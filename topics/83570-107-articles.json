The MK2 adapter is fine there are no problems on this front. I think you are getting confused there. Most of B9 fuselage parts also allow for surface attachment. When you are a little unprecise while trying to node attack, the part will often flip to surface attach instead. Press the ALT key to force node attachment and that will not happen. I do confirm problems with the T2 (tail) engine mount though. It only attaches right when you use Non-strict attachment rules in the debug menu, else the fuselage node gets ignored and it will attach at the engine node. I guess it is a part that is rarely being used because it only really fits the M2 cargo bays and s2 parts and nothing else.

So powerful that 2 engines can already be hard to control. That is the problem with the new velCurve - atmCurve system. If you can\u0027t reach the threshold, which for a Sabre S is around Mach 1.45, it will never pick up speed and atmCurve will kill the output with increasing altitude even further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@blowfish I\u0027d suggest that we keep the existing curve for FAR and create a new one for stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T07:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blowfish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blowfish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1)\u003Cp\u003E3) I\u0027m guessing you\u0027re using stock aero.

There\u0027s a bunch of orbital stuff I am entirely too fond off, such as the M27 command pod. I manually deleted the rest of the Parts folders, and I suppose there\u0027s other stuff I don\u0027t need to load, but the RAM footprint elsewhere in the B9Aerospace folder doesn\u0027t look that significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA longer-term suggestion: something in a similar style to the M27, either 2.5m or 2.5m-to-3.75m, that could give extra living space and/or service module functions. Not a pure cylinder or cone, maybe a larger flat window panel, maybe two nodes for docking ports, rather than a full 4-port hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe M27 has a movie influence, and movie spaceships I see, even ones trying to feel real, tend to have more design coherence than an M27 with basic cylindrical parts added. It goes off in the same directions as the Apollo Lunar Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few ideas I maybe ought to try.
