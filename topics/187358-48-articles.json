The two players interact, and suddenly technology from the \u201Cfuture\u201D makes its way to the \u201Cpast\u201D. Or, the advanced player has a base and the less advanced one goes around it, and suddenly they see a base that doesn\u2019t exist yet. Well, LMP has ways to solve this\u2026 or does it? You can disallow interaction across time and you can have a \u201Ckeep out\u201D zone where future structures are, and then players can do their temporal mental gymnastics much more easily. But if the two players ever want to actually interact, then the less advanced player has to warp to the more advanced player. In-game \u201C1000 year hiatus\u201D aside, what functionally just happened is that the less advanced player, who has not actually advanced through the timewarp, has just come into contact with the player in the future. All of that non-interaction just to have an in-universe explanation for why two space programs that were founded at the same time and are thousands of years apart in their development suddenly interacted in the \u201Cpresent.\u201D That seems like a paradox to me, even though it is (weakly) explained in-game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince we are also on a trend of using Minecraft for analogies, when you walk over to someone\u2019s base in the LMP system, you wouldn\u2019t see or interact with them, you would see a recording of their actions at the time that you are at (as in, if you played less hours than them, you would see them some number of hours ago) and instead of seeing the world populate with cool creations, you would see it populate with chunks that you can\u2019t interact with because another player did something there in the future. In order to have interaction, you press a button to populate the world, but why would you want to have that system when you could just see the other players and their creations by default instead? I\u2019m just saying, if LMP doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem of people in the past and the future interacting, why would you have all those extra steps to have an in-game justification and the semblance if a paradox-free experience?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-28T12:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224179911\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221664367808\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHere\u2019s a commonly brought up paradox: one player has progressed very far in the game and is further along in time, and the other player has not, and is less far along.

The first branch are the \u0027permission to timewarp\u0027 versions, where everyone exists in one time-plane and players vote or take turns being able to time-warp with everyone else dragged along for the ride. These do technically work and there\u0027s no risk of paradox. The downside is it makes KSP a turn-based game, with each turn taking potentially 10 or 20 minutes, and with several players you\u0027re waiting potentially more than an hour before you can actually fly or do anything. And sure, you can mess around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E while you wait, but in general the pacing would be absolutely glacial and this doesn\u0027t really sound like \u0022playing together\u0022 anyway. Might be fun for some but it doesn\u0027t appeal to me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second branch are bubble universe versions, where there\u0027s no continuous timeline and you just teleport into the timeframe of other players. This is mostly fine if you\u0027re doing simple things like flying jets together or a one-off mission to the moon in which you dock to a friend\u0027s station. It seems like the idea in KSP2 is that we\u0027re building little mini civilizations with colonies and supply vessels and prospectors and mining vessels going everywhere at once. When you have multiple vessels in interplanetary transit and entering and leaving different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s you really need some kind of spatial/temporal continuity, and having many different vessels jump from one timeframe to another sounds like a recipe for disaster.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe third branch are the \u0027leapfrog\u0027 models, where everyone can play at their own pace and in their own time, but in order to interact they need to leap forward to sync with other players or at least past the last edit of any given colony or vessel. This preserves continuity and causality and still allows everyone to participate in a shared world at their own pace. There\u0027s still a bit of diversity in the way\u0027s this would work in practice (are things greyed out or solid and on rails? how do you manage permissions? is it hosted online and anyone can hop in or out or is the group save tied to a single host? etc.) but these are to me the most promising versions.

I could be wrong but I think we\u0027re missing something fundamental: the relative position of each planet to each other is driven by \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E. Likewise the position of every vessel relative to every other body is driven by the \u003Cem\u003Edate\u003C/em\u003E. If I zoom out on day 3 I will see a very different arrangement of planetary positions than if I zoom out on day 200. This means you need to know what the date is at all times in order to make transfers. In order to rendezvous with any other player\u0027s vessel you need to be able to see where it is, and where it is also relative to what \u003Cem\u003Eits\u003C/em\u003E date is. If it\u0027s traveling between Kerbin and Duna that flight path and those encounters are tied to the relative positions of those planets and what time the transfer maneuver was made. If I have a trajectory that leaves \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, swings by the Mun, exits the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and encounters Eve there is really only one time that that specific trajectory can exist.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if I have a vessel that\u0027s going to Duna, a probe that\u0027s going to\u00A0Jool, and I have a shuttle I want to meet up with a friend\u0027s station in orbit around Minmus, what happens? Does my shuttle get transported to the stations\u0027 time? Does the station get pulled into the shuttle\u0027s time? If the person who made the station then also wants to dock does that vessel also get pulled into my time? When I\u0027m in map mode looking for friends\u0027 vessels to rendezvous with where do I see them? As they are in their time or as they were in my time?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you see the problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for asking! here\u0027s how it would (or could) work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you mentioned, the locations of things in space depends on time, so if players are at different times, they will see different locations. One of the biggest things that minimize this problem is that relative positions in space are cyclic, with the cycles being more frequent the less bodies are involved.\u00A0Take the simplest example: a ship in GKO. On day 2 and day 200, this ship will be in the same position relative to Kerbin, so for all intents and purposes for someone rendezvousing it from Kerbin, it doesn\u0027t matter that it is in the past/future. This can be applied to more complex configurations that require more considerations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, your first example, a ship going from Kerbin to Duna. A Kerbin-Duna transfer looks the same roughly every Kerbin year or so (a bit more), so the principle is that if you want to intercept a craft going from Kerbin to Duna, you don\u0027t have to travel to the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexact\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0transfer window that the other player was using, you only need to travel to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eany\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EKerbin-Duna transfer window (with a \u0022jump to window\u0022 button on any inter-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E ship). \u00A0If you want to intercept it outside of the transfer window, you can do that too with extra fuel, and it would be akin to launching a few months early or late, but offset by a couple dozen or hundred transfer windows (which don\u0027t matter because transfer window 1 and 1,000 both have the same relative positions). \u00A0This applies to more complex trajectories involving slingshots, it just requires you to warp to a less frequent window.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so what happens to ships while you match up your planetary positions by warping to transfer windows (or not, you can just torch-ship your way there too)? Well, just like with subspace, all your ships time warp. The reason I\u0027m fine with this and not subspace is because time warping 3 months to match a Kerbin Duna window (or just a few days for a Mun mission) is much more manageable than warping decades or centuries just to do the same little mission. Alright, so all your ships warp, they consume resources etc. If you were playing alone in a server, it would look like single player. When it comes to other players and stations, there is a little bit more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll expand your example of a few craft by adding that the other player is currently returning from an Eve mission and is going to dock at that same Minmus station. you set up the mission, make your Minmus injection burn, and time warp. All the craft that you have warp, but since you are only warping a few weeks, you don\u0027t overshoot in your interplanetary transfers. The Minmus station also warps, as well as any craft any other player has in a stable orbit. The logic behind this is that location-wise, the orbits are very cyclic and it doesn\u0027t matter if they are on their 2nd orbit or their 2000th, so the ability to rendezvous is preserved. The only ships that don\u0027t warp (that you are seeing in real-time) are the other player\u0027s ships that are on inter-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E trajectories. You can still rendezvous with those without breaking physics because if you try, you essentially launched at the \u0022same time\u0022 so you can still warp up to their ship, which is traveling at 1x speed, without cheating orbits. So, you rendezvous and dock with the other player\u0027s ship without difficulty, even though they interacted with it 800 years in the future. The other player sees that in real time, and for all intents and purposes, you are playing at the same time, except the transfers that you made are not ruined by an 800 year time warp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(sorry if that was confusing, it is really an intuitive system when you see it. Essentially, you are functionally always synchronized without messing up orbital mechanics or having to warp a lot. If you didn\u0027t get that from the paragraph above, I can try to explain it differently.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last consideration is - now the other player wants to dock with that station that you are currently managing. You don\u0027t want to suddenly be thrown into warp when the other player starts to rendezvous, so as you see them come into an orbit of Minmus, you are moving at 1x speed but the other player sees a version of the station warping around Minmus. When they rendezvous with it, they are put at the point in the orbit that you are at, so that you see the same thing passing below. That is the only time when a spatial discrepancy has to be resolved, when two players are actively interacting with the same craft or station. Any other time, it works like subspace bubble except instead of warping to the exact time that the other person is at in order to interact, you can be functionally synchronized (but not actually synchronized) relative to select celestial bodies and craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-28T21:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224180048\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221664397319\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, your first example, a ship going from Kerbin to Duna.

The orbital track isn\u0027t just a graphical element, its a precise line through space, and if you\u0027re trying to rendezvous you need to know exactly where the target vessel is and where it\u0027s going down to the meter.

I think what you would see is a track that does visually miss Duna and instead encounters an invisible or ghosted Duna 2m km away from the Duna you see. If you were trying to rendezvous with a vessel far apart from the window you would see a random arc starting somewhere along Kerbin\u0027s orbit and ending somewhere along Duna\u0027s orbit. For planets with higher inclinations and more eccentricity the difference would be much greater. Basically all other players in-transit vessels would look this way because their transit orbits are tuned to encounter planetary positions that vary wildly from the one you see. As you approach and dock with any one of those vessels you\u0027re exactly matching those orbits that in your time hit nothing, so I don\u0027t think you have any choice but to have that craft enter the other player\u0027s timeline, teleported into the future. It seems like after a dozen or so encounters you\u0027re going to end up with lots of different vessels that exist in different times, coming and going from multiple ghosted instances of different planets and its going to be really difficult to know what\u0027s real.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-29T01:06:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2022 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"poopslayer78","CreatedById":212496,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-29T01:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224179953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221664378707\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor at least past the last edit of any given colony or vessel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this were the case, not only would players accidentally learn orbital mechanics by playing KSP2, but they would also learn git without realizing it \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-29T02:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224180111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221664410999\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think you have any choice but to have that craft enter the other player\u0027s timeline, teleported into the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s a good concern that players probably have to exactly match the positions of at least the relevant bodies, which would entail at least a degree of long time warping.

I still like this system for its interactivity and stability for simple systems, and for its minimizing of time warping to synchronize, but to allow players complete freedom on where to interact, it would need to add a fair amount of time warps to fix interplanetary problems.

The result that I\u0027m realistically hopeful for is something like Minecraft, where players at higher advancement levels can give less advanced players resources and support to help them catch up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-30T00:06:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2022 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fullmetal Analyst","CreatedById":212373,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-09T10:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224175471\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221663265590\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022216179\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheOrbitalMechanic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/15/2022 at 8:13 PM, TheOrbitalMechanic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n???\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1 has a console edition that works fine (barring a few bugs).

Your original comment I was responding to, however, implied that core gameplay systems would need to be changed/revamped/removed in order to make the game work. I don\u0027t know exactly what you consider to be a core gameplay system (if you just mean the controls need to be changed, then yeah, I agree), but this has not been my experience--functionally, it\u0027s still pretty much the same game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
