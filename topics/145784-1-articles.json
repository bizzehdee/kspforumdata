And technically, anyone with solid knowledge of messing around with config files in KSP can make something that would use the Heat shield module with ablator (or just a part with high heat tolerance) that would also technically be an engine, and it would probably use the heat shield\u0027s model and texture (if they aren\u0027t made from the ground up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T17:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m worried about is if the heat shield could actually shield the rest of the ship - even if it\u0027s designed with a taper.\u00A0 The ship design looks like it uses the shockwave and the taper to keep the rest of the ship from burning up - that\u0027s what I\u0027m worried about working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
