They don\u0027t need to be huge they can be as small as an average human. The point is to \u0022feel\u0022 the technology so you subconscious would help you in next designs. Also, you are going to do mistakes at some points, even though something is theorically fully correct, still you will have something going wrong with it and it\u0027s not really fun when you have those moments while you are carrying a life with it. Testing is good, and improvement is even better. You would love to \u0022light the candle\u0022 that will lift a life up in the sky when you absolutely trust your technology. Nothing is easy, but nothing is that difficult either. Well I should also add that nothing will be %100 perfect since there are so many known and unknown factors affecting it, but even being 70% is something. Copenhagen Suborbitals is a good example for this. Even though almost all of them are experienced engineers, they still test every bit of their technology all the time, and then fire up the rocket in the sky every summer (which is still a test rocket for the manned one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on your \u0022civil space program\u0022, and I believe you are going to be successful if you keep patient through the progress.
