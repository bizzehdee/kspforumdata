For those of you not familiar with the speed of sound, it is roughly 340 m/s at sea level and goes down as the air gets colder and altitude gets higher. By my rough estimation, the velocity required for Mach 1 at 15,000 - 20,000 meters (on Kerbin, not Earth) is 322 m/s. Mach 3 would therefore be 966 m/s.\n\nIf you think about it, reaching that kind of velocity is easy. We\\\u0027ve all done it before using rockets. It\\\u0027s even possible to go that fast in the atmosphere with enough thrust. So where lies the challenge? I\\\u0027m glad you asked.\n\nHere\\\u0027s the criteria for my super sonic jet:\n\n- [li]No cheating (use Space Plane parts only)[/li]  \n[li]Takeoff and land horizontally[/li]  \n[li]No decoupling boosters (every original part has to be attached during Mach 3)[/li]  \n[li]Completely reusable (no detaching landing gear, etc...)[/li]  \n[li]Balanced for atmospheric flight AND high-altitude speed attempt[/li]\n\nEasy, easy, easy, easy, um... what?\n\nStep five is the tricky part. A poorly designed jet will pull up or down on you, even with ASAS turned on. The balance of your plane depends not only on lift surfaces like your wings, but also on engine location and power. Even if you manage to place all of your components such that your plane flies straight at sea level, higher altitudes provide less lift and less air for your engines. So what do you do?\n\nI designed the awesomely named [SweetJet](https://kerbal.blogspot.com/2012/05/super-sonic-jet-reaching-mach-3.html) to balance both at sea level and at 15 - 20km altitudes. The trick is that it\\\u0027s not perfectly balanced between those altitudes. At sea level, the wings and canards combined with the main engines provide a smooth ride that begins to pull upwards the higher you go. This is mainly because the engines gain thrust faster that the wings lose lift in the thinner air. Rather than the basic jet engines, I chose the TurboJets for their ability to get me to 15km.\n\nOnce high enough, the Toroidal Aerospike Rocket activates and in conjunction with the TurboJets propels the craft up to Mach 3. The high-altitude \u0027nose up\u0027 behaviour is corrected by the position of the rocket engine and the jet becomes balanced yet again. I highly advise to keep the altitude under 20 km as the air becomes too thin for the control surfaces to keep the jet steady.\n\nOnce the Rocket runs dry, you should descend to 12 km and fly your plane to the nearest landing zone. I tested the [SweetJet](https://kerbal.blogspot.com/2012/05/super-sonic-jet-reaching-mach-3.html) by rotating it 180 degrees so that I would be over land instead of water.\n\n[*** Ship download link ***](https://kerbal.blogspot.com/2012/05/super-sonic-jet-reaching-mach-3.html)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot30.png](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Pbqlm-TI9xE/T7v-9BfUc_I/AAAAAAAABbM/dmatWtenOn0/s1600/screenshot30.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot25.png](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rmhzYeDsl6w/T7v-2QKp7iI/AAAAAAAABas/qUgisOfXAVA/s1600/screenshot25.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot26.png](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iqEPf5xv3KE/T7v-4bbdPiI/AAAAAAAABa0/N-tg8dm_v_Y/s1600/screenshot26.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot27.png](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ey9vguPssZQ/T7v-5xnezDI/AAAAAAAABa8/VmBEYt9I3vU/s1600/screenshot27.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot28.png](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPXfIYzEguE/T7v-7GDJm0I/AAAAAAAABbE/nnt7uBSn_LE/s1600/screenshot28.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E 1062 m/s = Mach 3.3"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T23:40:30Z","Content":"TBH, the aerospike rocket is not a spaceplane part, but a rocket engine.
