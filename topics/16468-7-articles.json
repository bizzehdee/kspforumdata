I finally got a rocket that managed to plot a munar intercept, and still be as long as it was when it left the launch pad, and I figured it would be neat to hop out and take a look at it, maybe pretend to do an inspection having never had the opourtunity to do so with something so large before. So I jump out, and cruise down to the bottom, but I got a little far away, and when I flew back to it, my guy (Jeb no less) hit his head on one of the bottom engines, causing him to I guess black out and go ragdolling off into space. It took at least like 20 seconds to recover and regain control (he hit the engine pretty hard). I was starting to worry that he might never recover, or at least not until he got sucked back into the gravity well of Kerbin and couldn\u0027t get back to the only rocket with a hope of getting to him in time (which at this point was dangerously close to becoming an unmanned missile, destined to cruise the system alone. Forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd today I decided to fly to KSC 2, but its a long ways off and I only have one useable plane (and its slightly harder to fly advanced versions), which unfortunately does not have the kind of range I needed for such a trip. So I made a slightly stripped down version (here stripped down means minus a third of its fuel and an engine) that I could stick on top of a rocket. The plan was to fly up really high, fly over to where the KSC 2 is, and then drop the plane back down into the atmosphere. Easy peasy. Unfortunately, even a stripped down version of the plane was a bit heavy (probably could have skipped the RCS fuel seeing as I didn\u0027t give it an RCS thruster system), and the rocket I stuck it on was the basic model with what I called the star drive strapped on to the tail of the plane (a conventional rocket engine with rocket fuel tanks, where the 3rd jet engine would be attached). In other words, it was sadly lacking in the \u0027can get into orbit\u0027 department, and only managed to get the plane a little over halfway to its destination (but it did it much faster than conventional flying). I figured that was enough and put up a movie, turned on the ASAS, and off I go, making minor adjustments every few minutes to stay in a good altitude band. About 10 minutes out I realize I am going to run out of fuel, and decided to resort to some fuel bug exploitation. In the process I leaned that even without the fuel bug, since the plane can\u0027t go very high anyway (because the engines loose power, and without the RCS thrusters its one tiny move from spiraling out of control without much air for the control surfaces to use), I actually could have saved fuel by flying slower, since I was able to go at about 1/3 speed at about 10% throttle (which is about right, since air resistance increases with the square of your speed). I ended up coming down in a glide, to discover that the runway was gone, so I aimed for the tracks leading to the launch platform. Nailed it, only to discover that the second KSC is a floating hologram. When I got out of my plane, I tried to put the parking brake on by retracting the landing gear, but my plane still slid away. To get Jeb home, I will now have to build a 2m rocket capable of reaching orbit twice, which means building a whole new, supper efficient rocket small enough to strap onto something far more ridiculous. I\u0027ll also have to figure out precision landing in an atmosphere (this is why I strapped a plane onto a rocket rather than just landing a rocket there. Don\u0027t have this skill yet, so I thought something that could fly would be better) if I ever want to get Jeb back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if the small rocket is small enough, I might be able to give it some basic wings and a parachute so that it can land in the right position, but still guide itself down. This should hold me over until 0.17.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SNapple","CreatedById":38677,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T15:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJVXAs97LSg\u0026amp;feature=plcp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJVXAs97LSg\u0026amp;feature=plcp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayQHEKUjUyo\u0026amp;feature=plcp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayQHEKUjUyo\u0026amp;feature=plcp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aceassasin","CreatedById":20841,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T03:14:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust about a minute ago i was on my back to kerbin from Duna everything was going well and I started my rentry however soon after deploying the parachute failed \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand i thought the worst was about to happen.
