Is it just RAM, or am I missing something?\u00A0I have 16 gigs of ram and am running 64 bit, so I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s crashing. On my older computer I would get crashes all the time because of RAM (no 64 bit \u002B 8 gigs of ram). I do have mods. I have lot\u0027s and lot\u0027s of mods (I play realism overhaul).\u00A0I suspect it crashes because I am launching a really big rocket, but like, shouldn\u0027t 64 bit \u002B 16 gigs be able to handle it? I didn\u0027t really have any performance issues or lag or crashes with my other rockets, which were only slightly smaller.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrash log:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/PL3D9jwt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/PL3D9jwt\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-31T08:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom that it does rather look as though you did.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you really still never every one of your mods?
