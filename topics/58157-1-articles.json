Then I alt-tab back to KSP and hit F12 (Not the default, but I set it up that way) to start recording FRAPS. I then point at various things on the screen and name them so later, I can match the audio and video together. I then do my let\u0027s play. NOTE: Fraps chews up hard drive space, about a gig a minute. If you have less than 100 gig free I\u0027d suggest recording for an hour or less at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then run VirtualDub, compressing with xvid which I downloaded as well. This creates a high quality compressed video. I also, in Audacity, run 2 Components off the menu: Noise Filter and Compressor, to make my audio sound even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then load the compressed video and the audio into VideoPad and line them up using the a/v cues I did at the start up there, balance the audio so you can hear me over the rocket sounds, chop out the stuff I don\u0027t want, do some trickery with subtitles to name the episode and put little asides in where I want them, slap in my intro and whatnot, and then create the final episode which eventually gets uploaded to YouTube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds a lot harder than it is, though I had to learn each step as I went and did not do the extra Audacity step until a ways into the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T01:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, I post YouTube videos, under the name Bagel Rabbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/BagelRabbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/BagelRabbit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s mostly an agglomeration of random ideas I have in the middle of the night.
