The requirements state that I need to recover a stranded Kerbal on the surface of the Mun and return him back to Kerbin. I can get to the Mun and return him, but I am having trouble with locating him. There is nothing on my screen telling me where to land or where the Kerbal is. I must be missing something, however I couldn\u0027t find anything that answers my question. My vessel is manned with two pilots and one seat for the kerbal. I have full connection to Kerbin and full control of the craft. Battery is at 100% and life\u0027s good. Your guys\u0027 help is greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet Rice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elroy Jetson","CreatedById":195588,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-27T01:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you need to orbit and use the scanner dodad to map the surface? \u00A0I only messed with that device in a tutorial or maybe one of my test missions? \u00A0It scans the surface as you orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncan I also ask for my own benefit, how do I figure out what docking port to use on a craft I intend to build to perform a rescue from orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngood luck on the Mun, I have not made it to the surface yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-27T01:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat displays on your screen depends on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the celestial body with \u0022focus\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn map mode, if you click on the Mun, and click \u0022Set Focus\u0022 -- you should see a little icon for a kerbal on the surface, next to an icon of a ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-27T01:53:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it\u0027s worth checking WHICH icons are being displayed ... if you\u0027re not showing Kerbals on EVA, you\u0027re not going to see that Kerbal except visually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-27T01:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Cspan\u003EKryxal said, you should check to see if you have the filter turned off for EVA Kerbals.
