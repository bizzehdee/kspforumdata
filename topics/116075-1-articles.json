I visited all moon several times (my space station had a lot of fuel) and gather 40000 science points. That was a fun a long mission with its own recue missions (hopefully from the station, not from Kerbin)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering in 1.0.4, as we have those refueling capacity, what would be the best place to place a space station. I was wondering about \u003Cstrong\u003EVall\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s quite mid-placed, moon transfers are mitigated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- dV for landing is reasonable. The refueller wouldn\u0027t loose too much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vall SOI to low orbit has a reasonable cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther options :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Laythe : refueller would have a very hard time landing on the few available islands.

Well placed fot transfer costs, but the SOI to LO is expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bop : Cheap to land, and SOI to LO, but not well placed, longer trips (due to plane changes), higher moon transfert costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pol : Cheap to land, and SOI to LO, but not well placed, highest moon transfert costs.

I\u0027ve also read (but haven\u0027t yet actually done this) that a station in orbit around Jool itself, between the orbits of Vall and Tylo, is supposed to be the most efficient. You don\u0027t have to circularize around a moon, and you can reduce delta v requirements using gravity assists from the other moons, particularly Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Warzouz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Warzouz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat do you think ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, stations and bases depend on what your ultimate plans are. Is this a 1-and-done, flags-and-footprints explorations trip or are you going to end up with a large-scale, long-term colony project? There\u0027s also the question of where you\u0027re going to be using any fuel you make, whether on the ground or in space? Depending on that answer, you might need multiple bases/stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, let us assume you want to colonize Laythe and tie it in to a regular \u0022trade route\u0022. So you\u0027ll have SSTOs moving Kerbals and (mostly imaginary) \u0022stuff\u0022 up and down, which means you need a station at Laythe to transship cargo between the interplanetary freighters and the SSTOs. And you\u0027ll need a spaceport on the ground where the SSTOs load/unload and refuel, and then probably several dispersed villages scattered about in scenic places, served by atmospheric planes, and each of these villages will probably need refueling capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you\u0027ll probably also want to refuel the interplanetary freighters, plus anything else you\u0027ve got going on in Jool space. This will mean getting fuel from the ground to orbit. I like to get this from Vall because the gravity isn\u0027t too bad and it\u0027s close to Laythe. So there\u0027s a mining base on Vall, then a fuel depot in Vall orbit and a tanker lander than the just goes from this depot to the mine. There is then the question of whether you refuel the spaceships at Vall or the Laythe station, or both. Any refueling at Laythe will require that station also being a fuel depot and you\u0027ll need another tanker optimized for the Vall-Laythe run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can grow it from there. Want to colonize Tylo as well? Put another station there plus whatever ground bases you want, and tie it by tanker into the Vall-based fuel system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T17:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it\u0027s just a station for efficient science striping.
