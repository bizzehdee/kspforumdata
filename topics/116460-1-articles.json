All is going well until I launch my first ship (Just a Mk1 capsule with Jeb in it strapped to a Flea) and up it goes! As soon as it hits ~6km my camera freezes while my ship continues to ascend. Then, when the ship begins to descend, my camera slowly trails behind it until it lands. Any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I seem to have found the issue (maybe). I had been flying with a Mk1 parachute, Ven\u0027s stock revamp, and realchute. When I took the Mk1 parachute off, the camera stopped having the issue.
