During that time, I made the first 2 MACVs: the Magellan and the Columbus, and posted them here. Unfortunately, they suffered from 3 major drawbacks. First, the double magazine build complicated its use and reduced the gun\u0027s reliability tenfold. Next, it would\u0027ve been a pain in the rear to play a 400\u002B to 600\u002B part ship. Finally, I couldn\u0027t find a feasible design for a lifter (Yes, all gun simulations were done with Hyperedit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I waited for update after update, and I rebuilt the ship over and over again until the day Macey Dean went back online came. I was inspired once more. So I rewatched his videos, and realized that I had to reduce the ship\u0027s part count as much as I could. I stripped and shortened it until it just got to its current part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and a massive thank you to chunkblaster for listening to my questions about this around a year or so ago. Anyway, enjoy the ship!
