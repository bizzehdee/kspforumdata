That experience inspired to this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my CrazyRocket, from my pre-v1.0 game.

And actually, it got its name more from designs that had preceded it (and mostly failed) than from its own configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was in an early state of my KSP experience, had only access to early and small components, but pushed to design a rocket capable of visiting the Mun and Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results - MegaRocket and MunRocket - weren\u0027t too good. So a clean slate and a new effort was named \u0022CrazyRocket\u0022 in a rash and lack of imagination. And that name it got to keep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a very long service career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very rare image of the CrazyRocket_C. Actually the only one. Jebediah pilots it here in an encounter-mission with the Mun. Though the landing struts were fitted and deployed here, that\u0027s mostly for testing since he wasn\u0027t to land on this trip (and likely would have failed if he had tried, and would in any case not be able to return if so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CrazyRocket_C is of considerable historical importance for me though, because a brilliant Kenbus Kerman did make the the first ever landing on another world, on Minmus, with a CrazyRocket_C. Unfortunately there are no pictures of this momentous occasion, since Mission Control had not yet discovered F1- screen capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many notable things about this milestone landing. Kenbus wasn\u0027t supposed to land. It was an encounter and orbit -mission to learn and gain experience. He may have planned it, secretly, of course, but Jebediah screaming over the microphone \u0022\u003Cem\u003EGo for it Kenbus!\u0022 \u003C/em\u003Ecould also have something to do with it. Quite possible the two stalwarts could have colluded on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, he succeeded, and also succeeded in making it home, despite a scarily low level of electricity and fuel. Also, Kenbus did this without SAS (as Mission Control hadn\u0027t discovered \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; yet) and without navigation nodes (as Mission Control didn\u0027t have a clue about them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the CrazyRocket bridges over a lot of major steps forward in my first space program. It saw the advent of SAS and maneuver nodes, the first moon landings and straddled the period when manned, extra-kerbinal landings became routine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKenbus\u0027 landing caused a number of immediate modifications. Wider landing struts fitted on science modules. Solar panels and more battery. More fuel. These changes quickly led to the CrazyRocket_E, which is the major variant and responsible for countless Mun and Minmus missions. This picture depicts the typical launch of a CrazyRocket_E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot38.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot38.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite gaining huge amounts of science points and new technology and new components, the CrazyRocket_E remained in service for a long time and was probably responsible for the major share of Mun science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is typical of a mission. The very generous fuel load let the pilots maneuver and choose landing spot at leisure. As that long tank was finally dumped just before the landing, it was usually still half full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot75.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot75.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe configuration that the CrazyRocket_E landed in, remained the same during the return flight and landing on Kerbin.

I think the \u0027Eagle\u0027 followed directly. It was a failure. It did do some moon missions, three I think, and successfully, but it was really scary to fly and land. It originated as a 3-Kerbal crew, scale-up of the successful CrazyRocket_E lander, but saw substantial changes with every launch. To no avail. It remained dangerous to fly. I went to a clean slate again and designed a spectacular success. I\u0027ve never had a moon-rocket that was so nimble, stable yet agile, easy to fly and impossible to crash, as the Vulture. As the Eagle was essentially \u0027dead\u0027 and the Vulture \u0022ate\u0022 it, it got its name. The Vulture also went to an asparagus style of lifting rocket, instead of the earlier stacked stages. I may show the Vulture at some time, but not now. The Vulture was just another Mun/Minmus vessel, and as such not really important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, this is something else. My first, manned, interplanetary spaceship.

It deserves the epitet \u0022workhorse\u0022 as it made ten, or something, successful missions to Duna. But it also brought most of the technical concepts that all of my interplanetary rockets, Banshee (Laythe), Ikaros (Duna/Ike) and Kronos (Laythe) have been based upon since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the pre-v1.0 Duna missions were flown by Angel_A and Angel_B.

But Angel_B is not illustrated as it looks exactly like Angel_C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is that Angel_C features some more science equipment and a new ladder design. The Angel_B\u0027s ladder had the unfortunate property to be impossible to scale if the rocket was leaning with the ladder in an overhanging position. When this was discovered one day, rather than leave the unfortunate (Sidford, was it?) stranded on Duna, the pilot elected to take off slightly, pirouette and land again. It burned some fuel, but that Angel_B still made it home again. Luckily, this happened at a time when I had become bored with bringing all three crew down to the surface. Only one descended, planted the flag, took the surface sample, and done. I can well imagine my face if all the crew were on the ground and none able to board the rocket again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the takeoff of my first manned interplanetary mission, the Angel_A1 to Duna.
