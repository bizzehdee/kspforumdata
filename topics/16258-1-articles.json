After I sat down and learning to do things properly (like optimizing my gravity turns, injection phases, etc.) and understood why I was doing them , efficient design became pretty boring and monotonous. After venturing into mods (because the design capabilities for stock parts plateaus pretty quickly) I started making pretty big space stations and habitation capsules to land on the moons. It\u0027s quite more challenging to pilot a giant craft with 20 KMU\u0027s of dead weight strapped to the top of it (not counting the weight of the engines and fuel powering the thing) when you neglect to add RCS to it because RCS just makes things too easy. I design them to get into final descent stage not using any of the on board fuel as a bit of an additional challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETiny, efficient rockets and landers are boring for me now. I just continue to make things more and more complex and more difficult to pilot and land because its the only thing challenging anymore. My next little self-made challenge is a craft that can get to and return from the Mun using nothing but SRBs (from mods as well as stock) and then the same thing to Minmus, a massive rover/mobile base powered by the Katerpillar wheels and constructed with Kosmos parts, and fixing up my drop pod design so it uses more SRBs and feels more automated. I\u0027ve gotten to the point where as long as it has enough fuel, I can pretty much pilot anything, big or small, into space, landing, and return, so the only way for me to make the game more difficult is to strap on more dead weight, make it less manageable to control, and make it more complex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T10:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNnHn16Nd5c\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNnHn16Nd5c\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
