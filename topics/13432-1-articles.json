Never open the map, use F2 to hide instruments at all time, and never use the free camera view.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gave myself this challenge after using the fixed hull cameras to land and perform docking with map/instruments still available. Those missions were too easy! I streamed my first attempt last night to a few people in IRC, and after a few tries, I landed on the Mun and got back into orbit\u00E2\u20AC\u201Donly to run out of fuel right before escaping Mun SOI. To add to the challenge, the rocket I used was never tested beforehand. I had to learn how to fly it as I went!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Stock parts only, with these exceptions: fixed camera, Damned Robotics (for orienting cameras), and floodlights.

My initial launch didn\\\u0027t work until I oriented my cameras so I could keep my heading parallel to the equator. My Mun descent stage was incredibly difficult (and hilarious) to control, since my controls were swapped and then inverted along one axis. I burned a lot of fuel, having spent 5-10 minutes trying to kill horizontal velocity and land, so my second attempt should be much smoother. Sadly, the stream will likely be a lot less exciting now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I highly recommend this kind of challenge to anyone who\\\u0027s a little bored. Try getting into orbit first and see what kind of camera angles you need for basic orbital operations. My lander has four cameras, but one\\\u0027s primarily cinematic. With some adjustment, I could get it down to three and still accomplish mission objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shhhilent1","CreatedById":28278,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T17:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewheres SasquatchM or... the guy who landed on the SPH? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fracx","CreatedById":30039,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T18:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you made it then.

It took me a half hour or hour to figure out how to get into stable Mun orbit (I mixed up which direction I was pointing in my quicksave, so I kept burning prograde by accident). It took me a few hours to get the landing right. With the new design, my controls make sense and I have floodlights to facilitate a night landing, so I should be able to do it much more quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T01:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried again with my modified craft and completed the full mission. I crashed on my first landing attempt and loaded a quicksave from before I deorbited onto the Mun. Both times I entered a stable Mun orbit before descending. My successful landing was in the dark, and the floodlights did their job. The adjustable nose camera was very handy; I used the side camera for most orbital maneuvers, but once landed I used the nose cam to view my surroundings and identify a takeoff trajectory. I also used it for maintaining my heading while burning back into Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy burn put me on an escape trajectory from Mun SOI, and I was flung a bit past the Mun\\\u0027s orbit. This was a pretty incredible coincidence, because I saw the Mun orbit once, and as I started falling back to Kerbin, I fell right past the Mun, making a close slingshot flyby. The resulting trajectory landed me very close to being opposite KSC. I didn\\\u0027t check fuel remaining when I detached that stage, but I think I used considerably less when landing this time around. Total MET was 6 hours, 6 minutes. Could definitely be done in less time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the Kerbin -\u0026gt; Mun burn was super easy. Got there in one-half orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what can I try now that this mission is feeling pretty routine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] Nevermind! Tried this again on livestream a few times and couldn\\\u0027t get the Munar insertion right. I guess I just got really lucky the first two times. I made some adjustments to the craft, but I\\\u0027ve run into some balance issues I need to correct. I want to avoid doing something like a direct ascent; it\\\u0027s a cheat that eases skill requirements by piling on a ton more fuel. True Kerbals arrive at the Mun with their excessive stacks of fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
