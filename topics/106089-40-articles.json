In other words, the rocket has more dry mass for the same amount of wet mass. The engine\u0027s Isp should be able to compensate that for typical mass fractions.  \n\n- Hydrolox engines are generally weighted towards less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, more efficiency. So you are allowed to improve the Isp a bit above what the line above would consider sensible - but you have to give up some thrust for it, or add some engine mass.  \n\n- As a technology higher up the tech tree, hydrolox engines should cost more per kN of thrust produced than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines. In return, they can again gain a little bit of extra Isp.\n\nUltimately though, the engine must have a useful niche in which it \u0022feels right\u0022. No matter how carefully calculated your selection of stats is - if they mean that nobody would use the engine, they\u0027re \u0022wrong\u0022.

I think that the best option to work with Nertea is to have a option to make them work like stock tanks, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox, so it can applies it\u0027s own system, with the cooling. But I\u0027m no expert.  \n\nI did a test install without firespitter (by accident), and got this:  \n![2DpIJQ1.png](https://i.imgur.com/2DpIJQ1.png)  \n\nThe wings simple got the resources and Nertea\u0027s fuel switch took over, like any other tank.  \n\nSince many mods I use have Firespitter as a dependence, I need to keep it. So I tried to remove everything in GameData\\OPT\\mm\\_config, the wings lost all the tanks.  \n\nThem I removed only the OPT\\_FS.cfg, no effect. Removed OPT\\_Resource\\_Defaults only, lost the tanks.  \n\nThem I removed OPT\\_FS.cfg, and removed the mod dependencies (:NEEDS[!Firespitter,!RealFuels,!ModularFuelTanks]) from OPT\\_Resource\\_Defaults.cfg, so it should always applies the tanks. It worked for all tanks, wings and cabins, with firespitter installed. But I lost the custom OPT category ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif \u0022:huh:\u0022) I don\u0027t see any relation for this to happen.

If you play around with it enough, though, you\u0027ll find that the LH2/Ox engines allow you to make a tradeoff:\n\n1. Much more volume\n\n2. Probably more expensive\n\n3. However, rather significantly less *mass* for a given \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E so long as we\u0027re talking about an upper stage.\n\nThe same seems to be true for KerbalAtomics, which switches nukes over to LH2: LH2-based stuff is less *massive* overall for similar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the tradeoff is a LOT more volume (like 6x or 8x the volume compared to setting up a Nerv engine with LiquidFuel instead).\n\nAt least that\u0027s been my impression with them so far.\n\nEDIT: One thing I will note, though, is that the engines themselves from this pack tend to be MUCH more massive than vaguely similar ones from other packs. Dunno how each author decided on the balance there, just a thing I noticed (compare to BDB, for instance).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-03T22:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2018 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lithium-7","CreatedById":37150,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T22:12:24Z","Content":"Hmm...
