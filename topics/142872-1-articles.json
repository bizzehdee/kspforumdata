I get that it\u0027s modular and you start with a \u0022core\u0022. After that, I haven\u0027t a clue. I think I can get the girders and other things up there (although I have an impossible time with the aero \u0022protective shells\u0022). Do the girders need to have all necessary parts attached before launching (IE, electrical panels, docking ports or radial attachment points for the various additions)? Does a radial attachment point allow the transfer of fuel and what else is required to get the fuel from the station\u0027s holding tanks to a docking ship? Will attaching solar panels be enough or do I need some way of transferring the generated power to the batteries, wherever they may be? The list goes on and on...\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

(No offence!) What I am going to advice you is to forget about assembling a (refuelling) station at this point. First just play the game. You do not need a refuelling station to go anywhere. But you do need a certain level of experience to build a station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust play the game. Explore. Learn to land, mine, rendezvous and dock.

As soon as I want to build a station with them, I launch a \u0022klaw hub\u0022 -- and attach the bigS liquid fuel boosters to it one-by-one. I arrange it so they all have a little fuel left in them, so they can cooperate in docking, and they provide some fuel right from the beginning. Then you have to bring fuel to the station. I prefer to mine the Mun and send tankers back. Mining Minmus takes longer, but works better in some ways. You usually also need to have a space tug around to help with docking and fuel transfers to ships that can\u0027t dock themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd every time a ship comes up from Kerbin, you suck out any drops of extra fuel that they have and store them in the tanks. And in fact, you redesign your ships to make sure that they will all end up in orbit with some extra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it goes\u00A0something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022klaw_hub.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.virtualrealitytoursllc.com/pix/klaw_hub.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-30T21:41:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2016 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T00:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn orbital refueling station doesn\u0027t have to be fancy.\u00A0 All you need is a big fuel tank with some docking ports around it.\u00A0 You don\u0027t necessarily have to use girders and things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said:\u00A0 to use it, you\u0027ll need to develop the skill to do orbital rendezvous and docking.\u00A0 If you\u0027re relatively new to KSP, I suspect that \u0022figure out how to dock\u0022 will be your main challenge, more than \u0022design a fuel station\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere fancy design starts to come into it is when you want to build a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebig\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E station that has lots of features on it-- but I\u0027d suggest that you leave that for later.\u00A0 Start out simple, just try lobbing something with a lot of fuel capacity and some docking ports into a circular orbit, then practice learning how to dock with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T02:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like you don\u0027t really understand what modular means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt;Do the girders need to have all necessary parts attached before launching (IE, electrical panels, docking ports or radial attachment points for the various additions)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing except initial docking ports.
