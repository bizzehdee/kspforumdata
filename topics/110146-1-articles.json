The wikipedia article on \u0027delta-v\u0027 seems to prefer splitting the burn time around the direction change, but I wonder if the games estimate is based on that or burning upon reaching the node. It seems like an almost arbitrary design decision, trading off an easier user interface for a simpler estimate calculation.\n\nDoes anyone know for sure when the burn is expected to happen to match the estimate provided by the nodes in game?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T18:47:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T20:54:25Z","Content":"I may be wrong, but you basically want half your burn to occur before the node, and half after it.

That is assuming that the burn is short, taking place to orbit, while in orbit to intercept another celestial body, and under a couple of minutes at most. Long interplanetary burns from orbit are best split up into several shorter burns during each Periapsis.\n\nAs always, some maneuvers can be more time and delta V critical then others."},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:20:28Z","Content":"When in low kerbin orbit (about 85km) I like to try to do about 2/3 of burn before the node. \n\nGenerally doing your burn lower in the gravity well to be more efficient and starting early enables me to get more of the burn done before I rise into higher orbits.\n\nI also like to burn along the horizon just ahead of my blue indicator so that I\u0027m burning horizontally. When the blue indicator reaches and passes the horizon I then follow it (out of the brown and into the blue). This helps minimize losses due to gravity (but it may add steering losses).

From what I\u0027ve observed it doesn\u0027t take into account the change in mass as fuel is used, so the longer the burn is the less accurate the displayed time is. \n\nI\u0027ve searched an answer for this question before, and while I\u0027m on my phone right now and don\u0027t have the link, I found that burning in the same direction as prograde at the maneuver, half dV before the node and half after, is the best approximation of an instantaneous burn. In other words, point at the blue maneuver marker and start at half the expected burn time to be the most accurate."},{"CreatedByName":"nekogod","CreatedById":103186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:34:54Z","Content":"It\u0027s not quite as simple as splitting the burn time in half across the node, technically you want to split the velocity change over the node, since as you burn your craft gets lighter and thus acceleration increases."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:13:05Z","Content":"For reasonably simple gameplay, just split it 50:50, it might not be perfect, but it works for practical purposes. If you need sensitive 0.1m/s adjustment at the end of the burn, or for very small burns, set the thrust limiter very low, probably to 5%, for 20x the throttle control (assuming medium to high TWR). In most cases, there will be at least some small error in the net vector of the burn, requiring a small mid-course correction burn (which people like NASA routinely allow for, it\u0027s very realistic to do a later correction burn or even series of burns). Over very long distance, a tiny error magnifies greatly. It\u0027s often easier not to worry about the tiny error and just correct for it later.\n\nFor advanced gameplay, what the other folks said above is entirely relevant. But, there will almost certainly still be a net error at the end of the burn, as it\u0027s near impossible to get the vector absolutely perfect, and the burn duration millisecond perfect.\n\nI mostly prefer to keep it simple myself, as long as it gets the job done in a reasonable overall manner. With experience, it\u0027s possible to guesstimate the split a little better than 50:50, but without going too technical and doing loads of maths. I do the initial main burn, check the result at least puts me in the roughly correct area at the destination, then move on to plotting a basic mid-course correction to see if it\u0027s worthwhile doing one. After any mid-course correction, I\u0027ll do a final correction burn on entry to the target SoI, if need be. For longer trips, more correction burns may be worthwhile, but if the dV for any plotted correction burn is less than 1.0m/s, I\u0027ll tend to leave it until later in the trip."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:22:21Z","Content":"nekogod and alistone are on the right track. The fact is that dV is a function of work, which can be represented as \u0022the area under the curve\u0022. Since fuel flow rate is constant, the \u0022curve\u0022 is a straight line with positive slope... which gives a triangle. So to find the perfect time, you\u0027d need to find the point, t, at which the dV on the left and right are equal. This is analogous to splitting a right triangle into two odd-shaped portions. On the left is a shorter similar triangle, and on the right is a taller more narrow quadrilateral. The fact that it\u0027s narrow is representative of the fact that it takes less time to burn the same amount of dV (due to increased acceleration).\n\nDoing the integration shows that the midway point is depends only on total burn time, the proper midway point in terms of time is given by:\n\n T-midpoint=(.5\\*(T^2))^1/2, where T is the total burn time and T-midpoint is found in seconds after starting the burn.\n\nSo to get burn start time, you\u0027d subtract T-midpoint from t=0 to get the proper time to start (EG: -35 seconds).\n\nThis formula gives a linear relationship between total burn time and midpoint time. T/(sqrt(2)), or approximately .707\\*T.\n\nSo aiming for about 70% of total burn time before the node will be a very good approximation.\n\nOf course, if you know the acceleration at the beginning of the burn, you can use the same integrals to solve for total burn length as well (but simple geometry is easier and faster).\n\nLast but not least, bear in mind that maneuver dV is an estimation based on assumed \u0022impulse\u0022 maneuvers in which all dV is burned at once. The longer it takes you, the less efficient the burn will be and the further off the estimate will be. Also, burning longer than intended can throw off timing significantly. Keeping burn times short reduces the penalties for incorrect burn midpoints and helps keep estimates accurate. I\u0027d say that if your burns are long enough where burning 50/50 produces noticeably different results than burning 70/30, you\u0027re taking far too long anyhow."},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T23:59:14Z","Content":"I like to do 50/50 with about 2 seconds early.

Think of your speed vector in a 3D space, imagine you have two vectors, one is your current speed, one your target speed, which is of the same length but pointing to a different direction.
