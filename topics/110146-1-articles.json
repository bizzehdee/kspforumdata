If you need sensitive 0.1m/s adjustment at the end of the burn, or for very small burns, set the thrust limiter very low, probably to 5%, for 20x the throttle control (assuming medium to high TWR). In most cases, there will be at least some small error in the net vector of the burn, requiring a small mid-course correction burn (which people like NASA routinely allow for, it\u0027s very realistic to do a later correction burn or even series of burns). Over very long distance, a tiny error magnifies greatly. It\u0027s often easier not to worry about the tiny error and just correct for it later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor advanced gameplay, what the other folks said above is entirely relevant. But, there will almost certainly still be a net error at the end of the burn, as it\u0027s near impossible to get the vector absolutely perfect, and the burn duration millisecond perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mostly prefer to keep it simple myself, as long as it gets the job done in a reasonable overall manner. With experience, it\u0027s possible to guesstimate the split a little better than 50:50, but without going too technical and doing loads of maths. I do the initial main burn, check the result at least puts me in the roughly correct area at the destination, then move on to plotting a basic mid-course correction to see if it\u0027s worthwhile doing one. After any mid-course correction, I\u0027ll do a final correction burn on entry to the target SoI, if need be. For longer trips, more correction burns may be worthwhile, but if the dV for any plotted correction burn is less than 1.0m/s, I\u0027ll tend to leave it until later in the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enekogod and alistone are on the right track. The fact is that dV is a function of work, which can be represented as \u0022the area under the curve\u0022. Since fuel flow rate is constant, the \u0022curve\u0022 is a straight line with positive slope... which gives a triangle. So to find the perfect time, you\u0027d need to find the point, t, at which the dV on the left and right are equal. This is analogous to splitting a right triangle into two odd-shaped portions. On the left is a shorter similar triangle, and on the right is a taller more narrow quadrilateral. The fact that it\u0027s narrow is representative of the fact that it takes less time to burn the same amount of dV (due to increased acceleration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the integration shows that the midway point is depends only on total burn time, the proper midway point in terms of time is given by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E T-midpoint=(.5*(T^2))^1/2, where T is the total burn time and T-midpoint is found in seconds after starting the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to get burn start time, you\u0027d subtract T-midpoint from t=0 to get the proper time to start (EG: -35 seconds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis formula gives a linear relationship between total burn time and midpoint time. T/(sqrt(2)), or approximately .707*T.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo aiming for about 70% of total burn time before the node will be a very good approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you know the acceleration at the beginning of the burn, you can use the same integrals to solve for total burn length as well (but simple geometry is easier and faster).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, bear in mind that maneuver dV is an estimation based on assumed \u0022impulse\u0022 maneuvers in which all dV is burned at once. The longer it takes you, the less efficient the burn will be and the further off the estimate will be. Also, burning longer than intended can throw off timing significantly. Keeping burn times short reduces the penalties for incorrect burn midpoints and helps keep estimates accurate. I\u0027d say that if your burns are long enough where burning 50/50 produces noticeably different results than burning 70/30, you\u0027re taking far too long anyhow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T23:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to do 50/50 with about 2 seconds early.
