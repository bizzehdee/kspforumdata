For one, you could route two lines from the center tank to a docking port somewhere isolated with a decoupler. then route lines from that decoupler to the side tanks. with an action group you can toggle the fuel flow crossfeed of that decoupler. If, in flight you toggle the decoupler at the right rate, it will alternate between draining and refilling the side tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T19:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s doable provided either the center or outboard engines are not directly connected to the tanks (say, separated by decouplers).
