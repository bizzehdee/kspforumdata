Let\u0027s say the drive has a maximum range of about 10 ~ 11 light years, can only be operated (jump in/out) around or outside the orbit of Jupiter (or a similar gravitational acceleration), preserves universal velocity vector on jump (aggregate), is expensive in materials, requires a large amount of infrastructure to manufacture, has a payload fraction of around 5% (drive \u002B power system \u002B fuel \u002B radiators, not including crew, facilities, in-system drives, etc...), and generates massive amounts of heat on jump while requiring a lot of stored power to actually perform a jump (recharge, cooling time). Keep in mind to make a useful jump you need good knowledge of the destination and some good computers to calculate when would be the best time to jump. Existing radiator mass and payload fraction encourage in-system drives like a fission-fragment rocket or similar which would mainly be used for orbital correction while the craft is met by in-system craft for off-loading.\n\nObviously you\u0027re not going to be terribly inclined to use this as a weapon, although the option is very much there.

I suppose that really depends on computing power.

I hope it\u0027s sufficiently interesting not only as a means of transportation but also as a plot device. One of my goals of posting here was to see if there were any overt problems with the device in terms of realism (ignoring the fact that you\u0027re teleporting between stars).\n\nYou really have to know what the target system looks like to use it effectively, which means that probing target systems becomes a big deal if your computers don\u0027t know what to expect. I imagine early exploration was quite an experience and most likely done by automated science probes. Once again, charge time is crucial since you can reasonably expect a safe jump, given the operation parameters, but have no idea what to expect once you\u0027re there. So basically you\u0027d send the probe on a good vector to place it into orbit of the target system, collect as much data as possible on possible jump destinations and anything that might cause problems, and hopefully be able to jump to relative safety before you actually do run into problems.\n\nShips with this device probably have Brayton generators, enormous radiators, a nuclear reactor of some type for initial spin-up (since you could use the waste heat for helping with recharge at the target), and high-isp maneuvering drives that require as little reaction mass as possible (like a fission fragment rocket).\n\nI\u0027m curious whether the consensus is that this would be a interesting drive for relatively low-tech space exploration where fusion power is still a pipe-dream."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T16:46:55Z","Content":"Fission fragment rocket indeed has very high ISP, but its thrust is minuscule.

Given a payload mass outside of the interstellar drive of around 5%, I think these ships would end up being fairly massive on their own and would prefer to avoid maneuvering as much as possible since they would have to bring along enough reaction mass to do the job.
