Specifically hoses so we can remote mine on large craft. Then you just get a small vessel with some mining stuff on it and you take it out to mine and hook up the hose and go to your mining spot. This could help with orientation of mining equipment. It would also be nice if it can be done with and without kerbals help for drones. Either preconnected or the ability to use an arm or something to connect the hose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-16T07:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love a stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Adding stuff like this is a great idea! You could have a large(ish) ship with low fuel, and an asteroid mining base and fuel that way, I can say how many times I have ran out of fuel when trying to dock to a place, once, it was a large ship, in orbit of kerbin, I lost the ship, luckily I was able to save the crew by taking them on a shuttle, but jeb, the captain, died. I was soooooooooo mad cause I was going to fast and hit the station, even worse, it was the solar panel wing, so the station lost power until I docked (horribly) a new solar panel wing. I lost the world sadly. I still blame the oberth class that I had docked at it for the loss of that ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
