Though this would make it MUCH harder for beginners (actually with simple configuration edit I could do that....)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T13:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the torque ratings, the larger one has 30 in all aspects instead of 15. I think all of them used to just provide 15 before the update. Plus it only makes sense something large will cost more than the small ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quantumpion","CreatedById":57602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T13:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso the probe cores have differing amounts of torque as well. The ones higher up on the science ladder have more torque.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T13:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think they addressed the changes to the torque wheels directly, but they did say lots of parts were getting tweaked. These changes basically fell under that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
