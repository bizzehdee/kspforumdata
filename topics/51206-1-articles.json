I only joined the forums yesterday and for all intent and purposes this is my first real post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping that some of the KSP veterans (actually any non-newb will do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) would not mind answering a couple of questions I had regarding the game and performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially I would like to know if my computer has the capacity to handle the full KSP experience ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have read the other threads about processors and performance for KSP, and have come away with the following : KSP is CPU limited (not surprising really), not threaded, supports only software PhysX and is most heavily influenced by part count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I would like to know is what sort of part counts are needed to accomplish \u0022most\u0022 things within the game. For my own playstyle this would mean the following :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Being able to reach every planet/moon/sun in the game.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Being able to land and \u0022take off\u0022 from every planet in the game. (Carrying/Deploying whatever scientific equipment/rover/etc is required)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Being able to build a space plane capable of reaching every planet in the game (and is atmosphere permits) fly and land on it. (NOTE REALLY A DEAL BREAKER, BUT WOULD BE NICE)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Be able to create a moderate space station around any planet/moon in the game. (Ie Refueling facility, small crew complement, escape vehicle, etc)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Be able to create a multi-part ship (assembled in space I assume) capable of reaching any planet in the system and carry landers/rovers etc.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it. (NOTE : I am talking about a MOD\u0027less KSP experience here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I obviously don\u0027t mean one ship that can do all of this but rather whatever of the above that would require the most parts, as the maximum. I also realise that people can build in huge amount of redundancy, mod parts, aesthetics etc, but I am only really interested in the MAX parts required for a reasonably well thought out design with a eye for keeping part count down (not manley-esque brilliance, but not tied up with tape by jeb either) that will accomplish these goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not at this stage interested in creating \u0022what if\u0022 scenarios, or building giant massive multi-purpose ships (it sounds like fun, but I am sure vanilla KSP has much to offer for a long time ! ). I just want to be able to experience the game without massive lag because I need 600 parts to get to some distant planet etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have loaded all of the stock ships and they all perform fine, but the max parts is only about 75 so its not a really impressive test. I also loaded the 600-700 part monster from the performance thread and this reduced performance to a crawl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I reckon if I can get an estimate that would accomplish goals 1-5 above, I can then just download a ship from somewhere that has roughly that number of parts and see how it performs. As far as I am aware, launch is the most CPU intensive time for the game, so I figure if it can launch at a half decent frame rate, then all else will be ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone for reading, I really do hope someone will respond with an estimate so I can begin testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again and happy KSPing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFYI If through testing I find my machine cannot handle it I will wait till early next year sometime when I will build my next machine, but as I am sure you can all appreciate I would rather play now \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E .

Graphically I have two GTX 280 SLI video cards that use an SLI profile I put together using NVidia Inspector. Graphically KSP seems to be a non-issue from the small amount of testing I have done. Although those two cards sound low (and are low), in SLI configuration with a decent profile they can run every dx9 or dx10 game I have played in the last 3-4 years at 1920*1080 and mostly max settings with a frame rate of above 40 at the lowest and usually enough for full vsync (ie 60\u002B) : (So Civ V, Fallout 3/NV, XCOM, ME 1-2, Payday 1-2, Amnesia for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU wise I only have a dual core, but it is unlocked.

Frame rates around 30 ish range, which I think is fine for this type of game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried a few larger part ships from the SPACEPORT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E428 Parts absolutely failed, only managed about 5 frames more then the 600 part craft from the performance thread managed. So I now know I can handle at least 180parts at a decent frame rate (ie min 30 for me), but 428 reduces the game to a paltry 9. I am trying to keep the frame rate above 20 so I guess I might eb able to handle about 300. Need to go back to the SPACEPORT and find a few testbunnies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW AS I am a complete newbie to this, and want to avoid reading to much about how everything works (in terms of things like orbital transfers etc) as I enjoy figuring it all out, I had a few issues with the function of the space bar \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I had initially set up all my engines to fire (from the downloaded craft) and clamps to disengage and then assumed that repeated pressing of the space bar just separated empty tanks. Well to my utter surprise I found that if you manage to FORGET to link a few engines (damn some of those test ships have a lot), then the next time you press space it will fire any that are not already going. So in LKO orbit I pressed the spacebar on one design as fuel was running very low, hopefully to make it gracefully separate and low and behold four \u0022unknown\u0022 engines roared to life and then proceeded to separate from my craft, rather then BE separated from it (THE NERVE OF THE THING). My first response was COME BACK DESPERATELY NEEDED SENTIENT ENGINES, my second was HOW COME MY CAMERA IS STUCK TO THE CRAFT THAT IS NOW FALLING NOT FLYING. Well at least part of the ship made it into orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway still not sure whether to continue playing or wait a bit, will do a few more tests with part counts see what my max is (at least I can max out the graphics, changing my viewpoint doesn\u0027t make much difference to the framerate so I know my GPU\u0027s are doing their part). I get plenty of enjoyment just reading about the adventures you guys are having so that could keep me going for a while (with my spoiler reflexes at the ready of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). Am toying with installing LINUX as that is supposedly meant to support a 64-BIT unity engine, and perhaps might support multicore ??? IDK Need to do more research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everybody, all very useful. Very grateful for all your help. I now have a reasonably good idea of what minimum part numbers are needed for probes and interplanetary explorers, and can use that info to determine if my system (as it currently stands) is enough to not impact my designs (and enjoyment) too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunJumper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SunJumper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELarge cargo means mass.
