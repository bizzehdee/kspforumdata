If you\u0027re not, and you realize this is alpha software and may have to rebuild from scratch at a moment\u0027s notice, then load up all the parts mods you want. If you are attached to your creations, it is probably best to stick with stock or with mods that don\u0027t add too many parts and that are easily updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also want to check the mod\u0027s history. While modding can be pretty chaotic (you\u0027re not only on the game developer\u0027s schedule, but also the modder\u0027s!), there are some very reliable authors who fix things immediately after a new version.

There have been a number of updates that have broken compatibility and I would imagine there will be more to come. With that in mind, what you really need to ask yourself is do you feel like you are missing out on anything? I used to be a hardcore vanilla player. No mods, zero, none. I did all my delta-v maps with paper and pencil. Then I got carried away with designs and began changing them so regularly I got tired of counting and adding parts, so I started using the original kerbal engineer mod to do my delta-v calculations. Some time later, long before rovers or docking, I started looking for things to actually do when landed on the Mun or Minmus. Various parts mods, the kethane pack, and mapsat gave me plenty to do. Now its a regular thing for me to download these mods as soon as they are updated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time a new KSP version is released it\u0027s about time for me to delete my persistence anyway.
