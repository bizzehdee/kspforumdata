Now everytime I try and rename Engineers/Scientists, they all suddenly become Pilots.\n\nI\u0027m a bit of a Homeworld nut, so I want to name a Scientist \u0022Clee-San\u0022, and some Engineers \u0022Mothership\u0022 or \u0022Pride of Hiigara\u0022 or maybe even the \u0022Kuun Lan\u0022.... but everytime I rename a Kerbal of the right specialty, they suddenly become pilots the next time I load the career. Rather frustrating, and I\u0027m sure there must be a step I\u0027m missing now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T04:10:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Somtaaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:06:07Z","Content":"As of 0.90, a Kerbal\u0027s specialization is based on the hash of each Kerbal\u0027s name, and so renaming the Kerbal changes its specialization in a non-intuitive manner. According to some folks on KSP\u0027s IRC chat channel, SQUAD\u0027s intention was to ensure persistence between save games e.g. Billy-Bob Kerman might always be a Scientist with high stupidity.\n\nPersonally, I agree that one should be able to manually customize their Kerbals to have the desired profession for headcanon / role-play purposes. The Ship Manifest add-on does use a workaround of padding non-alphanumeric ASCII characters to Kerbal names to force the desired specialization, but this is an extremely hacky workaround and results in strange characters being displayed in Map View.\n\nfutrtrubl made the following suggestion, which I quite like:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What Squad should do is, upon creation of a Kerbal, base its profession on its name hash and save that as a separate variable. This will allow same named Kerbals across saves to have the same profession *unless changed by an addon*, and allow graceful name and profession changes."},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:08:10Z","Content":"damn. random specialties is a bit of a downer."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:28:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E damn. random specialties is a bit of a downer.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t call the speciality assignments random, since they are algorithmically and deterministically based on the hash of the Kerbal name (i.e. a Kerbal with a certain name will \\*always\\* be a certain profession).\n\nBut I certainly don\u0027t like the unintuitive and uncustomizable nature of the current system, either."}]}
