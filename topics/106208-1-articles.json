According to some folks on KSP\u0027s IRC chat channel, SQUAD\u0027s intention was to ensure persistence between save games e.g. Billy-Bob Kerman might always be a Scientist with high stupidity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I agree that one should be able to manually customize their Kerbals to have the desired profession for headcanon / role-play purposes. The Ship Manifest add-on does use a workaround of padding non-alphanumeric ASCII characters to Kerbal names to force the desired specialization, but this is an extremely hacky workaround and results in strange characters being displayed in Map View.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efutrtrubl made the following suggestion, which I quite like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022futrtrubl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022futrtrubl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat Squad should do is, upon creation of a Kerbal, base its profession on its name hash and save that as a separate variable.
