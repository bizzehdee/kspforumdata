Previous time was when I made a part .cfg edit that should have worked (simply adding one missing line in an IR hinge .cfg) but caused KSP to be unable to load any parts except a few Hooligan Labs ones, and it even deleted all the asteroids due to no potatoroid part. Replacing the part .cfg with a freshly extracted original didn\u0027t fix it, nor did extracting all stock KSP files and overwriting.
