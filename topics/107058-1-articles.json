That way you won\u0027t need stuff protuding in the middle of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, use an aerodynamic profile. You have girders and monoprop tanks extruding in the middle, the top of the tanks feeding the mainsails in your first stage lacks cones, the top shouldn\u0027t behave aerodynamically (if the aero model is good, \u0022air\u0022 should be concentrating between the material labs) - put a fairing there. Although, why send four labs? Send one with a scientist and reset them after collecting the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I believe the orientation of the tail fins matter. If they aren\u0027t parallel and/or perpendicular to the ground (assuming level flight, which isn\u0027t the case), I would think the changes in direction they\u0027ll produce will be sideways. Imagine a plane with the wings like an X-fighter, that should give you the idea (of what shouldn\u0027t work). You have the Kickback rockets in the middle, I suggest you rearrange them while keeping symmetry so you can put four tail fins right where the rockets are right now. And use fairings or put the monoprop tanks in a service module. You also have four monoprop tanks which get discarded during the ascend. I\u0027m not sure there is too much point in having them there. As 0.90, monoprop didn\u0027t do much in the atmosphere. Vernors are useful for that part instead. Now, with air being thinner (I think) above 20,000, it\u0027s possible monoprop is indeed useful at high altitudes. I\u0027m using it, but mostly as a last resort when my ships don\u0027t reenter at a proper angle and I didn\u0027t put vernors on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you have enough dV in your final stage?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the TWR at launch and what ascent profile are you trying to follow?
