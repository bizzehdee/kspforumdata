The basic idea is to send probes and manned spacecraft to the Mun, which is the easiest body to get to in KSP. Below are the craft that have been launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMunar Station 1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Success. Is a 5-kerbal single rocket in munar orbit. Command module is a Cupola with one HSC attached as well as a battery pack and 2 giant solar panels. Launched with a modified Kerbal X rocket.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMuna 1:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ESuccess.

Was a rover designed to land on the Mun. Had 2 driving wheels, two steerable wheels, Rovemate, solar panels, Comsat. Destroyed during landing, was too\u00A0fast and destroyed upon touchdown.\u00A0Launched with a modified Kerbal X rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMunar Base 1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Failure. Was a 5-kerbal crew designed to land. Had one Cupola, one HSC, 2 solar panels. Didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land or orbit, would have been long gone if not for the Revert button.
