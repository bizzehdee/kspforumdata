This challenge isn\u0027t so much about how hard it is as what sort of crazy designs you can come up with in order to max-out your points.\n\nThe Rules:\n\n-No FAR or NEAR\n\n-Can not use any other fuel type other then monopropellant during the mission. \n\n-No mods that add new monopropellant engines to the game \n\n-No part clipping\n\n-No physic-engine-abuse \n\nScore System:\n\n\u002B1 point for every Kerbal onboard, \u002B2 for every Kerbal to space, \u002B5 for every Kerbal on the Mun/Minimus, \u002B10 for every Kerbal on Duna/Eve\n\n\u002B1 for every stage recovered (only qualifies if you reach 10km\u002B)\n\n-1 for every stage lost.\n\n\\*Notice\\* Recovery is defined as landing your craft safely, with no damage, ready to be collect and flown again. \n\n\u002B2 for every stage recovered at the launch pad (only qualifies if you reach 10km\u002B)\n\nFor suborbital flights: \n\n\u002B1 for every 10km above 75km achieved \n\n\u002B10 for every 1000kg of payload to 75km\n\n\u002B10 for every launch to space (75km) without refuel\n\nFor orbital flights: \n\n\u002B1 for every 50km above 75km Ap. achieved. \n\n\u002B1 for every 50km above 75km Ap. achieved.\n\n\u002B10 for Mun encounter \n\n\u002B10 for Mun orbit\n\n\u002B10 for Mun landing \n\n\u002B50 for landing on and returning from the Mun. \n\n\u002B200 for Eve/Duna encounter \n\n\u002B500 for Eve/Duna orbit \n\n\u002B500 for Eve/Duna landing \n\n\u002B500 for Duna return \n\nYou win the entire game if you can return from Eve with just monopropellant....\n\nAwards: \n\nLowest Part Count (Orbital flight): \n\nVirgin Galactic Got Nothing On Me (Most Kerbals to 100km): \n\nTo The Stars (Most DV): Foxster, 10km/s DV\n\nScoreboard:\n\n1. Foxster with \u0022Mono Virus\u0022: 10km/s DV on launchpad, landed and returned from both Mun and Duna. 1712 points.\n\nTo submit, upload a picture on launch pad, at least one throughout flight, and on at the end of the flight. Every screenshot must have the resources menu open for obvious reasons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T05:57:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CitizenAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:47:26Z","Content":"Your attempt?\n\n(This shouldn\u0027t be too hard)\n\nOh, and your scoring system is a wee bit out of whack.

It\u0027s not a tradeoff of weight vs delta-V as with other engines. Your interplanetary transfer stage could have a TWR of 10 if you want it to. Because of that, it\u0027s actually not too bad to make an Eve lander with it since the majority of the dry weight of most Eve landers is engines.\n\nNot a submission yet. This lander should be good for ascending from 3000m or higher. It\u0027s about 35 tons and uses 48 O-10 engines.\n\n![GeDJaxT.png](http://i.imgur.com/GeDJaxT.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T16:09:27Z","Content":"That\u0027s inspired me to have a go at an Eve lifter too.

Why have I not been using this before! Interesting to note though that all the crafts so far have been essentially payload-less... Anyone want to try a manned Mun mission? I\u0027ll update the points with new categories when people actually do the stuff thats out of the existing categories. Also, I am aware of the massless effect of most of the parts that will be used in this challenge, I do not include those in physics-engine abuse. As has been stated before by someone else, I consider that infiglide and kraken drive, ladder-phantom force abuse etc."}]}
