Yet I just can\u0027t get it out of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve always enjoyed games like Elite, and a couple years back I briefly had a blast with X3: Terran conflict. It had lots of combat, a halfway-decent space trading econ simulator, and such scriptability. However, as much as I enjoyed space fighting and trading games, there was always a voice in the back of my mind screaming, \u0022But Physics!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But now I\u0027ve come to know and love KSP: Physics is here. So I find myself wondering, what would it look like if you added trading, combat, and scriptability to KSP? People have already done some of the work, as there\u0027s MechJeb, numberous weapon mods, and mods that add new resources. But what if you could mine a wider variety of salable resources? What if there were competing Kerbal space agencies that placed a few stations in various orbits where you could dock and trade resources, steal them, or simply rapidly dis-assemble your competition? Perhaps you could keep positive relations with one space agency that you used a a fence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Meanwhile, mercenary combat seems like it could be pretty doable. I could imagine using something like CupCake\u0027s dropship with a couple weapons to fend off pirates and do some bounty-hunting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What if the progression in the game started with a trading ship in orbit instead of a VAB on the ground, and you had to lease the use of a company\u0027s VAB until you could buy your own? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I just have to ask, on a scale of merely impractical to utterly nuts, what do other people think of the idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:22:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is not a bad one but the required work is... extensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarCitizen multiplayer is out next year and should be close to what you want \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roguelycan","CreatedById":64979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have often times thought how cool a open world game like Eve and a physics construction game like KSP would mesh.
