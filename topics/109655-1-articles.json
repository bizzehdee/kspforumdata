My town has some nice used book stores, including one (anyone here ever been to Bookman\u0027s in Arizona?), where it is very easy to sell back to the store. I have surprisingly little fiction, looking over it, mostly history books (some fairly historic themselves), language books, space and science books. As far as ebooks, I have read a bit on an ereader once, but never really got into it. I only realy use ebook services like Gutenberg to find very obscure titles that are not practical to find elsewhere, or at least not cheaply.

Welcome to an addiction much stronger and more expensive than any drug ever made.\n\nMost of the books I have are bought used. It\u0027s sort\u0027ve a neat experience buying used. In one of them right on the 1st page there was a birthday note from what must\u0027ve been two older people giving it to their middle-aged son. Sometimes you get some with folds \u0026 creases, I even found an old receipt being used as a bookmark once. In one of them I found a bookplate with a birthday message and signature from the author. Sometimes they\u0027re dirty or have stains \u0026 they show their age, but the dirty ones, in fact all used books have a history \u0026 a character to them that you don\u0027t get with new books.\n\nEDIT::\n\nAs for Abebooks, I just found a website called thriftbooks.com. Almost everything\u0027s around 4 bucks too (large books/newer books/very old books/rare books are more expensive), but if you spend more than $10 you get free shipping (less than that it\u0027s a buck a book). The books ship from all over the US, but I honestly don\u0027t mind. I got 7 or 8 books (can\u0027t remember) for just under 30 bucks. You can see if the jacket\u0027s missing or if it\u0027s a copy that came out of a library, and you can pick from a list of different editions \u0026 conditions. It\u0027s also got, IMO, a better interface. It isn\u0027t something you browse for books with, I browse on Amazon and then look up the ISBN on TB, but if you know what you\u0027re looking for it\u0027s great.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T18:49:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:43:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have almost the opposite problem.
