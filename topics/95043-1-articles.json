A slide deck from a presentation by a member of OTP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s VPN Exploitation Team, dated September 13, 2010, details the process the NSA used at that time to attack VPNs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACincluding tools with names drawn from Star Trek and other bits of popular culture.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese guys are hurting everyone...

There are similar, separate repositories for PPTP and SSL VPN traffic dubbed FOURSCORE and VULCANMINDMELD, respectively.\u003Cp\u003EThe data is then replayed from the repositories through a set of attack scripts, which use sets of preshared keys (PSKs) harvested from sources such as exploited routers and stored in a key database called CORALREEF. Other attack methods are used to attempt to recover the PSK for each VPN session. If the traffic is of interest, successfully cracked VPNs are then processed by a system called TURTLEPOWER and sorted into the NSA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s XKEYSCORE full-traffic database, and extracted content is pushed to the PINWALE \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdigital network intelligence\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 content database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the Vulcan Death Grip never existed.
