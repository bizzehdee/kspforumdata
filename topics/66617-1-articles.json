I\u0027m upgrading rig. I was just curious, upon which part(s) is KSP most intensive? I really want quick load time and of course decent FPS, as current is crap with several mods, and load times are really irritating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe it to be the CPU, I\u0027m getting FX-8350 (8-core/4ghz). I\u0027ll also be running 8gb SDRAM DDR3 1600, and game will be on an SSD (Samsung\u0027s EVO 840 something, 120gb) Running on old GPU, 6850 1gb. 7870 or R9 270x to come. Though game is not graphic intense..?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know this will be enough, but is there anywhere worth investing more into to get best KSP performance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T04:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe funny thing about KSP is that upping the processor can sometimes actually hurt performance, with physics being single-core its actually better to maximize single core speed, like with a 4 core Intel chip, which could have better per-core performance than say an AMD 8 core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, you should look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42877-CPU-Performance-Database\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E thread to truly determine whats in your best interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: AFAIK there isn\u0027t much data on how much graphics capability really helps, it only really shows up as a limiting factor on integrated graphics systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-24T04:46:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2014 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Xaiier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T04:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42877-CPU-Performance-Database\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42877-CPU-Performance-Database\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 600 parts, even the i7 max, will only run at about 30 fps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027zzz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kunschner","CreatedById":58320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T05:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it is single core ughh.
