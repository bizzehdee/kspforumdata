I can build flight capable planes and fly them reasonably well (with SAS). I\u0027ve done nap of kerbin flying, landing on roughish terrain, gotten a turbojet equipped plane up to 1400 m/s horizontal, taken a basic jet engine to 65k, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m trying to do is build a \u0022piggyback\u0022 style launch system that will put a probe out of the atmosphere before it fires a rocket. I built a turbojet equipped plane that flies perfectly well and has plenty of power and air. It\u0027s capable of getting to 70k apoapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a single BACC SRB with a battery, wings and a probe to hydraulic manifold attached to a hardpoint on top of the plane as a test. I made enough adjustments to wing position to get COL perfectly aligned with the new COM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t fly straight. The bow flips over topside and continues to loop around. I\u0027ve made quite a few adjustments, moving COM up and down, forward and back. Moved the wings around to adjust COL above and below COM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should I go about doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3Z8Ba1I.png\u0022 alt=\u00223Z8Ba1I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T20:52:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xcorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T21:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you saying the nose comes up and it flips over backward?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be a couple things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) It might be that there\u0027s enough drag up front and on top now that it\u0027s forcing the nose to flip over. Especially if it\u0027s happening after you add the booster, and the fact that you have that big ram scoop on the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You don\u0027t have enough control authority. It\u0027s hard to tell because of the angle of your picture, but you might need more control surfaces further aft on the fuselage. If they are too close to inline with your CoM, they don\u0027t help much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Also, turn on your Center of Thrust (CoT) pink marker and see where that lines up. It\u0027s probably a bit low after you load on the booster, causing your craft to pitch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s something you can check, to see how borderline your base craft is. Try flying it again without the booster, but watch and see how much the SAS is working to keep the nose level. Do a couple of aggressive nose up/down maneuvers and see if it goes out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be aware that if you move your CoL up too much to meet up with the loaded CoM, you might have problems later if your ship doesn\u0027t have enough control authority to deal with the shift after release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of a piggy back space plane carrier I made a while ago. It\u0027s not nearly as big as what you\u0027re working on, but sort of demonstrates what I\u0027m talking about. In this case, the CoL shifts up with the CoM because the space plane also has wings. However, I designed the carrier to be able to take cargo (satellites) into space on its back, but I don\u0027t have any pictures of that uploaded. Notice how the CoM is a bit below the CoL. That was so that when I load cargo up top, the CoM shifts about that much above the CoL and the carrier is still controllable. Also note the CoT relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce such way to deal with all of that is to add a torque unit to your craft (can\u0027t see any in your picture but I\u0027m sure you have at least one). That can help you from having to redesign the wings and control surfaces for this particular design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AbJVnPV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AbJVnPV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Here\u0027s the rest of the album, but the other pictures probably aren\u0027t useful for design. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/mpA63\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/mpA63\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T21:46:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T22:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, great post, thanks for taking the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo a couple of aggressive nose up/down maneuvers and see if it goes out of control.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is true of almost all of my designs, even the smallish ones.

If you can force it out of control, then it could be that your design is unstable or it could be that you have enough control authority. (Or both...) Generally speaking, I find that I want to be able to just barely be able to force a carrier plane out of control. Then it should have enough authority for payload carrying (assuming the payload isn\u0027t assisting).

I should have said. Look in the lower left corner at the trim indicators. You can watch the SAS do its inputs there. If it\u0027s all over the place, then your craft is a bit unstable. If it\u0027s way out at the ends, then your craft has just barely enough control to keep it in line.

It isn\u0027t the only thing, but it can be part of it. Being able to pitch only so far up or down isn\u0027t always a bad thing, since that can help keep your plane from going out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tanks are loaded under the wings to pull the CoM down. Conveniently with this setup, the CoM moves up as the tanks burn thereby making the plane easier to fly after cargo release.
