I\u0027ve been playing this game for a while now but up till now have just lurked the forums here. One of my mapping satellites is currently spinning around the Mun right now so I figured I would actually join in here. So far I haven\u0027t gone farther than the Mun yet. I have a pretty kicking space station up though and have landed 3 rovers on the Mun already. See below for my 2 favorite pictures so far. Right now I am working on setting up a Mun base. I was gonna post some pictures in the spacecraft section later of the HUGE mobile gantry crane I am trying to land there to assemble the base modules.
