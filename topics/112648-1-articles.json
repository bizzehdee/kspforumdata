Sometimes I left-click on a maneuver to edit it and it gives me the delete options instead. Other times I right-click and it will only give me the edit options, so I have to drag the maneuver off of the orbit to delete it. (This is less of a problem, but still annoying.) I checked my mouse settings, and nothing seems to be off. Also, left and right-clicking work as they should in every other program and game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else encountered left and right-clicking difficulties or had trouble switching between edit and delete options for maneuvers? Or, could anyone give me more detail on how to edit and delete nodes?
