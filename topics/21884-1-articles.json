Once, it just \u0027splode on the pad. I have a few that make it to orbit without \u0027splode, but the Nerva engine can\u0027t seem to circularize a Kerbin orbit. I\u0027m trying to keep the Nerva engine through landing, so I can bring the Kerbals back home. I don\u0027t like stranding them and like blowing them up even less. Except for the pad boom and one of the scrape the tower booms, all of the other Kerbals were able to make landings due to a generous application of SPAS (SPacebar Abort Sequence). I have gotten better at SPAS, so that I\u0027ll turn on and off the engines between stages to keep the capsule above the \u0027splosions. My latest thoughts are a 3m tank with 6 3m tanks around it with some asparagus planning on dropping the outer tanks. I copied the scenario ships in to the VAB and really like the Kerbal-X design, but it doesn\u0027t have enough oomph (even with 18 SRB\u0027s) to get my rather large lander into orbit without doing the hula and occasionally \u0027splode.
