Modded installs are fine as I\u0027ll be using quite a few mods, and it probably won\u0027t matter if a few ships disappear because of incompatible mods. Save files from past versions are also fine, as I\u0027ll basically be trying to get as many ships in the same save as I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRendezvous is one of my favorite things to do in KSP, and not knowing exactly what I\u0027ll be rendezvousing with will make it all the more exciting. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and similar mods should let me scavenge parts from other vessels and dock them together to create wild monstrosities in orbit, which I\u0027ll use to further explore outward. I\u0027ll keep this updated with what I find out there, but for now, post your save files!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-29T22:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a mod for that\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022150019\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8299102660\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/188859-181-orx-kontinuum-development-thread-geo-caching-scuba-diving-winds-challenge-creation-and-more/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:213px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-29T22:51:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Spacecraft Exchange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
