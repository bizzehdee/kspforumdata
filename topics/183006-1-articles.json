I would like to find it again, as it makes payloads look much more clean than just the weird shapes of stock or even KW faring. It was useful for getting clean fairings that would look the same for all payloads, and they usually had nice curves to them. Could anybody point me in the right direction?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loskene","CreatedById":141778,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-22T05:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedural fairings?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-22T10:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis thread has been moved to Add-on Discussions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Moderation Team\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
