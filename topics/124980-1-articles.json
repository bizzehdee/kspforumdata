Aero brakes, who\u0027s purpose is to create more friction in the air, only have 1.2k heat tolerance. Before 1.0.5 I didn\u0027t have issues with them burning up, but now I do under the same conditions. It seems reasonable to increase the heat tolerance to at least 2k (i think 2.6-7 would be great) or we should add another kind of aero brake part that maybe weighs \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E more then the original but can withstand more heat or has build in ablators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T22:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T02:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022only\u0022 1200K is 1700 degrees Fahrenheit, FYI.
