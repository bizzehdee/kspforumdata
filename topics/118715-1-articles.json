Despite the display of parachutes being risky to deploy it was safe to deploy them at a speed around 450m/s. I might be wrong, but IMO the correct formula to calculate whether it\u0027s risky or not should depend on atmosphere density x speed and the right click menu should show this correct and not show statically \u0022safe\u0022 starting at speeds \u0026lt; 250m/s no matter how dense the atmosphere is. Really annoying that you have to guess here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example Dunas atmosphere is alledgedly 0.2 as dense as Kerbins. That means, 1.0 * 250 m/s = 0.2 * x m/s or resolved to x = (1.0 * 250 m/s) / 0.2 = 1250 m/s. So near Duna\u0027s surface it should be safe to deploy chutes starting at 1250 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell whatever the correct formula is, the display of \u0027safe\u0027 or \u0027risky\u0027 should be correct and not static and should be based on the games simulation of atmosphere and drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
