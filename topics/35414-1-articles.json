It\u0027s very rare to find a game that\u0027s not only fun to play, but also has educational value. Kerbal space program, and it\u0027s excellent mod support, more than make an educational game fun. I love it and look forward to the continued developments! I only have Demo version right now, but I hope to get the full version soon. My interest in space travel has been accelerated ever since the Alcubierre drive was announced as viable in 2012, and this program has only continued to increase my interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp Speed Ahead, fellow Kerbals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sierra_seven_","CreatedById":72072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T08:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!
