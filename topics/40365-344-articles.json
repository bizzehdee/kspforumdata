My tech level is pre-fusion and pre-antimatter. I have all the stock techs unlocked, though.

Bear in mind I use FAR, your experience will be very different without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that basic fission just doesn\u0027t cut it, way too little TWR. Once you get fusion though, it gets feasible. I recommend you use the 2.5m hybrid turbojet; better TWR than the 1.25, and having two separate subsystems is just wasting weight. Because the foldable radiators will be ripped off with prejudice during ascent, radials must be used. There\u0027s no way you can cool a fusion reactor with them though, so it must be shut down once you stop burning. Include the smallest fission reactor to serve as starter motor and standby power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can afford the memory, I also recommend you use B9 and Procedural Wings. The first for its awesome fuselages, and the second will make it a lot easier to have big wings that don\u0027t flop around and break apart. Lower part count helps too. Also, the turbojet gulps down an unholy amount of air, you need lots and lots of intakes to saturate it, and B9 has some nice big ones. Check your reactor on the way up: if it drops under 90% before you are at the edge of the atmosphere, you need more of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith basic fusion and LFO as vacuum propellant, I managed to get a 45t plane off Kerbin comfortably with a few thousand delta-V to spare.

Well, there\u0027s one big problem with the thermal receiver: it operates at only 1400K, and you get abysmal ISP from it. Although for a LKO ferry, that might not be a problem. Also, you can get crazy amounts of power, and can afford to use pure liquid fuel, which offsets this somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Einarr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Einarr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was unimpressed with PWings as, although they can be large, I\u0027m not a fan of wings thinner than a human hair (all of the example craft I saw when I had it installed had 2d wings, length, width, shape along those two dimensions, but no thickness)...just not appealing to me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s weird, I\u0027ve never seen that, my wings always had thickness.

On atmospheric worlds, you don\u0027t need a single drop of fuel to land after the deorbit burn. There\u0027s also the problem of orientation. My guess is you would need to make a plane with legs on the top and bottom side of the wings, so that it can also land on its tail like a rocket. It would be terribly unstable in the pitch direction, and the tiniest slope would make it topple. But if you have KAS, you could put winches with grappling hooks on the top and bottom, angled backwards. Land on tail, fire grappling hooks, maybe tighten the uphill one a bit, and profit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T03:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Einarr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Einarr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was unimpressed with PWings as, although they can be large, I\u0027m not a fan of wings thinner than a human hair (all of the example craft I saw when I had it installed had 2d wings, length, width, shape along those two dimensions, but no thickness)...just not appealing to me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OctarineNoise\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OctarineNoise\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s weird, I\u0027ve never seen that, my wings always had thickness.
