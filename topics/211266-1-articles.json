You just have to be extra careful to lining everything up first, so that the small lateral corrections won\u0027t be needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that, I recommend raising your speed relative to the target at 0.5 m/s, because the more time pass, the more your orbit drifts (you will move away from your target because you are in different orbits), which veers you offway, so you don\u0027t want to be too slow. without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can\u0027t correct for those little drifting. though you can correct for it in the same was you do in step 2, if you are stll far enough from your target that you have the time to turn around the ship, use the engines for some corrections, and turn the ship around again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe most important thing about docking without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E is that you can fail, and if it happens it\u0027s not a problem. Now you are close to your target, moving slowly, so you basically go back to step 3 and try again. it takes roughly 1 m/s, so you\u0027re not losing much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother hint: sometimes your trajectory is off-course because of residual speed. when you set your speed as 0.0, it can still be up to 0.04 m/s in any direction, the navball approximates. and those 4 cm/s are few, but when you are moving at 0.3 m/s they actually matter. For more precision, if you have a crew, you can use iva view; any crew pod will have a navball, and that navball has 2 decimal digits on its speed. so you can brake down to 0.00 m/s. It\u0027s more precise, which matters if you don\u0027t have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E to fine-tune stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E is generally light and makes your life easier, so it\u0027s a good idea to have some; but if you\u0027re desperate for mass reduction, you can skip it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I generally play with kerbalism, that adds random parts malfunctioning, and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E is just another set of potential malfunctions to worry about. my kerbalism ships are already overnegineered with multiple redundant systems, I skip the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E just for the sake of simplicity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
