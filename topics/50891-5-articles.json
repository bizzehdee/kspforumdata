For this reason, an Eve return is pretty hairy. Mission creep led me to design a gilly return mission lander with 2000 dV and a transfer stage providing an additional 2000. How much fuel I burned to bring too much fuel... I\u0027m considering a sample return probe, leaving the Science JR and the goo behind, in favor of tiny science instruments. I\u0027m considering building what amounts to rockets attached to a chair. Ive got the perfect transfer stage, and a space station in eve orbit ready for the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder about the feasibility of a rescue mission. Knowing you won\u0027t be able to attain full orbit, burn up high enough to be plucked and docked by a highly maneuverable rescue craft.
