I have posted about this on the TweakScale development thread too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR seems to get confused when I change the scale of parts as to the hitboxes and meshes it\u0027s supposed to use. This is a particular problem since it gets most confused when changing the size of the small Tail Fin, Standard Canard, and the 2 Small Winglets (AR-2 and AR-69 I think is their name). FAR calculates with the correct cross section of the wing, but lift calculated therefrom seems odd. I had a standard canard each side of the plane at 400% scale as main wing (a bit larger than a Big-S Delta Wing), plane weighs 20t. It needed 155 m/s to get off the runway at a AoA of ~10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.

This craft has a tendency to pitch up until it stalls. At first I thought it was the air brake on the back so I removed it. The craft still pitches up. I then moved somethings around and it still pitches up, not as bad though. Then I thought the CoL was ahead of the CoM so I did some minor rework in the wing design and it still pitches up. \u003Cp\u003EThis is where it is now, and it is FINE at supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AkZPi9r.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/AkZPi9r.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to be using P-Wings or B9 P-Wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Also it\u0027s displayed in a window as \u0022Mach 1 Wave Drag Area\u0022 (my frikkin\u0027 part descripion window is masking that part of the FAR-Tab). You want that so be as small as possible and your yellow graph to be as close to 0 as possible. The yellow graph is the 2nd derivative of the green graph displayed.
