I have to slap on a garnet fission generator, or tons of huge solar panels which will reduce my TWR to like 0.5\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI find it far more efficient to use some VASMIR engines paired with a lot of batteries and capacitors.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI may not find\u00A0the point but can someone please tell me a practical way to use these?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T22:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Markush100\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T23:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, what kind of TWR did you expect out of an electric engine? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E 0.5 is \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E for those.
