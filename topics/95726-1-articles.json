You could evn say it had to be 3 missions in a row achieving orbit and successful return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanting a flag on the Mun and returning the pilot to Kerbal might unlock the first VAB upgrade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the same on Minmus could then unlock the first Launch pad upgrade.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T12:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s a good idea. But just granting building upgrades for free seems a little OP to me. How about a discount?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample contract: Achieve high Kerbin orbit 300 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReward: x Funds, x Rep \u002B 25% discount on Tracking station upgrade.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBT85","CreatedById":114980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T12:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking no other rewards at all just the upgrade. Possibly it could be one that appears for you if you are playing on Normal but on hard it just gives a 40% reduction or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T12:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed you could make the percentage higher or lower by diffuculty or a slider in costum. But extra funds or rep always comes in handy, especially if you are short on it and performing such a contract can mean alot when Funds and Rep are included.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
