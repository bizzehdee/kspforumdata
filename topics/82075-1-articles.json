In .23.5 I had all these reusable lift stages tweaked and ready to be duplicated with the .24 parts, but they turned out to Op(riced) when S(olid)R(ocket)B(oosters) are so cheap. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never leave debris, so the center stacks of my lifting stages are probe cored with enough fuel to de-orbit. During the .24.2 career play through, I found funds not that hard to come by. If I used a mainsail on a couple of tanks for a center stack, I could easily recoup the cost of ditching this by fulfilling a couple contracts during the launch. However, providing the lift core with enough \u0027chutes to safely land for recovery, kicked my dv in the efficiency minded coniglianos due to the added drag. At first I would follow them down and practice my suicide burns ( occasionally saving some and getting a lot better at suicide burns ) then I realized that with just two radial chutes I can slow way down ( from the usual 120m/sec impact speed, which isn\u0027t much from orbit, thanks to the \u0027motor oil\u0027 like stock atmosphere ) and use a short burn to save the stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny how speculation about a new update can be completely useless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat say ye??\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T20:30:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T20:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore or less the same - I\u0027m playing around with SSTO rocket designs at the moment.
