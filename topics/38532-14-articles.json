I made a design that could Single-Stage to Duna with a Rover, but Mechjeb would lose control of it in the yaw axis on ascent. I had to manual it halfway to orbit before MJ could fly it. It was just so heavy for the amount of thrust, lift, and control forces it had that Mechjeb couldn\u0027t cope with it.
