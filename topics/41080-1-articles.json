I ferel that the design is, to be honest, kind of weak and realized I would like to improve on that design and also design more military craft. So these questions are related to that desire (but I did not wish to spam that thread with non-Spirit/Hanland related questions - but nether are these really Game Play related questions so this is the only place I can think of posting it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStupid Three questions - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Can anybody tell me if Hyper Edit is working with 0.21, where to find it, and how to install it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Weapons save file where I design and test military craft. Once I know they can properly launch into space I realized that I didn\u0027t need to launch them again and again if I could use Hyper Edit. This way I could got on with testing them in space in other ways. Like in docking with stations, ease of rearming and refueling, so on. I think my Light Escort can be improved on for future use and have new designs that need to be tested. In other words, I need a orbiting weapons lab.....and that means I need Hyper Edit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The station will need drones that can service visiting craft - in other words act as tugs or rearm them. I know the Carrier, Spirit of Kerbin, had such a drone but I was wondering how to design a bare bones kind of drone. Any suggestions would be welcome. What does it need and what does it not need?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. On a related note - I use MechJeb 2 to test out and fly my creations. But I wish to push my creations to the edge - see how they work. If I fly them and they explode that just proves how BAD I am as a pilot. No really. I was wondering if there were players who enjoy flying but don\u0027t like being engineers? Or who just like being test pilots and giving feed back? There are so many \u0027companies\u0027 who design rockets and stations is there a \u0027company\u0027 of rocket jocks? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T02:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1:It is working \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbaltekaerospace.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbaltekaerospace.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2:It needs RCS a battery a probe core and a docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3:I don\u0027t know but I\u0027d recommend taking on a ship far out of your class.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T03:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
