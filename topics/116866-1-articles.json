Valentina is a great addition to the orange-suits, and honestly unless the class idea was super-fleshed out, giving them only one real purpose (and planting flags, at that) wouldn\u0027t quite cut it.

If there is room for another class, you need to either add something *new* for them to do, or you need to let Kerbonauts multiclass so that they get something to make up for what you\u0027re taking away. If Jebediah was a Pilot-Explorer (gains levels as a Pilot but can also plant flags) while Valentina was a Pilot-Scientist (gains levels as a Pilot but can also restore used experiments), then there is at least some tradeoff and not a straight downgrade."},{"CreatedByName":"Woksaus","CreatedById":148764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T01:55:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yep but i think val seems.....empty, for example if you need a pilot you chose jeb no exepitons the only real reason to use val is if you cant use jeb\n\nAww, that\u0027s not true. I admit I prefer to use the original four, but I try to let all my Kerbals run the same deadly risks - err... I mean, have the same amount of fun.\nI don\u0027t think a new class is needed at the moment. In the future maybe, if new features are added that aren\u0027t covered by the current classes. For now, an idea might be to have two types of pilots: space pilot and atmosphere pilot. An atmosphere pilot would be able to use SAS in atmosphere only, while a space pilot would only be able to use SAS in space.
