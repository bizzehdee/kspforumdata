It\u0027s then another leap of speculation that it was \u0022rushed\u0022 because Sony asked for it by a certain date.

Not to say there aren\u0027t PS4 owners who DO play KSP, but these people also have computers and use consoles for things like rock band and netflix and things that consoles actually make sense for. Not sure I\u0027d really predict a lot of PS4 or any kind of console sales for KSP. Maybe they\u0027re going to start a kickstarter or something asking US for $20 to NOT make this port? That would probably end up grossing them more money than actually releasing it on PS4 to an audience who couldn\u0027t give two ....s about a game with no weapons in it or which requires any degree of scientific thought.

It\u0027s not awful but it\u0027s not great either - I hope that the experience of working with a PS4 developer enables Squad to sort out proper PS4 controller support. I really can\u0027t see how a controller will be easy to use in the VAB or SPH but then I\u0027m not considering buying it on PS4 so I don\u0027t really care. So long as work continues on the PC version I\u0027m fine with KSP being on PS4 and I hope it becomes a valuable revenue stream for the devs. We just don\u0027t know if PS4 KSP will impact the PC version yet so there\u0027s no point in all this doomsaying.\n\nI think a lot of the disappointment here on the thread stems from the fact that Squad have called the game 1.0 but there is still a lot of work to do on it and people are worried that the devs will lose focus. KSP has fantastic community support and actually a fantastic community but since 0.90 Squad has been making decisions which are threatening to lose that support and I worry that once they lose the trust and support of their fans and modders then they won\u0027t be able to get it back.\n\nKeep listening to your community Squad and keep working with the modders who make your game better because I\u0027m sure you must have started dreaming about KSP 2.0 - but if you lose your fans in 1.x then the next version will never be as successful."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T07:54:31Z","Content":"Im ready for next weeks Devnotes where they say \u0022Last weeks PS4 announcement went great, we are all glad to have everyone\u0027s undivided support.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T07:56:16Z","Content":"You get what you get.
