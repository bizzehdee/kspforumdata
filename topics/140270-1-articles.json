So, i placed it on orbit of the mun, landed, collected science, returned to the lab and processed. After that the experiments (review stored data) disappear. Was that intended? I mean, on the notes for 1.1 it is said that data could no longer be duplicated, was that the meaning? I mean, if i process the data all the science i ll get from it will be from the processing itself and i ll no longer be able to send or recover it after returning to kerbin. Is that right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T18:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, that was an intentional change to the way labs work. It was meant to prevent you from taking the same science result to several labs and getting unlimited science.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kadrush","CreatedById":158076,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T19:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, will that make the experiment re-runnable for 100% science? I mean, since i never transmited or recovered i believe the game i ll never credit it as a done experiment. right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T21:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, if you take a second copy of the experiment back to KSC\u00A0you get full science credit for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
