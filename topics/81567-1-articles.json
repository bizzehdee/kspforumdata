It\u0027s going to either be the Ferdinand or the Jadgpanther II... Now any long time playing World of Tanks players will know the eternal argument about the Ferdinand and the Jadgpanther II tanks. But I need your opinion on these tanks and which one should I get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X7FgBWQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X7FgBWQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T06:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you\u0027re used to depending on your agility, JagdPanther II, otherwise, Ferdi. For JP2, it has a terribly low gun arc, so keep that in mind. A friend told me just yesterday how he abused IS-3 with Ferdinand. People say it can actually angle it\u0027s armor, thanks to it\u0027s large gun arc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to be honest, I don\u0027t have any of these two, but I\u0027m (veeeeery slooooooowly) headed towards Ferdi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I have unlocked 110E5 with crew trained on my T34 pillbox, but never got around to having enough silver to buy the damned thing :-D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T14:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi , been playing WOT since closed beta and although not so active now I still pop in and kill stuff now and again,.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy all time favorites and most successful vehicles have been the jagdpanther, loved chasing stuff around with that , it was very agile at one time, the ferdi I still have fully upgraded with full on crew is great but you need a good team to back you up, that said it\u0027s very deadly in the right conditions, it\u0027s rate of turn means you really have to be careful where you place yourself, the same goes for the JagTiger as much as i love it, its a shell magnet, Did try a buddies jp2 but it wasn\u0027t so nice it felt more like broken arty than a useful TD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T02:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to suggest the Ferdi, since it has enough armor that you can be close to the front. While it can\u0027t go fast, it can go as fast or faster than most heavies, so you shouldn\u0027t have much to worry about with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"General Rarity","CreatedById":67829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T08:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally don\u0027t play WoT. I am not totally at tier 9 with the E-75 and tier 8 with the Panther II, and at tier 6 with my beloved KV-2. Anyone who tells you else is a lying dirty non-patriotic liar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut srsly, JgPanther II has agility and that damned superstructure that will bounce anything. Ferdi has those weak 45 degree shoulders. But it also has the same amount of crew as the JgTiger.
