Also more biomes on kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso on Duna it will be good if we added more\u00A0Detailed terrain like Mountains, gaps on mountains where we can go through using our skills, Ravines and many more. Different colors on duna like on some biomes dark orange on some biomes light orange.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T00:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Kerbin has enough Biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems more like an HD texture/re-model rather than a stock consideration. The most I do interacting with Kerbin is flying over it, and landing on it. Same goes for most planets/ moons. I never had a problem with the current models/textures. Since the procedural generation everything looks pretty good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHD versions of the planets/ moons are out there if you want more immersion, but stock things seem fine to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T03:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s assume for a moment that terrain detail could be substantially improved. If so, it needs to have some gameplay utility. More clicking experiments because of biomes is pretty weak, it needs a new paradigm. \u00A0Just looking better is significant, look at even minecraft, sometimes it\u0027s worth seeing a seed just because some location is actually cool/pretty (in the way blocky minecraft can sometimes be (sorta like clunky Roger Dean paintings, lol). Anyway, some \u003Cem\u003Ereason\u003C/em\u003E to explore them would be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
