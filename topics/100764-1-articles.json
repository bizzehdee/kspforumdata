I achieved this, but now have 5 rookie Kerbals just hanging out. There\u0027s quite a bit of fuel left and I\u0027m pretty sure I could return to Kerbal (or at least get it to a parking orbit). However, it\u0027s reasonably large (2x mobile labs), and has no chutes attached.

It seems such a waste to have sent it all the way out there only to destroy it. But since you can dock transport to your orbital station, did you know you can transfer kerbals through the docking port, without them having to to EVA?
