They just don\u0027t seem to give a good enough reward for the risk involved (I\u0027ve always played without quicksave and reverting for better realism and I\u0027m now playing on Hard in 0.25). Besides, I\u0027ve always managed to get enough money with only the bigger contracts (like explore Mun and Minmus, achieve orbit around Kerbin and save Blah-Blah Kerman) even on 40% funds. Moreover, most of the parts contracts seem harder to me than the \u0022normal\u0022 ones - usually I have to activate a part not only under certain condition (like in orbit around the Mun for example), but also to do it at a certain altitude range AND while moving at a certain speed.
