It\u0027d be nice if I could just use a different compilation package that didn\u0027t require the .net targeting package, but i\u0027d probably have to start using Monodevelop which kinda defeats the purpose of having an editing environment that you can use effectively already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this whole .net thing has become \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E too complicated and is now defeating it\u0027s own intended purpose with all of these version mismatches and lack of full backwards compatibility. It\u0027s only marginally better than the old C\u002B\u002B redistribution packages, of which I have about 60 separate packages of, all named exactly the same, half of them the same version number, just to make sure everything runs smoothly.

I\u0027m thinking about trying to figure out how to convert other modded wheels that use the stock module to use your steering at the very least. I\u0027m also wondering how hard it would be to create a part which would only apply the steering properties and not the wheel properties. I\u0027m thinking along the lines of being able to create a set of tracks which would not apply any sort of turning, but then copy that set a few times and attach these \u0022sets\u0022 to a steering part which would apply the vessel-aware steering to the sets as if they were a single wheel. in other words, apply steering from the bottom of the intermediate part which would turn it\u0027s immediate child as one object. I realize it won\u0027t be doable with yor plugin alone likely, but I\u0027m thinking together with an IR part it might be doable. I\u0027m going to look at it later when I have no internet and do some fiddling. I\u0027m on a trip with my family, so internet in intermittent at best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T18:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAttach nodes (actually, the accurate term is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Estack\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E nodes, though that isn\u0027t a very good description for them) were my baby.
