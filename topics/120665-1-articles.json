It wouldn\u0027t work in real life it turns out, but Duna\u0027s atmosphere is apparently dense enough to fly in because it\u0027s been done here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what kind of lift rating to mass ratio is good for Duna? For example of what I\u0027m looking for, I consider in Kerbin having 1 lift rating per 2 tons is my standard for aircraft; can get away with less if necessary, or add more if a lot of stability is desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would that ratio look like on Duna ASL?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T16:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think more is needed, I\u0027ll run some tests with hyperedit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyrt Malthorn","CreatedById":149101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T16:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I was thinking, due to low air density.

But it\u0027s also sporting a .83 TWR which goes a long way, it\u0027s pretty floaty on lift alone. So I\u0027d say 1:1 is a decent reference point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock your thrust options are Dawn ions or rocket engines of whatever flavor (RAPIERS certainly operate, in rocket mode). In an ion glider you\u0027re likely going to want a lot more lift, RAPIERs can likely keep a decently built plane aloft without much help so wings would be largely for control surfaces - which is important, it\u0027s not easy to turn in Duna\u0027s atmosphere, at least compared to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
