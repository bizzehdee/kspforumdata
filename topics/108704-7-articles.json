It is meant for facilitating base construction or other types of ground docking, but it also works in space. You might want to disable the magnets in space though, at least for lighter vessels, as they tend to get tossed around faster than the docking port can move. Also note that when two flexible ports are brought together only one will be active, when both are active they tend to chase each other around and you get odd results.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For now I\u0027m only releasing a version for testing. It has a single port, the 1.25m part that pairs with a standard clampotron. The stock 1.25m docking port is required (in case anyone has deleted or replaced it) as they share the same texture.
