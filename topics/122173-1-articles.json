Is there any space at any time were that is not true, if we go to very longest wavelengths, hv that comes from the very edges of the visible universe but are so low energy its not possible to detect them and have extremely high penetrance. I mean one hypothetical explanation is that the hv resonance is interacting with other low energy magnifying simple EM momentum by redirecting these low frequency waves when they approach from certain directions. This is what i mean by uncertainty, at least oneof the devises it does not appear possible that it could be producing a reaction mass at ST.

Aside from the space experiment, they should place a whole feild of graphene circuited probes inside the fulstrum using fractal geometry to survey the em feild intensites over many wavelengths. The problem is that the longest wavelenths would not interact with probes of the shortest curvature.
