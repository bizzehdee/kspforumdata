Operation limited to 50m off the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- VERY sensitive to weight shifts. I was constantly adjusting the buoyancy even with a 500 ton test weight and only moving a 3 ton aircraft around the deck. Computerized assist would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Wonky carrier parts means that construction can\u0027t be mirrored. Kerbals still have freeze bug walking on deck, getting stuck in cracks between parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stopping is a PAIN. It takes years to slow down from 50m/s. I used 12 air brakes from Firespitter mod and it cut the time in half, but still took forever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dropping anchor at \u0026gt;10m/s risks tearing the anchor off...then you\u0027re screwed. I started keeping spare anchors in storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Despite freezing the lift factor in order to save, the whole craft will eventually settle to the ground when you aren\u0027t looking. Don\u0027t stop over uneven terrain or you might fly your scout back to a nasty surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cool factor is still a 9.5...thank you makers of Firespitter, carrier parts, and Hooligan for making this happen.
