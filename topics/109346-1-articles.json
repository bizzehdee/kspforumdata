When I start a new game, the 1st time I enter the VAB everything is fine but when I come back from a mission or revert the VAB tries to load then crashes. Sometimes it will load but then when I try to load a saved ship it crashes.\n\nAfter reading around the forums I thought it might be a texture issue so I removed ATM and texture replacer but no joy. I\u0027ve updated my drivers too and set the mouse frequency thing to 125ms.\n\nI\u0027ve copied the folder and tried fresh installs (with the below mods \u002B/- ATM and texture replacer) but it keeps happening.\n\nI\u0027m not sure where to find the error logs, if you they\u0027ll help then please let me know where to find em.\n\nThanks!\n\nCore i7 3612- 8gb Ram, \n\n2gb Radeon 7xxx - Gallium 0.4 on AMD TURKS driver\n\nKSP: 1.0.2 (Unix) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Linux 3.13 Ubuntu 14.04 64bit\n\nUSI Tools - 0.4\n\nChatterer - 0.9.1.86\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.1\n\nDeadly Reentry - 7.0.1\n\nEditor Extensions - 2.7\n\nFirespitter - 7.1.1\n\nRasterPropMonitor - 0.19.3\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nKerbal Construction Time - 1.1.6\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.16.6\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.3\n\nInfernal Robots - 0.21.2\n\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.0\n\nFinal Frontier - 0.8.2.1285\n\nPlanetShine - 0.2.3.1\n\nProcedural Parts - 1.1.1\n\nRealChute - 1.3.2.3\n\nRemoteTech - 1.6.4\n\nSCANsat - 1.1.2\n\nSafeChute - 1.7\n\nStageRecovery - 1.5.5\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer - 2.5.1.7\n\nTAC Life Support - 0.11.1.20\n\nAlternate Resource Panel - 2.7.1\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.3.1.1\n\nTweakScale - 2.1\n\nUSI Exploration Pack - 0.4\n\nFreight Transport Tech - 0.4\n\nKarbonite - 0.6.1\n\nKarbonite Plus - 0.4\n\nMKS - 0.30.1\n\nUSI Survivability Pack - 0.3\n\nWaypoint Manager - 2.3.2"},{"CreatedByName":"Corax","CreatedById":11311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T13:31:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve copied the folder and tried fresh installs (with the below mods \u002B/- ATM and texture replacer) but it keeps happening.\n\u003E I\u0027m not sure where to find the error logs, if you they\u0027ll help then please let me know where to find em.\n\nIs KSP working for you on a plain unmodded install?\n\nYou can find the logs here (might want to read that whole post):\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **The Logs**\n\u003E \n\u003E These are text files that the game spits out for debugging purposes as it runs; if something broke horribly in-game, there will be something in here about it.
