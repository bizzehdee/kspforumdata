Right now at the stages detach, they either damage the main booster or nudge my ship and mess up its course."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T08:16:34Z","Content":"Several ways:\n\n- Put the decouplers in the same stage as the next stage engine. When you press space, this should decouple the old stage and start the new stage in one go, which should cause a correct separation.\n\n- Add retro rockets to your spent stage and fire them on the same stage as the decoupler. There are some in various mod packs, such as NovaSilisko\\\u0027s SE or NovaPunch.\n\n- Edit the .cfg files of your decouplers to modify the EjectionForce value. Set it to something like 500."},{"CreatedByName":"ForumHelper","CreatedById":8635,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T09:34:34Z","Content":"Add boosters to your boosters so that they can fly away and leave your craft safe."},{"CreatedByName":"Crass","CreatedById":24532,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T09:53:27Z","Content":"Also struts. If you have a large stack attached to the main body at a high point with a decoupler, use a strut on the lower end. Without one, the expulsion force of the decoupler will often cause the stack to rotate inward at the lower point. The strut will prevent that.\n\nAlso maybe post a picture of the rocket design in question?\n\nEdit: Also spinning the craft with Q or E before decoupling will also help in casting off the part."},{"CreatedByName":"WatchDragon","CreatedById":26903,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T15:23:27Z","Content":"Would that be an RCS thruster? if so i have no idea how to make those things work"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T16:19:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would that be an RCS thruster? if so i have no idea how to make those things work\n\nYou need to add an RCS fuel tank somewhere on your vessel.
