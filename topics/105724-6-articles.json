It definitely deserves the release candidate badge. If it had been released as 1.0 RC or .99, that would have been much better.\n\u003E This update is great. The features added are great. The polish is great. It is a GREAT update. But it is still a release candidate. That isn\u0027t a step you can skip. They tried to skip it, and named it the release. They raised the expectations of a release level product. They said things like it will be ready when it is done. But the release has problems. And these problems would not nearly be perceived so negatively if it had been a 1.0 RC instead of just 1.0. After all, they are ~~mostly~~ all trivial issues. This release should have been a triumph.\n\u003E \n\u003E It is said what is in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell a sweet.

Then again, i defenetely wouldnt label it finished with teh sheer amount of bugs present right now.\n\nA short list off the top of my head:\n\nOcclusion is completely broken both for heat AND for drag! You can \u0022occlude\u0022 a 3.5m tank with a cubic strut, and stuff that shouldve been occluded never gets occluded (such as radially mounted stuff even if they are behind the entire craft not exposed to airflow). While the occlusion mechanics are good, its so poorly implemented that designs that would never work can now bypass drag, and some 100% logical planes fail due to occlusion not shielding some things that are 100% behind another part. Now i know this is alot more complicated to fix then most bugs, but i still want my 3.5m tanks to have actual drag regardless of whether i leave them exposed or stick a cubic strut atop (try it, launchg an exposed fuel tank, watch the drag/mach#, and then retry this with a cubic strut atop, drag goes from 700\u002B to 5!\n\nParachutes are virtually indestructible and function at interplanetary velocities for some reason without either burning up or being torn off if deployed properly. I dont think i need to explain ANYTHING when it comes down to why this is broken!\n\nThe pods are notorious for flipping over backwards, and then burning up as the heat shield isnt even pointed in the right direction. Yes its a quickie fix by setting the heat shields to have physics enabled, but why wasnt this addressed in the actual game, unless none of the experimental/QA testers actually tried to reenter with a command pod atop a heat shield (which seems unlikely). Not that this one bug breaks the update, but something THIS SIMPLE should never have been in the final game (all it takes for now is a quick cfg edit!)."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:11:29Z","Content":"The new parts, systems and overhauls in 1.0 are much appreciated; looking forward to what balance tweaks v1.0.1 might bring.

Anything more than about 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (degrees) of attack angle (i.e. you stand on the controls to do that ridiculous 45% turn in space at 10km) then you\u0027ll have a bad day.\n\u003E \n\u003E Folks will have habits that may need to be relearned.
