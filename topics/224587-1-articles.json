We\u0027ve attempted a few different methods, and currently, we can unlock the gimbal lock with the code and access various data such as PitchAngle, YawAngle, RollAngle, etc. However, we\u0027re facing issues when trying to change the values of these data because these data properties are \u0022Get Only\u0022 in kOS. Therefore, we\u0027re unable to move the gimbal through kOS. Any idea on how can we do it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
