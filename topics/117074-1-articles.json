And with a vengeance! Now fully tested to be compliant with 1.04, and with delivery methods (yes, plural) rated for *anywhere but Tylo*\\*. \n\n![Vp6ZMYl.png](http://i.imgur.com/Vp6ZMYl.png)\n\nThere, a sample basic base. What you can see in the background is the new delivery method, actually, the C.R.A.D.L.E. (**C**ontainer **R**ated for **A**tmospheric **D**escent and **L**anding **E**nvelopes). Those babies are the simplest delivery method, and actually deserve the moniker \u0022base in several boxes\u0022, to be more precise, because the basic base is divided among three of those. One carries all the crewed spaces (Hab, Lab and Node), another the utility stuff (Fuel Dump and Resource Module), and the final one a buttload of corridor sections (6), plus a construction/science rover. I find it the most convenient for base expansion, if I need more crew space or fuel handling facilities I can pick one of them as it suits me. They have a heatshield (mostly emptied), retrorockets with \u003E1 TWR and \u003E1km/s dV under the maximum load, chutes, and extra RCS to tip over (and do so safely!) even under kerbin gravity on a plain, for module drop. To dispose of them after the cargo is safely horizontal and detached on the ground, you can also use RCS on low-grav worlds, or the extra kick of some separatrons on higher gravity worlds. Make sure to quicksave before trying out, tough, in case kraken!\n\n[table=width: 1000]\n\n[tr][td][![vCAkOrEl.png](http://i.imgur.com/vCAkOrEl.png)](http://imgur.com/vCAkOrE)[/td][td][![p1y4T4fl.png](http://i.imgur.com/p1y4T4fl.png)](http://imgur.com/p1y4T4f)[/td][/tr][/table]\n\nThen there is the good \u0027ol fashioned method of landing each module with a dedicated lander based on an orbital depot. Cheapest by far! In that case, the whole basic base pack can fit inside a shroud, and I have created both a very simple and rugged rocketcrane lander to go with it that should handle the job, even on high-ish gravity worlds like Duna (DL below), and the Trident, which you can see in the latest pics and is an actual SSTO on oxygenated atmospheres on top of being just as capable as an airless moon lander. That one you would have to [grab from its own thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132722-Trident-SSTO-V-STOL-Dropship!). Obviously Eve is a one way trip, I advise using disposable CRADLEs there. An extensive net of refueling depots is all you would need for this, cleverly using the (refueled) upper stage of the launcher to tug the base around, and keeping the shroud if you plan on aerobraking at your destination. You could also dispose of it and tug it through Sr. ports, of course, it will maintain structural stability. Careful unpacking! It will create some debris that you will have to clean if you are not in an unstable orbit when you do so.\n\n[table=width: 1000]\n\n[tr][td][![oRs6b4ul.png](http://i.imgur.com/oRs6b4ul.png)](http://imgur.com/oRs6b4u)[/td][td][![2yFgPyll.png](http://i.imgur.com/2yFgPyll.png)](http://imgur.com/2yFgPyl)[/td][/tr][/table]\n\nTo assemble it together, if you don\u0027t know how yet (perhaps you missed when user Temstar popularized the method for the first time), you basically grab the modules from the bottom with the rover and drag them into a perfect land dock. In theory. In reality, there are a few more considerations:\n\n-Land docking in different gravity regimes is tricky. It can be done, basically because the rover is a rocket VTOL that can take care of the sag of the wheels, and you can also raise gears on the target to increase sag. With some patience you\u0027ll get the trick, remember to be gentle and quicksave often.\n\n-Most of the modules can be up-righted if they fall over, especially in low gravities, but doing so is often tricky. Careful! You may end up having to build a wall to push against with other modules, and on high gravity worlds, when a lab module with a spent uprighting mechanism (the legs on the side you can drop with a decoupler) falls over, it is pretty much toast.\n\n-The corridors can drop their legs, in order to reduce part count when the base is assembled. Careful with that, you can move them afterwards with other modules, but if they fall to the ground without legs, they are as good as lost.\n\n-You should have ample power so each module can stay alive, but don\u0027t go timewarping at x1000 or something crazy: most of the modules are only battery-powered, and sometimes you need to grab control to open ports and actuate legs and such.\n\n-I put science equipment on the rover. Who knows why, since you literally need almost all the nodes already unlocked to build this thing, but hey, you might be a completionist like me! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Of course, I give you one fully functional base, but the possibilities for expansion with additional modules are, literally, what you CPU handles. And the basic pack is a mere 172 *135* parts when fully deployed, so you can push it a lot! Check out what I did in previous versions, with its predecessors:\n\n![VO4OZJj.png](http://i.imgur.com/VO4OZJj.png)\n\nBoy do I need to get cracking at this base building stuff, that screenie looks *old* now ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif). Anyhow, perhaps a final word (or two) on delivery methods. The CRADLEs are tested without refueling on a self-delivery to Minmus, and they get there with dV to spare and all upper stages on impact trajectories for a clean straightforward mission with no support. You might have to tap into the fuel of the Fuel Dump\u002BResource Module CRADLE (designation B2 in the files), but hey, you carry a drill, and that CRADLE ends up with the highest dV if you do so. In fact, the thing can be used as a miner for the other modules, if you are veeery cheeky about it, on extremely low gravity worlds. The possibilities there I leave to the user\u0027s imagination. That also means, of course, that Mun is doable (not trip back, remember? And there is a nice margin, plus they can exchange fuel in low munar orbit) without depots or refuelling, as well as Duna and Eve. To go further, or to save *a ton* of money, I suggest using the Base-In-A-Shroud model and/or SSTOs to put the modules up, and the rocketcrane to deliver them one by one (the corridors can ride on the outside port to save some trips). You will need fuel depots and tugs, but at this point, my advice is probably redundant and you already have your own ideas on how to go about it.\n\nAlso, as a bonus, this time I am also giving out quite a few subassemblies to go with the pack (each separate module, the rover, and a couple of corridor packages), so you can build your own custom packages! Plus, I am also including a modded module, in case you want to go that way: a clone for the fuel dump, but with a KIS container instead of fuel, which can house enough equipment to actually store USI life support stuff enough to supply a crew of three with fresh-grown veggies (you can actually see it on the pics, because I use those should-be-stock mods). A module for every need indeed! Free to grab what you want from this, innovate on it, and share the fruits of your labor here with us, I always appreciate a good screenie with a story behind it, be it glory or fail. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSo now, I (finally!) leave you with a very confusing album that needs some reorganizing and more pics added to it (on it!), and the juicy juicy downloads.

I\u0027m getting a bit frustrated!\n\u003E Kit\n\nYup, that is something that will be fixed. The easiest way is to move the spacer between the modules up to that docking port in the VAB, so you clear that vernor with the actual modules (I know *exactly* what you mean). However, in Minmus and with its pathetic gravity, you can also roll the Cradle out of the way with the RCS activated, no need for the separatron\u0027s extra kick to make the CRADLE do flips in the air, just rolling a bit worked for me. Disconnecting all modules from each other before trying would help, or dropping one first and then the other after moving the CRADLE a bit. And it being Minmus, if one module ends up upside down, right it up with reaction wheel power.\n\nThe issue however, would be more important on a high-gravity planet, but as I also said, you only need to put the spacer on that end of the bay so the modules clear that Vernor.\n\nRune. I have to finish up with vX.1 testing, it\u0027s a big improvement.

Maybe I\u0027ll make the spacer an integral part of the CRADLE or move the vernors to the sides. And no, I haven\u0027t yet made v2, no new modules yet in the DLs. But soon! I just want to test that I can get them places still, and that the new corridor/rover bundle works as advertised (so far so good, it doesn\u0027t seem to summon the kraken). That will be the nicest touch, it allows me to put the rover back into the basic pack-in-a-shroud, keeping the three corridors, and just have an optional fuel dump in the rocketcrane, not a crucial part of the kit like the rover. Also, the rocketcrane with am ISRU module would make a decent emergency miner to fuel the further deployment of modules... if it had a command seat for an engineer to multiply yield. So I might do something about that.

Same reason they ditch their legs after assembly (though now that I think about it, I could have put a temporary docking port). Point is, it\u0027s not necessary, and in fact the next version will have a corridor without legs entirely because it can be picked from the floor by the others. How to pick and move them, then? Well, you guessed the right way for high-gravity planets, you pick them with other modules and drive them around. The Node module is ideal, since they will probably end up with one end on it. Note that the extra torque actually helps if you know how to handle rovers: Map the rover wheels controls to, say, IJKL, and you can drive with your right hand while you control orientation with your left one. That trick is priceless! Especially in low gravity. Short of like docking, takes a bit of getting used to, but after a few hours doing it you will map it in your brain and it\u0027ll become automatic.\n\nBut, that is the \u0022official\u0022, safe, boring version of the user manual. How to move them the kerbal way? Well, reaction wheel power FTW! They have a 1.25m wheel and 1000 units of electric charge for a reason, after all. You can master the \u0022Minmus-step\u0022, rolling sideways in shorts burts with the legs extended for surprisingly controllable sideways jumps, or just roll on the ground (even on kerbin gravity, but it becomes tedious) with them folded. You can get them close this way very easily, and it you are good with weird controls, I usually just dock them this way. If you let them run out of electric charge (say, you timewarped to mine fuel for the rocketcrane, it has happened to me), just connect them temporarily with a power-generating module to recharge them. And try to remember to forbid batteries the next time! I can\u0027t say I\u0027m too successful at that myself, but hey, maybe you have a more organized mind.\n\nIn other news, the munar base to test the new modifications is happily chugging along, built the old fashioned \u0022one module at a time\u0022 way. Turns out now I have enough drills to fill the ore tanks *while refueling another ship*. Also, the fact that the rocket crane can land-dock under low gravities is cool, in Duna and such places I will have to drive the old-fashioned LFO fuel dump to it to refuel.\n\n![213L2ux.png](http://i.imgur.com/213L2ux.png)\n\n![LLnQ8vt.png](http://i.imgur.com/LLnQ8vt.png)\n\n![H1iy3If.png](http://i.imgur.com/H1iy3If.png)\n\nJust a tiny clearance issue on the Mining Modules radiators, which turned out to be unnecessary... and broke on landing for some reason. Also I had to drop them upside down, and they can\u0027t right themselves, so I I had to fly the rover upside-down to dock inverted, then use its RCS systems to roll it the right way up. Fun times with the engineering prototypes! At least *you* won\u0027t get this this particular issue.\n\nNote I happily use KIS\u002BKAS as if they were stock, to get the engineer bonus to extraction and go all fuel-cell powered during construction. The manned skycrane Eagle Mk VII I\u0027m working on will address that issue for 100% stock players, and make a nice independent miner with a ISRU module to boot:\n\n![ERElSdt.png](http://i.imgur.com/ERElSdt.png)\n\nRune.
