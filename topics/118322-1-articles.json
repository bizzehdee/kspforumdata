The entire event will be live-streamed over the course of several days (notices will be posted here as well as in other places).\n\nThe Vehicle!\n\nThe vehicle used will be a heavily modified version of Jon144\u0027s Mega Truck 2. He has approved of the usage of his vehicle for the task and even plans on filming some of the streams to use for his youtube channel. This challenge should be a good test for his wheel and suspension systems. The base version of the truck has been cleared for up to 45 degree slopes, which should make mountains less of a problem for me.\n\n\u003E ![94BA3C8CBF03F130A41585D98BC7F7600FD1B9B1](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/436074295020378658/94BA3C8CBF03F130A41585D98BC7F7600FD1B9B1/)\n\nProblems have arisen, mainly due to lag issues. I likely will be designing my own home-built vehicle for the challenge instead sadly\n\nThe Twitch Channel!\n\n[http://www.twitch.tv/noname117spore](http://www.twitch.tv/noname117spore)\n\nStream Status!\n\nNot streaming\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T21:58:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T21:03:38Z","Content":"Good luck."},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:37:31Z","Content":"Under 500 parts is not laggy.
