I also find the stock illuminators to be to big. I really like to add LED-lights and nav lights to both rockets and spaceplanes. Makes it much easier to see when it is orbiting on the dark side of a planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if they could make it possible to adjust or give steering to the illuminators, that would be great. Imagine your M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn base where one part is landing next to the other.
