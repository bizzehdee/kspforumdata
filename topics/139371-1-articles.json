A small normal/antinormal burn at the edge of SOI brings down the PE a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, most of the time I get a highly inclined orbit. When going to Duna, I usually get almost polar orbits.For landing, thats no problem. But when I want to also visit some moons, then an equatorial orbit would be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the best way to ensure an equatorial orbit on the target body? Where do you have your burns, and what burns do you perform for achieve this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T08:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, all you need is a bit of normal burn about half way through your journey, or right at the ascending / descending node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T08:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112072-empiro/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112072\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112072-empiro/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Empiro\u003C/a\u003E is right. It\u0027s better to do burns on ascending or descending nodes than when entering SOI. Then AN and DN nodes are the only location you can set your inclination correctly in only one burn. Further more, it\u0027s usually farther so the burn dV is less expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only issu I have is when you get an encounter, the AN/DN nodes disappear from the orbit, you have to guess it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you orbits look \u0022crazy\u0022 focus on the target body, so they\u0027ll look just like regular hyperbole. It\u0027s easier to fine tune the orbit in that view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, MechJeb \u0022node editor\u0022 or \u0022Precise node\u0022 mod is a great help to tune the incoming orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
