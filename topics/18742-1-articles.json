Well, other than that you have to restart.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly! I like the fact that both of these games embrace losing as part of the learning and playing process, something that has been somewhat lost in the past decade or so of game development. Not that I think every game should be impossibly hard or something, just that the challenge of doing things has somewhat been lost. FPS games are linear and you have infinite health pretty much, RTS have all become clones of each other pretty much, simulation games have been dumbed down (Compare SimCity 4 to the newest SimCity planned) racing games are easier, flying games are easier; I think about the only games that have not been touched in terms of complexity might be the 4x games (with Civ V being maybe the exception) and RPGs, which I think are going through a paradigm shift atm (which BioWare is leading in so far)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why it is so refreshing to see games like DF, KSP, and to an extent MC. Unique games with unique challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ydoow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ydoow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate to say boring, and I hate to say that the GUI is what makes it boring, but I think that\u0027s why I can\u0027t get into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably my biggest gripe as well; that and it seems you NEED third party software to play the game properly. That being said, I like the level of immersion that game can offer you. I personally don\u0027t really care for the violent part of the game.

And then it is still quite difficult. Something that has helped me when I play the game is not to play too much at a time. It increases fatigue and makes me get impatient. I find playing 30 minutes at a time is fun and allows me to focus on the minor details of the game which is really what it is all about. Once I realised the game was about the micro, not the macro, it helped me to enjoy it more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are all reasons I like KSP as well. It allows my childhood fantasies of being an astronaut be fulfilled. I HAVE been to the moon, I HAVE been in space, I HAVE done a space walk, it is so great that a game such as this can entertain me as an adult so much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dt890","CreatedById":8704,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T12:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esome quick notes on what to expect from Dwarf fortress \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb58377/vsrecommendedgames/images/b/b4/DorfLearningCurve.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022DorfLearningCurve.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://dwarffortresswiki.org/images/4/40/FunComic.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FunComic.png\u0022\u003E Offical wiki lol\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits a really rare type of game.
