The Saturn V could deliver 120,000 kg to LEO -- more than twice your hypothetical mass -- and it took a lot less than five hours to do it. The American people decided that it was not desirable. It\u0027s not just that we no longer make Saturn V rockets; we no longer make the machines that were used to assemble the Saturn V rockets. A gigantic chuck of aerospace infrastructure was utterly dismantled and removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of questions come to mind with your hypothetical question.
