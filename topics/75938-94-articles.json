I gotta know what really happens before I leave it alone. especially considering all the time I spent working with SQUID before discovering your wheel project (literally by accident) and got hooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E**It was crazy. There wasn\u0027t even a namespace or anything, and SharpDevelop found all sorts of redundant code in there.

Doesn\u0027t seem to matter what you do, if the two vessels are, indeed, separate \u0022vessels\u0022, then in the eyes on KSP, they have different trajectories, and there is naff all you can do about it. I\u0027ve posted a thread in the plugin dev forum asking for info, but nothing is forthcoming. I think this one is intractable, as it would require messing with the most fundamental parts of KSP, so it\u0027s the docked way, or the highway. I did try disabling the flight integrator, which is hilarious, as it makes the world move around the active vessel at anything over 800m/s, very interesting things happen...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love it if you would share more about those... um... interesting things...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, along the lines of those on-rails vessels and such, I still remember a plugin that was able to get around that... somehow... I think. I\u0027m going to do a little research. I may know absolutely nothing about what it is you\u0027re asking the rest of the forum-gurus, but I have looked at and tested out billions (sorta) of mods for this space simulator we all love (and hate at the same time, usually) and while I don\u0027t have any sort of super-accurate memory, I do remember all sorts of strange things that I read in mod change-logs. I\u0027ll let you know if I find anything useful. Now that I\u0027ve discovered ILSpy, I\u0027m finding all sorts of cool stuff hidden away in the DLL files we get with some of the older mods from before source was so easily distributable and/or required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: ah-HA! I found it. The mod was called \u0022Burn Together!\u0022 and it allowed a lead vessel to command surrounding vessels to copy its movements, thus creating a formation-flying effect. I always wishes you could also force the vessels to try and maintain a specific formation relative to the heading of the lead craft so you could have a flying-V setup, but that would bloat the code to over twice what it is now I\u0027m sure, since you\u0027d have to account for the relative distance, speed, and vector of movement between every vessel and every other vessel in the formation, and get them all to move at different speed and angles to maintain the formation. Though, now that I type all that out, I have to wonder if an adaptation of the KF wheel calculations could have proved useful in such an endeavor. Oh well, we\u0027ll probably never find out. The last release for this mod was back during KSP 23.5. Back to the matter at hand though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important parts of the change-log are these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ealpha v5.1:\u003Cbr\u003E[B]-timewarp lock occurs only if followers are within 0.1m/s of leader[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E-fixed loss of followers during high timewarp\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ealpha v5:\u003Cbr\u003E-added some rudimentary rover support\u003Cbr\u003E[B]-ships lock in position during timewarp[/B]\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I gather that the author found a way to lock two or more crafts, which are separated by longer distances than we are even trying to achieve, in the same relative spot during high time accelerations (which I would assume also includes the odd things that happen when exiting high time acceleration modes).
