Also this is a two-body problem, which does not really exist. If we can imagine the earth and the moon as a two body problem, both have some elasticity, and thus the Earth\u0027s rotation slows, the moons increases, and some of that energy becomes a magnetic field. In the above situation if the tube in which the ball fell was elastic, the ball would impart some of its energy on the tube (causing heat) and it would loose some of its energy, the problem is that there is no form of matter that is completely inelastic. Everything compresses if sufficient force is applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a third body is placed in the system in which an object is not rotating but orbits about a star or a moon orbits about a planet, the ball would not continue to fall strait, it would eventually conduct heat to the ball in the form of friction, over time the amount of collisions would increase. A third instance is that the planet is orbiting is parent galaxy, although this is more of a hairy problem since in a galaxy the forces are spread out in many directions and one of the tensors is dark matter (an is, except for the vector product, intangible).\u00A0 As a consequence a non-rotating objects orientation relative to galactic basis is changing over geological time scales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forth problem is gravitational waves, since two objects oscillating with respect to each other are expected to create gravitational waves at very small levels, since wave production is energy, this is loss of energy to the system. The falling object is transferring through more u/r than a satellite leaving earth orbit as it falls, this is very tiny amount of energy loss since most i trapped within the system but if the system is observed from the outside then this is not true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the problems apriori\u0027s are insufficient. For example, if this is the only two objects in the visible universe (which is counter to the definition of the universe because we must see it to be visible), and its light is what we observe by (including falling objects on kinetically inactive spheres), and those two objects are at 0\u0027K (non-elastic), which by definition we cannot observe them except through gravitational observations and Heisenberg uncertainty applies.

For example, if this is the only two objects in the visible universe (which is counter to the definition of the universe because we must see it to be visible), and its light is what we observe by (including falling objects on kinetically inactive spheres), and those two objects are at 0\u0027K (non-elastic), which by definition we cannot observe them except through gravitational observations and Heisenberg uncertainty applies. You cannot observe a system even with gravitational waves, without affecting the system. So if your system is perfectly conservative you cannot observe it, and if you observe it, then it cannot be indefinite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre we really going to nitpick about n-body interactions and gravitational waves in a question that involves a completely implausible shaft drilled exactly straight through the centre of the\u00A0Earth? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas the old spherical cow in a vacuum assumption gone out of fashion these days?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T04:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jN-FfJKgis8?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/urQCmMiHKQk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-13T03:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223265619\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169467\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515694198\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002249317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/11/2018 at 12:09 PM, Steel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre we really going to nitpick about n-body interactions and gravitational waves in a question that involves a completely implausible shaft drilled exactly straight through the centre of the\u00A0Earth? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas the old spherical cow in a vacuum assumption gone out of fashion these days?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES! why wouldn\u0027t we.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I do that is the same reason a forensic pathologist claims there are no traceless crimes. The point from a physical point of view is that every action has a reaction. So whereby we apply this to our logic. If we are detecting the motion of two neutron stars 2 million light years away detecting the gravitational effects of a local object would be all the more powerful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 1 a celestial . . .Celestials are found where, in space, surrounded by other matter stars planets, other, parts, of the galaxy . . . . so are we to remove these. Most solid celestials either orbit stars or other planets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStep 2 a dig a hole . . Most celestials of any given size do not have rigid interiors, if you dug far enough down you would start seeing the effects of pressure on its structure . . .so the celestial have to be absolutely rigid and cold at the center.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStep 3 drop and object into the hole . . . wait a second most bodies have some atmosphere, and even if a little by the time you finished digging the hole would have filled with something. Even the moon would if you dug a hole through the middle accumulate significant hydrogen over time because a hole is a lower energy state for the hydrogen. . . .so you would have drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStep 4 you also have friction. . .all celestials rotate even tidally locked celestials are rotating once per orbit . . . to prevent frictional encounters. . . . .there would have to be no motion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo now we need something that does not exist. A celestial with no companions . . .anywhere.... not rotating . . . .solid as a diamond. (although how did we dig a hole through solid diamond). we drop an object into a space that has nothing but space . . .and we observe . . .but without a meter (light source and a mass that measures) how do we know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIOW if you\u00A0 remove the universe from a problem, you cannot use universe\u0027s information to deduce a solution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-13T06:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI strongly believe that in the name of forensic we must run a practical verification test.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny suggestions about drilling through the Earth are greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-13T13:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would you start with earth, start with something smaller . . . . . . . .say a black hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
