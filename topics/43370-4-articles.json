The only reasonable way to resolve it is that warp drives simply cannot exist, for some reason we haven\u0027t discovered yet.

According to causality, the cause must precede the effect. And this means their actual order, not their observed order. For example, if the effect of a specific cause is closer to an observer, you might observe the effect before the cause. But the cause still preceded the effect in actual order. Causality is only violated when, in some frame of reference, the effect precedes the cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this is not just different observations of events. If I get in a rocket and travel close to c, it will feel to me like a certain amount of time has passed. That amount of time will be different for an observer in a different frame of reference. There is no violation of causality here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as I said before, you can have FTL travel without violation of causality if you have a single frame of reference. If I get in my warp ship and travel at 100c to Alpha Centauri, there is no violation of causality. The problems occur when you add additional observers in other frames of reference, i.e. observers who are moving in relation to the original observer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a real in-depth read about this stuff, I point everyone to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.physicsguy.com/ftl/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.physicsguy.com/ftl/index.html\u003C/a\u003E where Jason Hinson has a TON of information on FTL, relativity, etc. I\u0027ll try to summarize some of it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot understand causality violations, paradox, and FTL travel without looking at Minkowski diagrams. This is a simplified 2D representation of movement in space and time for a given observer in a specific frame of reference:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.physicsguy.com/ftl/figures/xvst.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022xvst.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe observer (O) is \u0022at rest\u0022 at the origin, with the x axis measuring travel in space and the t axis measuring travel in time. By adding a grid and identifying a point on that grid, you can determine when and where any event occurs in relation to the at-rest observer at the origin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.physicsguy.com/ftl/figures/xtgrid.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022xtgrid.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you measure the grid using seconds as the unit of time, and light seconds as the unit of distance, the event \u0022@\u0022 occurred 3 light seconds away and 1 second in the past for the observer (O) at the origin. The key here is that any event that occurs below the x axis (-t) occurred in the past for any observer in that frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what happens if you add a second observer (O\u0027)? Well if that observer is \u0022at rest\u0022 with respect to the original observer (O), then they share the same frame of reference and thus the same coordinate system. Any event that happens in the past for one observer (-t) will be in the past for the second observer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOW what happens if that second observer (O\u0027) is moving in relation to the original observer (O)? You need to apply a Lorentz Transformation to the coordinate system of the moving observer, which shifts the axis depending on the how fast O\u0027 is moving in relation to O:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.physicsguy.com/ftl/figures/o2fast.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022o2fast.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what we can do is say that O and O\u0027 both share the same point in space and time at x=0 and t=0. Basically, the two observers pass each other at a specific time and at a specific point in space common to both of them. By making the \u0022passing event\u0022 be at the origin we can superimpose the two coordinate systems, and you get this where the black lines are the coordinate system for O and the blue lines are the coordinate system for O\u0027:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.physicsguy.com/ftl/figures/xptp.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022xptp.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important thing to note here is that the event marked as * happens in the past for O (it is below the black x axis) but happens in the future for O\u0027 (it is above the blue x axis). So when they meet at the origin the two can argue all day about whether * happened yet or not, but there is still no causality violation because * really HAS NOT HAPPENED yet for O\u0027...there is no cause before effect. And as long as FTL does not exist you cannot have a causality violation, because O cannot send any signals or information to O\u0027 at the time of the event that will reach him before he actually encounters the event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow once you introduce FTL you throw all that out and can easily create a causality violation and a paradox. Using the same diagram above, we say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Observers O and O\u0027 are in space stations, with O at rest and O\u0027 moving at a high speed in relation to O\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) As the two space stations pass each other (the \u0022passing event\u0022) O\u0027 sends out a robot in a FTL shuttle to kill the brother of O. That death is the event *. The death happens after the passing event according to O\u0027 (which makes sense, since he sent out the shuttle) but it happens BEFORE the passing event according to O (it is below the black x axis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The shuttle arrives at a third space station where the brother of O lives. This space station is at rest in relation to O station, so is in the same frame of reference and shares the same spacetime coordinate system (the black axis) as his brother. The robot kills the brother, and third observer O\u0027\u0027 records the event. The observer O\u0027\u0027 now knows that at some point in the future, O\u0027 will send a robot to kill the brother, because the passing event HAS NOT HAPPENED YET in their frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) O\u0027\u0027 then fires up his FTL radio and sends a signal to O. Remember these two observers are in the same frame of reference so for both of them the passing event has not happened yet. O\u0027\u0027 tells O that at the passing event, O\u0027 will send the robot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) When the passing event happens, O is ready and when the robot leaves on his shuttle, O destroys it with a laser blast, thus saving his brother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have a paradox. If O stops the robot, then his brother isn\u0027t killed. But if his brother isn\u0027t killed then he doesn\u0027t know the robot will leave, and he doesn\u0027t blow it up. If he doesn\u0027t blow it up, the robot kills his brother......etc. Note that all this happens because the two observers are moving in relation to each other, and it happens regardless of the type of FTL used. The robot could have used a Alcubierre Drive shuttle, or gone through a wormhole, or even just send a FTL signal to an assassin on the third station. As long as you can send information FTL then you can get causality violations and thus unsolvable paradoxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of self-consistency principles is that any event that might cause this kind of paradox has a probability of occurring of zero. Something will happen, the FTL signal from O\u0027\u0027 to O wont go through. The robot will break down. Something will prevent the paradox from happening. So you could get FTL travel, and you could even get causality violations (or closed timelike curves), but any attempt to create a paradox will not happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR Go to Jason Hinson\u0027s page and at least read Part I Chapter 2 where he talks about Minkowski diagrams and Part IV wher he talks about FTL travel and the issues it causes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T18:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wouldn\u0027t any FTL signal at all cause consistency violations, where two observers in two different inertial frames observe two different outcomes?

The attempt was to initiate a negative-time phase-freeze that would allow the traveler to \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4drop back\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 in time. The calcs proofed wrong though, and the freeze didnt propagate into greater volumes. Instead, it stayed on tiny scales and propagated backwards through time agressively. And now, a billion years earlier, we got this mess we call quantum physics, dark matter and whatnot.

There needs to be time travel to cause that, and you only get time travel when you have FTL communication (either by signal or by actual movement) between observers in two different frames of reference.

There is no doubt that time travel is mathematically possible, since closed timelike curves have been shown to exist at least on paper. So if time travel is possible, and self-contradictory situations are not, then there must be a mechanism to prevent them. You have ideas like Hawking\u0027s chronology protection conjecture, and Novikov\u0027s principle. These aren\u0027t relying on \u0022fate\u0022 to stop paradoxes...they use mathematics.

This has actually been \u0022somewhat\u0022 proven by using a situation where a ball is sent through a wormhole so that it time travels back and hits itself before it goes in the wormhole, causing a paradox. An analysis was run using every possible initial situation for the ball, and there were no results that were not inconsistent.

They all agree on center detector system\u0027s configuration of atoms, the state of the electronics, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they were watching the center detector/bomb system\u0027s state carefully, they will have to see the center detector system\u0027s atoms respond in a causal way to outside stimuli. The system can\u0027t magically change states without something to force it to change states. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that, according to the frame of reference, observers will see this same system respond to different stimuli, and thus, have a different ending configuration. Most observers (those who are not sharing the reference frame of the flatbed car) will be able to watch as the center detector system receives one FTL signal, do some computations, timestamps the arrival time, and THEN receives the other FTL signal, does some computations, and stores a DIFFERENT timestamp for the other FTL signal\u0027s arrival time. Observers on the flatbed car will observe the two FTL signals be received at the same time, and receive the same timestamp! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the differing computations would result in a different amounts of electromagnetic radiation leaking out of the center detector system, as the different computations would result in different electric current flows. That also means that different reference frames would witness a different heat output, a different energy consumption, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, as long as the universe follows physical laws, where information does not magically appear, violating conservation of energy (and mass), causality, and making all the laws of physics meaningless, observers on the train observe a different reality than those with a different inertial frame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what happens when the different physical realities, which somehow still lie in the same physical reality, start to interact with each other??? The laws of physics lose all meaning as particles start responding to stimuli that do not exist in their version of reality? If they don\u0027t exist in their version of reality, then how are they responding? Causality dies, and the laws of physics become meaningless, as anything at all can now happen, with no stimulus to cause it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what you\u0027re saying is essentially the same thing- maybe worse, in fact. You\u0027re saying that observers on the ground should witness the center detector system receive one FTL signal, wait some time while its internal clock increments, receive the FTL signal at a different interal clock time, and then, it malfunctions, giving the timestamp on the arrival of the second FTL signal as being the same on the timestamp for the arrival time of the first FTL signal. If the observers on the ground watched closely, according to you, they would see a logic gate fail in the system somewhere, consuming slightly more or less energy during the failure. Furthermore, this would be a different flow of electricity though the system, and flowing electrical energy emits electromagnetic waves. The observers on the train do not witness this happen, they see everything work as normal. Thus, the end states of the two systems would be slightly different. Observers on the train would be in a different physical reality than all other observers in different frames of reference, as depending on the frame of reference, the center detector system would consume differing amounts of electrical power, output differing amounts of electromagnetic noise, and have differing final temperatures (as electric current flow generates heat). In fact, ALL frames of reference would experience their own, different version of reality, as, depending on the reference frame, differing amounts of time would have passed between the arrival time of the two FTL signals. And yet, they would still be in the same physical reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words- you\u0027re saying that the observers on the ground should end up in a different physical reality than the observers on the train, and yet, still be in the same physical reality.
