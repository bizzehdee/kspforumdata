I\u0027m doing a big Eve mission to collect science from all the surface biomes. Mission profile is a disposable surface biome hopper, eventually calling down an ascent vehicle from orbit at a suitable LZ. 2 Kerbals - a scientist to reset the experiments, an engineer for the ISRUs and broken things, 2 cabins to recover 2 copies of all experiments (just for fun). I have the ascent vehicle finished - sea level capable, 4 stages with ISRU surface fueling, ~450T and 200 parts at Kerbin launch, ~300T and 80 parts at Eve launch. The surface of Eve in my sandbox/hyperedit testing save is hilariously littered with wreckage and dead Kerbals from the process of designing that craft, but it works every time. The only requirement is landing on no more than a moderate incline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and this is a mostly stock game with just GPOSpeedFuelPump, EditorExtensions, KER, MJ. Cost and techs are not factors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1: I designed and tested a 2-Kerbal rover to drive over all the biomes, and I quickly lost interest in that method. Eve is a big place and rovers can be explodey, though it seems to work with a lot of F5/F9 and it\u0027s very simple. Maybe I just need more design work to survive 4x physics warp, and read a book?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2: I designed and tested a vertical-launch 2-Kerbal ISRU suborbital rocket that can fly horizontally for a bit and land on chutes. I went for as small as possible with aerospikes and ~1500m/s sea level dV. Works terrific on Kerbin, but I can\u0027t seem to make more than 6-7km per hop on Eve - very tedious. Perhaps a gigantic Mammoth based ship could get a lot more suborbital and cover more ground? Perhaps some big wings could give me more glide distance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 3: I\u0027ve looked at low-altitude rocket planes with landing gear and a Mk3 ISRU cargo bay. It does seem like the surface is smooth enough that low-speed landing and take-off is possible. But the mass is such that I\u0027m having trouble generating enough lift with something that could survive entry from orbit. Parts count and TWR with spikes seems marginal, craft profile with Mammoth is pretty unwieldy, maaaaybe a Mainsail could work but seems like it might have trouble taking off again at low elevations. But maybe - just maybe - I might get a plane to float around, get data from \u0022splashed-down\u0022 biomes, and rocket back to land? Most of the info I\u0027ve found on flying on Eve is very dated, based on Kethane, strictly about SSTOs, ion gliders, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 4 would seem to be wait a week for 1.0.5 and see how the mini-ISRU parts affect the economics of options 2 and 3, though I\u0027m concerned about the reported pickiness with low ore concentrations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: any thoughts on how best to explore the surface of Eve?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-08T00:07:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T04:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed that exploring Eve by rover is tedious, though if you\u0027re willing to put in a bit of time and choose site carefully, you can hit like 5 biomes within a radius of a hundred km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a rover that survives well at high physics warp: keep it as light as possible, the more mass it\u0027s carrying per wheel, the more explosion-prone it is.
