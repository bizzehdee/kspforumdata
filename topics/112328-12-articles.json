However, It is not the root cause of your problem.  \n\nI can see in your log that you have a vessel \u0022Dres 1\u0022 which has a freezer and frozen kerbals on-board, but when you go to the tracking station DeepFreeze cannot find the vessel in KSP memory. The root cause of why that is occurring is escaping me.  \n\nI found the following errors when you go to the tracking centre, which also indicates KSP has no memory of your vessels (this happens in your log before DeepFreeze starts having the same issues (can\u0027t find any vessels):  \n\n[EXC 15:52:43.093] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  \n\n    FloatingOrigin.setOffset (Vector3d refPos)  \n\n    FloatingOrigin.SetOffset (Vector3d refPos)  \n\n    PSystemSetup.SetTrackingStation ()  \n\n    PSystemSetup.OnLevelWasLoaded (Int32 level)  \n\n[EXC 15:52:44.185] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  \n\n    SpaceTracking.buildVesselsList ()  \n\n    SpaceTracking.Start ()  \n\n[EXC 15:52:44.187] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  \n\n    MapViewFiltering.CountVessels ()  \n\n    MapViewFiltering.Start ()  \n\n[EXC 15:52:46.111] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  \n\n    SpaceTracking.DrawGUI ()  \n\n    RenderingManager.OnGUI ()  \n\n[EXC 15:52:46.764] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  \n\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects\u002B\u003C\u003Ec.\u003Cupdateasteroid\u003Eb__8_0 (.Vessel v)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Linq.Enumerable\u002B\u003Ccreatewhereiterator\u003Ec__Iterator1D\u00601[Vessel].MoveNext ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[Vessel].AddEnumerable (IEnumerable\u00601 enumerable)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[Vessel]..ctor (IEnumerable\u00601 collection)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList[Vessel] (IEnumerable\u00601 source)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects.UpdateAsteroid (Kopernicus.Configuration.Asteroids.Asteroid asteroid, Double time)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects\u002B\u003Casteroiddaemon\u003Ed__10.MoveNext ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n    UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects:Start()\u003Cbr\u003E\n[EXC 15:52:47.005] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E\n    SCANsat.SCANcontroller.scanFromAllVessels ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n    SCANsat.SCANcontroller.Update ()\n\u003C/asteroiddaemon\u003E\u003C/createwhereiterator\u003E\u003C/updateasteroid\u003E\n\nIt\u0027s also happening when you exit flight back to the space center:  \n\n[ERR 15:52:14.431] [SurfaceObject]: Cannot return to original parent, it no longer exists.  \n\n[EXC 15:52:14.822] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  \n\n    CactEye2.CactEyeAsteroidSpawner.CalculateGlobalDiscoveryRate ()  \n\n    CactEye2.CactEyeAsteroidSpawner\u002B\u003Cdelayedstart\u003Ed__0.MoveNext ()\u003Cbr\u003E\nEXC 15:52:14.863] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects\u002B\u003C\u003Ec.\u003Cupdateasteroid\u003Eb__8_0 (.Vessel v)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Linq.Enumerable\u002B\u003Ccreatewhereiterator\u003Ec__Iterator1D\u00601[Vessel].MoveNext ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[Vessel].AddEnumerable (IEnumerable\u00601 enumerable)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[Vessel]..ctor (IEnumerable\u00601 collection)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList[Vessel] (IEnumerable\u00601 source)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects.UpdateAsteroid (Kopernicus.Configuration.Asteroids.Asteroid asteroid, Double time)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects\u002B\u003Casteroiddaemon\u003Ed__10.MoveNext ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n    UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Kopernicus.DiscoverableObjects:Start()\u003Cbr\u003E\n[EXC 15:52:17.173] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E\n    SCANsat.SCANcontroller.scanFromAllVessels ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n    SCANsat.SCANcontroller.Update ()\n\u003C/asteroiddaemon\u003E\u003C/createwhereiterator\u003E\u003C/updateasteroid\u003E\u003C/delayedstart\u003E\n\nI could fix the DeepFreeze errors, but the only way to do so would be to detect when this occurs and remove tracking of vessels that aren\u0027t in KSP memory. But the down side of that would be, in this example, that you would lose your frozen kerbals on \u0022Dres 1\u0022.  \n\nThe better thing to do here would be track down what is causing KSP to have no memory of your vessels.  \n\nSo I started looking, I found lots of errors from PlanetShine complaining about planet colors. But this seems to be of most interest and occur a lot:  \n\n[ERR 14:38:35.500] [SurfaceObject]: Cannot return to original parent, it no longer exists.  \n\nI\u0027m wondering if there is some issue with your Kopernicus/planets setup which is causing this issue.  \n\nI would recommend:   \n\nMake a copy of your install and eliminate mods Kopernicus and related and run a test game to see if you still get the problems.  \n\nSorry I can\u0027t be of more help, but I do believe there is much more evil going on here than a DeepFreeze error."},{"CreatedByName":"Judicator81","CreatedById":156023,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T09:57:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 30.12.2015 at 2:35 AM, JPLRepo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Do people still want to be able to freeze/thaw tourists?

Can\u0027t believe no one else has picked this up... including myself. I never tested the version TaranisElsu did, I just assumed it worked.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For anyone using TACLS:  \n\u003E **[.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112328-105-deepfreeze-continued-bug-squashing-v0202-27-jan-2016/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2329308)**[**Please go to this post (which I have updated**)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112328-105-deepfreeze-continued-bug-squashing-v0202-27-jan-2016/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2329308) You need to follow the instructions in that post.\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the response!  But, its still not working.  I did a full delete\u002Breinstall of the ThunderAerospace folder, version 11.2.1, and placed your dll in the TacLifeSupport folder.  Exact same behavior as before.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T07:09:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 07:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by IonMage**"}]}
