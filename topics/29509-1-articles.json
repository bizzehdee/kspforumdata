The first question that came up: If we want a single-seat capsule with a parachute, where to we put the docking port, and which do we use? Can\u0027t seem to find one small enough to fit on the nosecone - then, maybe the small capsule isn\u0027t meant to dock?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being the case, in any scenario, what are the standard docking parts used? I\u0027d like to just shoot an unmanned chunk of stuff into orbit (with a docking port of course) and then follow it up with something capable of docking to it and returing to Kerbin. I guess just knowing which ports are normally used, and where the typical mounting locations might be would be a great start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndrew\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ceauke","CreatedById":67898,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T14:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Andrew\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI JUST submitted a similar question. But I think I can help with your issue. It seems like the only things that can dock are CLAMP-O-TRONS. If it doesn\u0027t say that then it\u0027s not a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, for the Mk1 capsule, there are two ones that you can use, the shielded clampotron and the (regular) clampotron.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these are on the utilities group on the first page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, because you used the nose for docking, you\u0027ll need to use a different chute. On the utilities, page two, there is a Mk2-R radial mount chute right next to the nose cone chute. I\u0027ve used these successfully to save my poor kerbals after THEY failed miserable to dock with stuff that\u0027s not dockable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy rocketing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T14:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe jr docking clamp will fit the nose of the small capsule but, as far as I know, it will only dock with another jr port.

Since you can\u0027t move kerbals around without EVA, it doesn\u0027t really matter that there are fuel tanks in the middle.

Small clamps only clamp to other smalls, so I try to standardize medium clamps on all my designs so everything can dock with everything else. Large clamps are useful when docking large, full fuel tanks to space stations, or when docking parts of a spaceship being assembled in orbit that will undergo large amount of thrust compression or torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re planning on practicing docking in LKO(Low Kerbal Orbit), I recommend a vessel like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking port is located underneath the 1 man capsule, serving as a decoupler. When it has been launched into orbit, you can decouple the launcher stage(right click docking port)(you can put a probe on it to deorbit it, or just turn off persistent debris) and voila, you have a capsule with a parachute and a docking port!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen docking, you can right click the docking port itself and click \u0022Control from here\u0022 so that you can use it to line up your docking target on the navball. This particular design(200l of Monopropellant, and only 4 thrusters) has over 1000 Delta V just in the monopropellant stage, so you have plenty of fuel to rendezvous and to practice docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(tip for docking. . . before using the translation controls, make sure that your vessel is oriented with \u0022up\u0022(In this case, the capsule door and window) pointing to your screen\u0027s \u0022up\u0022, or your translation controls will be reversed, turned 90 degrees sideways, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck docking, and welcome to Kerbal Space Program! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
