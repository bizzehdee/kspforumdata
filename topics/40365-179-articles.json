The efficiency you see will sometimes go up when you timewarp because the reactor and generator will run at 100% until they have filled the Megajoules and ThermalPower bars, that takes a bit of time, after a while, when those bars are full, the reactor and generator will drop down to low percentages of their maximum power output - which produces much less heat and allows the radiators to cool. When the radiators cool down, you get much higher efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4%, however, is actually a bit lower than it should be possible due to a slight error with reactor temperatures in version 0.8 and I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll ever see lower than about ~10% efficiency in version 0.9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XanderTek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XanderTek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAwesome, that\u0027ll be a big help!

And my new joystick is a godsend lol. I use liquid fuel only(and its OP). You can build SSTO\u0027s with Fusion and Fission reactors, for career you will have a limited payload based on your reactor tech level. B9 is also vary helpful, since they have a few craft you can modify, the B9\u0027s are already strutted so they hold together better. I took the B9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for circularizing, you need to work your way up to 30Km and just build up speed once you get there, you need to be going atleast 1.8-2kms before you really start going up or your going to waste alot of fuel, its a very slow process and I usually don\u0027t switch over to LF until about 35 minutes into my flight, and I use very little. You also have to spam intakes... I also have mechjeb setup to tell me the drag on my craft, if its to high you will have issues. I also have Deadly Reentry so I try to keep my craft right at the verge of flame effects. The craft I posted above can get a 77T payload into 80km LKO and only use about 30LF.

The fact you can get into orbit with almost no fuel usage on intakes is nice, but then having insane ISP in vacuum is just a little to much lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-15T15:55:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2013 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Donziboy2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myrten","CreatedById":92200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T15:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been working on an electrical power display for your ships for version 0.9, it will give you information about the amount of power that your generators can supply, current power demands, net power and power utilisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also get a list of parts that are currently drawing power, how much they are drawing and potentially, for certain parts, information about what that part is doing with it.
