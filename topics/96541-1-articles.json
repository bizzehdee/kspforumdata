None of our existing members have any artistic ability whatsoever, and we very badly need someone who can make some Stockalike UI textures, such as for buttons and assorted UI \u0027greebling\u0027 (I\u0027m not sure what the relevant word is here, honestly). Existing examples in the stock game would be the \u0027recover vessel\u0027 and \u0027space center\u0027 buttons in the flight UI (not the pause menu), the \u0027Research\u0027 button in the research UI, the icons in the craft file browser window in the editor, or the New/Save/Load/Launch buttons in the editor. You don\u0027t need to worry about getting them in the game or even in any particular format.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific examples will come up, but you\u0027ll have a lot of design freedom.
