Best game purchase ever....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one question though: how I do plan efficient interplanetary trips? I have successfully landed at Duna, but it took me 2.5 years to get there. That seems a bit redundantly long (especially considering Earth-Mars trips take about 6-18 months, and Mars is far further from Earth than Duna is from Kerbin).
