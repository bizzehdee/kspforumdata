Most KSP crew compartments are small command pods, with a dedicated hatch separate from any docking ports that may be installed on the pod.\n\u003E \n\u003E In the case of large space station modules (such as those in my FusTek pack), these hatches would be located at the two ends of the compartment, where docking ports would also be located. If both ends are docked to other compartments, then the hatch would be inaccessible to mouse clicks, and so there\u0027s no point in having hatches there in the first place.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Well, why don\u0027t you move the hatch onto the side of the modules, away from the ends with the docking ports?**\n\u003E \n\u003E Many of these station modules are habitation areas, which are not intended to be depressurized on a regular basis. An airlock isn\u0027t just a door; it also includes a lockout chamber, bulkheads, life support, air pumps etc. Designing every single station module to also double as an airlock adds unneeded redundancy and complexity to each part. Besides, who would depressurize an entire space station just to let one astronaut go on a space walk?\n\u003E \n\u003E Another type of crew-habitable part that doesn\u0027t have hatches opening to the outside are crew tunnels.\n\u003E \n\u003E **If you don\u0027t want it to look like a hatch, just disguise the airlock / hatch collider as a window or panel!**\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s an extremely hacky workaround, and would give users the option of essentially teleporting Kerbals out through solid walls.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Kerbal Crew Manifest / Ship Manifest allows you to transfer crew directly without clicking on hatches.**\n\u003E \n\u003E I use SM on a regular basis, and it\u0027s a great add-on. Which is why I\u0027m asking for the stock crew transfer system to also be available by right-clicking on the pod itself.\n\n(Submitted as Feature #3489 on the SQUAD KSP bugtracker)\n\nEDIT: Bentley has also suggested that a Transfer (XFER) button be added to the crew portraits, alongside the existing IVA and EVA buttons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T02:16:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T02:47:50Z","Content":"I second this although I\u0027d rather see an extra button added to the crew portraits rather than right clicking on the pod.
