It\u0027s a real pain in the ass too. I spend a lot of time putting things EXACTLY where I want them. Then save the model. Then leave the vab and return and reload the model and all the offset parts are snapped back to their default positions. This of course screws up my fairings and looks crappy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a simple example. Look at the batteries and solar panels attached to the cubic struct and then pushed up into the bottom of the tank. Then look at them after saving, going out of the vab, re-entering the vab and re-loading the model. They cubic struct, and the parts attached have popped back out of the model to their default attach point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/x1Jv7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/x1Jv7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T23:37:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ctbram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T08:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to be a nag, but we really need some sort of reproduction steps for this. I play nearly stock (MJ and KAC) and I\u0027ve not had this problem. Is there something specific in your setup that you\u0027re doing?
