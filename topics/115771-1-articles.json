I only modeled my engine, but I want to download Unity now. The problem is that the download only wants to give me Unity 5. So, does someone have a Unity version that supports KSP and a part tool package for KSP 1.0.4? I will be very happy if someone can help me with this."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T08:35:19Z","Content":"Got to the [download archive](http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive), click on the 4.x tab under the paragraph of writing, download 4.6.4 (you can see KSP\u0027s unity version in the output\\_log.txt file) 4.2.2\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T08:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T08:47:31Z","Content":"no. You need to get 4.2.2 so you can animate the emission.

No need to get the .20 to \u0022install\u0022 first. Just drag the contents of the zip into the assets folder within the Unity project you create. Good luck!"}]}
