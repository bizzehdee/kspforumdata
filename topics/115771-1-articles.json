I only modeled my engine, but I want to download Unity now. The problem is that the download only wants to give me Unity 5. So, does someone have a Unity version that supports KSP and a part tool package for KSP 1.0.4? I will be very happy if someone can help me with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T08:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edownload archive\u003C/a\u003E, click on the 4.x tab under the paragraph of writing, download \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E4.6.4 (you can see KSP\u0027s unity version in the output_log.txt file)\u003C/span\u003E 4.2.2\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T08:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T08:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eno.
