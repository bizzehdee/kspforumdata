I feel like docking is a noobish way to play, I like 1 launch to anywhere. Anyways, how do I go about getting to Eeloo? Preferably returning, although I guess I could just stick some solar panels on the lander and call it a science base, but I want these people returning.

To go out to Eeloo and come back, assuming you land straight when coming back from Eeloo and don\u0027t bother with putting yourself in orbit, is going to take not more than 6500m/s. And you should be able to land and go back to orbit for about 2000m/s. So for one ship, you would need around 8500m/s, and that includes about 400m/s of error margin. Even though you want to do one launch, you could still use docking and sending a lander up at the same time as the crew module, this way you could leave the used lander in orbit and save some weight for the return on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"little square dot","CreatedById":42920,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T23:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no secret to it really... pack lots of fuel and build carefully.
