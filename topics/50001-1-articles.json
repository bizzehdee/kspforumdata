Since I had just about depleted the science in the Kerbin system, I didn\u0027t do any science till I was outside the SOI of Kerbin. At each of the following places, I did every experiment/report possible* and exhaustively transmitted it all back to Kerbin.* 1. In interplanetary space (in Kerbol\u0027s SOI) 2. In Duna\u0027s SOI high orbit 3. During braking maneuver in Duna\u0027s atmosphere, 4. Inside IKE\u0027s SOI/orbit 5. On IKE\u0027s surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*obviously I didn\u0027t do EVA reports during the braking maneuver at Duna. Also, the science gathered on IKE\u0027s surface was stored and recovered back on Kerbin\u0027s surface. It can be transmitted but I didn\u0027t want to spend the time doing it as the energy resources on the lander aren\u0027t as capable as the vessel as a whole is, I\u0027ll explain later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission:\u003C/strong\u003E Interplanetary voyage to Duna\u0027s moon Ike, return to Kerbin.

After rendezvous within 200m but before docking, both craft still had their circularizer engines \u0026amp; fuel tanks still attached with surplus fuel. I undocked the ILV from it\u0027s circularizer and then switched to the IKEL and docked it with the now undocked ILV circularizer tank and drained it of it\u0027s surplus fuel into the circularizer tank on the IKEL. Then I docked the top of the IKEL to the ILV and disabled the crossfeed on the docking ports between the two so the NERVAs wouldn\u0027t drain my lander. During my transfer burn to Duna using the NERVA engines, whenever the NERVA fuel tanks were about half I would transfer fuel from the docked circularizer on the prograde end of the ship to the NERVA tanks to keep more mass at the rear for stability. I still had some bit of fuel left in the circularizer after the transfer burn, I eventually decoupled it and the docking ports from the center engine on the lander after some adjustment burns as I neared Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s35.photobucket.com/user/trepidine/media/KSP/2013-10-21_00001.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/trepidine/KSP/2013-10-21_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-10-21_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighlighted here in blue is the \u0027circularizer\u0027 fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy current craft consisting of just the IKEL \u0026amp; ILV\u003C/strong\u003E, I set my Duna periapsis for 13.5km in a CCW/retrograde/West orbit for aerobraking.
