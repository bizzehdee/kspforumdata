Have a special sensor guide you loosely to it, but not directly to. Upon discovery, you are given a hint as to the next location. This goes on for a while, with a reward and hint at each monolith. Finally, when you reach the last monolith (orbiting the sun or something) you are given the coordinates to a previously hidden external star system with a single planet. An ultimate reward of some kind awaits you there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my humble opinion, it seems like a pretty good game play mechanic for campaign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(To avoid copyright, you could maybe replace the monoliths with prometheus-esque compounds or something cool that can be explored. Also, maybe make the star system campaign only? I\u0027d like to earn it rather than go straight to it.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T20:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley suggested that there should be hidden parts of a stargate like structure located randomly throughout the Kerbol system. If you collected them, dragged them back to KSC and put them together, that\u0027s how you\u0027d get from Kerbol to the other solar systems(if/when they come out with them, that is). Either that or doing science on all or most of the munolith type structures as a prerequisite for unlocking warp technologies at the very end of your research progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther people have suggested that they should just give you a big heap of science points for doing research at the various easter eggs. Some people think that defeats the purpose of having the easter eggs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other solar systems, they\u0027d said that there\u0027d be a couple of them that were predefined, with specific planets and what-not. Those would be the first solar systems you\u0027d travel to. Beyond them, there\u0027d be procedurally generated solar systems...I guess to encourage exploration and random stories that people come up with in games like this. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s still the plan, but I guess we\u0027ll find out eventually~\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T21:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this I like it alot.
