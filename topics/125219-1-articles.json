For instance, I know the MK1 and 2 Commmand Pods will naturally fall bottom first and that is good because that is where they have the most heat protection.

What can I do to make sure the heat shield I slap on the bottom is actually going to serve its function and the ship is not going to turn sideways or flip 180 and go nose first? I know an engine makes a great heatshield but I want to know ahead of time that I am not going to flip and burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T19:07:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 07:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Invader Jim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Muskrat","CreatedById":153467,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T18:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, you want the center of mass of the return vehicle to be as close to the heat shield as possible.
