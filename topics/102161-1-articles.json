I don\u0027t really like ISA MapSat which I find buggy and somewhat boring despite its usefulness.\n\nI have also always kept myself away from all the spoilers \u0026 lists with GPS locations I I would like to have a chance to discover those a bit more organically, i.e. throughout the normal course of the game.\n\nIs there a way to discover these without using ISA MapSat and without simply looking them up on Kerbalpdia ?\n\nThank you all for your help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T22:44:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sovnheim**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T20:16:28Z","Content":"Sometimes the science reports might give clues, especially if you have Community Sourced Science.\n\nWithout mods though, no clue."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T20:22:39Z","Content":"In stock KSP if you head off the runway at about a 45 degree angle you will run into one.

There are some really good ways of trying to find them but they are rare to just come across. The first way to find them in a non spoiler way is to go to [http://www.kerbalmaps.com/](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/) and show the anomolies(show location but not what is there. I suggest this one because you get a surprise after you look for the monument and find it). The second is to spend your time in very low (possibly) polar orbit looking for the 1 to 2 abnormal pixels of a easter egg (some are visible from orbit but really they are really hard to see). I don\u0027t suggest this, but you could just go out and look for an easter egg on one of the planets that contain them. I hope this helps\n\n- sbski"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovnheim","CreatedById":104593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T22:40:00Z","Content":"It does ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m going to go for the Kerbal Maps and try to go looking for them without additionnal guidance.

Each egg would give you a clue to help you find more.
