There\u0027s a lot of mods that try to address this but I have a theory that there\u00A0is a more subtle issue with career mode progression\u00A0than that. \u00A0Remember the old \u0027barn\u0027 tier of buildings that will be making a comeback in 1.1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, my view is this: there are some pretty significant non-part specific limitations at the beginning of the game because of the number of parts you are limited to, and the weight/size of your vessel. \u00A0It can be quite challenging\u00A0to cobble together 30 parts to make the trip to Munar orbit, let alone anywhere else. \u00A0Granted we all have different tolerances or preferences which\u00A0make this easier or harder\u00A0(I play on hard so science is quite grindy at the start),\u00A0but it seems to me those initial building restrictions posed by the launch pad and the vehicle assembly building are far more significant than a lack of part diversity. \u00A0I can build\u00A0a cluster of engines and fuel tanks that bypass a need for a mainsail, but only if I can cobble together enough parts to do it and get it in under weight. \u00A0In fact, the biggest benefit of unlocking some\u00A0parts early on is the ability to simplify otherwise ridiculous, yet still effective, designs. \u00A0Essentially while some parts do unlock new gameplay opportunities, many of them simply open routes of efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is basically the early game hump. \u00A0And I\u0027m not complaining. \u00A0That moment where I\u0027m on the cusp of getting somewhere but trying to get it in under budget, or running a mission to get science to unlocks parts that will let me do so, is where career \u0027feels\u0027 the best. \u00A0So for me, the issue is once you have enough money to unlock the expanded VAB and launch pad, the gating is pretty much over and it becomes science mode again. \u00A0The jump between 30 and 255 parts is pretty much endgame material\u2014you can build a ship to go anywhere with those restrictions, and later contracts give exponentially more rewards versus difficulty so money is really only an issue as long as you are stuck on Kerbin. \u00A0It seems, more than anything, this has the single largest\u00A0detrimental effect on the progression of career since, in my experience anyways, my first hurdle is literally to expand the VAB and launch pad and then that\u0027s it: hurdles over. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t matter what order you force the player to unlock parts in;\u00A0ingenuity will win the day. \u00A0The imposed size/weight/part budget is far more imposing, and I\u0027m really hoping another tier of buildings will help with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, and this goes a bit off my original topic but folds in nicely is I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing a couple other building gates. \u00A0The administration building goes mostly unused, and like I said: money is no issue once you get past Kerbin. \u00A0So why not crank up the part cost gradient and add in a part\u00A0discount to the admin building? \u00A0Or perhaps rather than gating science on the R\u0026amp;D, have it reduce the cost of nodes making it more attractive, and less mandatory, of an investment?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, these were just some thoughts I had this morning while playing and I wanted to share them with the community. \u00A0It looks like my ship is nearly in Munar orbit though, so I\u0027ll cut it off here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228967D888541B1E01FC54F62519C49ACC70FB1A6F\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/392174347966319660/8967D888541B1E01FC54F62519C49ACC70FB1A6F/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T18:43:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T18:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run pretty exclusivity career mode, my published and private games, so Ill wade in a little here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll agree with you that early game mass and part counts are the restrictions, and rightly so I wouldnt (even if I could) want my second flight to go to the Mun.

There is still a lot of my tree below that level that has not been researched but I want the large docking ports and the last of the science sensors before I go for lots of the other parts. I find it grindy if I go back to the same biomes on Minmus and Mun and I end up doing that a bit with the first interplanetary expeditions on their way to unlock the things I need for Jool and Eve exploration. My order for upgrading the complexes are astronaut complex to allow EVA first, pad to 140t limit 2nd, 7 contracts 3rd, tracking station to conic sections 4th, R\u0026amp;D complex to allow surface samples, then VAB to allow 255 parts - which is where I am at in my 1.0.5 career with my desire to get the big docking ports (hey anyone want to invent 3.75m docking ports?) and science sensors before I send my first kermanned\u00A0interplanetary missions (an unmanned one is already on the way to Duna/Ike on a fast orbit using my first nuclear engines), then I will want to remove the 140t weight limit at the launch pad. \u00A0Oddly enough one of the things that makes early career grindy for me is trying to do things in the least amount of elapsed Kerbal time, so I don\u0027t accelerate time as much as I could and rather fill that time with tasks that start to feel a little grindy as they advance my science and funds a little more slowly than just following the interplanetary adventures would. But that is simply a choice of how I like to play the game and not a complaint about the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must say the new contracts that ask you to follow up with existing stations, probes, science surveys have helped make it seem less grindy.
