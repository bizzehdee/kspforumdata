In this phase, developers generally test the software using white-box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black-box or gray-box techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as alpha release.\n\u003E Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. In general, external availability of alpha software is uncommon in proprietary software, while open source software often has publicly available alpha versions. The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. **At this time, the software is said to be feature complete.**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Beta, named after the second letter of the Greek alphabet, is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as betaware. Beta phase **begins when the software is feature complete** but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software, as well as speed/performance issues and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T12:05:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Welp, a Certain forum group is up in arms over an update again, looks like the forums are no-longer the \u0027Best Community\u0027 on the internet anymore, then again, they haven\u0027t been since 1.0 was announced...\n\u003E With regards to the announcement, I think it\u0027s a good thing, the games reach will expand once again, to the reach of the non-PC gamer, I know a friend who will be interested, as he doesn\u0027t have a decent PC, only every PlayStation under the sun...\n\nSo criticizing something we think is a bad idea is being completely up in arms??\n\nAnd for your information we who warned about the last updates were completely proven correct.

I\u0027ve got nearly 200 hours in stock without even KER. Anything that can be done to increase the audience for something that promotes space exploration is OK with me.

They have made a really special game and I look forward to seeing it grow even more in the years to come.\n\nI don\u0027t own a PS4...but consider me all aboard the Hype Train for this one!"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:34:48Z","Content":"So I\u0027ll preface my arguments with two statements:\n\n1) I\u0027m not personally interested in this. I feel the PS4 doesn\u0027t offer enough that the PC lacks, and I also have a strong antipathy towards Sony that means I avoid buying their products.\n\n2) I\u0027m assuming the *good-case scenario*. That is, that the PS4 port has some time and effort put into making it good, that relevant development such as performance improvement is shared between PS4 and PC versions, and that compromises needed for the PS4 version are not forced on the PC version.\n\nI\u0027ll grant the second one there is pretty bold. The company Squad have contracted-out the port to haven\u0027t worked on games for the mainstream consoles since the PS2. Contracting out the port at all probably restricts the code sharing between PS4 and PC versions.\n\nWith that out of the way, I feel Kerbal Space Program could work very well on the PS4.\n\n**Controls**\n\nThe most commonly raised objection but I don\u0027t really see it as a problem. Considering flight, a keyboard is hardly an ideal control method being limited to binary on/off inputs and yet most players manage just fine. I\u0027ve played KSP using a controller and for planes it\u0027s an absolute joy, far far better than using the keyboard. For rockets it\u0027s fine too. There are enough buttons for all the core functions. Now some of the ancillary stuff will be trickier, things like locking individual engine gimbals and so on, but I see no reason the developers can\u0027t solve that. Perhaps a menu-based system, perhaps using the PS4\u0027s touchpad, perhaps something else.\n\nFor the editor, again the current controls are deeply flawed. We\u0027re trying to manipulate things in a 3D environment using a 2D input device and it not infrequently causes trouble. Try moving a rocket to exactly where you want it in the VAB, or attaching an engine to a central tank and not the six tanks surrounding it, and we\u0027re liable to have problems. Now with a controller the player can have direct 3D inputs, with buttons or thumbsticks for up/down, left/right, and in/out, and all the problems that using a mouse brings go away. Done well the VAB on PS4 could be in some ways better than what we have now.\n\nThen the control improvements needed to make the game work well on PS4 can be backported to the PC version, giving us PC players the best of both worlds with the possibility to combine a controller or joystick with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nUltimately the assumption that the PS4 controls are going to be bad is an argument from ignorance. Just because you can\u0027t imagine how the controls would work well, doesn\u0027t mean they cannot possibly work well.\n\n**Performance**\n\nThis is a fair concern but I feel the developers will overcome it. KSP is going to need some serious optimizations to run well on the PS4, which it will get, not least because neither Sony nor PS4 gamers will be impressed with a lagfest. I expect Squad are reasonably confident those optimizations can be made when they announced the PS4 port, and I also expect they\u0027ll make it back to the PC version. Best-case scenario, for PC players lag is a thing of the past unless you go in for truly huge builds.\n\n**Mods**\n\nIf there aren\u0027t mods for the PS4 version it\u0027s obviously a big minus to that version, but I doubt it will hurt the commercial success on PS4 much. After all I expect the typical KSP PS4 version buyer is someone who can\u0027t play the PC version anyway. On the other hand it will probably encourage Squad to make the stock game better, and add features that previously they were happy to \u0022leave\u0022 to mods because those features need to be stock to be on PS4. Then the stock game is made better on PC too.\n\n**Rushed development?**\n\nI said from ages ago the move to \u00221.0 full release\u0022 was a business decision not one based on the development progress. I don\u0027t believe it was just down to the PS4 port plans though. There were many other factors that could have influenced Squad, such as the increasingly poor reputation of Steam \u0022Early Access\u0022 or the desire to get the game in other storefronts. In any case KSP isn\u0027t a traditional release-and-done game, development is ongoing and the numbers mean nothing really."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:36:05Z","Content":"I don\u0027t get the hate.
