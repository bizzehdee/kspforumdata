That does not work... the best defense in the world is to simply have a player sitting in the base in question. Makes it practically immortal. It will respawn if hit, parts that are shot off are not registered as such, the base will twitch, jump, teleport and do weird stuff in the most horrible ways, a true possession by the Kraken. For the attacking player of course, the base is in reality untouched. Making the entire attack wasted. And don\u0027t even try missiles, the base targeted will simply disappear. And MAYBE reappear after your missile has lost all lock, is destroyed, out of range or something like that. Heck, it will disappear without missiles too! And when it reappears, it\u0027s a new copy that you do not have targeted, possibly in an entirely new location! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttacking unmanned bases with guard mode/lag defenses are better, a little bit like single player honestly. Only somebody else actually built and set it all up. Which is cool. Like the old switching saves, but it isn\u0027t necessarily turn-based, a bit easier, can be more spontaneous, like scenarios and stuff will pop up as you go. So it works if you do it like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
