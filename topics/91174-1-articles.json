We all know the rocket mode (closed cycle) is very bad unless you absolutely need the acceleration (its similar ISP to a LVT-30/45, a tad worse but also lighter engine, with a hair less thrust to boot). So could someone here come up with say a chart or some tips as to what craft if any actually benefit from rapier use (im talking about efficiency). Or is it best to stick with a jet and a 909/nuke dual engine setup? RAPIERS ofc make more sense for SSTOs that have no intention of flying in kerbin/laythe atmo much, as then they arent 100% dead weight, and do help landing on some planets that have too much gravity for say a single nuke to cut it (jets are useless outside of kerbin/laythe).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-24T22:16:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2014 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaredkzr","CreatedById":73023,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T21:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantage to the RAPIER engines is that you only have to put 1 engine on rather than 2. This saves weight and can help smaller craft reach orbital speeds. If your building larger SSTOs for interplanetary travel then dual nukes is probably the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T22:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just design what I feel like.

And i like the utility, albeit i COULD get away with turbojets, and older versions of this did use those, before i ofc got into landing on duna ect, since outside of landing on planets that arent kerbin/laythe, the jets are just better. Gotta try a minimalistic design though, as ive recently learned that low isp isnt always that bad (a super small vessel will actually have less dV using nuke then say 1 lv909, provided its so lightweight that the nuke is like 1/2 the total mass ect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T22:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you can check out all my plane designs in my sig, but this was one of the biggest examples where a RAPIER was the only choice.

As a result, you need 18.4% more jet engines in a RAPIER-powered craft than in a turbojet-powered craft. The turbojet requires 15.6% more intake air at 100% throttle than the RAPIER, but if you throttle the turbojet down to 84.4%, the engines are essentially the same. Both engines have the same Isp at the same altitude, and the velocity curves (the ratios of actual thrust to nominal thrust) are also the same until 2000 m/s. Above that speed, the RAPIER loses thrust faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your intakes/mass ratio is low enough that you have to switch to rockets before reaching 2000 m/s (surface speed), the turbojet is asymptotically more efficient in reaching orbit than the RAPIER, if there are at most 0.22 tonnes of rocket engines per turbojet. This assumes that the vacuum Isp of the rocket engine is 360 s. Changing the specific impulse shifts the crossover point slightly. With more intakes, the situation becomes more favorable to the turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, actual spacecraft use an integral number of engines. If the craft can fly with the same amount of turbojets and RAPIERs, the RAPIER can be more efficient, because it doesn\u0027t need separate rocket engines. On the other hand, if the craft needs more RAPIERs than turbojets, the situation can be more favorable to the turbojet than in the asymptotic case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T01:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut me firmly into the RAPIER camp.
