Probably what you could do is go ahead and build the bottom part first - the adapter with the ports - then take it off your stack, flip it over and set it aside. Go ahead then and build the upper part - adapter, engine, decoupler, port - then grab the bottom part and stick it on. The ports give you the connection; the decouplers let you slough the whole thing off as normal.
