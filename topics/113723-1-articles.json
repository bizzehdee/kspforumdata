I noticed the over 4-1 Real-to-game second ratio when I was flying a behemoth of a jet across for a survey. I will try to analyze the true FPS tonight, all I can say now is on launch a non-tiny ship causes very blocky performance. I expected this as the laptop is a utility pc and not built for graphics.
