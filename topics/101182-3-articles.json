Just.. thank you. Job done. A bit sad that the fairing bases are fixed sizes (this is going to limit them considerably, for larger builds) but I suspect I understand the reasons. Leveraging the tweakable code to have a single base that can confirm to additional sizes may have been a different approach; I don\u0027t know if you considered that?\n\nI imagine, again, there were reasons.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mike (Mu): I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been ploughing on with the re-entry and aerodynamic heating effects.\n\nIf I had a child (which is best not to contemplate) I\u0027d probably name it after you (this is why it was best not to contemplate).

The .90 release wasn\u0027t a true beta, look at how many new systems are planned for the next release. I am glad that Squad is much more committed to testing this time around than with previous releases and I\u0027m hoping for the best, but I\u0027m still a little worried with all the new systems being added in this cycle that a major bug/balance issue will still slip through.\n\nSquad is already planning on iterating on the concept for the forseeable future, which is perfectly acceptable, nobody complains about getting new features. The thing is, the 1.0 release is what gets all the attention and is what all the reviews are based on, few reviewers will ever play the game again after 1.0 so it needs to rock solid without any major issues.
