This rating system can have multiple criteria. For example, you can rate the stability, features and \u0027fun factor\u0027 of the mod.\n\nHere\u0027s my question. Considering that even .dll plugins like Firespitter and Advanced Texture Management would be right beside mods like B9 and LLL what criteria would you use to rate all mods so that they each have an even chance of a good rating (yea, I know they\u0027re completely different but different ratings for different types of mods are out of the picture for the moment.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:18:43Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think a numerical rating will be terribly helpful (on 5-point scales, it\u0027s the 1 and 5 that get used most frequently anyway). \u0022What percent of users think that this mod meets (or doesn\u0027t meet) some criterion?\u0022 is also tricky, because those criteria can be pretty nebulous, and they won\u0027t all matter to every user. If you\u0027re looking to make a central location for recommendations and opinions, something like \u0022do you use (or not use) this mod, and why?\u0022 might be a better basis for discussion.\n\nIf you\u0027re just looking for criteria, though, here are some of mine:\n\n- Stability -- not so much \u0022unchanging\u0022 as \u0022unlikely to cause trouble with KSP (or another mod)\u0022.\n- Exposes information and improves my control over the game and my vehicles.\n- Provides the capacity and a reason to do more \u0022stuff\u0022 (this is the really nebulous one -- think AntennaRange to give me a reason to make communication networks, USI stuff for colony building, SpaceY for launching colonies...)."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T04:11:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - Stability -- not so much \u0022unchanging\u0022 as \u0022unlikely to cause trouble with KSP (or another mod)\u0022.\n\u003E - Exposes information and improves my control over the game and my vehicles.\n\u003E - Provides the capacity and a reason to do more \u0022stuff\u0022 (this is the really nebulous one -- think AntennaRange to give me a reason to make communication networks, USI stuff for colony building, SpaceY for launching colonies...).\n\nThanks Kerbas for taking a moment to give some feedback. Unfortunately, the best way I\u0027ll be able to provide the visitors with some actual feedback is with the 1-5 system. And it seems my thinking pretty much follows yours, with a couple of additions.\n\nHere\u0027s the ones I\u0027ve come up with so far:\n\nStability \n\nFeatures \n\nVisuals (if applicable) \n\nFun Factor\n\nOverall\n\nThe system I\u0027m sorta stuck with (nothing better atm) does use a weighing system. I\u0027ll most likely give the \u0027overall\u0027 a 50% influence in the final rating."}]}
