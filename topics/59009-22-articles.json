Any ship I attach them to experiences a weird bug where shortly after launch at about 6-7km my ship flies away from the camera as though a part broke. Instead what\u0027s happening is the center of mass is moving further and further behind my rocket and it picks up some serious speed as it does so. This causes even slightly touching the controls to make my G forces meter go haywire since the distant rocket tries to move around this way off center of mass. It gets so bad that after my first stage simple things like decoupling cause the rocket to disintegrate from the G forces and pieces go flying away at insane speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas what that could be?
