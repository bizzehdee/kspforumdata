These 2 launches would assemble in Minmus orbit. This final rocket would contain 1 survey sattelite, 4 communication relay satelites, lander module,\u00A0a Science lab, Mining Rig, transport tug, and a orbital fuel depot, Essentially the \u003Cstrong\u003Ekitchen sink\u003C/strong\u003E of rockets. I\u0027d refuel said rocket in Minmus orbit(from existing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E setup)\u00A0and then launch for Duna at the appropriate time. Mid-transfer i\u0027d uncouple the survey scanner and it would boost it\u0027self into a polar orbit and then shortly after the 4 communication relays would uncouple and boost themselves into orbit as well. Mining Rig would head to Ike with the tug following into Ike orbit\u00A0and the Fueldepot(orange tank)/Science Lab\u00A0would orbit around duna to facilitate refuling lander which would land on duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is, does it make sense to do this as 1 mammoth rocket, or do i do seperate launches from Kerbin/Minmus.

I have calculated ephemeries to figure out when to eject from Minmus, but I still don\u0027t get the full savings from the dive. Part of the problem is that Minmus is inclined to your launch orbit, so it might be necessary to start out with a high periapsis, adjust inclination, and then lower periapsis for full effect. The savings might not be phenomenal, but part of the fun in KSP is setting up and executing complicated maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
