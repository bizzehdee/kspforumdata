I won\u0026#39;t point fingers, because at some point, everyone in that section, including myself, has done some sort of roleplaying. However, we haven\u0026#39;t had any incidents in nearly a year. Most of us just want to build things, and enjoy the collaboration of working in a group. Like any group, there were a few bad eggs. [/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#333333]I know that my voice has no meaning to them. Heck, after the past few days, I don\u0026#39;t think any of the Rocket Builders have a voice anymore. The writing is on the wall, and I doubt anything can change it. So, to any mods or staff members who see this, I have one thing to say: I hope you\u0026#39;re happy. You have alienated several upstanding community members, people who have been kind and helpful on this forum for years, people who loved KSP and this forum with a passion I have never seen; your actions have driven them away for good, and angered many more by showing them that their voices are meaningless. I know it\u0026#39;s your forum at the end of the day, and I understand that you can manage it as you wish; but please, don\u0026#39;t push so many away for the actions of a few.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#333333]I have loved this forum from the day I logged in. The community here is the kindest, most brilliant group I have ever been part of. I love it here, but I cannot abide what is being done. I will not beg or plead for the Rocket Builders to be saved, but if this plan is implemented, know that it will tarnish the image of SQUAD permanently, both in my eyes and the eyes of many others.[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s literally just the discontinuation of a low-activity subforum.
