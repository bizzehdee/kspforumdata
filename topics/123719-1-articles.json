While uncompressed textures are pretty and all, they do sort of inflate the memory footprint of a mod, and increase it\u0027s fill rate requirement. I\u0027d much rather make them pre-compressed when the compression doesn\u0027t interfere with visuals too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD\u0027s compression tools are all for Windows only, although I\u0027m going to see if there is a Linux version included with their big SDK. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t been able to find any Open Source ones, likely because of the patented nature of the S3TC algorithm, and the fact that nobody wants one that can just use the newer compression formats that are not patented, and certainly nobody wants to use the S2TC compression algorithm version that sacrifices quality to avoid the S3TC patents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ed Gauss","CreatedById":110895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T23:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI run Arch, and this is one I use: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ducakar/img2dds/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/ducakar/img2dds/releases\u003C/a\u003E.
