I mean in theory they could edit the SPH and VAB models so that the inside of them is part of the model and have rocket building take place there, but that would take so much effort I think it\u0027s something that should be done during the beta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T23:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAICT, doing this would take a significant change to the way lighting works in the editor scenes, so I wouldn\u0027t expect it \u003Cem\u003Esoon\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T04:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be amazingly easy to solve this issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust close the doors.

Old scenes had a directional light acting as a sun, so terrain stretching into the horizon was evenly lit and shadows of the building were coarse and sharp. We didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want such a view to spoil things outside of our beautiful interior, so another trick is used. Instead of uniformly distributed directional sunlight I create a spotlight, much similar to ones you have in the part list, but with much higher intensity and extreme effective range, around 1000 meters. This spotlight is then used to illuminate the exterior outside of the doors. The circular nature of it is not visible with the very narrow field we have available looking through the doors, so the whole thing looks like real sun is producing a very soft shadow of the building and the light is softly fading away into the fog in the distance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds exactly like that ineed ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leilders","CreatedById":57966,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T20:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut you forget the windows!
