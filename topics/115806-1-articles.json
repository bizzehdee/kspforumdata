I was able to track the functionality down to this source-code file:\n\n[https://github.com/BlackNecro/PartCatalog/blob/master/Source/GUIEditorControls.cs](https://github.com/BlackNecro/PartCatalog/blob/master/Source/GUIEditorControls.cs)\n\nThe functionality was basically that while the mouse was in the red marked region, I was able to switch to the other part-pages by using the mouse wheel, instead of clicking on the \u0022next page\u0022 button:\n\n![ySFT9Qy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ySFT9Qy.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T19:12:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mhoram**"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T19:07:24Z","Content":"You want the excellent QuickScroll:\n\n[Kerbalstuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/436/QuickScroll)\n\n[Forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95168)"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T19:09:51Z","Content":"Great.
