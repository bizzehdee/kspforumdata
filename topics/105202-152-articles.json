I had 2 \u0022normal\u0022 kerbonauts - who ran out of supplies and habitat comforts whilst orbiting Gael.  I docked with them with a supply ship and kept getting spammed to say they were homesick and refusing to work and defaulted to their \u0022tourist\u0022 state.  I transferred them to the new supply ship and bought them home along with Bob who was also a tourist.  When they returned to Gael they are still showing as tourists and not reverting to their previous state of engineer and scientist. Bob reverted to his previous scientist state on the way home. I have sent them back out on another mission as tourists - but they still remain as tourists.  They have now been stationed at Gael for several days and still remain as tourists.  I have tried to find the answer by scanning this thread as to whether this is the way that it is supposed to work for normal kerbs that once a tourist always a tourist, but can\u0027t find my answer - or if it is indeed a bug, or a clash with perhaps the colonists mod where I am spawning farmers/colonists/biologists etc - and maybe the LS mod doesn\u0027t work with Colonists mod.

This will list your current supplies usage, how long it\u0027s expected to last, etc. as well as both habitation and home time.  If they actually get homesick, you\u0027ll get a notice directly on the screen, saying they\u0027ve refused to work.\n\n2: Assuming they\u0027ve been returned to Kerbin and haven\u0027t already, try launching them in a ship.  (Any ship, just get them out of the astronought complex and onto the launchpad/runway.)  Often that gives them the nudge to reset, and you can then reclaim the ship.  If that doesn\u0027t work - and they went Tourist with an older version of the mod - go into your persistence file and edit their profession back to whatever it was; you got caught by a bug that\u0027s believed to have been fixed, but the fix wasn\u0027t retroactive.

I have a Minmus base with plenty of hab time and supplies and about 20 Kerbals there, but its a complete lag fest.  I think its a mixture of using MKS and K\u0026K base parts, and especially the \u0022transparent pods\u0022 feature (which can lag you even if turned off).  I don\u0027t have any mods that mess with Kerbals other than the contract configurator for tourism (maybe?).  So I decide to scrap the base by bringing back kerbals on a space available basis from other missions that pass by...once empty I\u0027ll try again without the craziness.  \n\nI land and suddenly one of them is freaking out and made himself into a tourist...ok, he gets on the ship first, and I load up 3 other random ones.  Those 3 were fine when I put them on board.  After reaching low Minmus orbit, all 4 had become tourists...and stayed tourists all the way home...and are still tourists.  Not the most useful report because I can\u0027t pinpoint the exact moment I noticed they were all 4 tourists, but I can say that I just started playing again 2 weeks ago and never used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E or MKS before that.\n\n3 of us in the last few hours or so...just thinking the only thing I updated was Wild Blue Tools recently.

And the crew transport will only need to handle transit time\u002Bsafety margin, as hab time is per-vessel and home-time is based on the best vessel(aka base).

Obviously the goal of life support is so players don\u0027t end up letting this timer run out, but accidents do happen, especially when running a part failure mod. Like with Apollo 13 and the Martian, I think Kerbals should have an option to work the problem and stretch their supplies until they find a solution. \n\nWhat I would propose is a toggle to enable the crew of a vessel to enter Emergency Mode. This would extend life support and hab times by a multiplier in exchange for a large loss in crew experience levels and reputation. Just like Apollo 13, the crew would lose efficiency and capability on their mission in return for making it home alive. Plus the reputation bonus should dissuade players from just turning it on to maximize mission time.\n\nThis is just an idea I had, it is by no means a request and I am not good enough at coding to make this myself ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T04:50:13Z","Content":"The fifteen day grace period for supplies already represents them stretching things (burning oxygen candles, etc.). ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nUnrelated - working on the next release and this will include a few adjustments to hab caps that make Scouts/Pilots more balanced, and also makes long-distance voyages easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Merkov","CreatedById":165068,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T05:08:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Doing a quick drive by.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When comparing a Hitchiker to a Tundra don\u0027t forget to account for machinery mass.

Having to balance volume vs mass makes sense, and I would be interested to know how you came to that (when you have a chance, of course). With regards to machinery, though, I don\u0027t think Kerbitats use machinery, so the example provided by dboi88 is a good example:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, dboi88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Nils277](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/122414-nils277/) [@tsaven](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138869-tsaven/) The more i look the less i understand. Small tundra Kerbitat has 2.41 months per ton, Large Kerbitat has 6.8 months per ton and the hitchhiker has 8.4 months per ton.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My best guess at this stage is that they\u0027re is something else entirely that\u0027s being included in the balance figures.\n\u003E \n\nKerbitats are handy to look at because they don\u0027t need material kits to inflate or machinery to operate. DStaal mentioned that habitation bonuses require EC usage, but as Nils277 pointed out, taking EC usage into account doesn\u0027t explain the perceived imbalance either:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, Nils277 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This does not add up too... the small tundra Kerbitat has 2.41 months per ton and uses 0.495 EC/sec and the large Kerbitat has 6.8 months per ton and uses 1.925. So here the number of EC per hab month is relatively equal \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But the hitchhiker has 8.4 months per ton and uses only 0.525 EC/sec so it is way more powerful.\n\u003E \n\nNow, looking at the small Tundra inflatable habitat, it has a dry mass of 1.875t, requires 1000 MaterialKits for expansion (side note: from what I can tell, resources have a defined density, not a defined mass. MaterialKits have a density of 0.001, which I assume means each has a mass of 0.001 t. If that is incorrect, then all of my following numbers are wrong and I apoligise.) which is 1t, plus 500 Machinery, which is 1.89 t, plus 0.495 EC/s to operate. In exchange, you get 19.8 months of hab time. So that\u0027s 19.8 months divided by 4.765t which equals 4.155 months per t for 0.495 EC/s, which still seems underpowered compared to the stock hitchhiker.\n\nOne thought I had in the KPBS thread was that maybe making the hitchhiker so powerful is necessary for those using bare \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS without MKS, since your options for hab parts are limited and anyone who wants to send a kerbal to Duna would like a vessel that is not 90% hitchhikers. If this is the case, perhaps MKS should add machinery as a requirement to the hitchhiker when it is installed?\n\nOf course, if you actually have it all balanced using a different metric, then maybe nothing needs to change, but some clarification would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!"}]}
