It\u0027s not the dead people governing so much as their laws and aspirations are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was pondering on how to create scifi space opera without violating the lightspeed limit and came up with the following below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a scifi scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTranspace Warp drive: Translates space past starship at the max speed of light speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTimeporter: All starships carry them onboard. Seems like a teleporter pad but actually transports you forward through time instantly on the same spot on the teleporter pad. That is how crew can travel years at lightspeed without aging. You can also travel back in time, but not further back than the date of timeporter\u0027s activation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fun trick is that it helps the ship avoid fatal collisions by foretelling the future, since if you cannot timeport to a future date it means the ship must have been destroyed by colliding with something huge while warping at lightspeed or in some other way. So you adjust ship\u0027s heading until you can make successful timeports with random items, and then send crew after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmpire Control: Using timeporters aboard starships is how they keep control over a vast interstellar empire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the past governs the future, and it is not everyday that a starship bothers to travel home to see the future.

Because not only will branching timelines occur when someone uses a machine to go into the past, but naturally occur whenever anyone does anything. Because time doesn\u0027t just exist like a line with branches going out, in fact time isn\u0027t really real at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole \u0022branching realities\u0022 thing needs to assume that somewhere at some point in space anything that ever existed still exists, and always exists.

Because not only will branching timelines occur when someone uses a machine to go into the past, but naturally occur whenever anyone does anything.
