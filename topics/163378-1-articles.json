I made a copy of my back up so that I can perform a test on a fresh and clean copy. I started a sandbox game, built a simple plane flew west and north of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I flew quite far away, spent some time flying very close to the ground, landed and saved and reloaded. All this time, I have not seen a single tree. I had ground scatters on, scatter density at\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E100%, and ground textures at high.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhat can be the problem?
