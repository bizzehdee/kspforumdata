That said, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if Making History or other upcoming releases took this in hand - I have seen a few dev posts this year that seemed encouraging. For the most part, modders do a great job of making their parts sit well with the stock game, but the devs hold all the cards when it comes to how \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the parts balance with each other and what the visual themes and standards are for everything else to match up to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second is in breakthrough changes in core functionality - not changing what the game looks like or tweaking the way it does what it already does, but making it do newer more various things. Examples would be multiplayer, flowing water, surface excavation, lavafields, or floating ice-caps. Mods that do this (if they ever even can) will always seem cobbled together and flakey, but the dev team have options to change the code in ways that modders fundamentally don\u0027t. I don\u0027t feel too much of this is likely tho - the amount of work to make any one of those example features happen seems prohibitive even to a layman like me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
