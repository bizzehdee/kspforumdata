I\u0027m good at most of the game, although 1.0\u002B aero did have a learning curve. I general play career mode just to see how it\u0027s progressing. I generally haven\u0027t flown planes, except in sandbox. I use KER and KAC. MJ was helpful for a time. \n\nHopefully I can be an asset to the Forum. \n\nI have enjoyed learning from the members and the youtubers. \n\nThanks, I hope to pay it forward.\n\nHave Fun!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T04:53:59Z","Content":"Hello AlanP and welcome to the forum. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T22:55:07Z","Content":"Hello Alan! 1.0 certainly brought some changes, but I\u0027m glad to hear you\u0027ve been playing for a while.
