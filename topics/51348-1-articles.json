The biggest difference is heating. Not only is there much more kinetic energy in the gas you encounter, but a lot more of that energy ends up deposited in the fuselage. This will mostly affect the leading edges, but it does factor into how you can use control surfaces as well. One of the consequences is that a hypersonic aircraft will not have quite such sharp leading edges as a supersonic one. Think wings and nose of the Space Shuttle compared to something like a Concorde. This helps create a protective normal shock in front of the leading edge as well as spread heat over larger area. A sharp leading edge would start overheating at these speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other obvious effect is change in overall desirable geometry for the aircraft. As I mentioned above, containing your aircraft inside the shock wave is a good idea, and at Mach 5\u002B the envelope is going to be narrower than at 3\u002B. It\u0027s also not worth it trying to generate secondary shocks, generally. So unlike the 3\u002B (think SR-71 Blackbird here) you won\u0027t get many sharp features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all the other requirements are pretty much the same. You still have to deal with shock waves anywhere an edge enters a supersonic stream, and you still want to ensure that there is a subsonic boundary layer on your lifting surfaces and control surfaces or you won\u0027t get much use out of them due to separation. The transition, however, is still only around Mach 1. There are no special transitions at higher numbers, so calling a flow a hypersonic rather than a supersonic one is somewhat arbitrary. The physics is much the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: For more details on how things are actually done in practice, take a look at Boeing X-51. It addresses most of the questions raised here. It is capable of Mach 5, and it does use control surfaces rather than rely on thrust vectoring alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T05:56:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"victory143","CreatedById":80787,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T14:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhaa?
