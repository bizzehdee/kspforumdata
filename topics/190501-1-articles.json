So, for anyything other than orbital delivery, I\u0027ll probably use rockets. It\u0027s easier to build a bigger rocket for a heavier payload than to reinvent the wheel with a new spaceplane whenever your current design can\u0027t handle the increased payload mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the long term, though, I\u0027ll probably go for something of a mix between starship concepts and spaceshuttle: vertical, booster-assisted takeoff, gliding during reentry and then a vertical landing.
