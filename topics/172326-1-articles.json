The rocket entered orbit, staged twice leaving with a manned pod and the container containing the rover. I then switched to piloting the rover, with the drill and ore container, etc... I sent that down, and after much difficulty got it deployed UPRIGHT from it\u0027s container and ready to go... I then landed the manned pod and EVA\u0027d Bill over the rover and, for the next half hour wondered why the hell the LZ was down in the valley and not up on the mesa where it should have been... This is the first time I\u0027ve ever used that command seat so I\u0027m like =\\ about it... The much celebrated cupola module is excellent for rovers but absolutely senseless for bases and stations -- grumble grumble...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I get the rover up there and found I couldn\u0027t make the drill work because I had a broken mod that I couldn\u0027t fix mid-flight like this so I gave my self 3U of ore by editing save.\u00A0 The problem seems to be that even though the mission demands a rover, it expects the rover to be the main flight so everything seems to be locked to the identity of the command pod, which is still down in the valley, and has no drill, and no ore container. (when I go ore mining I bring the biggest drill I can carry, on the biggest rover I can launch with the biggest tank that can be put on wheels, etc, but yeah, this rover is kinda cute.. The rover is directly above the magical X but it is stuck on \u0022go to digging spot\u0022... =\\\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
