Exploding rockets and designing bizarre planes is fun but once you learn basic rocket design and orbital mechanics you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emay feel the urge to do something more purposeful. The KGSS tries to inject real (or hypothetical) science into your space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emissions.

Through the use of community designed mods, the KGSS has mapped the surface of Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus. The KGSS, through the efforts of volunteers, can now offer 2d and 3d contoured topographic maps of KSP celestial bodies. Who would have thought! The KGSS also provides a \\\u0027name this feature\\\u0027 register for those that wish to name prominent landmarks (rules apply). We\\\u0027ll also offer hypothetical scientific missions for you to try something you probably would not even consider doing normally. For those that are interested, the KGSS will offer articles on real Kerbal science like topographic maps, Kerbin air density, exploration, flight dynamics and more.

These two projections have less severe distortion than the Equidistant Cylindrical Projection, especially near the poles. The colour also increases the altitude resolution because gray scales are limited to a resolution of just 256.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy maps have some slight artefacts that result from my altitude interpolation algorithm (I will work on improving the algorithm), but otherwise the two maps seem to be very comparable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas stuff like this been done for Kerbal yet?
