Exploding rockets and designing bizarre planes is fun but once you learn basic rocket design and orbital mechanics you\n\nmay feel the urge to do something more purposeful. The KGSS tries to inject real (or hypothetical) science into your space\n\nmissions. You can fly around the Mun just because it\\\u0027s there (which is fun!) or you can fly around the Mun on a hypothetical\n\nKGSS sponsored surface mapping mission. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) The KGSS encourages imagination, the application of real world science and the\n\ncontinual push for discovery to help you expand your enjoyment of KSP.\n\nAnyone can participate in the fun the KGSS offers. The goals of the KGSS are:\n\n- to promote learning in game and in real life;\n\n- to encourage exploration and discovery;\n\n- to enrich KSP gaming by highlighting diverse mission objectives;\n\n- to engage the community for a richer experience for members and the KGSS;\n\n- to foster all the science disciplines without prejudice;\n\n- to challenge members to expand their mission repertoire.\n\nThe KGSS has already embarked on real science missions. Through the use of community designed mods, the KGSS has mapped the surface of Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus. The KGSS, through the efforts of volunteers, can now offer 2d and 3d contoured topographic maps of KSP celestial bodies. Who would have thought! The KGSS also provides a \\\u0027name this feature\\\u0027 register for those that wish to name prominent landmarks (rules apply). We\\\u0027ll also offer hypothetical scientific missions for you to try something you probably would not even consider doing normally. For those that are interested, the KGSS will offer articles on real Kerbal science like topographic maps, Kerbin air density, exploration, flight dynamics and more. If it\\\u0027s scientific in nature, the KGSS has an interest!\n\nIf you have skills or tools to offer then let someone know - this is your society, feel free to participate. If you wish to be a silent member then enjoy the posts, the challenges and the quest for scientific knowledge. Welcome to the KGSS!!\n\n==========================================================================================================================\n\n**KGSS recognised maps**\n\nThese maps are in csv format (comma delimited text files) and are the end result of many contributors.

I think the Society needs to sift through all the provided data and decide if it should be included or excluded in the official maps. This sounds very official but its really a matter of someone opening up the data in map mode and doing a sanity check. Datapoints that are outside the -180/180 or -90/90 range (for the Mun) is instantly suspect and this dataset should be rejected. It should be open source because in this KSP community no one really has a monopoly on much. If Modders can provide source code for free then so should the Kerbin Geographic Society.\n\nI think we should have a poll for regions (whatever that means) but not for individual features. A hill, mountain or bump in the ground probably won\\\u0027t get much attention except from the person that claims it so I think a poll on features is overkill and will have in many cases just one name and only one vote. People are more interested in larger regions so this should go to a vote.

Hopefully this is small enough to qualify for the \u0027Small Features\u0027 part of the naming.\n\nProposed name for the overall peninsula that it is on: Hydra Peninsula (also known as Hydrangea.) The area referred to with that name would end at the mountains in the northeast, as the land widens past that point to no longer be a proper peninsula.\n\nExample use:\n\nDude 1: \u0027Hey, let\\\u0027s head down to Hydrangea. The surf\\\u0027s really nice at the beaches this time of year, and my cousin has a place right near Borgnine Beach.\u0027\n\nDude 2: \u0027No way, man, didn\\\u0027t you hear? The whole Hydra Peninsula got whalloped by a hurricane earlier this week.\u0027\n\nDude 1: \u0027Bummer! Let me call my cousin and make sure she\\\u0027s ok.\u0027\n\nTo be clear, Hydrangea would not be a country name, just an alternate way of referring to the peninsula. It would be called Hydra Peninsula any time the two-word approach was wanted, but Hydrangea instead of Hydra in a single-word reference."},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T03:39:18Z","Content":"I think Borgnine Beach is fine.

Your map appears to use an Equidistant Cylindrical Projection so I also used that projection for my comparison map. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E ![JzvBG.png](http://i.imgur.com/JzvBG.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The colour maps that I posted above, on the other hand, use polar stereographic and Mercator Projection. These two projections have less severe distortion than the Equidistant Cylindrical Projection, especially near the poles. The colour also increases the altitude resolution because gray scales are limited to a resolution of just 256.\n\u003E \n\u003E My maps have some slight artefacts that result from my altitude interpolation algorithm (I will work on improving the algorithm), but otherwise the two maps seem to be very comparable.\n\nHas stuff like this been done for Kerbal yet? Ill be needed some full surface maps soon, in colour preferably, similar to this Munar map."}]}
