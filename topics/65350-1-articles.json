Post your router make and model if you don\u0027t know how to do this and I\u0027ll find out how to get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find out if the channel the router is using is too busy you\u0027ll need a wifi channel scanner like NetSurveyor: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://nutsaboutnets.com/netsurveyor-wifi-scanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nutsaboutnets.com/netsurveyor-wifi-scanner/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will list all the wifi signals close to you. There are 2 things to look for; how many signals are on the same channel as your router and how many are using a overlapping channel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis image shows which channels over lap, the best ones are 1, 6 and 11. Pick 1, 6 or 11 if they are not to busy with other signals.

I suggest getting something like a Sitecom or Netgear router which can handle 802.11n, but you\u0027ll need wifi adapters which can handle that too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T09:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou know what i did, i just picked the last channel on the list. very few people change the defaults. never have a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T09:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuys, the OP has no problem staying connected to his WiFi, it\u0027s the router that loses connection to the net.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T09:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell then all you can do is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. complain to isp, get someone to check signal levels. 9 times out of 10 they will lie to you and say everything is fine, and the tenth time they will try to sell you something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. switch isps and hope the new one sucks less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T10:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you not able to reset the router using its configuration page?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T10:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rickenbacker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rickenbacker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuys, the OP has no problem staying connected to his WiFi, it\u0027s the router that loses connection to the net.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoh!
