And just like that silly Wally, Kally\u0027s Ship can be hidden amongst other objects around the kerbol system.\n\nI am devising a hiding spot and will post soon. I hope it will be more challenging and might need to zoom the image to find it.\n\nLet me know if the resolution is too low (it is maxed at 1920x1080) and I will upload a super screen shot if I can remember how to change the config settings.\n\nSit Down and Relax\n\n![dOhXz0u.png](http://i.imgur.com/dOhXz0u.png)\n\nDeduction is the way to solve this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  This is not the same image and was trying the super sample settings and this is at 2 times\n\u003E \n\u003E ![t3bCmef.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/t3bCmef.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E I would like to have more clutter laying about the image.
