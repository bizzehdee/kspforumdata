Your first rockets will flip and crash with no feedback available as to why. If you do get to space then you will likely burn up on re-entry. If you fly through space with the engines full on then the craft might randomly explode (engines overheated with nothing to tell you so). If you try some mining then for no apparent reason the parts will stop working (overheating with nothing to indicate so). So you give planes a try and find that your aircraft fall apart and explode for no apparent reason. Even trying to do some science with the MPL is a black art. And so on. \n\nI can\u0027t help thinking that KSP is now going to put off an awful lot of new players, even more so than before. Its just so opaque now, things go wrong a lot and then there\u0027s nothing to tell you why. \n\nAny new players out there?"},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:19:11Z","Content":"They re-did all the tutorials. Try them out and show them your friends who are interested (they are often overlooked).\n\nThe new tuts are actually quite good!"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:26:06Z","Content":"\u003E Seems KSP is even harder now.

Pulling everything down will give them the old behavior of KSP, so it wouldn\u0027t be hard for them...it will properly be a \u0022noob\u0022 mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:34:01Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think going over 1000m/s in atmosphere counts as exploding for no apparent reason.\n\nFair points tho. Most of the games these days are designed so you can just start playing them and the game guides player thru all the stuff. People stopped looking for manuals a long time ago and even if you include tutorials in the game some will always ignore them too."},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:32:04Z","Content":"Honestly I fear for new players. So far this update seems very deep/complicated. I have to say when I first played this game several years ago, I did not like it because of the learning curve. And with even more complicated features and now \u0022atmospheres\u0022 added, it gets even more difficult."}]}
