Try widening the base a bit - attaching FL-T200s is a good way to do this; your landing gear should attach to them. Only other thing I can tell you is to make sure you\u0027ve killed all your horizontal velocity when you finally touch down. RCS can be a last resort if you tip over; I\u0027ve been able to complete many missions because I was able to use RCS to re-upright the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Pretty sure that\u0027s what you\u0027re talking about; I hope I\u0027ve answered the question.
