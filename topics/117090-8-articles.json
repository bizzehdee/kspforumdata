Was just not going to work out properly. There was no way to -cleanly- merge the different directional trusses, and no matter what the whole thing would be very directionally dependent (e.g. trusses would need to be rotated a certain orientation to line up properly).\n\nInstead, I have settled for Near-Future Octo-Girder style trusses (currently unimaginatively titled \u0027Octo-Truss\u0027). I do not think these will be available as discrete parts/individual truss sections (you should use the NF ones instead), but will come \u0027pre-welded\u0027 with other features -- such as docking ports, solar panel arrays, or storage sections.\n\nSo, yes, there -will- be some station trusses with built in solar arrays.\n\nCurrently planned station parts are:\n\nMulti-Docking Port - multiple configurations with different sized docking ports, 5 docking ports, 1 standard attach node\n\nSolar Truss - basic truss with large deployable solar panels, 4 solar panels\n\nSolar Docking Truss - Combination of Multi-Docking Port and Solar Truss, with special layout of docking ports to accomodate the layout of the panels, 3 docking ports, 3 standard attach nodes, 4 solar panels\n\nStorage Torus - large non-rotating rigid torus, includes docking ports (x4), optional solar arrays (x4), resource-switch capability. My also include lights.\n\nAntenna Truss Cap - station end-cap containing an antenna array (multiple dish antennas) and several solar arrays. Will also include lights.\n\nFor references, many of these parts will resemble some of the welded parts I had created for this monstrosity:\n\n![uHGxBLw.png](http://imgur.com/uHGxBLw.png)\n\n-Large Storage Torus w/docking ports can be seen... its the big torus thing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Antenna Truss Cap - the parts attached to the torus with 3x solar panels on them; might be making them a bit different, but the concept is the same.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Korion\u0027s Panels still aren\u0027t picking up EC.

I do not experience this problem in my personal game (played a bit over the weekend, I would have noticed if it was not working), nor have I heard of any other reports.\n\nDid you ever go through the steps to track down what mod/etc was interfering? Did you try and verify the problem persists a clean install?\n\nEdit: Wanted to add that I really do want to resolve the issue you are experiencing, but without enough information to duplicate the problem on a clean in stall or a minimal-mod setup I have nowhere to begin the investigation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-22T01:37:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2015 01:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T15:53:22Z","Content":"Spent a bit of time working on finishing of Ship Core - Series B (rather, spent most of this time a couple weeks ago, and just getting back to it now)...\n\nWorking on creating the SC-B-CORE; what would be the equivalent of the SLS core stage. The only real problem I\u0027m running into is the size of the thing at proper rescaled dimensions. It is tall. Really tall. Barely-fits-in-the-VAB tall.\n\nSo... I guess I have a few questions regarding what people would expect/want from a kerbal-sized core launcher stage (and what size/how tall it should be!).\n\n1.) Payload capacity of the core system (SC-B-CORE and SC-B-SRBs only).\n\nSLS Block 1 has a 70 tons-to-LEO capacity. Scaled down to kerbal dimensions is only 18.35008 tons (70\\*0.64^3), which seems really tiny. Should I aim for a comparable payload to LKO (e.g. 70 tons), and let the difference in to-orbit-delta-v offset the difference in scale?\n\n2.) Weight/performance of the core stage and boosters\n\nCurrently I am using some bashed-together liquid-hydrogen stats for the ICPS, HUS, and preliminary numbers for the CORE (volume, density, mass, engine ISPs). This means that they are comparatively light, and only contain a fraction of the fuel they would if stock fuel densities were used.\n\nShould I go for standard stock balance using stock engine ISPs and fuel densities? Should I go full-out and actually use the LqdHydrogen resource as defined by USI/NF?\n\nWhat should the weight be of the core\u002Bboosters only?\n\n3.) Size of the core stage\n\nCurrently at ~34m (~64% scaled from real article) (not including engines), it is -very- hard to fit the core stage in the standard VAB. You can -just barely- manage to attach the ICPS and CSM to the top before running into camera/positioning problems.\n\nObviously it will be staying at ~5m diameter. However the height is open to adjustment if needed. Height does influence internal volume, which determines fuel capacity (and thus lifting capacity). So, I suppose the first thing that is needed to be known is \u0027how much to lift?\u0027.\n\nPreview of current geometry, for reference:\n\nGeometry -not- finalized; not sure how tall to make the thing. SRBs are ~2.5m diameter. You can (kind of) see these parts in the screenshot I posted of the BPC/LAS engine effects.\n\n![NhvDU0L.png](http://i.imgur.com/NhvDU0L.png)\n\n.... And of the RS-25 engine that will be used (geometry and texture mostly finished; might have some small texture touchups).\n\n![CHIlz9j.png](http://i.imgur.com/CHIlz9j.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T18:17:36Z","Content":"Shadowmage, that looks good.

So, in that regard, yes, it is a separate part, usable on any craft. It is missing the upper turbopump geometry and plumbing, but I did not model any of it as it was not needed for its intended purpose (and, would have increased the tri-count substantially... it is already high-poly enough). I will be balancing the engine as its own part (e.g. thrust, heat, weight); about the only thing that would be a bit off for use on other craft would be the overall height of the engine\n\nHave the geometry work mostly figured out for most of the station parts, at least the initial few that I have planned. Might have some that are usable by this weekends\u0027 release, though no guarantees (and they likely won\u0027t have any real texturing yet). Taking it slow on the station parts while I work on finishing up the rest of the Lander Core WIP stuff (mostly texturing at this point). Will try to post up some renders of what I have for feedback later today.\n\nThe solar panels integrated into trusses will only be able to rotate in the standard stock-supported behavior (e.g. along the long axis of the panel itself). Trying to rotate the entire truss would.... not work out well due to lack of stock support for it (e.g. surface attached stuff would -not- rotate with the visible mesh). Trying to add any other multi-axis tracking for the solar panels would require a major rewrite of the plugin module that drives them, and is not currently planned.\n\nBut yes, the whole point of these parts (all of them that I make) is to reduce part count on useful vessels (ships, landers, stations, bases). Basically they amount to little more than \u0027pre-welded\u0027 parts, but include all the bits that you can\u0027t normally weld due to plugin/module constraints (such as solar panels, landing legs, etc). I always -want- to include large numbers of massive solar panels on my stations, but never can due to part count (when limited to ~60 parts for a useful/non-laggy vessel, allocating 8 to solar panels is out of the question). Same with lights, docking ports, and resource storage; I always want to include them, but never can due to part-count limitations.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So this is similar to SLS block 2? Are you going to make one eventually?\n\nYes; the Ship Core: Series-B is supposed to be a Kerbalized analogue to the NASA SLS system. I already have all (most?) of the upper stages and the top end of the stack; now I\u0027m working on completing the bottom of the stack. Might also make a couple of other payload adapters / large fairing parts (as the stock 3.75m is just not big enough for a 5m rocket!). In the end there should be a Block 1 config (Core\u002Bboosters\u002BICPS), as well as Block 2 (core\u002Bboosters\u002BHUS\u002B5th engine). I just have no idea what their payload-to-LKO capacity should be in the Kerbal system, going to orbit from Kerbin.\n\nRight now I\u0027m at the concept validation point -- I need to make sure that the parts will work as desired in KSP with stock balancing (I\u0027m sure I could get RO/RSS stuff to work fine, as all of those stats are known quantities). I\u0027m trying to determine the needed size of the core stage based upon the desired lifting capacity to LKO and the type of fuel/engines that will be used. I\u0027m going to need a MUCH smaller rocket to push ~70t to LKO (3.6km/s dV max), compared to pushing the same to LEO (9km/s dV or so). So...that is what I\u0027m trying to figure out.\n\nI\u0027m heavily considering rebalancing the SC-B parts to use standard/stock KSP ISP values and mass fractions (and thus require -much- more fuel for a given payload). Currently I am using values based off of real-volume with fuel amount calculated from fuel with the density of hydrolox (much less dense than KSP LFO). So, there is a ton of \u0027volume\u0027 that could still be used in the ICPS and HUS if I were to convert them to use stock fuel values; but the overall (wet) weight of the parts would skyrocket. Hmm...perhaps I\u0027ll run some number and see what I can come up with."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T19:22:54Z","Content":"Shadowmage, beautiful concept of that SLS stuff,\n\nI would personally go for 80-120t LKO capability since MK3 stock SSTO with rapiers is already able to push sizeable 40-60t payload depending on setup and it\u0027s reusable.\n\nedit: 3.75m 4x cluster stock engines are also currently overpowered having great isp and thrust alltogether.

Sadly, this just doesn\u0027t work out right for anything close to stock balance or for use with other stock parts. While I could make it consistent across the series of parts (self-consistent), it would just not play nicely with anything else, or be usable for much else (it certainly wouldn\u0027t be a heavy lifter).\n\nAnd yah, the heavy-lift capability just with a few stock parts is pretty amazing. I have a 3.75m Delta-IV-Heavy styled lifter in my games doing \u003E100t to LEO. By that metric, the SLS-styled setup should probably lift \u003E150t in baseline config, or ~240 in the fully evolved Block 2 setup.

So, the core is currently 40m, I\u0027ll probably end up going with something between 25 and 30m. Boosters will likely get scaled down as well (possibly in diameter too). I will probably aim for a ~200t to LKO capacity for the standard \u0027full\u0027 version with no upper stage (full height tank, 5 engines, 2 boosters). Nerfing the ISP down to KSP \u0027lifter\u0027 levels will probably help with the OP\u0027ness a bit as well.\n\nI likely will end up creating two tank sections of different heights to allow for a few different combinations (where you had suggested the tank-split is pretty close to the already-existing intertank split-point, will probably go with that, or very close). This, however, creates a bit of a problem -- which tank section should include the engine mounts? Or should I create those as separate part(s) (possibly with integrated engines... 3, 4, and 5 engine variants)\n\nWill run another set of numbers with some different scaled parts, as at this point it is pretty obvious that I cannot used the true scaled-height of the core (it is just too big, and has more lifting capacity than I would ever need in a single launch or could even use given its already-massive height). So, expect another math/numbers filled post later today...\n\nAt this point I am thinking that the entire SC-B upper stack will be rebalanced as well. The Command Module and Service module will be intended for unassisted Kerbin-SOI operations, and as such will have close to the same dV it currently has (and close to the real-life value of 1400m/s); this should allow it to propel itself to Mun/Minmus with enough dV for insertion\u002Bstation rendezvous\u002Breturn (and still far lower performance than it-should- have given its volume... it should hold much more fuel). The ICPS will be repurposed as a 3.75m generic upper stage (using stock balance/volumes/etc). Initial balance calculations put it somewhere \u003E3km/s when pushing the CM\u002BSM, so it will be enough to propel the CSM to a few different interplanetary destinations, and should be adequate to use to deliver the CSM \u002B lander/rover to Mun/Minmus. The HUS will be repurposed as a generic 5m upper stage (again, using stock balance figures); it should be quite capable as an upper stage to deliver some of the heavier payloads to their interplanetary destinations; have not done any preliminary calcs on this, but I\u0027ll try to keep it in line with the rest.\n\nI was quite curious regarding the \u0027SRB with integrated separator and decoupler\u0027 that you had mentioned, but I could not find any such part(s) in the BAE download package. They do have SRBs, but none of them have integrated decouplers (or any function besides the SRB engine). I really would love to add decouplers and such to my SRBs (to reduce part count even further, and make them a true/simple strap-on booster), but as far as I know it is not possible due to stock staging mechanics (e.g. a part may only have a single staging action)(It also really messes with MJ/KER dV calc when you include decouplers into engines/fuel tanks).

This configuration would also be good for calculating dV, mechJeb etc I guess.\n\nI\u0027m going for overall stock balance / usable in stock system with other stock-balanced parts and mods. MM patches can (mostly) accommodate any optional rescale packs that users want to setup. Things would be **-much-** easier were I designing for RSS/RO, as I could use the actual real-world values for stuff for the most part, but sadly those values just do not work for the stock system/mechanics.\n\nI had initially run a balance sheet using LH2 stats (including less-dense fuels and heavier tankage by mass-factor (relatively unchanged by volume factor)); however the whole thing was still... weird... given the mechanics at play in the KSP universe (densities, scales, orbital velocities). Some things worked out quite well (upper stages/balancing of CSM), others not-so-much (CORE stuff was still weird).\n\nHmm.. will consider different options for the SRBs. I like the idea of an integrated separation engine in the SRB/decoupler (as the stock decoupling mechanisms are...sketchy at times). Perhaps I\u0027ll make some specialized radial decouplers for 2.5m parts that include a surround ring \u002B separator engines. Will see what I can whip up.\n\nOn a unusual note of good news, the height-rescaled-rebalance of the parts is looking promising. 30m/5-engine/2-booster config at 315 ISP can do the intended ~200t payload to LKO (or upwards of ~300t if HUS is used as part of the lifter). A shorter 20m/4-engine/2-booster config does ~160t to LKO.\n\nWill add more info/stats as I figure things out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOn the subject of IVAs -- I\u0027m still plodding away at them slowly, making a bit of progress every day. By far the hardest thing has been trying to find appropriate positioning for the seats to allow for a good \u0027landing view\u0027. Sadly, I cannot actually find any good positioning that does not have problems (for LC2/LC3); the geometry of a Kerbal is just not well suited to adaptation of real-world lander designs -- the geometry of their body and head is all wrong for trying to use the same kind of mechanics humans would. Where a human would push their nose into the window to look out and downwards, the top of the kerbals head is too huge to allow them to do this (their head hits the window or upper wall, while their eyes are still below it). \n\nSo I will be moving to include RPM support out-of-the-box, mostly for use of the \u0027external cameras\u0027 on MFDs (redesigning geometry on already \u0027finished\u0027 models is not an option). This does mean that the stock IVA experience will be sub-optimal, but it generally is in the other IVAs anyhow (I have not seen a single stock IVA that is actually usable for its intended purpose -- the view angles/visibility in all of them is terrible; mostly due to the previously mentioned strange kerbal geometry).\n\nThe \u0027stock\u0027 IVA experience for the landers will be mostly an instrument-only deal. You would need to use the nav-ball and radar-altimeter to land.\n\nPerhaps if/when I do a refresh on the lander parts I\u0027ll -start- with the IVA geometry and work outwards from there (will ensure good visibility). For now though I\u0027m going to have to settle for some amounts of compromise."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T18:41:49Z","Content":"cool, \n\nConcerning radial decouplers - the problem with them is that they have too little mass for their joints to hold massive SRB effectively thus one usually requires struts.

Lots of new ideas and concepts in the works as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Looks great. Is the integrated radiator truss going to be like the ISS one (and Squad trio radiator panel)?\n\nI haven\u0027t really thought of anything along the lines of radiators - have never had to use one in my games. Though I might consider integrating some radiator panels into the solar-truss as well (or other station parts), as I can see there might be a need for them for some setups (mostly those involving reactors, or close solar orbit).\n\nAfter -much- thought, -many- hours of number crunching, and quite a few discussions on the subject, I -think- I have settled on a set of parts and a system of balance for the Ship Core: Series B lifter parts.\n\nFuel tank 20m\n\nFuel tank 10m\n\nEngine Cluster x5\n\nEngine Cluster x4\n\nEngine Cluster x3\n\nSRB - 28m\n\nSRB - 20m\n\n(Rough geometry render, no geometry finalized yet except for the engine bells)\n\n![jay3AMB.png](http://i.imgur.com/jay3AMB.png)\n\nUsing those parts you can assemble 5m lifters for many different needs, with payload-to-LKO ranging from 60 to ~350 tons depending on part configuration (and final part balance).\n\nEngine TWR, ISP, fuel density, and tank mass/volume fractions are all within the range used by stock parts. I\u0027ll also be doing some comparisons vs KW Rocketry to see how it stacks up there (perhaps other heavy lifter packs as well); I\u0027m not aiming to obsolete (or compete with) any other mods, merely offer a unified low-part count alternative.\n\nThe 3x engine cluster has a bottom attach node (and engine fairing), and could be used for a first stage engine for smaller payloads or as an upper stage engine for some of the more massive payloads. So far I\u0027ve balanced it for slightly higher ISP with slightly lower thrust-per-nozzle than the other clusters.\n\nThe 4x engine cluster is \u0027middle of the road\u0027 of the three engines. Nothing special (other than it is still massive and puts out gobs of thrust). It has no bottom node, and is intended for first-stage use only.\n\nThe 5x engine cluster has slightly lower ISP and slightly higher thrust-per-nozzle compared to the 4x cluster. Intended to be used when you just need more thrust. Again, no bottom node, intended for fist-stage use only.\n\nThe SRBs are nothing special, aside from being much larger than any of the stock offerings. Really heavy, really poor ISP, tons and tons of thrust.\n\nThe tanks... are well... fuel tanks... you put fuel in them for your engines ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). Big..really big, and heavy. The -small- tank weighs 196t when full, double that for the 20m one.\n\nI have not yet done any geometry work regarding decouplers, but have a few ideas that might help the overall experience (if they work).\n\nThe one problem I was experiencing during testing was how poorly KSP handles such massive parts in stock. I do not have KJR installed in my dev setup, and the parts are just so massive they tend to break the attach joints just from gravity whenever physics is started up; even the joints between the tanks, or tank and engines... they all tend to get crushed. Some quick strutting fixed the problem, and might just be an unfortunate (and otherwise unsolvable) side effect of such large/massive parts in non-KJR installs."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T04:14:30Z","Content":"Issues with joint breaking and \\*incompatibility with KJR?
