So, in that regard, yes, it is a separate part, usable on any craft. It is missing the upper turbopump geometry and plumbing, but I did not model any of it as it was not needed for its intended purpose (and, would have increased the tri-count substantially... it is already high-poly enough). I will be balancing the engine as its own part (e.g. thrust, heat, weight); about the only thing that would be a bit off for use on other craft would be the overall height of the engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave the geometry work mostly figured out for most of the station parts, at least the initial few that I have planned. Might have some that are usable by this weekends\u0027 release, though no guarantees (and they likely won\u0027t have any real texturing yet). Taking it slow on the station parts while I work on finishing up the rest of the Lander Core WIP stuff (mostly texturing at this point). Will try to post up some renders of what I have for feedback later today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar panels integrated into trusses will only be able to rotate in the standard stock-supported behavior (e.g. along the long axis of the panel itself). Trying to rotate the entire truss would.... not work out well due to lack of stock support for it (e.g. surface attached stuff would -not- rotate with the visible mesh). Trying to add any other multi-axis tracking for the solar panels would require a major rewrite of the plugin module that drives them, and is not currently planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, the whole point of these parts (all of them that I make) is to reduce part count on useful vessels (ships, landers, stations, bases). Basically they amount to little more than \u0027pre-welded\u0027 parts, but include all the bits that you can\u0027t normally weld due to plugin/module constraints (such as solar panels, landing legs, etc). I always -want- to include large numbers of massive solar panels on my stations, but never can due to part count (when limited to ~60 parts for a useful/non-laggy vessel, allocating 8 to solar panels is out of the question). Same with lights, docking ports, and resource storage; I always want to include them, but never can due to part-count limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo this is similar to SLS block 2?

I already have all (most?) of the upper stages and the top end of the stack; now I\u0027m working on completing the bottom of the stack. Might also make a couple of other payload adapters / large fairing parts (as the stock 3.75m is just not big enough for a 5m rocket!). In the end there should be a Block 1 config (Core\u002Bboosters\u002BICPS), as well as Block 2 (core\u002Bboosters\u002BHUS\u002B5th engine). I just have no idea what their payload-to-LKO capacity should be in the Kerbal system, going to orbit from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027m at the concept validation point -- I need to make sure that the parts will work as desired in KSP with stock balancing (I\u0027m sure I could get RO/RSS stuff to work fine, as all of those stats are known quantities). I\u0027m trying to determine the needed size of the core stage based upon the desired lifting capacity to LKO and the type of fuel/engines that will be used. I\u0027m going to need a MUCH smaller rocket to push ~70t to LKO (3.6km/s dV max), compared to pushing the same to LEO (9km/s dV or so). So...that is what I\u0027m trying to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m heavily considering rebalancing the SC-B parts to use standard/stock KSP ISP values and mass fractions (and thus require -much- more fuel for a given payload). Currently I am using values based off of real-volume with fuel amount calculated from fuel with the density of hydrolox (much less dense than KSP LFO). So, there is a ton of \u0027volume\u0027 that could still be used in the ICPS and HUS if I were to convert them to use stock fuel values; but the overall (wet) weight of the parts would skyrocket.

So, the core is currently 40m, I\u0027ll probably end up going with something between 25 and 30m. Boosters will likely get scaled down as well (possibly in diameter too). I will probably aim for a ~200t to LKO capacity for the standard \u0027full\u0027 version with no upper stage (full height tank, 5 engines, 2 boosters).

So, expect another math/numbers filled post later today...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I am thinking that the entire SC-B upper stack will be rebalanced as well. The Command Module and Service module will be intended for unassisted Kerbin-SOI operations, and as such will have close to the same dV it currently has (and close to the real-life value of 1400m/s); this should allow it to propel itself to Mun/Minmus with enough dV for insertion\u002Bstation rendezvous\u002Breturn (and still far lower performance than it-should- have given its volume... it should hold much more fuel). The ICPS will be repurposed as a 3.75m generic upper stage (using stock balance/volumes/etc). Initial balance calculations put it somewhere \u0026gt;3km/s when pushing the CM\u002BSM, so it will be enough to propel the CSM to a few different interplanetary destinations, and should be adequate to use to deliver the CSM \u002B lander/rover to Mun/Minmus. The HUS will be repurposed as a generic 5m upper stage (again, using stock balance figures); it should be quite capable as an upper stage to deliver some of the heavier payloads to their interplanetary destinations; have not done any preliminary calcs on this, but I\u0027ll try to keep it in line with the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was quite curious regarding the \u0027SRB with integrated separator and decoupler\u0027 that you had mentioned, but I could not find any such part(s) in the BAE download package. They do have SRBs, but none of them have integrated decouplers (or any function besides the SRB engine). I really would love to add decouplers and such to my SRBs (to reduce part count even further, and make them a true/simple strap-on booster), but as far as I know it is not possible due to stock staging mechanics (e.g. a part may only have a single staging action)(It also really messes with MJ/KER dV calc when you include decouplers into engines/fuel tanks).
