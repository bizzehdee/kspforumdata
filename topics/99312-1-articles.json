There are struts but most aren\u0027t visible. The wings are held together by struts but they\u0027re placed inside the wing to make it prettier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures: Autopilot (it is, after all, a ferry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 shielded docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 strategically placed RCS ports to aid in docking (no left/right though, I deal with this by rolling and using the up/down as left/right)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 R.A.P.I.E.R. engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 Turbojet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 structural intakes and 2 shock cone intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a nuclear generator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U66cYKg.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/U66cYKg.jpg\u003C/a\u003E (large image)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major downside is that fuel balancing can be tricky. It will become back-heavy after fuel depletes, which won\u0027t matter on ascent but on descent, you\u0027ll want to manually balance your fuel toward the front so that it doesn\u0027t go tail-first. Even so, I\u0027ve had it flip wildly out of control and still landed it safely several times because the imbalance seems to only be disastrous at high speeds. If anybody has any suggestions on how to improve this aspect without significantly changing the design, I\u0027d appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./?adyuzs3mn8hh7dn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www./?adyuzs3mn8hh7dn\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
