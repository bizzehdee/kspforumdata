To make matters worse, you can only get one \u0022recovered vessel from\u0022 per pod, so if you were to do a grand tour and land on every body, you\u0027d only get points for the one most valuable landing place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T01:08:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you have a command pod on your mother ship, and one on your lander, and your mother ship doesn\u0027t land, you will only get \u0022orbit of\u0022 recovery science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T08:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...unless you carry the lander back home and land it on Kerbin to recover that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically you could have a mothership that carries like 10 landers to their destinations and back to Kerbin, then land all 10 landers on Kerbin, and recover them all.
