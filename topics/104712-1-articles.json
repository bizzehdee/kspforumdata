Unfortunately, adding lots of mods also seems to add lots of parts that I don\u0027t usually use, at least in my current game. For example, the Firespitter mod adds parts for a World War I era biplane, and B9 Aerospace adds a bunch of huge parts, and I don\u0027t use them in the game I\u0027m playing now. All these extra parts seem to slow down my game and make it take a long time to load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo can anyone tell me if it\u0027s possible to delete some of the parts I don\u0027t use? And if so, can I just delete the parts in my current game save, so if I start a new game I could use them then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your help... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, you can delete any parts you want.

When deleting parts, you just have to be careful that the models and textures arent also used by parts you will be keeping.
