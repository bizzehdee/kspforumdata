Unfortunately, adding lots of mods also seems to add lots of parts that I don\u0027t usually use, at least in my current game. For example, the Firespitter mod adds parts for a World War I era biplane, and B9 Aerospace adds a bunch of huge parts, and I don\u0027t use them in the game I\u0027m playing now. All these extra parts seem to slow down my game and make it take a long time to load.\n\nSo can anyone tell me if it\u0027s possible to delete some of the parts I don\u0027t use? And if so, can I just delete the parts in my current game save, so if I start a new game I could use them then?\n\nThanks in advance for your help... ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:00:14Z","Content":"Yep, you can delete any parts you want. I once by complete accident deleted them all, game started just fine, I just couldn\u0027t build anything.\n\nJust remove them from GameData\\Squad or GameData\\NASAMission\n\nYou can not just remove them for one save however, it will be every save on that installation. You can maintain multiple installations though. There is no DRM, so just copy the install folder elsewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T01:19:04Z","Content":"KSP ModAdmin, and possibly TinkerTime can be helpful in deleting specific parts from mods. When deleting parts, you just have to be careful that the models and textures arent also used by parts you will be keeping. A good example are there are several mods that reuse the stock (Squad) models/textures, so you have to be careful deleting unused Squad parts...\n\nKSP ModAdmin\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26031](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26031)\n\nTinkerTime\n\n[https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/243/Tinker%20Time](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/243/Tinker%20Time)\n\nI\u0027m not sure if CKAN is helpful this way or not?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T01:40:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure if CKAN is helpful this way or not?\n\nIf using CKAN 1.5.6 or above, the [third-party PartManager plugin](http://http//forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106363-CKAN-plugin-CKAN-PartManager-v1-2-Selectively-remove-parts-from-mods) allows CKAN to remember not to install specified parts when an add-on is installed/updated.
