Use \u0027H\u0027 to change its distance from the base and \u0027N\u0027 to alter the size of the base. To size the base to a known size, connect something underneath it of the desired size and use \u0027N\u0027 to get a close match. You can use \u0027H\u0027 to bring the upper stage right down to the base, or leave room for other parts that will go beneath it but will remain attached to the lower stage when the interstage is decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow turn off symmetry, grab a fairing side (conical tends to be the most useful here) and attach it to one of the outer interstage base connection points. This will let you see the inner contents the interstage will hide while still being able to see the shape that the walls will take. Use \u0027Y\u0027 to widen/shrink the top radius of the walls and \u0027J\u0027 to adjust their height until everything is lined up the way you want. Remove the fairing wall, add any struts you deem necessary, then turn on symmetry and re-add the fairing wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImportant note: \u003Cem\u003EUse the fairing sides, not the fuselage sides.\u003C/em\u003E If you use the fuselage sides, they will auto-strut to the stage above them and when you eject the interstage, the upper stage will remain stuck.
