I recently also got Ferrams Aerospace Research, and upon my first launch using the plugin, I noticed that the Throttle Control on MechJeb wasn\u0027t limiting my launch to terminal velocity like it should be and I ended up at a good 400m/s at an altitude of only around 1500m, which of course because of the Deadly Reentry plugin... Blew me up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve been told by somebody that apparently MechJeb and Ferrams Aerospace Research are not compatible because they use different drag models, and I can understand that but wouldn\u0027t that mean that only the parts of MechJeb related to drag would be broken? (As an example the Smart ASS still works.) I didn\u0027t think that the \u0022Limit to terminal velocity\u0022 used the drag, I though it used the speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyways, I guess the point of this post is to ask if there is any way I can get the \u0022Limit to terminal velocity\u0022 option in MechJeb to work with Ferrams Aerospace Research?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: MechJeb 2.0.7\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T17:48:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T14:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t mind working around the problem, you could try the limit acceleration option and use different values\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T14:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CoriW\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CoriW\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI didn\u0027t think that the \u0022Limit to terminal velocity\u0022 used the drag, I though it used the speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeminal velocity is the point at which your drag force matches the force applied by gravity and you stop accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you change the drag then you change the terminal velocity, so it may well be working.
