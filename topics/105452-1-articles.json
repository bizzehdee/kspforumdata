Well, TV will be close to what it is in FAR, I suspect, so it\u0027ll be pretty high, and darn hard to catch even at 2Gs. For the aeroFX, unless things have changed that\u0027s based on density * velocity^3 which has an extra factor of velocity compared to drag (drag is 1/2 density * velocity^2) so it probably won\u0027t be that reliable.
