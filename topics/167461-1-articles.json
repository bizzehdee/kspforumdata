So when\u00A0launching TSTO craft to orbit, the first stage sometimes tumbles and gets tons of drag to low its\u00A0own apoapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strange thing is that the flipping depends on \u003Cu\u003Ewhich craft you have focus\u00A0on.\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0The exactly same first stage\u00A0doesn\u0027t flip back if it\u0027s focused, while it always ends\u00A0up tumbling when I\u0027m focusing on the second stage nearby.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I\u0027m going for the first stage\u00A0recovery before the second stage reaches apoapsis, this is quite important for me.\u00A0So why is this happening? Is it a glitch with the physics engine?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The\u00A0first stage is the one which is flipping when not focused. It does not flip when it\u0027s focused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Here\u0027s the screenshot of the craft. It has fairing top to lessen the front node drag of the first stage, and added wings at the back. I\u0027ll try turning off prograde marker and see if something changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022o3Tvz8X.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022286\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/o3Tvz8X.png\u0022 width=\u0022509\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ef4Em3t.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022285\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/ef4Em3t.png\u0022 width=\u0022506\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-15T02:58:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2017 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Reusables\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T21:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m reading this as your second stage with payload\u00A0 tumbling -- you might wish to edit the question to clarify if that\u0027s not the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the stage is aerodynamically unstable after staging, it may be unable to hold heading if it\u0027s more than a couple degrees from prograde -- and your probe core will be switched to \u0022stability assist\u0022 (i.e. \u0022hold constant heading\u0022) when you switch focus away from the second stage, which inevitably happens while you recover the booster.\u00A0 During this time, the stage tries to hold heading, but it\u0027s coasting, so its prograde vector will point more and more downward -- and if the heading gets too far off prograde for an unstable stage, it\u0027ll often will have enough aerodynamic destabilizing forces to overcome the reaction wheel(s) and start to tumble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dead simple solutions to this are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
