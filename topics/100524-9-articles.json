I didn\u0027t see any harm in leaving it in since some of the advice with that particular design was \u0022make the fuselage longer and draw the CoM forward\u0022. In my experience, monoprop makes for reasonably good ballast if nothing else. I did move it well forward from where it was originally; in retrospect I wonder if it would\u0027ve been better to put it in between the cockpit and the cargo bay.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo move the CoM forward I\u0027d first and foremost get the crew cabin and docking port forward, since these are components that do not change weight no matter what you do.

A tailplane applies pitch-up moment by tilting up, giving a negative angle of attack; as the plane pitches up, the angle of the tailplane surface approaches 0 compared to the airflow.
