Main reason being to be able to go at max warp to get to the departure point.\n\nAlso, how is it a severe disadvantage? we aren\u0027t going for fastest circularization here. I want to try an ion engine anyway.\n\nStill, given the differences in the way that the different engine types perform, it still makes sense to make categories for those.\n\nedit: If you drop a stage without burning all of the fuel, does that count against or towards the deltaV saved? It\u0027s the stage that propels my main stage to Jool from Kerbin orbit around 1k km if you\u0027re wondering.\n\nTo clarify further, the white tanks are the stage that I\u0027m leaving behind after my correction burn:\n\n[![screenshot13_zpsuiho9kn6.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot13_zpsuiho9kn6.png)](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot13_zpsuiho9kn6.png.html)\n\nDoes the deltaV left behind in that stage count towards my score? I\u0027m not trying to exploit a loophole or anything, I actually realized the potential issue after launch since nothing was said about dropped stages. In theory, one could use a stack of 5m (or 10m using tweakscale if you want to get ridiculous) tanks to launch a small probe out of Kerbin orbit for a huge deltaV savings because of the deltaV left behind in the 5m tanks.\n\nEdit: Oh hey, MJ has the ability to show deltaV expended, makes recording expended deltaV easy, I\u0027m going to restart the attempt so that I can record using that.\n\nEdit2: Crap, having some issues related to Nerteas heat control mod, or maybe NFE, not sure.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T14:00:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T17:46:14Z","Content":"Anyways, part one of the journey, LOADS of images.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
