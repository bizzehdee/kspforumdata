I really REALLY like the lighting changes, they\u0027re simply wonderful. And I love the comets too. That was something I never thought would ever be practical in KSP. And the retextures/new terrain on the planets is phenomenal. I particularly love the new Duna, and The new Tylo. As well, Jool\u0027s new coloring is really nice. I always found the stock green to be just a tad too vibrant. But all this said, there\u0027s something to be said for the stock solar system. If there was a way to add new planets, similarly to Krag\u0027s planet factory, with these awesome retextures and terrain upgrades, with new names, new orbits and new characteristics, leaving the stock system mostly intact, that\u0027d be awesome. Or maybe once interstellar travel is implemented. But I\u0027m rambling. What I\u0027m saying is that I really love this mod, but for now I\u0027d like to keep the default solar system. I\u0027d really like it if I could have the stock system with that lighting though, and if comets could somehow be added that\u0027d be great! All in all, I think this is absolutely fantastic work!
