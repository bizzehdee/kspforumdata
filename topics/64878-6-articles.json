I am still having trouble getting the \u0022tinted\u0022 visor to not be solid. I switch them out and they are still solid. I wanted to be sure they were transparent so I opened them in photoshop and all looks good. Not sure why I\u0027m having problems with that. I added some more mods now that I\u0027m up and running with the textures, but no compressor or FPS tweak.\u003Cp\u003EJust an idea for your custom non-real suits. Here is a kerbal states suit I messed with some, but the main test wast to see if I could make a see through decal on the visor. Since my visors are not coming in see through the decal is very bright. But I like how it reacts wit the light. It disappears in the shade, but as you spin to the light it becomes bright and visible. This gave me a good idea ;-) More to follow...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, pay attention that the map for the visor is duplicated on the sides, so what ever you put on it will be on the sides too, as you can see the emblem on the edge of the visor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis visor is the tinted one, I messed with in photoshop.
