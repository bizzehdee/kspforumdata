This is my second day playing ksp. as the title says i have problems with those parts. After a few sucessful basic builds i wanted to build something advanced, and i decided to put a few\u00A0separators / decouplers. But for some reason,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen i accelarate the engine and press space to start it, it just activates the\u00A0separators and decouplers and the whole ship becomes unusable. Im testing the parts with a 3 part spaceship: a pod, a liquid tank and a behemoth engine. i put 1-1 seperator on the ends of the liquid tank and when i want to start the engine the spacebar just activates the 2 separators\u00A0 one after another. No matter in what order they are in the bottom left corner the engine wont start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-06T16:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using engines that require a liquid fuel, then you will need to throttle up (Z key).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacemen2.4","CreatedById":224586,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-06T16:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi. i already wrote in my post that i accelarate my engine. after the throttle is on max i press space to take off but it just activates the\u00A0 separators and tha pod falls off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224216199\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211337\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221673022457\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204997\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Echo__3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, Echo__3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using engines that require a liquid fuel, then you will need to throttle up (Z key).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-06T17:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should check your staging, in particular make sure that the little \u0022separator\u0022 icon is in a stage \u003Cstrong\u003Eabove\u003C/strong\u003E the one the \u0022engine\u0022 icon is.
