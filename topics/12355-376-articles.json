None of this has corrected this new problem at all. I\u0027m unsure if it even relates to MJ directly or if I\u0027m getting the issue from somewhere else, but the only variable I\u0027ve changed recently was Mechjeb settings, so if there is any other possibility, I\u0027m at a loss to know what it could be. Any help with this new issue would be greatly appreciated as I rely too heavily on MJ to simply go without at this stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T07:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketScientist00\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketScientist00\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks.

I should also note that ships that performed flawlessly for me in the past are now exhibiting this behavior so it is something more general than node tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It also appears to be something limited to a specific install of the game and not really the fault of MJ in particular as a test install I put together to try and narrow down the cause of my RCS issue does not display the same behavior. I guess I will have to figure out where this conflict comes from before continuing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I can also confirm that the original RCS issue is directly related to MechJeb as using RCS only to make attitude changes through MJ results in the same overuse of monopropellant as I was experiencing in a fully modded build, though at a much lower rate. I think that the core issue lies with MJ, but then it is drastically exacerbated by the changes that Real Fuels brings to RCS thrusters / fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T08:48:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T08:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how you did your re-install but have a look at the cfg in gameData/Mechjeb/plugin/plugindata/Mechjeb (or something like that).
