If you can\u0027t get it that far, then I suggest you practice a bit more. Three landers and a rover are included, utilizing all three types of stock landing legs. This rocket uses the Direct Ascent Mun mission, which, although no longer necessary since 0.18, remains my personal favorite Mun mission in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImgur album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/pR9PF#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/pR9PF#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/mun-expedition/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/mun-expedition/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch in a standard manner, zero degree inclination, prograde. Next, transfer to the Mun. If you don\u0027t know how to do this, I suggest you watch Scott Manley\u0027s video\u0027s and steer away from Mun rockets for the present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in Mun orbit, detach first the mini lander, then the small lander by pressing [space]. You can land these wherever you like, just be advised that the small lander may not have enough fuel to return to Kerbin, and it definitely has no parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, land the main lander ship, hopefully close enough to the small lander that you can get all your Kerbonauts home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on the ground, detach the buggy by pressing [space]. It is recommended that you first transfer most of the fuel from the buggy sky crane tanks into the main ship, as they have way more fuel than they need. After the buggy is on the ground, press [space] to detach the sky crane tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can unload your Kerbals from your capsule, and walk around on the surface. Maybe you will need the buggy to get your third Kerbal over to the main ship, or maybe not. It depends on your skill and your patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are done on the Mun, boost your ship into orbit and return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Manfredatee\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
