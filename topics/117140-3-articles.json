However, doing a full reinstall after upgrading is probably a good idea if you want to get a 100% \u0022out-of-the-box\u0022 experience without any left over stuff from the older version. It should work just fine without a reinstall though."},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T08:50:48Z","Content":"One more question, I\u0027m running Windows 8.1.

Should I use File History for backups, or System Image Recovery?\n\nI honestly don\u0027t know as I\u0027ve never used either one of those. I\u0027d say the easiest and most foolproof option is to just copy all the important stuff onto a USB hard drive (or to a NAS drive if you have one).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I am getting nothing from that media creation tool its been running for hours with zero percent progress\n\nFirst, make sure your computer is up to date and that it meets the requirements (these can be viewed through the \u0022Get Windows 10\u0022 app), and then try again. If MCT still doesn\u0027t work, you can try the \u0022wuauclt.exe /updatenow\u0022 method. If that also fails, it\u0027s probably best to backup your stuff, do a clean reinstall of Windows, install all the updates and then use MCT to upgrade. This is what I did when it refused to upgrade my existing installation."},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T09:48:13Z","Content":"I just want to download an ISO but of course you just cant download an ISO you have to go through some convoluted process and use a microsoft tool to do what is a very basic process which of course isnt working"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:04:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just want to download an ISO but of course you just cant download an ISO you have to go through some convoluted process and use a microsoft tool to do what is a very basic process which of course isnt working\n\nThere is no ISO. If you want to upgrade, you have to do it through MCT or Windows Update. MCT can also create a bootable USB or DVD for you. How is it in any way \u0022convoluted\u0022? Download the program, open it, select either one of the two options, hit next and let it take care of the rest.\n\nLike I said in my previous post, if any of those methods aren\u0027t working, there is probably something wrong with your computer and you should reinstall Windows 7/8.1 and all available updates and then upgrade to 10. Or you can keep banging your head against the wall - you might get it to work eventually, but seriously, this is the easiest and quickest way. It\u0027ll take a few hours, but after it\u0027s done, you can create a USB/DVD installer and use that if you ever need to reinstall it again."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:12:16Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to ask you guys if I should buy an ssd and install win10 on it.
