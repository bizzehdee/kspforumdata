Maybe OP you just found shuttle design easy, but I think most of us find it one of the most challenging designs. I certainly did! It would be nice to see your designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a shuttle look-a-like is one thing, if its really small and without payload then its is prob not too hard (still tricky thou), but to get one able to carry payloads is really tough. I found it much much harder than building a payload carrying SSTO and my SSTO is still able to take a greater payload than my shuttle (and for a lot less fuel!). It took me several attempts, often ending up with giving up and doing something else for a while before I got it (using the infernal robotics mod to allow the engines to adjust their angle -\u0026gt; ultra gimble!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I found most difficult was dealing with the separation of the boosters. If the main engines balance the boosters then once the boosters run out there is a sudden shift in center of thrust. If I tried to compensate by throttling back the main engines as the boosters separated then I didn\u0027t have enough thrust to maintain ascent. If I turned the thrust of the boosters down so the difference between booster and engine was less then I could balance it, but the rate of climb was too low. In the end my solution was to have the engines pivot on hinges (which didn\u0027t work when I first tried it with damned robotics, but the infernal robotics hinges are better). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring launch they face almost directly down, but as the boosters become lighter I gradually angle them in towards the boosters, then at the moment of booster separation they swing out into a more classic shuttle style position; facing away from the external tank. Then they pretty much stay like that till the external tank is nearly empty and then they return to a more central position. I know this is not \u0022right\u0022 in terms of mimicking the real shuttle, but it works! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry if incoherent, I\u0027m half asleep!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cakeofruit","CreatedById":73238,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T10:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKatateoshi try to lower your booster it Will reduce the pitch madness !

Building a symmetrical shuttle is easy, just build a rocket-powered spaceplane, slap some drop tanks and detachable SRBs on the end of the wings, strut and fuel line it up enough, and launch vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding a space shuttle lookalike is hard. The only reason the actual one was balanced (thanks to the forums for helping me figure this out by the way), is because the main engines of the orbiter were angled so they passed through the centre of mass of both the orbiter and the main fuel tank. Setting this up in KSP is incredibly fiddly, and although some people might enjoy it, I know for me it wasn\u0027t worth the time and effort for the amount of fun and satisfaction it would provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
