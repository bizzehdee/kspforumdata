Use the Kerbal Foundries Anti-Gravioli Repulsors.***\n\n- You must use the suspension-mounted kind, not the surface-mounted kind.\n- They must be visible during flight. They cannot be placed in any fairing, service bay, or other container intended to reduce drag.\n\n***2. Use any two of the following stock air-breathing engines:***\n\n- J-33 Wheesley.\n- J-X4 Whiplash.\n- R.A.P.I.E.R.\n\nYour engine choice determines your race category. Do not mix and match!\n\n(Note: Whiplashes and R.A.P.I.E.R.s are considered the same engine for this challenge, as their performance is similar.)\n\n*No other engine is allowed.*\n\nRCS thrusters are permitted.\n\n***3. Wings are prohibited.***\n\n- Up to two control surfaces, with a lift rating of 0.5 each, are permitted. This includes A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.\n\n***4. Cheats are prohibited. This includes but is not limited to:***\n\n- All mods that are overpowered or \u0022cheats\u0022 by their creator\u0027s admission.\n- Using the cheats in the Alt-F12 menu, such as Infinite Fuel, Infinite RCS, and Hack Gravity.\n\n***5. All other mods are allowed, regardless of purpose.***\n\n**Race Rules**\n\n***1. There are two heats for this race: The Wheesley class, and the Whiplash class.***\n\n- If your craft uses J-33 Wheesley engines, you will compete among other Wheesley craft.\n- If your craft uses J-X4 Whiplash or R.A.P.I.E.R. engines, you will complete among other Whiplash craft.\n\n***2. To start the race:***\n\n- Click the Air-Race button to show the Air-Race window.\n- Click the \u0022I Want to Race!\u0022 button at the bottom of the window.\n- Proceed to the Start gate. The race begins when you pass through it.\n\n***3. You must touch down at least once per gate.*** \n\n- A touch-down is when your repulsors are actively repulsing the ground.\n\n***4. You must pass through all 10 gates and the Finish gate.***\n\n***5. Neither your craft nor your Kerbals may sustain damage.***\n\n***6. The fastest craft in each class is the winner.***\n\n**Assorted Accolades**\n\nWe will also be recognizing the following entries:\n\n- ***The Coolest Looking Design***   \n(as judged by Cuzican Aerospace)\n- ***The Weirdest Looking Design***   \n(as judged by Cuzican Aerospace)\n- ***The Most Massive Craft***   \n(according to the Craft Stats menu, MechJeb, or KER)\n\nAll entries in this challenge are automatically entered into the Coolest/Weirdest contest. \n\nTo enter in the Most Massive Craft contest, take a screenshot of the Craft Stats menu (\u0022i\u0022 icon in the lower right corner of the Editor) and include it with your entry.\n\n*You must successfully complete the challenge to be eligible!*\n\n**How To Enter**\n\n***Post a reply to this thread with:***\n\n- A video clip of the race, with the Air-Race window open from start to finish.  \nIf you do not have a VGR already, a free recommendation is Open Broadcaster Software: [https://obsproject.com/](https://obsproject.com/)\n\n***Optionally, you may include:***\n\n- A screenshot of your Craft Stats menu for this craft.\n- A link to the .craft file.\n- Assorted comments as appropriate.

XD\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m trying to get a completed race before I start recording with this redesigned craft (which is a speedy little thing), or maybe I\u0027ll start recording anyway, I dunno.\n\nCone clipping is OK, if only because I really don\u0027t want to rules-lawyer this challenge to death. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnd greydragon70\u0027s advice is pretty good--that\u0027s what I typically try to do, with some success, more or less.\n\nAs for whether to record--that depends on whether you\u0027re up for posting your failures later. Sometimes the failures are more spectacular than the successes.\n\nAnd the video footage I\u0027ve got... well, I have a certain pop-culture parody in mind that has been attempted in KSP a couple of times, but mine\u0027s got enough of a twist that I think it\u0027ll be particularly funny."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:00:25Z","Content":"I didn\u0027t start recording the screwups/crashes until after I finished a first run.\n\nAnyways, heres my first attempt with the whiplash engine, 3min 9secs, I\u0027m going to try and do better.\n\nEdit: I was actually airborne quite a lot, but I tried to get ground contact at least once between gates.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LCWe6C3LkI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s my piloting skills or my craft is simply unable to do the drift between gates 4 and 5, or rather the transition between gates 3 and 4 because those keep getting me as far as time.\n\nEdit: Are there categories for wounded finishes?
