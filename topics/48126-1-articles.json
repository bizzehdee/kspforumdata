I\u0027ve been using adapters to utilize HOME\u0027s 3m end leg struts, but the issue is in landing the thing. Any engines I use for retrorocketing send the craft into this painful-to-watch spin, and parachutes just end up disintegrating the craft when they pop open. So does anyone have any practical advice on getting this done or should I pursue alternate methods?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T15:20:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 03:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ravyne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T02:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParachutes won\u0027t destroy an assemblage if you 1) distribute their attachment points so the shock isn\u0027t concentrated, 2) mix drogues with regular chutes so that they don\u0027t all open at once, 3) open the chutes in sets with action groups, or 4) some combination of the preceeding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stormwynde","CreatedById":78445,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T08:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re trying to come at something horizontally (to dock?), instead of legs, use wheels.
