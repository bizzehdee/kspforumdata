By perfect I mean that your apoapsis and periapsis almost do not move. I know that with the default nav ball you cannot do it because the nav ball doesn\u0027t account for the fact that normal and anti-normal moves as you burn. If there was a way to mod it or just eyeball it and you guys know, I would appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T23:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on how you define \u0022perfect\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You can easily get to NaN\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 with a bit of maneuver node fumbling (NaN\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 because of a programming limitation, AFAIK.

For minor changes, the change in altitudes is negligible. On larger changes, you experience the \u0022dip and recover\u0022 (plane changes as was mentioned earlier). The \u0022perfect\u0022 maneuver would deliver the dV in an instant. Since this is not practical, we calculate the midpoint of the burn and extend the beginning and end from there. (If nothing else, KSP has taught me to divide time in half very well!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis phenomena can best be experienced by attempting such a maneuver with differing propulsion systems. Let\u0027s say I... I mean this Kerbal was orbiting the Mun equator. This Kerbal wants to change to a 45 degree inclination but only has about 100 dV left on my rocket engine. No problem, the mission plan included a large amount of RCS. Once the motor quits, it is ejected and we finish the maneuver with RCS. Great plan, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the engine quits and is ejected, we are far into the \u0022dip\u0022.
