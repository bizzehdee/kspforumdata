It seems to only have 4 (maybe 5) and yet it is the first interplanetary location that most players are going to look at getting surface samples from. Eve seems to have twice as many, and yet you won\u0027t be coming back from there until you\u0027re deep into the game (if ever). Looking at Duna\u0027s varied surface, it is ripe for more; that nice big canyon is obvious, and the poles could be separated into north and south for two new ones right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you can argue that Ike makes up the other half of biomes for Duna\u0027s SOI, and in fact it has \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E biomes than Duna itself - but who wants to drive a rover around on \u003Cem\u003EIke\u003C/em\u003E... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T16:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat Ike point is a good one indeed, but honestly 5 biomes is plenty to do all the science from Duna.

Sure, you can kind of rove around on Mun, but since wheels are kinda deep in the tree and hard to deliver, you may have used all the biomes up by the time you can put a rover up. Players will almost certainly have rovers around for Duna though - but why bother if there aren\u0027t that many biomes to explore? :S\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T16:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s one more why it should have more biomes - driving 200km between them would be more financially favourable than launching two missions, but most bodies make this concept impractical. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAha, but what if you land your missions on the border of the biomes?
