Iwe been using the beta since it came out some time ago. The only thing i had a bit of trouble with is the vertical toolbar menu. It is just a tad too small on my 4k screen and it dont scale up well(becomes grainy) its also especcially difficult to see the text on it with any other theme than the default one. But im happy to live with it because of all the additional improvements made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T19:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes it include anything that\u0027s useful for mod makers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T23:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
