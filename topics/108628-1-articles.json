Test Mk16 parachute between 17000 and 25000m @ 400 - 800 m/s\n\n2. Test Radial Parachute between 19000 and 24000 @ 500 - 1000 m/s\n\nI thought the best thing to do was to run the two tests at once by aiming for 19km - 24km @ 500 - 800 m/s.\n\nBasically, the parachutes ended up overheating on deployment and Jeb died. I had decided to test the parachutes on the way up as I felt that that gave me a better control over speed. I also separated my engines in the same stage so I couldn\u0027t shut them down and my speed went to about 1200m/s.\n\nMy question is; was the test contract doomed to failure or was it my piloting?\n\nIn a way, I can understand why there would be a mechanic to allow certain parts not to stand up to the tests that they are faced with (that is probably the point of having a test). It does seem a bit unreasonable to the player though."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaia","CreatedById":95282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:01:09Z","Content":"At all, I would say it is your fault.\n\nAs you said, your seperated the engines without shutting them down, mistake no. 1\n\nBoth chute tests in one run is nothing bad, but you should add an emergency chute. \n\nYou could try to tilt your capsule with SAS, if your engine is not too strong, it will wobble the engine away."},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:02:08Z","Content":"With the new aerodynamics, it is best to use a probe core for testing or keep a parachute reserved for safe recovery of your test pilot.

The chute just needs to be staged in the right conditions, but doesn\u0027t actually need to deploy or semi-deploy. Similar to how engine parts don\u0027t need to actually run (and don\u0027t even need fuel), but simply need to be staged.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:05:39Z","Content":"They overheated when you opened them, or they overheated because you kept accelerating because you didn\u0027t shut down your engine?\n\nIf 1, it\u0027s the flight profile or some other factor.\n\nIf 2, it\u0027s your piloting."},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:54:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They overheated when you opened them, or they overheated because you kept accelerating because you didn\u0027t shut down your engine?\n\u003E If 1, it\u0027s the flight profile or some other factor.\n\u003E \n\u003E If 2, it\u0027s your piloting.\n\nThey didn\u0027t open until after my engines had burnt out, I hit my apoapsis and then semi deployed on descent.
