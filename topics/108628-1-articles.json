I had decided to test the parachutes on the way up as I felt that that gave me a better control over speed. I also separated my engines in the same stage so I couldn\u0027t shut them down and my speed went to about 1200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is; was the test contract doomed to failure or was it my piloting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a way, I can understand why there would be a mechanic to allow certain parts not to stand up to the tests that they are faced with (that is probably the point of having a test).
