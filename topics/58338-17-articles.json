The reason for this is the fact that the wheel deploy/retract status really doesn\u0027t have to correspond with the current status of the gear action group, so sometimes you have to hit the gear AG twice for it to properly synchronize. You\u0027ve probably occasionally run into this within KSP just using the gear AG manually. As far as I can tell, \u0027fixing\u0027 this with Smart Parts would require iterating through all of the parts on the current craft to figure out the status of the landing gear. Doable, but... messy. You can, however, use normal AGs for gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eodh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eodh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s a suggestion for tech tree along with a CTT (Community Tech Tree) config:\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestion, eodh!
