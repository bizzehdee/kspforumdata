I\u0027ve been playing KSP since 0.18, I know how to land a ship. But when it came to landing on the Mun\u00A0 it took me 4 attempts, all because the legs either kept bouncing and flipped the ship, or the legs got \u0027stuck\u0027 in the ground and exploded. It didn\u0027t matter if I set SPRING and DAMPEN to AUTO or changed them manually, the effects were often the same. I even tested a lander on the Launch Pad (just loaded in from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) and while it was stationary I changed the leg\u00A0 DAMPEN/SPRING settings and they just spontaneously exploded. Frankly I never had this issue in 1.2.2, I don\u0027t even now what the difference is between DAMPEN and SPRING; in my head they do the same job. They\u0027re just absorbing the impact. Why have both?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy landers usually consist of the Mk1-2 pod, and have over 2500 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. They use the heaviest, most robust legs. I was landing with 30mm/s of horizontal speed and 3m/s of vertical (manually), and the legs still didn\u0027t like it. Just what the heck is going on? It\u0027s got to the point now where I dread having to land anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-30T08:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83805-timkerbin/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002283805\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83805-timkerbin/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TimKerbin\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I havnt played much with 1.6 yet I have read that they are still a little \u0022delicate\u0022 shall we say.

You can test this on the launch pad by making a very small test rocket....get to a low height (2km maybe) then go thru a landing procedure to see what\u0027s best on landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrustrating I agree yet also could make for a new breed of designs \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, take a look at this thread, may help you more than I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1604973998\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/180835-how-many-landing-legs/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:225px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-30T08:56:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2018 08:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
