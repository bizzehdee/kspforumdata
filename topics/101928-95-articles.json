Build basic rovercar in free play mode.\n\n2. Add a couple of basic tools and components with near no mass (eg. ground pylon) to the pilots inventory.\n\n3. Deploy to runway\n\n4. EVA and get on the ground\n\n5. Open inventory and try to drag ground pylon or other part out into the world.\n\nResult: Error message pops up.\n\nI tried taking a vanilla unmodded KSP 1.1.2 and installing KIS \u0026 KAS in their freshly released versions (from curse) into that installation. In this case there was no problem, it works and i can attach a ground pylon to the surface of Kerbin with no error message appearing when i drag it out of the inventory.\n\nSo i went problem hunting. Turns out that for me it\u0027s caused by combining KIS/KAS with TweakScale\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101540-112-tweakscale-v229apr-30-fixes-and-recompile/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAs soon as i added KIS/KAS and TweakScale to the vanilla copy of KSP 1.1.2 the problem pops up. I have a long mod list so i dont know if other things than tweakscale causes issues, but for me KIS/KAS \u0026 TweakScale do not seem to play well together.\n\nAny chance for an update to KIS/KAS that\u0027ll fix it so it\u0027ll play nice with TweakScale? Or is it more likely that the problem lies in TweakScale itself?\n\nI imagine that since TweakScale can dynamically scale items (including mass and such) up and down the issue may stem from something to do with this? (I\u0027m guessing here though, i have no insight into the inner workings of TweakScale).\n\nI\u0027d hate to have to give up either KIS/KAS or TweakScale as both of them are quite important for the playthrough i have in mind with 1.1 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sekh","CreatedById":163435,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T21:23:05Z","Content":"I\u0027ve also posted to the issue tracker on GitHub for KIS where others have described the same issue.\n\nThought i\u0027d link it here, since someone else just confirmed that TweakScale combined with KIS/KAS also caused the problem for them!\n\n[https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/131?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/131?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container)"},{"CreatedByName":"Festivejelly","CreatedById":37420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T21:30:40Z","Content":"If I wanted to give other kerbals limited control to attach stuff, such as everyone being able to use the wrench but only the engineer able to use the screw driver, is this possible?   \n\nMy thoughts are normally all astronauts are trained for maintenance, but you may get one who\u0027s a specialist engineer that could do more complicated stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T21:52:13Z","Content":"Cannot attach Concrete Base to Minmus surface with H-key.

Glad to hear that the bug is hunted down! Since my, lets say, Kraken meetings recently I don\u0027t really use KAS for docking yet. Its not related to KAS but to the whole docking system (as I mentioned earlier). So why would I tease the cosmic beast?  \n\nBUT. Yesterday I tried to replace a telescope (just a part) on my station. That involved detaching it and reattaching without putting into inventory. And it.. worked. No error messages, no mass limit messages. Just for you to know - maybe it helps somehow. But as you said the bug has been fixed now.. meh. Nevermind then! xD  \n\nBTW I have never encountered the cloning bug. How do you guys do it? I could find a use for two Jebs! lol  \n\nI have a small question though. I have zero experience in ksp mod development but recently I talked to the DR developer to fix an issue with KIS - they were conflicting a few days ago. Its fixed now though. But.. It seemed that DR somehow failed to properly finish executing some OnUpdate() method - it threw a NRE exception or something, I can\u0027t really tell. My understanding is that some mods subscribe to the lets say internal message queue or an event so OnUpdate or any other similar callback that they implement will be called. I guess KSP chains it - like when you have a bunch of listeners and just iterate over them and call their respective callbacks (like OnUpdate()). The question is: isn\u0027t it wrapped in the try-catch block? One mod throws the exception and other subscribers\u0027 callbacks will never get called. I may be completely wrong about the internal subscriber/callback mechanism though. Thanks in advance. xD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-03T10:21:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2016 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by atomontage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JWS","CreatedById":136190,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T12:05:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, IgorZ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you everyone for helping tracking the bug with the inventory.
