Movement would be first person through the same control scheme as jetpack, including being able to grab onto ladders. You could interact with individual sciencey bits in the science lab, and maybe some command pods might have special features. Maybe the Cupola would have a control panel for a robotic arm, and you could only control the robotic arm in IVA with a Cupola? Maybe the Hitchhiker Storage Container has a map-view computer built into it. When on the surface of a planet, walking is based on the orientation of the pod. And if the pod is spun up, then you should be able to walk against the centrifugal force."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T13:58:50Z","Content":"While a nice idea, I think I would be fine with just double click at certain space to move there(camera angle change like now, but also moving the actual kerbal to a different seat away from piloting seats), instead of full fledged IVA interaction."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T14:30:43Z","Content":"If the hatch in the first picture is the same we see externally, they look big because the scale is wrong.
