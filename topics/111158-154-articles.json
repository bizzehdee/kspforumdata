No. Maybe. Most of the time.\n\nWell, maybe it is for the moderators here on this well behaved forum filled with friendly pseudo-anonymous internet folk. Moderating the hobby forum I\u0027m partly responsible for? It\u0027s filled with folks that are arguably friends, questionably adults, all of which know each other, the vast majority of which would be well behaved in face to face encounters.
