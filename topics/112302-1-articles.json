The in-situ verification of the presence of a breathable atmosphere in Laythe, coupled with the long experience of the program sending orbital laboratories missions and descending on Gilly, Duna and Ike that had been developed in parallel by the pupil of Henry, Andrea, laboratories like these:\n\n![EZ3sXU1.png](http://i.imgur.com/EZ3sXU1.png)\n\nNow, after all this time, it has released the latest resupply mission to the second laboratory using Recover 1 spacecraft.\n\nFor this mission have not been reused old laboratories, Ike Lab and Eve Lab, which are in a very eccentric and out of fuel in orbit of Kerbin, we have launched new laboratories, designed to maximize the scientific return, giving them the ability to land on airless bodies of Jool system.\n\nShips for the mission:\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Joolian Labs: Two new modern laboratories with nuclear propulsion designed specifically for this mission. Delta-v possess sufficient for transfer to Jool, braking on the system, transfer to another system and landing body. (1, Intrepid and 2, Acheron).\n\n![IViN43O.png](http://i.imgur.com/IViN43O.png)\n\n![64AYrTQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/64AYrTQ.png)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Joolian fuel processors: Two twin spacecraft designed to land on the surface of one of the satellites and begin generating fuel.

At 14 kilometers high, expelled Gerbus from command module and ordered him to use all its fuel to try to stabilize its orbit, unfortunately, it didn\u0027t work and both crashed into the surface of Mun. \n\nOn the last minute, few seconds before crashing, Gerbus sent his last message to his mothership, that we recovered from the black box by the second processor mission. The message was \u0022I love you\u0022. Now, on their crashing site, a flag stills remembering future kerbonauts the importance of love... And check your engines.\n\nAboard the ships that will head to Jool, are 10 of our most courageous kerbonauts.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Jendi Kerman: Woman, pilot, level 3; famous for being the first kerbal to set foot Duna aboard the Spirit Duna Lander, his feat has not been repeated.

They landed on ike and the fuel remaining wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enough for reach kerbin (it was planned add an extra detachable tank of fuel, but we weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t able to afford that.\n\n**ACHERON LAB, TRANSFER\u0027S DAY**\n\n-Here Acheron, applying double A communication priority. Here Dunfield Kerman, control center, are you there?\n\n\u0022Affirmative, Acheron, here control center requesting status report.\u0022\n\n-Center Control, the entire redundant computers has given the green light for the operation. Requesting permission to turn on the twin reactors and start pumping liquid fuel to them, I repeat, we request permission to initialize the twin-\u0022NERV\u0022 system.\n\n\u0022Dunfield, you are allowed to initialize the system. When engines were activated, communications will be cutted. We can not reestablish contact for another two hours. Good luck, Acheron. \u0022\n\n\u0022Acheron, here Intrepid, we thank you that you should go first to check if the engines are so defective as it says by another companies, good luck, see you in Jool.\u0022\n\n\u0022Acheron, here Prometehus Requiem, thanks to pave the way, we\u0027ll see shortly, Sherdas, short and close\u0022.\n\nLaboratory\u0027s twin engines began to drive preheated hydrogen in the two nuclear furnaces of the ship. The Acheron was barreled toward the stars.\n\n**INTREPID, 10 DAYS LATER** \n\n-Elwig From EVA, Jendi, get me?\n\n\u0022Here Jendi, what is the level of the reactor?\u0022\n\n-State Normal, it is ready for a boost of 55 minutes before exploding if you activate the control computer.\n\n\u0022KSC, here Jendi Kerman from the Intrepid, requesting permission to begin the quantum processing system, I repeat, I request permission to enable Intrepid Artificial Intelligence to manage the twin reactors\u0022.\n\n\u0022Here, KSC, before starting the IA, we order disconnect all telemetry systems or sending data except the E-34, we do not wan that the IA has the power to contaminate any computer on kerbin.\u0022\n\nAffirmative, KSC, disconnect all antennas, starting Intrepid autonomous management, Elwig, I need you here with your control key.\n\nElwig appeared 30 minutes later at the control room of the Intrepid. Jendi was waiting with her respective key.\n\n-Elwig, we\u0027re going to insert the key into the slot and the turn it on 3, ready?\n\n1, 2 and ... 3!\n\nA large screen that until then was off suddenly came alive, command lines and data lines urged her and after thirty seconds of waiting, a voice came from the speakers.\n\nGood morning, Jendi, good morning Elwig is a pleasure to be back with you. Shall we start?\n\n\u0027Of course, Gerbus, we need controls the nuclei of the NERV and provide us a stable output.\n\n-OK, it is a pleasure to work in space ... How long will I be on this time? Can I contact Tebe and Val?\n\nYou\u0027ll be active throughout the mission, Gerbus, we\u0027re going to need you in top form for collecting data. Tebe is in the Acheron and Val in the Prometheus. You can contact them once we get out of the sphere of influence of Kerbin.\n\nNow, start the transfer.\n\nAnd from telescopes located all throughout the night hemisphere of kerbin, two long tails similar to comet\u0027s ones eclipsed the sky.\n\n**A few years earlier, Eve Lab mission.**\n\n-Elwig, Your requesteddata are aboard the laboratory. You can now access them- Jendi said.- Are you sure about this?\n\n-I Have not been more sure of anything in my life, Jendi, we must do this, I need to do this.\n\nA month later, Elwig had dismantled half of the non-essential components of laboratory and linking to the central computer of the ship and a brain scan taken before Munar Prospector mission had revived the mind of the missing scientist.\n\nThe Laythe lander and Charon freighter were boosted at same time, and Prometheus R\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9quiem 4 days after that, activating Val computing system when they were out of range of Kerbin\u0027s sensors.\n\nTest Type Burn:\n\n![iLxTDXi.png](http://i.imgur.com/iLxTDXi.png)\n\n![Uw9tfXi.png](http://i.imgur.com/Uw9tfXi.png)\n\nPrometheus Burn:\n\n![vCio02N.png](http://i.imgur.com/vCio02N.png)\n\n![LypT7kP.png](http://i.imgur.com/LypT7kP.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"stellarator","CreatedById":92423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T13:17:49Z","Content":"Here Eugene Kerman, from the news service broadcast to all kerbals in kerbin, the crew of the research station in low Kerbin orbit, the three crew members of the Duna Lab and all the intrepid kerbonauts who are going to Jool System.\n\nWe have great news, the high-speed path of Prometheus Requiem has been a success and is ready to make air braking in Jool after its gravity assist near Tylo, Sherdas and Cerlee Kerman have already done some extravehicular activities becoming the first kerbals to enter on Jool\u0027s SOI and perform EVA in the space around it.\n\n![AvvbK0Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/AvvbK0Z.png)\n\n![HnwKIcI.png](http://i.imgur.com/HnwKIcI.png)\n\n![O1Fn0PK.png](http://i.imgur.com/O1Fn0PK.png)\n\n![4hFWNzv.png](http://i.imgur.com/4hFWNzv.png)\n\nIn another vein, the two tanks of the Refuel Duna Lab mission are in orbit and ready to make its final maneuver and get in trajectory to refuel Duna Lab.\n\nThe launch window will be used to launch a second Duna lander, this already with docking capability, which will remain in orbit for Duna for use by future missions.\n\n**Prometheus Requiem, entering the upper atmosphere Jool.**\n\n-Cerlee, Prepare for aerobraking, we are entering in the atmosphere.\n\nVal, adjusts the coordinates of orbital insertion, set up a meeting with laythe, let\u0027s see if the JSM can send more data.\n\n\u0022Ear Sherdas, preparing coordinates for orbit insertion, enabling RCS control of the ship.

They were the first and probably the last they would do something like that.\n\n![skYPRyS.png](http://i.imgur.com/skYPRyS.png)\n\n![QlIzy3w.png](http://i.imgur.com/QlIzy3w.png)\n\nBill came out first and ran to the module, after three hours, had managed to reconnect the refining system and solar panels to the control module, unfortunately, the drills had been completely destroyed, the refueling station had failed.\n\n![ckTCYDF.png](http://i.imgur.com/ckTCYDF.png)\n\nMeanwhile, both pilots had gathered all available surface science and from the nearby sea, ready to carry them to Kerbin for detailed study.\n\nAfter two days on the surface, all the crew returned to the ship and began the ascent.\n\n1.2 kilometers on Eve\n\n![mxw6be3.png](http://i.imgur.com/mxw6be3.png)\n\n-Tralenna, we are high enough, you can disconnect the systems of free ascent and put the engine in normal mode, I want maximum performance, right? Jeb said.\n\n-You want initiate TRANS-AM? In the dense atmosphere of Eve?\n\n-Oh, no, just put them in normal maximum performance.\n\n-Roger, Jeb, initiating particle systems, preparing countdown to the switch to normal mode, 30 seconds, blocking and initiating countdown time.\n\n-10 Seconds, Hold on and ... Oh, no!\n\n-what\u0027s Up?\n\n-The engines have turned TRANS-AM on on their own.\n\n-it\u0027s Not possible.\n\n-That will kill us, right?\n\n-Yes, Bill, that will kill us ...\n\nLander\u0027s engines were pulled TRANS-AM mode, accelerating to four times its normal rate and destroying the ship in the process.\n\n5 minutes later, from the mother ship, it was reported that two unidentified objects, emitting GN particles at an alarming rate, were leaving the atmosphere of Eve at 18 times the speed of sound and accelerating.\n\nThe unknowns are multiplied and several heads rolled on the incident that killed three of our best kerbonauts."},{"CreatedByName":"stellarator","CreatedById":92423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:03:41Z","Content":"**FIRST INTERLUDE**\n\n**In some unknown place, Kerbin, Territory of the Federation of the West.** \n\n*-Thank you for doing that for me, all the people would appreciate it if they knew what happened.* \n\n*-No mention it, sir, our duty is to obey ...
