And like you said, more elegantly than i would have, the almighty dollar played a roll. Im not a console player but I totally feel and understand their pain. How many early access games have you bought on steam for example that never got fixed or had bugs. You dont like it because, well, you spent money on it right? And you wait and you wait hoping then a update comes out and it still isnt right so you wait some more. Will your next post on their forums be full of joy and excitement? What do you think that next post they make is gonna be like? I dont call it anything but a natural human reaction. But here is a plushie for your troubles. At that point do you care about the plushie or the game you paid for and have been waiting for to be fixed?

Solar system already has some difficulty progression between different planets which can be used in some way to encourage flying to other celestial bodies and their points of interest to progress in some way through technology and funding. I don\u0027t know what exactly can be done as it has to be tested first on focus group, but it can be even some different kind of science you can get with different instruments in different places to progress through different tiers or branches so you can\u0027t just collect it all in single place.
