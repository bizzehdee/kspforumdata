How hard could it be? =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what i could do is add some lazors that point towards the ground and spawn an ASAS tuning system that slightly tilts the vessel towards a horizontal position.

If i don\\\u0027t have engines activated while doing this, the command pod floats through the vessel slowly until it hits the ground and explodes.

So it\\\u0027s just a matter of adding a big crosshair overlay to show the target point in relation to the vessels direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the remote control it is actually possible to make the vessel and the target align automatically, so the trick would be to make this process \u0027difficult\u0027 enough to make it a fun part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve almost finished the autopilot/mouse control thing for airplanes, just struggeling with a oscillation issue when controlling the airplane with the mouse. But with how the keyboard control works now it is hardly necessary to use the mouse. And then i\\\u0027m going to change the cyan lazor completely, it will now be a height maintaining device that also looks forward and hopefully makes the airplane avoid crashing into mountains. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T11:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if the two ships are aligned, the player will still need to adjust for any lateral offset as they dock and close the gap to the target, so it may still be enough of a challenge as it won\\\u0027t be (and shouldn\\\u0027t be) automatic, as long as there is the option to keep full control of your ship while keeping the target steady then players who want the extra challenge can fly that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\\\u0027d still like to see mouse flight, the new keyboard trim is great but there are still limitations even when capslock is on, small manoeuvrable craft are still twitchy with the keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the cyan Lazor to a hight maintaining system sounds like a good idea, It probably won\\\u0027t be useful on orbiting craft but that\\\u0027s ok, cyan could just be aircraft specific features such as an altitude hold system (just as you are making) and maybe a Lidar altimeter for correct terrain height (maybe allowing for terrain following), and maybe even a variation of the target cam that can look straight down, like a ww2 bomber \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I have found a possible bug with placement of the Lazor crystals, if they are accidently rotated upside down before the emitter is attached, they attach to the craft with the crystal inside it, making them impossible to remove.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a fault with the crystals as such, as it could happen with any part, but as they are a uniform shape it is impossible to visually determine their top from their bottom, if in the next update you can make the top pointy then that should be enough to prevent this until it\\\u0027s time to make proper models for the Lazor system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
