First, you can get rid of those ugly gaps if you find a consistent way of moving the pieces with the translation gizmo, by rotating the whole station so you always put the new part with the same initial orientation. Also, you can get 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA rotation increments on the rotation gizmo by pressing SHIFT while using it. And to top it off, you don\u0027t really need to only use crew pods, fuel tanks make for a useful depot, that can almost launch itself if you add a rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bsO2EKw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bsO2EKw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bsO2EKw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, with that docking you proved why the supposedly complicated docking maneuver from the Interstellar movie is pretty much trivial. They should have done it on the edge of the spinning ring instead, that takes precision and is much more dramatic. The other day I actually saw it done in Ender\u0027s game, only as a matter of routine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
