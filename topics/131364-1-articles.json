This would suggest your manoeuvres are\u00A0either at the wrong time, or in the wrong order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially, to successfully dock, you firstly need to successfully rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd doing that is, boiled\u00A0down, a two step process:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Plan a\u00A0manoeuvre (probably far away from your target/intercept point) such that the map predicts a very, very close point of intercept - ideally with a separation of\u00A0less than 0.5km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Make the burn to achieve that intercept. \u00A0Once you have arrived 500m (or less) away from your target vessel, then you match your velocity to theirs - essentially putting you on the same orbit as them. And, if you\u0027re in the same orbit and at (nearly) the same point in space you will have (nearly) zero relative velocity - and will have \u0027parked\u0027 next to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe important point here, and this sounds like where you may be going wrong, is that your \u0027slow down\u0027 burn needs to happen after you\u0027ve intercepted the target vessel so you relative velocities are reduced to zero at the same point in space (nearly) where you both are at the same time. - Not during your intercept but at the intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(this is why it can help to be in a relatively similar shaped orbit to start with so that when you converge you\u0027re not travelling in wildly different velocities).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-05T11:03:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2016 11:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wemb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T20:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222393565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454598327\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158055\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pingell1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E2\u200E/\u200E4\u200E/\u200E2016 at 9:05 AM, pingell1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhi i am trying to learn how to dock. i have done the in game tutorial but when i tried it in my career mode, and when i burn\u00A0retrograde\u00A0to slow down my\u00A0interception node\u00A0changes. is there a way to avoid this?\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);line-height:1.6;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really.\u00A0 When you create and fiddle with maneuver nodes on the map, the predicted path you see is under the assumption that the burn happens instantaneously precisely at the node.\u00A0 Problem is, burns actually take a measurable amount of time to perform, so you generally do half the burn before and the other half after you pass the node.\u00A0 When your ship is burning but not exactly at the point of the node, it\u0027s aimed a bit off of the prograge or retrograde direction, which means a bit of the thrust is actually being\u00A0applied along the radial inwards or outwards direction.\u00A0 Radial burns rotate the positions of your Ap and Pe on your orbit relative to where they are now.\u00A0 This necessarily changes the angle of your flightpath slightly from what was originally predicted when you placed the node.\u00A0 Therefore, if you create a node to intercept a target and the predicted closest approach distance is X, after you do the burn, the distance will actually turn out to be Y, somewhat different from X.\u00A0 But you should still be close enough for government work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference between the pre-burn predicted closest approach and the post-burn actual closest approach is minimized when there\u0027s not a big difference in the orbital\u00A0altitudes of you and your target.\u00A0 Still, even a 100-200km difference in altitudes shouldn\u0027t throw you off very much.\u00A0 Even being a few km away from the target when you match speeds is pretty easy to fix by burning directly at the target to so you close in a 30-50m/s until you get a lot closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
