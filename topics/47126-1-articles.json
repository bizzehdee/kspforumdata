Yes, I know, there are a gazillion of these out there. But have I already told you this beauty is only 230 parts on the pad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YSk0ljx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YSk0ljx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YSk0ljx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new lander jumped the part number a bit from the previous 200 parts. (I\u0027m that OCD), but it is still very manageable for slow computers. The thing is, I\u0027ve always liked Apollo replicas. But since I saw Munbug for the first time, I thought I had nothing better to offer people. Since then however, not only has Munbug become wildly popular (first ship that gets stickied and all that), it has also become a lag monster with about 1000 parts. What happens to people with potato computers, they can\u0027t get nice toys to play with? Well here I am to change that! But I also wanted the high fidelity and attention to detail that the Munbug family had, of course. And the building tricks! So a few weeks back, in a fit of inspiration, I put all the ideas together, and set about to create an Apollo replica with a \u003Cem\u003Etight\u003C/em\u003E budget in every way. I think I succeeded! And believe me, I was the first surprised when I noticed this thing actually worked as intended. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe warned, this ship is for players that know their stuff, and has tight margins all around. Just like the real thing! If you find yourself failing with a maneuver, you have probably already have and will have to abort the mission and start thinking up ways to save your kerbals. But now that that\u0027s out of the way, the nerdy details. First off, I knew this would be a mass-limited thing. I just couldn\u0027t afford more than 10 first stage tanks if I had to keep part count low. So, I had my first inspired idea of the day, and used the skippers as F-1 equivalents. That meant poodles for J-2\u0027s, and they actually fit the part quite well. With that, I just had 11 tanks with 11 engines for the whole booster, and I could even afford some fairing eye-candiness. However, a small rocket means a light payload. Then again, NASA also struggled to fit a lunar mission inside the Saturn\u0027s V fairing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E. But by keeping things light and simple (and very tight margins on the lander), we made do, and not one bit of realism suffered for it: as an example, the CM hangs from the fairing, and is not connected to the lander in any way, just like the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen of course I came up with a very stupid-looking lander, but some time off the project, a look at the various other apollo replicas out there, and a fit of inspiration about how to put things together, and a newer and much more sexy lander came about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/NwXdWzN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NwXdWzN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NwXdWzN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I must confess to a slight inaccuracy. Turns out the fuel doesn\u0027t fit 100% perfect with an Apollo flight profile: The S-IVb should have about half/one third of the CM\u0027s fuel. I know, tiny detail, but make sure you do two things: first off, the coast to apoapsis is a very nice time to perform the lander retrieval. You will ditch the upper part of the fairing, keeping space clean, which is always nice, and also you will save precious delta-v for TMI. Mind you, you could also dispose of the fairings after TMI along with the S-IVb, to keep it even more accurate and have time to do the fancy docking maneuvers, but then the decouplers may push the fairings away from a free return trajectory and into the garbage category. Second, before TMI, make sure to top off the S-IVb tank with fuel from the CM. You won\u0027t need all of that, but it\u0027s always nice to not have the maneuver interrupted because you miscalculated. If it happens anyway don\u0027t worry, you have a lot of emergency fuel on the SM, just transfer some more. Call that the checkout Apollo crews had to perform before TMI. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, to comply with the clean space act, the S-IVb is left on a crash course with the Mun, and the mission continues with a stack that would run on a wristwatch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZL8fQtV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZL8fQtV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZL8fQtV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the missions keeps on following (obviously) and Apollo-like profile. I performed the Munar sortie from a 10kmx50km parking orbit, but then again, I managed to land on dry tanks. That actually happened, running out of fuel less than five meters from the surface, and on both test missions, with the new and the old lander. Because of math, and science! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It was an effficient-ish landing with low T/W, so you might want to go slightly lower and never higher, and know your stuff to do good suicide burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hit some snags during development, like landing legs that got lost to the kraken, and a parachute that continued to get ripped apart no matter what.

In the one actually released, I increased Delta-v margins a bit (so you can be sure it can be done, even with a heavier vehicle), and switched the legs to the small ones.
