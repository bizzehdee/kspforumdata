I got to geosync orbit but was on the wrong side of the world and read all i have to do is go up to say 3000km let the planet catch up and come back down. easy as. Im using mechjeb. I just found that button that makes you orbit faster. But for the life of me i cant get back to 2870km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know to some this might seem like a really stupid question but after 3 restart and 4 days im losing the will to live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do i re-orbit???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Rick\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trekkie5249","CreatedById":101242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T19:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot entirely sure I understand your question. Are you trying to just get in to orbit, or is there any other reason you want to go up to 3 million meters?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T19:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s say you are in a circular orbit at 2870km. Your Periapsis and Apoapsis are very similar (but still defined points). These two terms you want to bleach into your memory - Periapsis, lowest point in your orbit - Apoapsis, highest point in your orbit. These two points entirely define your orbital characteristics - how long it takes to complete an orbit, how eccentric it is, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - you found you\u0027re parked on the wrong side of the planet in a geostationary orbit. Bummer - but it\u0027s not the end of the world (or your mission). As you already found out, you can change your orbital period (to let the planet \u0022catch up\u0022) by burning prograde to increase your orbit to 3000km. Here is the magic trick (it\u0027s actually just physics, but to many of us - it looks a lot like magic)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever you are at your Periapsis - you can change your Apoapsis. Conversely, whenever you are at your Apoapsis you can change your Periapsis. So - say you now have an eccentric orbit with Pe = 2870km and Ap = 3000km, first identify what you want to do... If you guessed \u0022decrease the Apoapsis to 2870\u0022 you are correct!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you decrease the Apoapsis? If you guessed \u0022burn at the Periapsis\u0022 you are mostly there. The best place to bring down your Apoapsis is at the Periapsis - to decrease orbital height for a point, you thrust RETROGRADE. So... point backwards, at the Periapsis, and give a little thrust - you will be able to see your Apoapsis come down - when the Ap and Pe are very close STOP, you\u0027re done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MagicRik","CreatedById":102864,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T22:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks EtherDragon ill give it a go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
