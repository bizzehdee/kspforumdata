As such, there will be no leg modules included. I will perhaps look into including other external options such as static solar panels and ladders (just in case someone wants to use them as the engine portion of a lander... which they are perfectly capable of doing). If used in conjunction with other lander fuel tanks, you could always use the leg-module from the other tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking Port Performance -- interesting proposition. It -might- work; I\u0027ll have to poke at the code a bit to see where it polls for the animation status -- whether it is updated from an event or actively polled (event driven I might not be able to fix, polled I might be able to hack around a bit like you had suggested). If it works out I could probably even have my module add a dummy animation at runtime and would be able to MM patch my docking port module in place of the stock ones; Every docking port would end up with \u0027activate\u0027 and \u0027deactivate\u0027 right-click options. I should also be able to manually (through code) activate/deactivate the port whenever the scene is reloaded.

Sadly, these transforms have different orientations than the docking node transforms, so I am having to add a second transform to my parts for that purpose, but it -looks- like it will work out well so far. Have not been able to test the \u0027Target X Port\u0027 functionality yet to see if you get a different target point per-port, but will hopefully be looking at that over this weekend (and from my experience with welding parts, it -should- work, as my welded parts were able to properly be targeted at just the port). I\u0027m also thinking of adding some lights/emissive stuff to my docking ports to tell you if they are active or not; think red/green lights on the hub around the docking port, hopefully visible on-approach to the port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022anxcon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022anxcon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Efor that engine, toss on bahamuto animated engine module support \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: I already have my own custom deployable/animated engine module that will be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Due to licensing I cannot bundle any external plugins with my work (ARR = incompatible with nearly every open source license).

In the past I have had people lift my entire in-development project (I had not even posted anything regarding testing or releases yet), re-brand it as their own, and start overloading my issues tracker regarding stuff that was in active development and obviously not finished yet or even ready for distribution or testing. And there was not much I could do as I had licensed it under a CC license... which allows for such alteration and redistribution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it weren\u0027t for the few bad apples I would probably release my stuff under public domain; sadly, experience has taught me that if there is room for someone to abuse something, someone, somewhere, will abuse it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anxcon","CreatedById":148336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T21:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECC has multiple types, including no distro and no changing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gunslinger1","CreatedById":74670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T07:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving a weird glitch with this mod where vehicles fly apart at the seams for no reason. haha\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T14:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gunslinger1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gunslinger1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHaving a weird glitch with this mod where vehicles fly apart at the seams for no reason. haha\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any more information regarding the problem?
