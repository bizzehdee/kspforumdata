Something had to give somewhere.\n\nI\u0027ve also always thought that the 45/60 m/s impact tolerance of some of the manned parts is.... silly. 45m/s is ~90mph. I\u0027ve personally never slammed into the ground at 90mph... but let me tell you... I don\u0027t want to... it sounds very painful. \n\nExample: The Apollo command capsule was validated for a touchdown speed of 7m/s. During testing anything above ~12ms could cause potentially harmful/fatal damage to the craft (e.g. crushing the heat shield, rupturing propellant tanks) and the astronauts (massive g-force spike, potential for concussion or compression injuries). (Source: [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a455658.pdf](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a455658.pdf)).\n\nSo... I might consider raising it to 20m/s, but even that is quite a bit higher than it probably should be.\n\nAnyhow, I think I will likely be working on IVAs this week. Gotta get started on them or they will never get finished. Will continue to slowly poke at some of the other stuff I\u0027m working on, but the IVAs will be the main focus this week. Will hopefully at least have internal geometry finished for one of them (yes, will probably take me all week.... have I ever mentioned how slow and painful they are to work on?).\n\nEdit:\n\n![YwwZ9qX.png](http://i.imgur.com/YwwZ9qX.png)\n\n![TSZCB3P.png](http://i.imgur.com/TSZCB3P.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-14T16:35:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T16:39:00Z","Content":"LES EFFECTS!!!

Note the proper shading on the right.\n\nBecause I am working on \u0027internal\u0027 geometry, the normal tools available to fix such problems don\u0027t work. As such I had to spend the entire last two days (something like 20 hours of modding time) to re-learn basic Python (because for some obtuse reason Blender.org decided to use Python as their plugin language), and write a custom blender script to fix the normals for a cylinder with extrusions. \n\nWhat should have been a simple \u0027push the button\u0027 operation has turned into such a major affair... I\u0027m not even sure I want to continue working on the IVAs after this. Seriously, in the time I lost fixing an issue that should never occur, I could have modeled several parts (at least one!), or gotten a texture mostly done. And I haven\u0027t even started on the actual geometry for the IVAs; all this was just to fix the @#$% shading problems for the main cylinder walls.\n\nSo... for now IVAs are on hold until I can find/create the tools to work on them without massive frustration (or until someone else offers to create them(IVAs or tools)). Because if I have to spend another two days dealing with python/blender scripting and fixing \u0026^$#@\\*( shading and normals, I will be done modding and never look back; I enjoy creating things, but it is not worth the level of headache and frustration (and lost time!) that I have dealt with over the last couple of days."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T23:20:09Z","Content":"On a more positive note;\n\nMutli-docking port parts are a go.\n\nDid some quick testing with a mockup geometry part with the requisite docking node transforms. With the stock ModuleDockingNode you can successfully dock and undock multiple craft to it the same part, it all comes down to having the transforms in the right place, with the right names. There is still a problem in telling which part to decouple/undock with the stock module, but I -think- I have a little bit of custom code that should clean it up quite a bit by labeling the undock/decouple node options in the context menu.\n\nSo, expect to see a couple multi-docking node parts in the semi-near future; will probably be 2-4 different parts, each with 5 docking nodes on them (and one non-docking attach node). The different parts will have different combinations of docking port sizes on them -- standard x5, standard x3 \u002B large x2, large x5...(others..?) Will also be using these types of multi-docking ports on some of the upcoming Station Core parts -- such as a large storage torus with integrated docking ports, lights, and solar arrays.\n\nWill investigate using mesh-switch on them to limit the editor part list additions, but not sure if I\u0027ll be able to pull it off cleanly on these (due to needing different settings for node positions and docking port sizes). Will also be investigating a \u0027docking port toggle\u0027 that would activate/deactivate the magnetics, etc; would basically function as the shielded docking port (without an animation) to hopefully reduce the CPU overhead caused by docking ports in general.\n\nStill doing some thinking on the \u0027welding docking port\u0027; I believe I should be able to pull it off, just need the time to sit down and tinker with it."},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T01:14:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So... for now IVAs are on hold\n\nYour doing this for yourself - do what you enjoy and leave the rest for someone that wants to do it.

However upon scene load there is a slowdown so one has to manually open/close docking ports (on both vehicles). \n\nThat\u0027s a good news since opened docking ports seem to not create performance issue as implied from previous tests (when they can be manually opened/closed).

(although there was some weird improvement when I used docking ports from the mod without the needed plugin?!?)\n\nTook a quick look at the exposed stock docking port code; I don\u0027t think there is anything I can do regarding toggling of \u0027searching\u0027 or \u0027enabled\u0027 state. All of the necessary variables/members are private (animation control, enabled/disabled state). All of the methods I would need to override are private (e.g. Unity FixedUpdate). I can\u0027t even hack my way around this one; there is no room for adaptation or alteration in that code.\n\nAbout the closest I would be able to do is implement a dummy empty animation -- but you would still run afoul of the stock bug of needing to activate/deactivate whenever you reloaded the vessel. The next best thing I could do would be to completely re-implement it as a custom class.... I really don\u0027t want to (going to be days/weeks of coding), but at this point it is looking like I might just have to if I want to clean up the stock/vanilla problems. From what I can see it shouldn\u0027t be hard to do better than the stock code; it is a complete mess, and no wonder it performs as poorly as it does.\n\nFor now though, I will be using a slightly adapted stock docking port module that will include special handing for the naming on the right-click functions on a per-docking-node basis - e.g. it will list \u0027Decouple Front\u0027 or \u0027Decouple Port 1\u0027 instead of \u0027Decouple Node\u0027. Will investigate the custom/re-implemented docking port code when I have time.\n\nTodays previews:\n\n![H1c2Mv2.png](http://i.imgur.com/H1c2Mv2.png)\n\n![UCC2WXG.png](http://i.imgur.com/UCC2WXG.png)\n\n- Concept development of the Lander Core Skycrane module(s)\n\nMore previews - Multi-Docking Port parts, concept development\n\nClose up view of the \u0027standard\u0027 MDP\n\n![vj1HUCv.png](http://i.imgur.com/vj1HUCv.png)\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n1. 2x 0.625m \u0026 3x 1.25m\n\n2. 5x 1.25m\n\n3. 3x 1.25m \u0026 2x 2.5m\n\n4. 2x 1.25m \u0026 3x 2.5m\n\n5. 5x 2.5m\n\nMight be a sixth that would be all 0.625m, but not really sure that it is needed; I would certainly never dock that many small craft to the same station\n\n![yWI91gw.png](http://i.imgur.com/yWI91gw.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-16T20:49:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2015 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T18:51:19Z","Content":"Preferences as to station structural truss type?\n\nLeft - Nertea / Near-Future style Octo-Truss\n\nRight - Full Octagonal Truss\n\nOther - Not Shown - Hexagonal Truss - ISS style\n\nAny preferences?

So... will be doing a ton of details in the normal map and texture. The space not occupied by the engine bays will be used as fuel capacity. They will also contain an ASAS module for direct torque/control. Strongly thinking about adding some static/non-deployable solar panels to the diagonal exterior sides (the ones not occupied by engines).\n\nThoughts?

These trusses will form the exterior for -many- of my upcoming station parts (those that are not directly cylindrical, which will be mostly just the crewed parts).\n\nIVAs -- I was kind of thinking that when looking at the IVAs -- the only place for instruments is on the left/right of the window, normal (e.g. widescreen) aspect-ratio screens do not have enough vertical view to normally see any instruments that were below. So.. will probably place the stuff necessary for landing on the vertical columns so you can still see them while looking out the window -- nav ball, altimeter, speed indicator\n\nDeployable engine modules -- these are -intended- to be used for skycranes. As such, there will be no leg modules included. I will perhaps look into including other external options such as static solar panels and ladders (just in case someone wants to use them as the engine portion of a lander... which they are perfectly capable of doing). If used in conjunction with other lander fuel tanks, you could always use the leg-module from the other tanks.\n\nDocking Port Performance -- interesting proposition. It -might- work; I\u0027ll have to poke at the code a bit to see where it polls for the animation status -- whether it is updated from an event or actively polled (event driven I might not be able to fix, polled I might be able to hack around a bit like you had suggested). If it works out I could probably even have my module add a dummy animation at runtime and would be able to MM patch my docking port module in place of the stock ones; Every docking port would end up with \u0027activate\u0027 and \u0027deactivate\u0027 right-click options. I should also be able to manually (through code) activate/deactivate the port whenever the scene is reloaded. Will really have to poke into the stock code a bit more to see if I can even figure out where the bug originates from.\n\nI have validated that the multiple \u0027control from here\u0027 options in the docking ports -do- work properly if given distinct control transforms. Sadly, these transforms have different orientations than the docking node transforms, so I am having to add a second transform to my parts for that purpose, but it -looks- like it will work out well so far. Have not been able to test the \u0027Target X Port\u0027 functionality yet to see if you get a different target point per-port, but will hopefully be looking at that over this weekend (and from my experience with welding parts, it -should- work, as my welded parts were able to properly be targeted at just the port). I\u0027m also thinking of adding some lights/emissive stuff to my docking ports to tell you if they are active or not; think red/green lights on the hub around the docking port, hopefully visible on-approach to the port.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E for that engine, toss on bahamuto animated engine module support ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nA: I already have my own custom deployable/animated engine module that will be used.\n\nB: Due to licensing I cannot bundle any external plugins with my work (ARR = incompatible with nearly every open source license).

(I will be releasing full public (non-test) versions of my mod under GPL, but sadly that also is incompatible with the vast majority of other open-source licenses)\n\nC: Maintaining dependencies for external plugins is -not- something I want to undertake. From my previous experience it will cause nothing but headaches in both the short and long term; moreso in the long-term concerning KSP version updates -- I have to wait for all dependencies to update before I can even -start- working on updating my stuff; often delaying my updates by weeks/months while I wait for everyone else to do their bit.\n\nAnyhow, yes, they will have full animation support, and must be deployed before the engines can be activated (or rather any attempts to activate the engine while stowed will result in first deploying the engine before it is activated).\n\nWill be working on cleaning up a few things tonight and tomorrow morning, and hopefully have an updated testing release sometime Saturday afternoon. Will have a couple of small bug fixes, adds engine effects to the LES/BPC, and several prototype new parts for testing (e.g. untextured, geometry might not be finished, but they should work well enough to validate the concept and begin balancing mass/thrust/fuel/etc)(SC-B-SRB, SC-B-CORE, ST-Multi-Docking-Port parts)."},{"CreatedByName":"anxcon","CreatedById":148336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T21:14:07Z","Content":"you dont have to release other plugins with you, just support via a MM cfg\n\nand why use ARR? i dont think ive seen a mod goto that extreme"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T21:27:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E stuff\n\nCool ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nTwo more things: for that deployable engines: might be cool to add 4 deployable quite strong rcs boosters on side panels of octagon so you can move precisely in x-y directions while maintaining altitude with you main engines (you can have a look at space-y mod there are strong rcs thrusters blended with an engine)\n\nAnother idea - might be useful for your lander stuff; what about resources in tanks that can be switched on (off) upon staging? For example you have a fuel tank in the middle that you don\u0027t want to drain fuel from before you jettison an other tank. So player wouldn\u0027t need to manually switch off resources\n\nSo in other words:\n\nFrom this state -\u003E ![RnPUu1y.png](http://i.imgur.com/RnPUu1y.png) to this state: ![PvLLaY3.png](http://i.imgur.com/PvLLaY3.png) upon staging. Ideally EC would be excluded from staging or resources for staging could be selectable ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nJust an idea ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T21:27:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E you dont have to release other plugins with you, just support via a MM cfg\n\u003E and why use ARR? i dont think ive seen a mod goto that extreme\n\nI use All Rights Reserved for my development and testing releases. Full public releases will be under a much more liberal license (L/GPL and/or CC, depending upon the specific asset and my final decision). As I have not yet reached the full public release stage (probably wont until KSP 1.1), it is all currently ARR. Public releases will be posted under a new thread, have a completely separate GitHub repository, and have their own licensing as noted above.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is to do as much as I can to stop people from trying to redistribute unfinished works. In the past I have had people lift my entire in-development project (I had not even posted anything regarding testing or releases yet), re-brand it as their own, and start overloading my issues tracker regarding stuff that was in active development and obviously not finished yet or even ready for distribution or testing. And there was not much I could do as I had licensed it under a CC license... which allows for such alteration and redistribution.\n\nIf it weren\u0027t for the few bad apples I would probably release my stuff under public domain; sadly, experience has taught me that if there is room for someone to abuse something, someone, somewhere, will abuse it."},{"CreatedByName":"anxcon","CreatedById":148336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T21:42:09Z","Content":"CC has multiple types, including no distro and no changing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gunslinger1","CreatedById":74670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T07:09:53Z","Content":"Having a weird glitch with this mod where vehicles fly apart at the seams for no reason. haha"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T14:49:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Having a weird glitch with this mod where vehicles fly apart at the seams for no reason. haha\n\nHave any more information regarding the problem?
