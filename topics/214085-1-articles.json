Hopefully they are going to do a lot more than that. In terms of Game breaking bugs, two of those are WAY down on the list. Can you play the game without great maneuver nodes? Yup, easy. Can you play the game without docking controls? Yup, easy. So far im worried about their priorities. Its concerning but understandable that during development they were working on multiple fronts so that they had a forward looking mission. Multiplayer needed to be integrated from day 1, same with other aspects like interstellar, etc, to make sure it would all be compatible one day. But at this point they should be focused on the most gamebreaking of bugs. That means ships not working, ships not launching, ships falling apart, not to mention performance for most computers without new graphics cards being the #1 priority for this game right now, not even mentioned. Maybe this patch is just about things that they can fix quickly in the next few weeks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe most of us actually delving deep into the core of the game have not been vocal enough about the real major bugs in the game? Obviously any player who plays for 5 minutes is going to figure out that maneuver nodes are crap, so maybe that why its being focused because its so noticable that everyone mentions it? I hope that they are not prioritizing by how many people complain about something. I mean, I guess I can understand that from some perspective, if you want people to be happy then give the most people what they want. The problem here is assuming that most of these people know what is going to make them happy. Im not sure they do, and I am not sure that fixing maneuver nodes right now is going to make anyone any happier about this game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand I guess some are going to notice that docking controls dont work. Anyone who knows how to dock already and knows that there are controls for docking, since i dont think its in the tutorial. So I guess those people are going to find out about this bug pretty quick and then want to complain about it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, these are MINOR BUGS that dont break the game in any way. Maneuver nodes sucked in KSP for like a decade. We still got around just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, if anyone with a say in these things reads this, prioritize the foundation of the game. That means performance, physics, building ships, launching ships into orbit. In that order. Its like building a skyscraper. Start at the ground floor and work your way up. If you try to build the penthouse before you\u0027ve built the foundation and frame and all the other stuff you need to support it, you are going to have a bad day.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe these are simply the easy things that they have managed to fix already? Dont promise something you cant deliver on? The maneuver nodes fix and the docking controls not working should be a super easy fix, although im not a game developer and dont know anything about these sorts of things it seems like something they could fix easily. So maybe thats why they decided to announce those things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave files being corrupt should be an easy fix. You look at the save file, you see the problem, you fix the problem. Boom, done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the loading screen, its obviously a game breaking bug, so they needed to fix it immediately, and im assuming its again not a super hard to fix issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yea, I amend my opinion. This isnt their priority list at all. Its probably a small list of things they already have fixed, with more that they are working on.
