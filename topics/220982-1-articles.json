December is an interesting one because while it has 21 paper working days, in practice you\u0027re lucky to get much of that in effective man hours on projects between people taking vacation time, which also knocks onto people being reluctant to release major things late into the month - If there\u0027s issues, half the teams out and you\u0027ve only got a few days before christmas to fix it. It doesn\u0027t mean the month can\u0027t have launches at all, quite the contrary, but that you want to know well before december rolls around that the launch is ready to go. December working hours tends to turn into cleanup, maintenance and pet projects as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this was just some minor patch or content update to existing core mechanics, I wouldn\u0027t be too concerned, but this is major net new functionality that\u0027s unproven in so far as stability goes. If they were going to launch in the first working half of the month, that date shoulda been locked down and ready to communicate by now - Its only two weeks away. If they\u0027re not done and its not working to satisfaction yet, then alarm bells should be going off,\u00A0 because your likely release window is pushing into the latter part of the week of the 11th, giving you very little time before christmas when you\u0027re liable to have the least staff to fix inevitable post launch issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t be so bold as to say \u0022If we don\u0027t hear about it by X, its definitely delayed\u0022 but I will say that going into a december release window without a december release date is not a reassuring sign. Every project I\u0027ve ever been in that tried to pull something like that off either got burned, got heavily \u0027last minute MVP\u0027 cut down to size, or got pushed into late January when most of the hands were back and able to fix it.
