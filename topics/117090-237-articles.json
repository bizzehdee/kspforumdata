It can be fixed by editing some files in KR\u0026D.\n\n( [https://github.com/mmoench/KRnD/blob/master/GameData/KRnD/parts.cfg#L2](https://github.com/mmoench/KRnD/blob/master/GameData/KRnD/parts.cfg#L2) )  \u003C-- patch that applies to all parts, needs to be edited to exclude specific parts  \n\n( [https://github.com/mmoench/KRnD/blob/master/GameData/KRnD/blacklist.cfg](https://github.com/mmoench/KRnD/blob/master/GameData/KRnD/blacklist.cfg) ) \u003C-- alternately, that file can be patched to add an exception for the SSTU modules (SSTUModularFuelTank, etc).\n\nNow, what KR\u0026D really should do (if they want widespread compatibility), is find a way to integrate with the stock PartUpgrade system, as SSTU -is- compatible with that system (at some level at least, and can always be improved for greater compatibility).  I\u0027m not sure if it would even be possible to do what KRD does through the stock PartUpgrade system, but that really is the only way that it will ever be compatible with SSTU (without a ton of special-case code on both sides).  \n\nFor the record, I love the concept of KR\u0026D.  The execution and implementation though... leave so very much to be desired.  It is done in such a way as so it will never work with parts that have any sort of built-in configurability (so no fuel switching, mesh switching, scaling; it can only be a very basic static part).  It is also yet another mod that does a bunch of \u0027hard coding\u0027 of support for specific modules, which is simply wrong for any mod that intends to have widespread compatibility (they need to switch from hard-coding support, to using interfaces and the generic re-usability that they bring; sadly that would require that stock code and modules actually provided and used interfaces properly)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T19:09:51Z","Content":"There has been some horizontal lander talk... check this new mod out:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/158067-konstellation-hlv/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T19:19:51Z","Content":"I did a test landing with it, and it was very controllable.

Basically just more texture reduction; but also will allow for the \u0027stock\u0027 MFT-D tanks to have multiple texture sets with recoloring.\n\nAlso in regards to the MFT-D tanks -- I\u0027ve reworked their geometry slightly so that the mount-plane is no longer angled when they are mounted against a standard tank.  Will also be adding some basic mounting brackets/braces to the models, as they currently stand out for being \u0027too simple\u0027 when compared with the rest of the tanks.  Some of these changes however -will- result in broken craft due to the changes in geometry and attach-node positions; the craft/vessels should load fine, but the parts will be misplaced a bit.  I\u0027ll put together a list of \u0027breaking changes\u0027 as the release gets closer and more information is known, but as with other major KSP releases, the general thought is \u0027start a new game with the new version\u0027.\n\nI\u0027ll also be updating the \u0027Soyuz\u0027 nosecone/adapters as part of this, as they previously used the same texture sheet as the tanks (and probably will again when finished).  Seems likely that they will be getting the same texture-set and recoloring support as the rest of the tanks/adapters.\n\nLastly, I\u0027ve been continuing work on the code-side updates and cleanup for the modular parts.  Currently working on figuring out how to allow optional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules (and models) to be added to the MFT-tanks, to allow for built-in ullage/vernier/retro thrusters (and/or use as standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E).  These should hopefully be available as an option for all MFT tanks, and if done properly should have no additional overhead in the flight scene when disabled/not present.  Currently I\u0027m planning on allowing for the thrusters to have their model, # of blocks, vertical position, and rotation all configurable when in the editor.\n\nSorry, still no ETA on when the \u0027next update\u0027 will be available.  I haven\u0027t even started playing with the pre-release yet.  Probably at least a few weeks worth of work left on the module, model, and texture updates.  The good news is that if all of what is currently planned works out, the upcoming part-series (Lander rework, ProbeCore, BaseCore) should have potential for some interesting features.  Even if only some of it works out, the mod should still be in a better state than it is with the current releases and setup."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-06T15:44:16Z","Content":"Apologies if this has been answered already, but does SSTU work well with SMURFF?
