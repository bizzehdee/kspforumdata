Squad made the stock Kerbals, and then they moved on to create career mode, asteroids, and so on. If a mod maker wants to come along and add color to those Kerbal suits while Squad is expanding the base game, this is hardly dereliction on the part of the developers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T06:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArkaelDren\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ArkaelDren\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@\u003Cstrong\u003EEndersmens \u003C/strong\u003EYes because it would take soooo much time, and be incredibly difficult to do such a thing.

You\u0027re more than welcome to play your game with as many mods as you want. Customize your experience to your heart\u0027s content. Just remember, without that framework - that bigger picture stuff that is getting us closer and closer to hitting the point of \u0022scope complete\u0022 in the stock version, the experience you have with your mods may not be the same. I\u0027m sorry that you feel that things may be taking slower than you\u0027d like, but when you consider the scope of what\u0027s being put into each update, the size of the team, the time it takes to get tested and the need to release a stable, polished product to a wide audience - among other things - I hope you can understand why things have taken the time they have thus far. Especially in the case of ARM, don\u0027t forget that the devs were working on two updates at once that whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArkaelDren","CreatedById":57992,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T15:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a forum, in which people are allowed to respond with opinions either negative or positive. I did so with a bit of sarcasm, that is all. My opinion is shared quite a bit within this community. I am simply giving a smart *** version. I end 95% of my posts with a much appreciated thank you, for the work that is put into this product and the greater modding community. But thx for the reply\u0027s to my post. Its still great to see a mature community, being able to express its discontent of ones opinion. Sorry guys, but I\u0027m just worried its taking to long to see the changes that are going to be necessary, for KSP\u0027s evolution in maintaining its hold. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy real concern... If some large developer(to late) sees the great value, that KSP is holding as a \u0022not so niche\u0022 area in gaming, then they are going to poor millions into a slaughter of our beloved KSP. Don\u0027t think for a moment, that they have not assessed the market for such an investment, and the return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
