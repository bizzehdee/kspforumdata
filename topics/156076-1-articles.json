On top of learning Unity, you would need to learn the KSP API, so basically 2 languages. I have taken multiple classes over the past year to learn Unity at my university and I still couldn\u0027t write up the simplest mod for KSP. If you are willing to learn, be prepared to learn a lot and to mess up and be discouraged, but don\u0027t let it stop you.. Unity can be extremely cool and fun to use. Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VikingStormtrooper","CreatedById":172287,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T09:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you could start by simply making new parts that use exactly the same functions as the stock parts - learning this took some days in my case, nothing terrible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as you feel confident about your modeling/texturing/configuring skills, you may move to coding, that is harder in my opinion, at least if you have no or just little experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T12:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of starting with a plugin, I suggest playing around with existing parts. The way KSP parts are set up, it\u0027s incredibly easy to make a copy and modify it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload a few mods, for example mods that modify existing parts to have different specs. Compare the differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, you\u0027ll learn the most about KSP if you start with the simple things. With just a few lines in the configuration file of a part, you can change the shape of a model, for example make it oblate. Change it\u0027s mass, resource contents, in the case of engines the thrust, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, curves etc. Every little thing you change has an effect not only on the part but the craft as a whole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso some of the existing part modules can be scripted to have a different behaviour, which can be seen as a form of programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the big question is: What do you wish to create?

Don\u0027t try to add a crap ton of extremely complex parts on your first attempt.

I don\u0027t know the original reasoning behind this rule (possibly to discourage malware), but it works very much in your favor as a new modder, because it means that for anything that any currently known mod can do, you already have a ready reference implementation that shows you exactly how to do it. Learn about all the mods that are similar to what you want to do, then download their source code and open it in your favorite editor to see how they work and which objects and functions they use to accomplish each important task. You should never simply copy any code unless you can confirm that it\u0027s allowed by that code\u0027s\u00A0license (and even then, you should always give credit), but if you\u0027re stuck on, say, how to get keyboard input, it can be tremendously helpful to be able to see how others have done it in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese links were particularly helpful for me recently:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/HebaruSan/Astrogator#plug-in-authoring\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/HebaruSan/Astrogator#plug-in-authoring\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
