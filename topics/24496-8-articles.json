Also have ideas for a series using these house rules in a storyline driven series, taking place in the current 6.4x save, tying together elements of the old abandoned Chapter 2 series with the lost message from the monolith. So right now the current plan is to do some more work on Project SOAR, then use those developed vehicles in the storyline series. I think I can pull it all together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hazens1","CreatedById":129789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T12:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat skybox are you using for your Youtube series?
