But I don\u0027t know what it is, since I\u0027ve never played KSP on a console. The [ ] keys on a PC are vital to some aspects of the game, and it is completely impossible that they were not ported and/or fully tested on the xbox. That being said, the [ ] keys only work when you are within 2.2km of the other ship. So for some of your testing, you may not have been close enough. However, if you can find that correct set of keys, and you are out of range, you will get the message \u0022No ships within range.\u0022 So that may help you find the right set of keys. As I understand it, there is a question mark on your screen that gives you an almost\u00A0full key mapping for your console gamepad. You may want to go through that list one-by-one and make sure you know what each key combo does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the folks on the KSP console gameplay forums will certainly be able to give you better advice than I can.

Your question was a good one, so I decided to replicate what I was experiencing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: When 2 craft are right next to each other, using the Cycle Focus button combo (LB/RB \u002B Dpad Left/Right) on Xbox only focuses on your current craft. Only way to change focus to control the other craft is from Space Center \u0026gt; Tracking Station (i.e.\u00A0multiple loading screen\u00A0workaround).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems like it\u0027s broken vs. the functionality on the PC which allows you to change control when cycling focus in Flight Mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I did to Test and verify:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- In \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, created 2 small rovers mirrored on either side of a pair of Jr Docking ports,\u00A0each side with an Octo2 probe core. This is saved as one craft named \u0022Test Rover\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Launched vehicle. Now I\u0027m in flight mode/view, not map mode.\u00A0On the runway, I see one craft that I can control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Clicking the \u0022Cycle focus\u0022 button combo (LB/RB Dpad Left/Right) onscreen says \u0022No nearby objects to focus. Use Map View to select distant ones\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Manually decouple node on\u00A0the right side of the craft. Separation happens normally. Camera shifts focus to the now undocked rover (which I\u0027ll refer to as \u0022Test Rover R\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Select Probe core and rename\u00A0as \u0022Test Rover R\u0022. Move around a little bit to establish control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Select left side rover docking port and\u00A0Set as Target. It says \u0022Test Rover Probe\u0022 and is 4.9m away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Now hit button combo to cycle focus. Onscreen indicates\u00A0\u0022Focus: Test Rover R\u0022. Hitting right button or left button, nothing changes camera focus, screen continues to say \u0022Focus: Test Rover R\u0022\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003Eplus \u0022Camera: Auto\u0022 and \u0022Target: Test Rover Probe Docking Port\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- At this point, I try different variations of pressure when\u00A0hitting\u00A0LB/RB, holding LB/RB before hitting Dpad L/R, hitting all buttons at the same time, hitting each with slight delay, etc.\u00A0Try hitting button combo with cursor toggled (LS) on or off, still no effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cannot click anything on left side rover except the docking port with the option to \u0022Unset target\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Go to Space Center, then\u00A0Tracking Station, I see \u0022Test Rover Probe\u0022 and \u0022Test Rover R\u0022 in the list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Select \u0022Test Rover Probe\u0022 and load back into flight view on the runway.

Jiggle the wheels to establish control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Now hit button combo to cycle focus between two separate craft that are less than 5m away.\u00A0Onscreen says \u0022Focus: Test Rover L\u0022 plus \u0022Camera: Auto\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Continue clicking the button combo, same variations, but camera doesn\u0027t change and only continue to see \u0022Focus: Test Rover L\u0022 plus \u0022Camera: Auto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cannot click anything on Test Rover R except the docking port with the option to Set as Target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Clicking on Test Rover R and setting target, it shows small \u0022Test Rover R\u0022 is now 1.2m away (after moving Test Rover L to establish control).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Finally, back to Space Center, then\u00A0Tracking Station and I see Test Rover R and Test Rover L in the list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- At this point, I can select each of the separate rovers, but the results are the same for each.
