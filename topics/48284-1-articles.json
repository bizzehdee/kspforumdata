Now, I know there are mods that add better cameras for docking, like the lazor mod, but I prefer to play vanilla ksp, with no mods. So, does anybody think the vanilla ksp needs better camera systems, not necessarily for docking, but for everything (mainly docking though). I bought this up because I had a bad experience with one dock the other day. I kept on missing the docking port by several metres because I couldn\u0027t see the relative distance between the docking port on the ship and the docking port on the space station. So, who thinks new cameras are needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T22:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ToTheMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T22:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, but this sounds a lot like \u0022more camera modes\u0022, which is in the What Not to Suggest list.
