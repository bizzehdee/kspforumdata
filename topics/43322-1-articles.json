Right there. A rocket sled, a probe body, two canards, and a decoupler. It\u0027s so simple...and so very, very hard to control, but look at that performance. It accelerates incredibly fast, and demands a delicate touch from a pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, this seems like a fun way to make infinigliders entertaining again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Formula I, an infiniglider racing challenge with a few design rules-it wouldn\u0027t be much of a formula series without having a formula to follow, after all. Having a bazillion canards surrounding a capsule is right out in here. Here\u0027s how a Formula I racer may be constructed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEvery Formula I racer must be unmanned for reasons that will become obvious in this inaugural event.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA Formula I racer may only be constructed with a maximum of four flight surfaces and four control surfaces. For the sake of Formula I, canards and fins are counted as flight surfaces. You may use any amount of struts or girders necessary to move things around to optimize the behavior of your racer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnly stock parts may be used, and only their stock values may be used.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EJet/rocket sleds may to be used to launch your Formula I racer. They may have no flight surfaces of their own and may not take off from the runway with you attached. If they lift off, you must decouple from them immediately. Use whatever launch methods you deem necessary-just don\u0027t let them leave the ground with you!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYour Formula I racer may have no thrusters of its own, nor may it have any pilot aids aside from ASAS. I\u0027m not sure they\u0027d help you go as fast as possible, either.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how a Formula I race works: it\u0027s a pure time trial. Your time is measured by your mission clock, just about nothing else, from start to finish, and the best time wins. There isn\u0027t even any landing-that\u0027s why there\u0027s no manned entrants allowed. You finish as fast as possible: by smacking into the goal area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a first event to try the concept out, I have lined up one that\u0027s really simple, and very short. I\u0027ve tried it and finished it in a shade under one minute and 36 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is simple: take off from the Space Center\u0027s runway, fly all the way over the island containing the airfield, then turn around, fly back to the Space Center, then crash land in it or as near to it as possible. Whacking it into any building or structure in the Space Center will shave ten seconds off your time, and crash landing on the runway will take fifteen seconds off your time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want photographic proof that you flew over and past the island at some point, then mission details where and when you made impact. The rule of thumb is that you should hit somewhere inside the Space Center or as reasonably near to its middle as possible. All entrants will be ranked by time adjusted for accuracy bonuses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it, really. Good luck, and go fast!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T21:29:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Reverie Planetarian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
