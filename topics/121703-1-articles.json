I recommend taking screenshots of your plane in the SPH, in the SPH with a payload, on the runway, in flight, dropping the payload, and the payload on the ground. Then upload them to imgur (as this forum supports embedding imgur albums) by going into your KSP folder, go to screenshots, and find your screenshots, or, if you purchased KSP through steam, use the screenshot tools there. After uploading to imgur, create an album, and embed it into your post by typing [imgur ]album code[/imgur ] without the spaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe album code is anything in between the imgur.com/a/ and any #0 or anyhting like that. So for an album with an url of imgur. com/a /qwerty#0 (without the spaces) you would type [imgur ]qwerty[/imgur ] without the spaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
