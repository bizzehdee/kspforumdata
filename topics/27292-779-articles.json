I had landed him the previous night in the Highlands, so I went ahead and cleaned out that biome before moving on to the Highland Craters. Unfortunately, I finally understood that when Geschosskopf said \u0022you need a bigger lander for Mun\u0022, he was referring specifically to the gas tanks. Rather than hit six or seven biomes before having to head back to Kerbin, the \u003Cem\u003EFireball\u003C/em\u003E only had enough gas to get those two safely. I was able to retrieve Bob before the night was out and he came back with 1,477 science from the two biomes plus the fiddling he did with gravioli scans in orbit prior to landing, which was enough for me to unlock RAPIER engines and the long Mk3 fuel tanks. I\u0027m definitely into the mop-up part of the tech tree at this point; there\u0027s not much else there I \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to unlock (the 3.5 meter engines are probably the only thing left that I would class as \u0022necessary\u0022, especially as I get ready to go to Duna). A redesign of the \u003Cem\u003EFireball\u003C/em\u003E for Mun is in order, and now that I have the tech unlocked the time has come for me to finally fix the problems with the \u003Cem\u003EAlbatross\u003C/em\u003E refueling plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Theogel returned safely to Kerbin from Minmus aboard the original \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock 7\u003C/em\u003E craft, marking that craft\u0027s official retirement and the completion of his rescue contract. Since he was the only engineer available and I had the scratch to do so, he was promptly loaded up into a \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E ore-delivery lander and shot towards Mun. The plan is for his craft to dock with Munport when he arrives in two days time, pick up Verise from Munport station and land at the Munar drilling site in the East Crater to begin Munar drilling operations in earnest. Looking at my engineer roster, I seriously need to bring back some engineers from Minmus at this point. Or hire a few, perhaps...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast thing that happened last night was the arrival of \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E at Minmus. She entered orbit retrograde to Minmusport station but that was rectified during her orbital insertion burn, and the craft successfully rendezvoused and docked with the station. Cerxie (the pilot), Jenedith, Neillong, Eldorf and Arissa are scheduled to make a surface excursion this evening (which \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E fulfill a long-standing Minmus base contract I have yet to fulfill). I\u0027ve considered setting them down at the Wildcat drilling site so that the Mun Buggy craft can be refitted with a KAS connector port; I don\u0027t know if I have the necessary tools at the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E site though, and the Buggy should have sufficient fuel to go down and back easily as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplacement contracts these last few days - I\u0027ve picked up some \u0022up and down\u0022 tourist contracts and at this point I might just launch them all in a relatively low-tech rocket. Going to depend on whether or not I can make a profit by doing so, of course. I have a new Mun space station contract requiring room for seven, a cupola and the usual accouterments; I think my standard space station core covers those requirements but I\u0027ll know more once I\u0027ve got the thing on the pad. The real question there is what to do with the thing once I\u0027ve got it in place, whether to keep it as a second space station, dock it to Munport or run it into the Munar surface. Finally, I picked up a \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1900k contract to put a Class C rock in orbit of Minmus. That one just sounded like fun. Plus at this point I\u0027ve got about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1600k and nothing pressing to spend it on - the rest of my drilling hardware is up and en route to its respective destinations, I\u0027ve got a plane to land and two to tweak, and nothing else going on. I do have five Duna-related contracts in the pipe now, so I may start thinking about how I\u0027m going to go about fulfilling those in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T13:27:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T16:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLOomTAEbPRL_VoCDlHP8H2ptf-uLjsqdy\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI really like this moon\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Belphegor","CreatedById":118918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T16:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egot a bit tired of space so i made a small plane to mess around in the atmosphere. it can fly up to 1300m/s below 2km altitude before the air intake explodes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/576817490791839402/6650478559344DC1AE12AAC978F22FD6F72B08D7/\u0022 alt=\u00226650478559344DC1AE12AAC978F22FD6F72B08D7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T19:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENailed the \u00220 to Mach 10 in 10s\u0022 challenge !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GsCEGre.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GsCEGre.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gods315Pawn","CreatedById":97772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T20:12:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have always struggled with airplanes in this game, before and after the revamped aerodynamics.

Had a little problem with the launch/transfer/delivery system for the mining/refining factory. And it seems that landing directly on a fuel tank with no legs/wheels/nozzles/chutes is pretty much like taking a hammer to spun glass--I landed it, on Minmus, at under 1 m/s, and the whole dang factory shattered into its component pieces...followed by the inevitable explosions from...from...I have no idea from what--how can ANYTHING explode after falling anywhere from 1 to maybe 5 meters in Minmus\u0027s g-field?\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, I fixed the skyhook for dropping the factory onto the surface, and gave it landing legs (and moved its side-mount docking port to account for the legs, so the fuel truck could still dock with it), and it landed just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. All components in place: 1) permanent ground-based mining/refining ISRU fuel factory; 2) tanker rocket to haul fuel from surface to Minmus orbit; 3) fuel truck to transfer fuel from factory to tanker rocket. Test-docked truck to rocket, worked great, yay! Turned on drills and converter, hit timewarp, filled the factory\u0027s tanks, drove the truck over to it, and... found out that factory\u0027s landing legs had settled just slightly UNDER Minmus\u0027s surface, a bit lower than the empty factory had settled on the launch pad during my test runs at KSC. And so the docking ports did not line up. Aaargh. (That is why I didn\u0027t want the dang landing legs in the first place! I figured the big broad Kerbodyne fuel tank would sit exactly the same way on the launch pad, on Minmus, full, empty, whatever.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. Tomorrow is Plan B: I\u0027m going to redesign the fuel truck so its docking port sits at the end of a chain of cubic octagonal struts.
