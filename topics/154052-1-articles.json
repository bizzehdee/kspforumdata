Here we have Shepster\u00A0Kerman shortly after saving him during a rescue from orbit mission. You may notice that it is looking a little bit upside down. That\u0027s because when I designed the rescue pod, I forgot to put landing legs on it, and was forced to land it on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks because lander can\u0027s break if you so much as pass gas too enthusiastically.

I wanted a plane that could get some easy science from the biomes near the Space Center. I didn\u0027t understand how fuel worked at that point. Or intakes. Or planes in general. I didn\u0027t get that science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228LxJ4Rs.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022539\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8LxJ4Rs.png?1\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere we have more evidence that I am not a smart man. This was what I built when I got a contract to reach orbit. Fins mounted to the front: Check. Boosters pulling the center of thrust up: Check.\u00A0Somewhere around here is where Jeb died I think. Possibly from the shame of having to pilot the garbage I put together for him, but most likely because I didn\u0027t have a backup save and forgot to put parachutes on his pod. Thanks to his brave sacrifice though, I now have a deceptively long scrollbar on my list of save files. Had to edit the top out because it had a naughty file name. Didn\u0027t install any mods until very recently, so all of these older \u0022ships\u0022 (I\u0027m being very generous calling them that) were built without the handy vessel info \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E provides. Looking back they all seem to share a common trait of having much more Delta-V than they need while somehow still struggling to make it where they were intended to due to poor design and shabby piloting. Jeb can only help me so much, he\u0027s not a miracle worker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mevAJwa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mevAJwa.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one physically\u00A0hurts to look at. Scott Manley would probably have a heart attack looking at this thing. Believe it or not, this is the new and improved version. The first iteration had a third row if kickers at the very tip top. I call this Celery Staging. It\u0027s what you do when you vaguely remember an efficient launch method named after a long green stalky vegetable, and you know that dropping engines and fuel lines are somehow involved, but you\u0027re too dumb to figure it out. Around here is where I spent some time on google researching basic rocket design and learned the explodey bit should not be near the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022E41mMRI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E41mMRI.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey said that well-designed rockets boosters near the bottom.

It was just slightly overbuilt, having two full tanks after I fulfilled the Munar Orbit contract I built it for, so I shot it at Eve with fuel to spare. Could have gotten it back to Kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, but didn\u0027t quite have enough fuel to put in orbit, and if you think that I was skilled enough at this point to try fancy stuff like gravity assists, you obviously haven\u0027t been reading the same thread. This is the point that the Relay Network debacle happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bit8Ibh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bit8Ibh.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my Relay Network. After the initial elation of realizing I had a probe on my way to Eve (and a second probe loaded with science stuff I hastily threw at Duna), I then had to deal with the fact that it was now too far away to communicate with Kerbin\u0027s ground antennae, so I decided to setup a relay network so I could keep control of them. I even went online and figured out how to put them into geostationary orbit for the heck of it. All so I could stay connected to my probes. Hours spent learning how in the hell sub-assemblies worked, figuring out orbital periods, rewatching tutorial videos over and over, and I finally got everything slotted into place, antennae deployed, T\u0027s dotted and I\u0027s crossed. I switch over to my probe and... no control. All that trouble and the antennae I was using didn\u0027t have enough power to reach beyond Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. So I turned off that remote crap so I could control my **** probes and haven\u0027t turned it back on since. I\u0027ll turn it back on when I have the patience for it again, but I am still just way to vinegary to deal with it right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rtztJjh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rtztJjh.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s three science containers and a single Science Jr. because the list of things I don\u0027t know how they function is as long as a Mohole is deep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kbk7F5D.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kbk7F5D.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere I am trying to build an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.
