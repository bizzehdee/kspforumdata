This has always been something the community has always wanted- and recently I also want it... In fact I\u0027d like both BUT I\u0027m willing to sacrifice and just have it on steam.\n\nSo is this now an option? If not, can I please be a test subject for it? I\u0027ve been a long term member on the website and although less, I\u0027m also a lengthy member of the forum. I try to be a decent model as well.\n\nSo can any of this happen?"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:08:10Z","Content":"They did have it for about 2 months, but you had to have purchased it before 5/xx/13 or you were not eligible.

If you bought after that time then you must repurchase if you want a Steam copy. IIRC this was part of the arrangement with distributing through Steam, they gave free keys to any existing players wishing to migrate but not for new purchasers. It\u0027s reasonable IMO; if you bought through the store then you have paid Steam no money for KSP and they should not be expected to provide bandwidth and other support services for it."}]}
