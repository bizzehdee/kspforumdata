If you bought after that time then you must repurchase if you want a Steam copy. IIRC this was part of the arrangement with distributing through Steam, they gave free keys to any existing players wishing to migrate but not for new purchasers. It\u0027s reasonable IMO; if you bought through the store then you have paid Steam no money for KSP and they should not be expected to provide bandwidth and other support services for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
