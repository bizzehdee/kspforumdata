What do you want to do by yourself, what do you want to automatize, do you want more resource managing tasks? It is nearly impossible to give good advice to someone just based on played hours. But I suggest Mechjeb to automatize boring repetitive maneuvering tasks and give technical data, Alarm clock to manage multiple simultaneous missions, KAS to get possibilities to modify ships and connect ships with cables to transfer resources (very useful in surface mining operations), life support to make time as a significant resource and Outer Planets to get more planets and possibilities (however, similar coloured balls with couple of physical parameters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gonzo98x\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gonzo98x\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou are ready...\u003Cp\u003ERealism overhaul plus fasa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will change your ksp life\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried it.

Basic principles was the same but maneuvers and transfers just took much more dv and time (both, in game and in real world). Also huge rockets became boring and the lag was annoying.
