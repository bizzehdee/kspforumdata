I was wondering does any one know of an up to date delta v map, or how one can calculate how much delta v it would take to get to each planet?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T07:14:29Z","Content":"Welcome to the fourms! The old dV maps work perfectly fine.\n\nThe only thing that changed is the ascent into orbit from the surface of a body with an atmosphere. In other words: launching from Kerbin, Eve, Duna or Laythe.\n\nAnd generally, these numbers decreased. Duna barely changed, Kerbin and Laythe had a moderate decrease, Eve requires drastically less.\n\nSo if you just use the old maps, you will never run out of dV, no matter what. Much to the contrary, you will end up with a little bit of safety buffer if you calculation includes the launch into Kerbin orbit."}]}
