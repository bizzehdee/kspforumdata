I wasn\u0027t 100% sure. Back to business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading the forums for a week, I\u0027ve noticed an increasingly alarming number of threads confused about the RAPIER or just straight up bashing it. The usual arguments are it\u0027s lower thrust and higher mass than the usual engine choices, both jet and rocket; and it\u0027s lower efficiency than other choices like the LV-T45 Liquid Fuel Engine or Toroidal Aerospike Rocket, and TurboJet Engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, let\u0027s just look at it\u0027s base stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has an impact tolerance of 20m/s. That\u0027s \u0026gt;2.5 times greater than the turbojet, making it useful for VTOLSSTOs that come in for rough landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt masses 1.75 tons, making it the heaviest 1.25m part in the game, heavier than the LV30 and Aerospike, which both weigh in at 1.5 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the only air breathing engine with an attach node on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s Isp as a jet is 800-1200 (ASL-Vac) and it\u0027s Isp as a rocket is 320-360.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s that, so let\u0027s get into some actual testing results, because numbers can\u0027t tell the full story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to fly a series of missions to identify the key performance differences in engine layouts by interchanging RAPIERs and different positions to achieve different results. These tests were done across two different test aircraft designed to represent different styles of SSTO building. While there are still more scenarios I\u0027d like to test, I believe the results achieved by these test flights will be substantial in making the case that the RAPIER is not poorly balanced, but rather being misused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDisclaimer:\u003C/strong\u003E I do not claim to be a master SSTO builder.

The ascent profile used is a basic \u0027climb to 20km, accelerate to 1200m/s\u002B, pitch up 30 degrees, punch out of atmosphere.\u0027 This is a hybrid profile between brute forcing your way to orbit with rockets from 15km, and an air hogging \u002735km on jets\u0027 ascent. This profile is used across all aircraft. The target orbit is between 70 and 80km circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img802/5250/azcv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022azcv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Aerospike was used as the rocket engine of choice because it has the same thrust as the RAPIER in rocket mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent did not climb as fast as it should have during the first 10km, likely due to lack of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft was able to achieve good speed and had acceptable thrust for the duration of the jet ascent. This craft has 4 clipped ram intakes to provide air at good altitude and a intake ratio of 2:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular aircraft suffers from a notable drop-off of thrust power when the jets cut out and the aerospike alone is powering the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img40/8148/l7g2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l7g2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft achieved orbit with 1,101m/s of delta V remaining for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETEST 2:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 2 RAPIER engines\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next test, the aerospike was removed and a useless adapter was put in it\u0027s place.

During the initial climb to 10km, however, the RAPIERs produce less than 2/3rds of their thrust capacity, resulting in a slower than usual climb. Another notable fact is that the RAPIERs where able to hang on to air breathing mode for a VERY long time, way longer than the turbojets ever could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img829/184/62y4.png\u0022 alt=\u002262y4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last key fact is that having twice the thrust during the rocket ascent was a significant difference to the last flight and the results of that were tangible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft reached a slightly higher orbit with 1,348m/s of delta V remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETEST 3:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E RAPIER engine \u002B Turbojets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this test, the turbojets were put back and a single RAPIER took the place of the aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img547/7732/vn83.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vn83.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircraft had the best jet TWR of them all, allowing a fast climb to altitude and to cruising speed. The turbojets were shut down as they flamed out and the ascent continued on the RAPIER. Due to an action group mishap, two of the air intakes were closed when the turbojets were shut off, resulting in the RAPIER engaging rocket mode sooner than necessary. The test shall be repeated at a later time. The rocket ascent was much like the first test as the thrust was the same. The main difference was that the RAPIER was able to get higher before needing to switch mode, compensating for the lesser efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img690/2013/6i1d.png\u0022 alt=\u00226i1d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft made orbit with 901.m/s delta V remaining, clearly showing the RAPIER\u0027s lower efficiency (as well as possibly some losses due to a less-than-ideal RAPIER ascent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETEST 4:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Single stack SSTO\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, we switch to a smaller SSTO craft which uses a single stack.

The results are likely mildly exaggerated due to imperfections in the craft design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft was slow to take off and suffered from mediocre TWR during all phases of the ascent. The engine layout is an aerospike clipped into a turbojet. The forward fuel tank is devoid of oxidizer to provide liquid fuel where a full mk 1 fuselage is unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img203/5936/bcm7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bcm7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven while maintaining the 2:1 intake ratio, the aircaft had difficulties reaching higher altitudes. The aerospike had to be called on sooner than was preferred. This was compensated by the ability to run both engines at maximum power until jet flameout due to the center of thrust being aligned with the center of mass (mostly, read on), allowing the turbojet to be milked for a good bit during rocket ascent. The loss of the turbojet was again felt as the TWR dropped off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the orbital insertion, it became clear I was not perfect in my clipping as the aerospike was slightly too low and the craft pitched up violently under thrust. This will have to be corrected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft made orbit with 70.73m/s of delta V remaining, by the skin of my teeth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETEST 5:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Single stack SSTO w/RAPIER\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this test, the wings were redesigned to fix the lift and controlability issues (warranting a rerun of the last test to ensure validity) and the clipped engines were traded out for a single RAPIER. In this case one engine weighs less than two, and the rocket thrust remains the same (but with less efficiency and the benefit of gimbal) and jet thrust takes a hit, or so we think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img30/980/pkiy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pkiy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the initial ascent, the lower weight was immediately present as the tail section as a whole ton lighter. The RAPIER really shined at the latter stages of high altitude. The RAPIER, as I discovered, is capable of running on less than five thousandths (\u0026gt;0.005) of a unit of intake air, so low that the resources tab won\u0027t even register it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img854/8739/glkl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022glkl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the RAPIER has just over half it\u0027s maximum thrust on takeoff, and doesn\u0027t hit more than two thirds of it until it clears 15,000 meters. The RAPIER is a super high altitude engine in every sense of the word, and while it may appear inefficient, it really is because people judge the wrong resource.

Well done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say as point from my recent SSTO experiences with Rapiers, that the early ascent to 10k-15k is as much a factor in performance as anything else. I think too many people just go nose up at 45deg\u0027s a call it good. The problem with this is that the gravity and drag losses are much greater resulting in slower ascent times to these first keystone altitudes. It seems counter intuitive, but an angle of 20-30 deg\u0027s on the initial ascent allows you to build up more velocity resulting in a slightly faster rate of ascent. But the key difference is that you will be travelling 2x-3x and thus be much deeper in the \u0022powerband\u0022 of most of the normally aspirated engines. This results in much harder acceleration through the upper altitudes and an overall shorter time to orbit.

Also, the LV-T30 got heavier in .23 and is now the same weight as the aerospike (even though I disagree about that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have an feeling that the rapier need an different approach. as its isp in atmosphere is lower you don\u0027t want an long and slow climb, you want decent twr, perhaps using an turbojet as extra engine to climb faster.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to do fine as soon as you get it above 15km.

In my experience with this testing, there are a few things conspiring against that. First is massive drag losses. You want to expend as little fuel down there as you can because that\u0027s less dV claimed by drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is that the RAPIER and turbojet both don\u0027t like the lower atmosphere. They have to get up high. The RAPIER has it worst, delivering only ~60% of max jet power at sea level. Neither of those two engines really come into their own until you clear 15km. I always rocket up through the 1-10km zone as fast as possible to get my engines to max power and to get clear of the drag. The 10-15km climb cannot be overdone or else you could flame out prematurely and with the RAPIERs, that will cost you precious rocket fuel. Yeah, the ascent is a tricky thing to do. The ease of use of the RAPIER probably tricks people into not flying proper ascent profiles, so they get confused and angry and blame the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-01T04:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2014 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T04:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso An LTV is much longer than an aerospike, making it more awkward to incorporate into a design that won\u0027t smash it on takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T04:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience so far the RAPIER really shines when used in high air-breathing TWR configurations, taking the craft to high velocities quickly and efficiently and punching out to orbit, minimizing gravity losses and preserving lots of dV even in the face of increased mass\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T04:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso An LTV is much longer than an aerospike, making it more awkward to incorporate into a design that won\u0027t smash it on takeoff.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is true.

I\u0027ll not hog your thread by repeating my graphs, but will refer to them. Some points. While the RAPIER (air mode) only dead lifts about a third of the mass that an aerospike can dead lift, this is certainly offset by the use of lifting surfaces and other aerodynamics. Also, while the aerospike excels by lifting and burning a maxed mass of mostly fuel to an altitude of about 22,500 km, the RAPIER Air excels by lifting a maxed mass (50% non fuel, this time) to an altitude of about 630 km or so. Actually, it does well with about 7 or 8% starting fuel mass. It also excels in an efficiency test (only the smallest fuel tank used). In fact, in followup graphs, I excluded results from either the aerospike or the RAPIER Air (depending on the graph) in order to make the results of other engines clearer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more practical note, my best pre-RAPIER SSTOs combine the use of turbojet and aerospike engines.

At lower speeds and altitudes, your TWR requirement will be higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever any fans of the Rapier due to its simplicity should look carefully at your ascent trajectory. Even with small numbers of intakes, substantial efficiency gains are possible by building up as much horizontal speed as you can at the highest altitude your intakes allow you to fly on jet power. The mode switch on the Rapiers should also be toggled to manual, since I believe the automatic switch will occur at the first sign of flameout at full throttle whereas in manual mode you can continue flying higher in air-breathing mode by throttling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming a proper trajectory, the Rapier is never going to be more efficient than pairing a turbojet with an LV-909 (or a few 48-7S engines which do outclass every other rocket in most situations - a pair of radial 24-77s is also a good choice if you\u0027re staying within the Kerbin system, simple to construct and not overpowered), no matter how many intakes you have. But it will be more forgiving of suboptimal trajectories. The thesis of the thread title of the Rapier not sucking depends on your skill level more than anything else. If you know how to get an efficient jet ascent, on few intakes or many, then the Rapier does suck. If you\u0027re new and still figuring it out, then it doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-01T10:49:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2014 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T10:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clockwork_werewolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Clockwork_werewolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne thing I have noted in these kinds of discussions is that no one mentions air intake to engine ratio. \u003Cp\u003EI suspect that those who do not like Rapiers are using 8-15 intakes per engine (air hogging). These people would find the jets power them to a very high alt with little fuel use, then all they need to do is add a little rocket thrust when out of the atmo. They would pick a good rocket engine not an atmo rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople only using 1 or two intakes per engine (without clipping it is hard but not impossible to have more) will have a different feel. For these people the rapier cuts out at a much high alt and then given them the force to punch though the rest of the atmo without needing to bring lots of rockets lowering T/W. New players that do not know about clipping tricks or players that see it as not in the spirit of the game will therefore find the rapier better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I find adding 12 intake per engine feels like cheating as I can throw a ship out of the atmo(but not a stable orbit) without needing any rocket engine. If I can do this then all I need is one nuke and I have no need of the rapier but this feels wrong to me. I think the ram air intake should weight 0.5 tons but produce 8 times the air intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe discussion is about the engine power given identical intake ratios for each. You are changing the variables to argue that one engine is better than the other when the tests have already established that each engine is running on identical intake ratios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Marin SSTO was originally made with the RAPIER engine in mind before I changed it to the RamJet engine, and given both were running on the 4:1 ratio (note that the intakes are not clipped and are placed on the plane which conforms to some form of aerodynamic realism) the tests for each engine is valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16683090/KSP/screenshot18.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only benefit I see to using the RAPIER is allowing you to have a different ascent profile, like what Captain Sierra has done with a more rocket-like ascent. While the TurboJet engine takes advantage of the lifting surfaces of the plane so that you spend more time horizontally gaining speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaw stat wise, a good TurboJet/Rockomax combo blows the RAPIER out of the water, but for ease of use, the RAPIER wins out. The choice of which engine you want to use depends on the type of craft you are making, what you want it to do, and what ascent profile you want to fly. I use the RAPIER engines for my heavier planes that spend a lot of time in space, and I use the traditional jets for very small planes that have less fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicking one engine over the other as a clear superior engine and the other to be thrown away just shows that some people can\u0027t see that the two engines are used in very different situations and roles, so they end up limiting themselves design-wise in their crafts, and then complain that their crafts have a difficult time getting into orbit etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
