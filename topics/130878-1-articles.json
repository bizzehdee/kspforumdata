Not sure if there are advantages to it, though. Flying a new fuel module to the thing would require you to have docking ports on each part. On the other hand, you could dock a tanker to a one-piece ship and transfer fuel through a single set of rings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPmAn","CreatedById":121564,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T04:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, should put up a poll, I am on my mobile phone right now\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T10:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could use KAS/KIS to swap parts over rather than needing docking ports on everything, but there\u0027s a weight limit on what a kerbal can manipulate so you\u0027d need to have several of them EVAing on the part at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I go for the separate tanker approach\u00A0and transfer fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T15:05:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d opt for for the tanker option too. \u00A0You can be much more flexible in what ships you send \u00A0to deliver fuel. \u00A0As long as it has the same sized docking port\u00A0you can send any vessels you like, and\u00A0you will have a lot less shuffling about when you get there -\u00A0just dock, transfer and go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T22:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222382970\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130878\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453953967\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022121564\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JPmAn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E1\u200E/\u200E28\u200E/\u200E2016 at 10:06 PM, JPmAn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be feasible to have a dockable engine section with an expendable, replaceable\u00A0fuel section, or a reusable fuel section, with refueling spacecraft.
