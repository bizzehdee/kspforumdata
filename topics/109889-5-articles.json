While colonization and interstellar travel are appealing, especially to those who are fascinated by space travel, as all of us are, the technology is centuries away, in my opinion. The Space Race resulted in some amazing engineering feats, and did result in some great technological innovations, our real focus in the 21st century should be developing technology to stabilize our own planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no realistic scenario where we colonize other planets, whether inside or outside of our own solar system, within this century.

If it is possible and profitable, I have no doubt that our species (or whatever evolutionary ancestors are around at that time) will pursue it and accomplish it.
