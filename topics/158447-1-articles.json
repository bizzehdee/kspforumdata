I removed the cfg lines that caused overheating. Looks like the program sees the new nacelle exhaust\u00A0caps as blocking the engines - because the exhaust do attach to the engine nozzle and I just pulled the caps\u00A0back to hide the engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just occurred to me (while typing this) that I could add an attachment node to the ram air and attach the engines then pull the engines\u00A0into the nacelle covers. Will it work? Is that the cleanest way to solve my problem or is something else easier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T00:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147465-red-shirt/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022147465\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147465-red-shirt/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Red Shirt\u003C/a\u003E. The problem is that the engines are too far into the intake parts regardless of how they\u0027re attached. Either the engines will blow off the intakes or the intakes will clip into and block their thrust. You\u0027ll have to deal with the engines being a little more visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T00:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I added a node and left a little more engine exposed.
