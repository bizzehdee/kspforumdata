Well, an air based attitude indicator works around the ground and the north pole. It uses a heading to let you know which direction you are going and has pitch going from -90 to \u002B90 degrees. A space based attitude indicator won\u0027t have a heading because there is no north pole in space. Remember that some planets have their axis tilted compared to the earth so which would you use? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space based indicator uses yaw instead of heading.

Pitch should be 0 to 359 no 0 to 90 then back to 0 for the top 180. When you get a pitch of 80 degrees you have to check the heading to find the true position.

With the current method an 80 degree pitch could be TWO positions on the ball and you have to use the heading to find the actual pitch. Same with heading and yaw. You can set a heading of 180 and get an actual heading of 90 if the pitch is set to 180.

WHICH WAY DO YOU TURN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you had the Apollo nav ball it would be a piece of cake as the error needles tell you EVERYTHING you need to know. They even tell you when the direction is coming round as they will start to move before the KSP marker would appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollo was planned down to the last nut, bolt and washer and they always used Pitch, Roll and Yaw... not Heading... and each value was 0-359... not 0-180, -180 to 0. There must have been a reason for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EtgyHir.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EtgyHir.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah... one thing that I meant to say regarding the aeroplane style ball. Aeroplane nav balls have only TWO AXIS... Yes, even those don\u0027t use a heading. They use a compass for that. Now as there isn\u0027t a magnetic field in space there had to be a fix and that fix was to make the ball handle three axis of movement and name that extra axis the Yaw axis. It was that third axis that totally blew my mind when I was trying to figure out how they made the ball move in sync with the the spacecraft attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact the ball in an aircraft is mounted in a C holder with the C normally in the horizontal position. When the ball is rotated in the mount it denoted the pitch. When the C clamp is rotated that is the roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Apollo FDAI they did is slightly different. They took a the ball, made it hollow and cut it into two. Then they took a disc the same diameter of the ball and put it vertically between the two halves and put an axis through the disc which would now become the pitch. The disc is then mounted in a C mount like the aeroplane version only instead of it being horizontal it is now vertical. when the disc rotates it is now denoting the yaw. When the C mount rotates that is the roll as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T00:24:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T01:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout colors... even if 8 ball style indicator could be black and white, the classic horizon could use also common, Blue-black style... take a look :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dJhlMMXPFv0/TIbc_QBQmUI/AAAAAAAAD7Y/NUtX8pjKmYc/s1600/IMG_7892.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IMG_7892.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpion","CreatedById":4192,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T05:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always liked the idea of having a screen to customize your own HUD.
