I\u0027m not really great at setting all the controls up and it\u0027s not something that I have been really ever done. I can easily reset my own graphic settings, and i haven\u0027t done anything to the keyboard controls. This would be great. \n\nP.S. I hope I posted this where it needed to be."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T17:05:01Z","Content":"I do, but have no idea how to copy the settings. Why not just make your own? It doesn\u0027t take too long. Just remember to increase the \u0022dead zone\u0022 on the analog sticks slightly as the default tends to drift a tad, at least with my controller.\n\nI agree that the Xbox controller is superior in many regards - it has analog inputs, and I can map both rotation and translation to the same controller."},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:23:22Z","Content":"Could someone suggest a good setup for a gamepad?"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:21:31Z","Content":"My scheme is as follows:\n\nLeft stick: pitch and yaw\n\nL/R: roll\n\nRight stick: move camera\n\nD=pad: translate up/down/left/right\n\nLeft and right bumper: translate forward/back\n\nA: Throttle down\n\nB: Throttle up\n\nX: Brakes\n\nY: SAS toggle\n\nLeft stick click: Gear toggle\n\nRight stick click: IVA toggle\n\nStart: pause\n\nSelect: stage\n\nWorks very well for launches, landings and docking. Is passable for flying planes, kind of like Star Fox 64 with realistic aero. It\u0027s useless for EVA though as I haven\u0027t found a way to bind kerbal movement to an axis."}]}
