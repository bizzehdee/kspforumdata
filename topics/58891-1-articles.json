It kinda makes me think though about something I never checked. Can you set toggle RCS? For large dockings, I place them close to center of gravity on either side to prevent spinning making it all translation movements and to minimize spinning. Long distance flight crafts, I will use structure to apply rotation torque which is what I want and not translation. I will need to try later, and if not, definitely going to add toggle abilities to my RCS so I can set up hotkeys. I usually have my thrusts and mass well balanced but I still hate translating with the rocket starting turning every time I try.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JayKay","CreatedById":90560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T02:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built a 900 tonne plus ship in my previous sandbox save. I had five central ASAS units and nine more reaction wheels by the Nervas at the back. It could quickly and precisely maneuver to any orientation I wanted (well, other than the horrendous lag slowing things down.) So, it is certainly possible to make a big ship maneuver using ASAS units. It won\u0027t help you dock, though, since you need RCS to do linear movements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to regularly dock fuel ships to my space station at about 80 tonnes each. The best advice I can give is make sure your RCS units are positioned at the axes of the center of mass, and that you have four of them, symmetrically placed front and back and on both sides. This is more important than being at the corners of the ship. Sometimes it helps to move fuel back and forth between different tanks to help balance the ship. It\u0027s still important to have one or two heavy duty reaction wheels working to help keep the ship in line if it\u0027s slightly off balance. By switching back and forth between linear and rotation mode quickly you can also keep even badly balanced craft lined up, but it takes some practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJK\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T03:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA big ship is not going to be very maneuverable no matter what you do with it.
