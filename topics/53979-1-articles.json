To cut to the chase.. refuling via Kethane mining was key. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why oh why bother trying to refuel from the bottom of a deep gravity well? Also, since kethane to monopropellant and kethane to liquid fuel and liquid oxygen is really inefficient why cart kethane around?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy solution was Orbiting Fuel Depots. A bunch of empty tanks with docking ports and one stabalizer module with nothing more than gyros, batteries, a few solar cells and a docking port to keep the tanks from tumbling so they can be docked with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna lander has a small drill, a small kethane processor and the tiny kethane tank. It lands on Ike with an extra empty tank or two from the depot attached at ports. (Low gravity, you can hang on more things and still land and take off). It mines kethane and converts it simultaneously without storing any but a minor amount of Kethane. Once loaded up the lander boosts to orbit, transfers excess fuel (main and RCS) to the fuel depot. Three or four round trips are enough to load enough fuel to completely fuel the lander twice, and leave the lander with a full load. How to get from Ike to Duna? Not much effort but to save fuel I use a nuclear powered tug to push the whole thing into Duna orbit. (I follow KASA guidelines in the use of NERVA units and never use them to land anywhere or in an atmosphere) I end up easily with a full lander and more than enough in orbit fuel to refuel it twice. BTW - I try and land on DUNA where I can refuel for the return trip which cuts down on refuling in orbit.

Lift fuel from the place where you have the mining done, not kethane. That way all you have on orbit are empty tanks, and all you need is to build a ship that has a lot of excess delta-v for the trip and is as big as you can to do it. The bigger it is, the more fuel it\u0027ll have as excess. So a huge SSTO, and the gravity of the place you refuel from defines your mass fraction and therefore the efficiency of your operation. Thus always refuel orbital fuel depots from low gravity moons if you want to minimize tanker flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
