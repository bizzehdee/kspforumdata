I don\u0027t want to risk getting home on half of his EVA pack fuel, so I\u0027m sending a rescue mission. Unfortunately, the rocket is HUGE. Therefore, all of the test flights ended in explosions through losing control (not because of aero. Also, using 1.0 for this; which makes aero easier.). Last but not least, before you say, \u0022STRUTS!\u0022, they won\u0027t go as long as I want them to do.

Are you going to Minmus (and yes by the way its called MINMUS NOT MINIMUS god damnit) or to Jool ? Cause that\u0027s a pretty big friggin rocket ! Remove the materials bays, either use a probe or another pod since you want to get bill back too, and make more stuff radial. This is very spaghetti, it will never get to orbit. Try something like 2pods/lander (909 and a 360 LF tank will do)/transfer stage (a 180tank\u002B720tank and a T45 are fine) and then get a first and second stage to get this whole stuff into orbit.\n\nDont be afraid to make stuff radial, moar boosters, tons of fins, and engine clusters with modular girders, as well as a s\\*\\*tload of space tape"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:53:23Z","Content":"I echo the others in this thread, shorten the rocket, and add radial stages if you can.

If you pull the rocket up instead of pushing it up you don\u0027t even need to use any struts connecting everything each other. You can just keep your engines at the sides of the craft and drop fuel tanks as you go up under the craft.

In general, anything that can get you to the Mun and back will work just as well for Minmus.\n\n1) I removed all the science stuff (it is a rescue mission after all), but you could prob add 1 or 2 back on.\n\n2) Removed 2 tanks off the lander and 5 tanks off every other stack. This is probably the most important part, you just have too much mass for too little engine power and the rocket looses velocity after SRB burnout. You always want more Dv, but it doesn\u0027t do you any good if you have to burn all of it before you get to orbit. Also makes it way less bendy.\n\n3) I WILL say STRUTS ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)! There were no struts on the lower stage or SRBs. You\u0027ve got 5 long fuel tank spaghetti\u0027s for your first stage. Just because the stacks are touching does not make them connected and might make things even worse! Part clipping can do weird things. The 4 outside engines were also drawing fuel from the center stack for some reason, stuck a decoupler in there to stop that. \n\nBigger is rarely better when it comes to (sane) rockets.
