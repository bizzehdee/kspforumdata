Solar panels DO absorb much more energy, thermal and otherwise. You can think about it as simply as considering their color (which is a function of their absorbency). Solar panels designed for space operation tend to be be a dark shade of blue. That is because that color corresponds to maximum energy absorbency from the Sun. Some of that extra energy is converted to usable electrical energy, but a significant part of that energy is absorbed thermally. Now in real life... is that significant? Idk the answer to that. For example, I am almost certain that the massive panels on ISS aren\u0027t themselves actively cooled (although the station is). It may actually be the case that the panels are quite warm and that a good bit of that heat transfers its way to the main structure of ISS (which is quite possible, given the lack of convection cooling on those panel structures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, dark colored panels certainly absorb more thermal energy per area than a white colored fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think it\u0027s worth considering though... currently I don\u0027t think KSPI models any passive thermal radiation.

In reality, it is possible to put a low-power satellite into orbit with a small amount of solar panels that can passively radiate all waste heat without need for radiators (I am actually designing such a satellite irl). However, this is a game, not reality. In reality, you also need heaters on spacecrafts to keep components warm, potentially in addition to radiators on other parts. It would be easy to change... just give all crafts a base thermal radiation rate (maybe dependent on size).

Once you move on to bigger things, the passive radiation will be insignificant to your needs anyways.
