If your kethane tank is filling that means the drills are working as intended, and you have the refinery on top of the tank, with another tank on top of that, assuming that everything is empty on launch it should work."},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T18:06:41Z","Content":"You probably need more power as running two large drills and convertors takes a good amount."},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T18:18:55Z","Content":"haven\u0027t played with kethane for ages, but wasn\u0027t there something with fuel flow so you had to place fuel lines from tank to converter (not from converter to tank) because it\u0027s some sort of \u0027negative\u0027 fuel flow.

Of course, if the orange tank is full, you need to transfer fuel out to the side tanks, which will NOT be automatically filled (and due to fuel flow with Kethane, still won\u0027t if there\u0027s a fuel route from the orange tank to them)."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T23:31:41Z","Content":"Moved to modded support."}]}
