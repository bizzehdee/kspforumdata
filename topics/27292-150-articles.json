However, once i performed a circulization burn around Minmus, the launch stage ran out of fuel. When i tried to decouple it from the lander, a horrible glitch kicked in, and no matter how many times i rearranged the stages and pressed the spacebar, the decoupler failed to decouple the launch stage from the lander\u0027s engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI desperately poured all my fuel into the launch stage and attempted a landing, hoping that the force would knock the launch stage off.

Alas, after all the effort trying to avoid it, Bill, Bob, and Jeb were stuck on the cold blue moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut there was hope. I managed to stick together a rescue ship without the evil decoupler glitch, and i sent it to Minmus. I landed less than a kilometer from the failed lander, and jetpacked all the crew to the rescue ship.
