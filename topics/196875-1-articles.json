They were able to get a force, but noted that when rotating the \u0022Drive\u0022 into various positions it didn\u0027t seem to change direction (Or something like that). Their conclusion was basically some imperfection in the cavity was causing more heating than average, and thus producing a tiny force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that should\u0027ve killed it, right there. But even if this thing worked, everyone ignores the simple fact that even the \u0022designer\u0022 admits. The damn thing doesn\u0027t scale, and requires increasingly ludicrous amounts of energy to produce more thrust as you continue trying desperately to make it work. So even without the extra mass of propellant, it isn\u0027t this silver bullet to free humanity from the tyranny of the rocket equation. After a point; the weight of the generators completely dominates the thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and it violates one of the core laws of physics, so there\u0027s that minor detail also. Mind you; that would actually be fine if a sufficient explanation backed up by extraordinary evidence was provided and repeatable (One of the things that the \u0022Well we should have an open mind\u0022 people seem to forget). But it doesn\u0027t....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecial and General Relativity were \u0022Crazy\u0022 ideas for their time, but Einstein didn\u0027t just go lay down and say **** you haters. Nah, he sent teams to observe eclipses and measure the difference in the position of stars that could only be explained by the sun\u0027s mass bending the light around it. He also showed that the anomalies in Mercuries orbit were explained by his model, and even today GPS has to account for tiny amounts of relativistic drift for it\u0027s calculations.

What defines the behavior of \u0022Engaging gravity waves\u0022? What would even make you think that the behavior is related to Gravity waves in any way? There\u0027s multiple detectors around the world, and they would\u0027ve noticed any anomalies during the testing. So this ad hoc hypothesis doesn\u0027t even stand up to the most basic of scrutiny, and the explanation of microwaved copper is still valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits a known property of waves that when they interact with each other they can either cancel out, or stack up, scientists call it interference. this is likely true for gravity waves. considering that there are multiple sources in the universe at various frequencies and amplitudes, the universe is effectively a sea of gravity fields which are constantly in flux. sort of like the gravitational equivalent of radio static as a large number of radio sources interact in such a way as to create a chaotic mess. so its no aether, just a product of multiple wave interactions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nenter mega drive, em drive\u0027s mechanical cousin. the real difference between the two is that the mega drive is built on a lot of peer reviewed science (from theory to device, while em drive attempted to go the other way). the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodward_effect#Propellantless_propulsion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewikipedia article\u003C/a\u003E is really out of date, but it does cover the theory of operation pretty well. the article describes the use of capacitors and inductors, but they have moved on to stacks of pzt disks, which are electrostrictive. the short explanation is that if you physically oscillate an energy storage device while simultaneously charging it up you should get some thrust. the claim is that it exchanges momentum with matter in the distant universe. now i have to admit that woodward and his team have been getting slammed hard in peer review in the past year or two.\u00A0in part because\u00A0em drive, and also because of the unfavorable outcome of tests of their thruster in dresden. and another guy from their team (rodal sp? i think) put out a paper that stated that mega would be impractical as a thruster.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy idea was simply to find a relatively strong gravitational wave source, tune the frequency of the drive to match that of the gravity waves (it doesnt have to be 1:1, i figure you could hit a harmonic), point the drive at it, run the test and see if the results are any different. i dont think this would work for an em drive unless it was designed to hit a specific harmonic of the target gravity wave, which means making a custom cavity, but its possible that it could be tested in the same way with a one off test article. with the way that the mega drive is supposed to work, i was wondering if you could selectively use a single gravity source as the thing from which to borrow momentum, rather than \u0027the distant universe\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni should point out that i dont expect these drives to go anywhere, give me old boom boom any day, and i think that it may turn out to be quack science. but quacks doing quack science doesn\u0027t harm anyone (people arguing about it on youtube now, or worse using it to \u0027prove\u0027 some other wackjob ideology. thats more a symptom of general scientific illiteracy). wouldn\u0027t be the first time a scientist chased their own shadow.\u00A0but you wanted me to play scientist, im out of my league there, so i dont have any equations for you. but there are woodward\u0027s equation from the wikipedia article. i need to better familiarize myself with the math behind gravity waves. since im making an assumption that gravity fluctuation \u002B mass fluctuation = moar boosters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-13T15:36:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2020 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-13T18:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTBH, riding a gravitational wave strikes me as impractical for one reason: they\u0027re really, really weak.
