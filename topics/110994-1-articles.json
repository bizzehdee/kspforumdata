The problem starts when i return back to KSC then switch back to the craft only to find ap and pe constantly moving. Any other craft i have in orbit are experiencing the same issue. They are stable unless i switch to them. When the physics starts effecting the craft orbit constantly moves. It is stable while fast forwarding tho so only when physics are applied that this issue starts. The fact that the game is letting me fast forward might mean that this is not phantom acceleration since if i was accelerating the game wouldn\u0027t let me fast forward. Not only the pe and ap constantly moves the inclanation changes when i turn the craft and comes back into its normal place when it returns back to the first position it stared the turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: WaypointManager, MechJeb2, [x] Science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving the mods doesn\u0027t fix the bug and new game i create doesn\u0027t have this bug.

IE did you use MechJeb\u0027s circularize? Because if that gets too close to 0 you get errors in calculating apoapsis and periapsis, if it\u0027s actually 0 they cease to exist. Basically the game has limited precision, and the change in altitude over a range is too small, so the apsides get smeared along the orbit and start jumping around randomly. It shouldn\u0027t really harm anything, but if it\u0027s too annoying you can de-circularize the orbit slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei know what you are talking about but this is not that.

I think this is caused by either ships that are too big and not sturdy enough ending up bending and creating kraken forces or moving something big with a claw. Clipping parts together is another reason why this happens but only if the parts are under alot of stress.

As i see it this bug is like the oldest bug there is in KSP which they still just couldn\u0027t fix. Did they improve it? Yes. Untill you start creating big and complicated crafts the kraken stays away laying in the deep dark corners of the universe waiting for the opportunity to rise. In the end its just a matter of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntill this gets fixed we as players have only one choice and that is to be really carefull about what we build and how we build them while using mods that improve structral integrity.
