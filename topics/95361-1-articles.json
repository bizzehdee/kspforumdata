The xx will then increase as each minor version gets released 1,2,3,4...,23,24,25 etc - at version 25 they realised they were on the verge of making an officially released product and switched from alpha to beta so skipped a few minor version numbers all the way up to 90 - in fact version numbering still allows you to have minor versions 100, 101 etc so you could still have kerbal version 0.100 in 10 versions time!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you could also think of it this way - its the computer version of feet and inches, minutes and seconds etc so if I said it was ten thirty pm you\u0027d write it as 10:30pm (or 22:30) - no one will ask \u00273 minutes past ten? why don\u0027t you write it as 10:3\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeet and inches are written out as 3\u002711\u0022.
