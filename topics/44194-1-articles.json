I\u0027m building a monster of a space station right now, its only half done and its already killing my FPS. Once its finished, I doubt I\u0027ll be able to even dock with it. But its going to look sweet, so I\u0027d still like to finish it. What I want to know is when KSP will try and load it. If I leave it at its current 1000km orbit and don\u0027t venture too close to see it, will those thousands of parts never get loaded? Or does it always sit there somewhere when I load that save, gnawing away on my ageing computer\u0027s resources?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T06:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil you get within 2.25kms of another ship, it is just a moving point in space.

I was a bit worried it would end up too epic to keep, but once construction is finished I\u0027ll just keep well away from it, unless I want to show it off to someone. Or if it\u0027s the only refuelling station in range in an emergency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Beaumonde Station so far, by the way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img692/7682/57t6.png\u0022 alt=\u002257t6.png\u0022\u003E Still needs a second solar sail at the bottom, then I need to fill those 4 attachment points. The plan is 2 habitable modules, a hangar, and an extended docking arm. Man, that\u0027s gonna be some laggy construction. At least docking at 2 FPS makes it harder to overcorrect!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
