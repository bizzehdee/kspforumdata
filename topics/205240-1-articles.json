If the game stops loading then it\u2019s probably because an exception has occurred that the game can\u2019t deal with, so check the very end of the log files and work backwards; a good text editor like VSCode makes this vastly easier than using the default Notepad as it has many more search options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post the logs you\u2019ve got?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fihnakis","CreatedById":214199,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-17T17:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo log file, I\u0027ve since done a few clean installs and through trial and error figured the mods conflicting. Thank you for the info on what to look for. It will be helpful if I add any mods in the future and have trouble.\u00A0 I did find a Notepad \u002B\u002B plugin that makes reading log files easier by highlighting only certain messages.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
