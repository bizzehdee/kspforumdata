I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. \n\nAs always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - **some details may change or be entirely incorrect**.\n\n**Squadcast Summary for 2015-02-28** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/3843322)\n\nBusy busy busy week at Squad..\n\nUpdate on the fairings, something like there may be a mode to **build them using cursor tracking?** No pictures of fairings today, not quite ready to show yet. **The fairings are procedurally generated, but not automatically generated.** You have to design and build them yourself, but the game helps you do that.\n\nNew 1.0 animation coming along excellently, you can expect awesome things from danRosas. The Engineers Report is coming along and being fleshed out nicely as well. **The Barn is being improved a lot**, the soul of the models has been preserved, they have to be of the same aesthetic, but the visual quality has been improved. **It\u0027s not so much a farm any more, it\u0027s more of an abandoned military facility kind of thing.** It still has the farm aesthetic, but it\u0027s looking a lot better and yeah.. Looks like an abandoned military facility, has same soul of the Barn.\n\nThe next update will probably take longer than any other update in KSP history. An ungodly amount of bugs have been slain, more are being lined up.\n\nProbe cores got trashed in 0.90, yes, Squad knows - they\u0027re rebalancing stuff, remember? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nContract news: **retooling kerbal rescue so they\u0027ll show up in different places, e.g. on Dunas surface, you show up and he\u0027s sitting by his pod.** The tourism one is also being looked at - the tourist is a kerbonaut with 0 skills in anything so you\u0027ll need to be a good player to do this cheaply. It\u0027s pretty profitable, should be a big hit. The initial altitude contracts are also being reworked (like, you can automatically complete them once you accept them if you\u0027ve already done it [*OWK: not the best way to fix that, but hey ho*])\n\nAerodynamic \u0027off\u0027 switch clarification - added a switch for modders (like FAR) that can just turn off the aero calculations full stop so they can add their own in - NOT one that reverts the atmo to 0.90 soup.\n\nChase cam is good for short term shenanigans, but it can really mess with your depth perception so all cameras are being reworked to ameliorate this - it\u0027ll come in handy, say, for multiplayer, the ability to more easily track another object.\n\n**Multiplayer: still very much in development, but is a looooooong endeavour.** Like, to make it is fairly easy. But to make it stable and easily playable will take a long time. \u0022Just give us time, guys\u0022, mmk? They just ask for your patience ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) A few updates are in the way before we get to MP.\n\nIVAs aren\u0027t quite ready to show yet, but frizzank is not only fast, the quality is incredible. It fits right in with what Squad wants for IVAs, just amazing work. Hopefully next week ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Resource news!** It can now also be turned into monoprop as well as LF and O. This is more than likely what the final thing will look like. There are options in-game to change colours and the raster scan lines are intentional (looks cool, and you can see the ground as well)\n\n![Y35K21h.png](http://i.imgur.com/Y35K21h.png)\n\nAnd this is what you\u0027ll use to extract it (slightly updated/modified version of the original part)\n\n![xyYmYdi.gif](https://i.imgur.com/xyYmYdi.gif)\n\nWith regards to the partnership with Eucl3d, there is, as of 0139hrs GMT, an AMA going on with them on reddit, here\u0027s a small selection of what they\u0027re doing (and the missing Poodle on the KerbalX is for all intents and purposes, intentional). To get a sense of scale, the largest in the middle is just over 1 foot tall.\n\n![ship5.jpg](https://eucl3d.com/public/img/ships/ship5.jpg)\n\nAlso, congrats to Kyasarinn for winning the Valentina\u0027s Day contest! Here\u0027s the winning entry for those that missed it:\n\n![ljUA0Ks.png](http://i.imgur.com/ljUA0Ks.png)\n\nAnd that\u0027s it! I\u0027ll probably update the pics with better resolutions as they\u0027re posted elsewhere, probably in official threads or whatever, so check back in a few hours (or don\u0027t, I\u0027m just a dude sat at his computer at 1.45 am)..\n\nLater, nerds!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T02:08:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP**\n  \nspelling"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T01:48:43Z","Content":"You are my favorite forum goer. thanks for always doing this."},{"CreatedByName":"Spuds","CreatedById":99784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T01:51:36Z","Content":"Thank you OWK!
