The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E says, you MUST have the EC of 3000 to freeze or thaw a kerbal. I went back to very early versions - it never has done what you suggest.  \n\nWhat it does do is consume EC per physics step of the amount defined in the part config by the field \u0022ChargeRate\u0022. This is defined as 30 EC units for all the DeepFreeze parts by default (of course you can change it if you so desire). As long as your vessel is generating 30 units per physics frame then it will continue to consume 30 units until the 3000 is met.\n\nAre you saying this is not working as described above?  \n\nIf so, then it is not because of DeepFreeze but probably changes to the way resources are handled in stock from 1.2 onwards."},{"CreatedByName":"billybob579","CreatedById":97487,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-08T03:28:33Z","Content":"Hm...
