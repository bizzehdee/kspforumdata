He shows you everything in an astonishing series of videos from the basics to more advanced topics like rendezvous/docking, interplanetary trips, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would try for some initial goals to guide your development:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fly a rocket with a Kerbal riding in a pod on top, with a parachute, such that the Kerbal survives the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Try to get a rocket (same conditions as 1) to a high altitude, 10,000 m initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Try a multistage rocket, as these are necessary if you want to go high and far. Get a Kerbal to the edge of space (70 km) and back safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Achieve an orbit with low point (Pe, or Periapsis) over 70 km. Then later do a deorbit burn to bring the Kerbal home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Achieve a near-circular orbit over 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Now you can go advanced: Learn to use the maneuver node to fly to Minmus or the Mun, land there, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImportant: Understand what \u0022staging\u0022 is. These you will see in a schematic stack to one side of your screen. The bottom-most stage is the active one, typically the engine nozzle at bottom. Above this you will have stack separators (rings of explosive bolts to connect stages then later blow them apart), upper stage engines, and eventually at the top, parachutes. Think of what comes in what order of your mission design, and move the items to where they need to be in the stack. The ship design system in KSP does not usually put the items in the right place...you must drag and drop reorder these manually, or the rocket just won\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly example of staging mistakes I have made: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a lower and upper stage engine firing at the same time because I had both engines in the same stage. So the upper stage was out of fuel and contributed nothing to the flight when it was needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrequently I have parachutes deploying at a totally wrong time because of staging errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo always double-check your staging setup before flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would NOT recommend spending that much time on aircraft design intially. It\u0027s harder to design these, and without proper instrumentation, it\u0027s really hard to land without killing the Kerbal. This game really shines in the rocket development and spacecraft flying areas. (OK, spaceplanes are possible but they are among the hardest things to do in KSP.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-29T19:47:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2014 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MajorThomas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded some suggestions\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
