If that\u0027s the case, what you really want to do is slowly tip your rocket over as it\u0027s climbing. So initially you launch straight up, but over time your rocket eventually ends up firing it\u0027s engines while horizontal. If you shoot straight up until you\u0027re above the atmosphere, then turn sideways and fire the engines to make an orbit, you\u0027ll definitely run into some problems. Likely fuel issues and lack of time to run the engines long enough before falling back into the atmosphere again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion would be to take a look at some videos.

The important thing to remember is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethe second one is far more expensive than the first\u003C/u\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 By far the lion\u0027s share of your dV is building up that horizontal velocity, much more than the dV you need to climb to orbital altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, you\u0027d like to be thrusting horizontally (or only slightly above it) the whole way.\u00A0 In fact, that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E what you would do, if that pesky atmosphere weren\u0027t in the way.\u00A0 For example, if you\u0027re taking off in a vacuum (e.g. from the Mun), that\u0027s exactly what you do: upon liftoff, you immediately crank it over to almost perfectly horizontal-- just the tiniest bit higher than horizontal to keep you from scraping your toes. Then you burn hard until you\u0027re going at orbital speed just above the ground, and keep burning until you\u0027ve raised your apoapsis to where you want it.\u00A0 Then you coast up to apoapsis and need only a very small burn to circularize, since you\u0027re already in a near-circular orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Kerbin, you can\u0027t do that when you\u0027re down on the ground, because drag.\u00A0 But it\u0027s still the ideal trajectory, so you want to get into a horizontal mode as soon as possible, i.e. as soon as you\u0027ve climbed enough for atmosphere to not be such a big deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you need to start tipping eastwards as soon as you\u0027re off the pad.\u00A0 Gently at first.\u00A0 By the time you reach 10-12 km in altitude, you should already be tipped at around 45 degrees, moving at 300\u002B m/s, and accelerating hard.\u00A0 By the time you\u0027re at 25 km, you should be only 20-30 degrees above the horizontal, and still accelerating hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen just burn until you raise your apoapsis to something reasonable, like 80 km.\u00A0 Coast up to apoapsis, then do a burn to circularize.\u00A0 The circularization burn won\u0027t be too huge, because you\u0027re already going sideways very fast.\u00A0 Depending on your launch profile, it\u0027ll be anywhere from 800 to 1200 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess the best question for us to ask you is:\u00A0 how many m/s are you needing for your circularization burn?\u00A0 If it\u0027s a lot higher than 1200 m/s, then you\u0027re doing something wrong (I\u0027d guess not going horizontal enough on the ascent).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T16:32:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T21:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222308933\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127061\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449292864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154404\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Orc\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Orc said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nANYWAY, as I understand things the Optimal use of fuel is burn at maximum thrust until you\u00A0run out of atmosphere to push against (roughly 50km ?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA correction here: Rocket engines are \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E efficient in atmosphere, they generate less thrust for the same amount of fuel used (sometimes dramatically so).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from that, the video Claw linked shows how to do an efficient gravity turn for a smooth ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orc","CreatedById":154404,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T08:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for the replies.

When you get round to buying the full version (and you will... !) you\u0027ll find that the really most efficient way of getting to orbit is to start turning as soon as you leave the launchpad. A couple of degrees east (90\u00B0 on the navball) straight away, then basically follow prograde and if you did it right you\u0027ll be at around 350m/s at 10km altitude and inclined about 45\u00B0 to the horizon.

That means that it may be a touch more efficient to make the start of your gravity turn later. The old (old, old) rule of 10km straight up then turn 45\u00B0 is NOT valid for the demo or the full version, but the basic idea is certainly more valid for the demo: head straight up to start with, but above all remember that it is horizontal speed that you need and make it happen as soon as you feel that you\u0027re not just going to plough through (and get heated by) heavy low-level atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T22:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you are up above 20 or 30 km, I recommend you switch to the map view (\u0022M\u0022), then pull up the nav-ball (click the little tab at the bottom of the screen) and watch your apoapsis climb. \u00A0Your exact ascent angle will depend on your thrust-to-weight ratio, but you should be in the middle of your gravity turn by this point, climbing roughly forty-five degrees relative to the surface.\u00A0 As your apoapsis gets closer to 70 km you can progressively turn your rocket to more of a horizontal vector and keep thrusting. \u00A0As you approach your target altitude, you can start easing off on the throttle a bit and cut it entirely when your apoapsis is exactly where you want it to be. \u00A0Once there, you can drift up toward your apoapsis and just let the laws of motion carry you there. \u00A0Again, exactly where you do this next step and for how long will depend on your thrust-to-weight ratio, but you should wait until you are close to the apoapsis and then thrust prograde when you get near it. \u00A0The closer you are to the apoapsis as you thrust, the less you will push the apoapsis out and the more of that energy will go toward raising the periapsis. \u00A0Just be careful not to leave it too late, or you will not have enough time to complete your orbital stabilizing\u00A0maneuver and will fall back into the atmosphere.\u00A0 Like earlier, start easing off the throttle as your target periapsis gets near where you want it to be, then cut it when it is exactly where you want it. \u00A0For a standard circular orbit, you will probably want to cut the throttle entirely just as your apoapsis and periapsis start to \u0022flip\u0022, as that will be the point at which they are closest to each other. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-05T22:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2016 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fearless Son\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
