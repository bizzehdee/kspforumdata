The reason I didn\u0027t just go with that and made my mod is that the booster depends on specialty resources added by KSPI and is really designed as a specialty rocket for Mun missions since the ISRU refinery can harvest aluminum and oxidizer from the Mun\u0027s surface.

One relatively painless option that worked for me is the -force-opengl flag, to try it just right-click on a shortcut to KSP and add that flag to the very end of the command (after the closing double quote around the path). The only side affects are that the graphics are glitched when I first start the game (an alt-tab to desktop and then back into the game resolves everything), antialiasing doesn\u0027t work from the in-game settings (you have to force it in your graphics driver) and screenshots are flaky sometimes, like they\u0027re grabbing what was shown on the screen a few seconds before you pushed the button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat option freed up enough memory for me to run a full maxmods install with great stability, along with the Outer Planets mod with EVE, TextureReplacer, PlanetShine and Distant Object Enhancement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T15:48:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T16:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113833-0-90-LightsOut-%28v0-1-1%29-Day-Night-Mode-in-VAB-SPH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI want to reccomend this ncie little add on LightsOut\u003C/a\u003E.
