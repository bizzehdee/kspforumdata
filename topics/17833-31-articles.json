The new simulation code appears to be much better but a couple of issues have cropped up with the Horizon Zenit mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, this mod sets the electric charge on the engines to be tweakable even on those with zero capacity and this seems to trigger a bug in KSP that, when you open the tweak panel, it shows NaN/0.0 and this breaks the mass calculations (with knock on effects on other values). I have worked around this and reported it to the author who will fix it in the next release of his mod. I will also report it to Squad as a KSP bug as it should just refuse to make it tweakable if the capacity is zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue is that KER is not currently handling engines with multiple engine modules correctly. It only uses one of the modules for the calculations which results in wildly wrong thrust (and hence TWR) values and (usually) somewhat less wrong ISP (and hence deltaV) values. This will require considerable work to fix \u0022properly\u0022 as I think different engine modules could theoretically use different propellants which may mean sub-engines could burn-out part way through a stage, changing the effective ISP (as well as effectively simulating the individual engine modules as separate engines, this also needs the simulation to calculate the effective isp of the stage backwards from the stage\u0027s deltaV). Hopefully I will be able to look at this over the next few days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of more intricate tweaks that could be done such as taking account of the orientation of engines which may be useful for landers with splayed out radial engines or shuttle type designs with angled main engines where some of the thrust is wasted but they need more thought to work out how to do them properly (e.g. this example actually needs the deltaV to be calculated as the final magnitude of the vector sum of the individual engine contributions throughout the stage to account for both early burn out and the direction of the thrusts).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T00:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are a number of more intricate tweaks that could be done such as taking account of the orientation of engines which may be useful for landers with splayed out radial engines or shuttle type designs with angled main engines where some of the thrust is wasted but they need more thought to work out how to do them properly (e.g. this example actually needs the deltaV to be calculated as the final magnitude of the vector sum of the individual engine contributions throughout the stage to account for both early burn out and the direction of the thrusts).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth asking sarbian about that, since MechJeb \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-0-22-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-1?p=861941\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post861941\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecan include cosine losses\u003C/a\u003E in its dV calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T13:13:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T00:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, this mod wont work.
