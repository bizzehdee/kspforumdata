Thank the Incans, they bred a tuber hardy enough for a different planet.\u003Cp\u003EI think I can tell where you\u0027re going with this. Basically, in order to do things kerbals do all the time, humans will need to develop the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. G-equivalent systems like a rotating torus that can be trusted not to break and fly apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Passive and/or active shielding systems to block the rads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Closed-loop life-support systems, either mechanical or biological.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just develop cryostasis. Then you get put in a meat locker, loaded onto the ship, and wake up on Mars. But that technology is even further down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSR devised the concept of terrariums in his book \u003Cem\u003E2312\u003C/em\u003E. They\u0027re asteroids hollowed-out and spun for gravity with whole ecosystems grown inside and placed into interplanetary transfer orbits. Their exteriors are excellent mass-shields against rads. The spinning prevents all the problems of \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5g. The biomes support human passengers physically as well as psychologically. A short-distance shuttle takes you from one planet to the terrarium and then, months later, from it to your destination planet. It\u0027s a brilliant if long-term solution. Building the prototype will take years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZubrin\u0027s alternative is to not care about the rads and trust the lives of astronauts to a steel cable between the rotating crew module and spent 3rd stage. He\u0027s a crackpot. This isn\u0027t his only completely mad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of a magnetic shielding system against rads because it can also be used for propulsion and to make aerocapture possible without the mass or the risk of an ablative shield. Your magnet can be in the form of a superconducting ring, which is incidentally a wonderful shape for a rotating spacecraft. If the whole thing is spinning rather than a single part that eliminates one or two joints between the rotating section and the stable section, which reduces mission risk. The maiden voyage of this technology is slated for a trip to Uranus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T09:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome post fireflower!

Recruit some doctors to be \u0027nauts, seal them up there for a year, have them all monitoring each other\u0027s health, and then shuttle them back down to Earth to monitor their recovery. The knowledge will be immensely valuable as each of the planets and planetoids I\u0027ve listed has been listed for colonization.
