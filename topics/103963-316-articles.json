It\u0027s simple, you are seeing the scaledSpace planet.

This is a good solution but also has a downside.. You see when we increase the gap between far and clip plane we \u0022spread\u0022 the depth buffer precision even further resulting in potentially more z-fighting artifacts and blurrier shadows.\n\n2) A second solution is to simply deactivate the PQS and switch to scaledSpace before reaching the altitude where we reach the far clip plane limitations. The issue with this is that we switch to scaledSpace sooner and so, we have less details to look at, at low altitude.
