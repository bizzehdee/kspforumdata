Its a good idea having the separate space programs so I might release the pack in separate American and Russian missions along with the combined in a few weeks once exams are over and I get some feedback on any bugs that may be present across multiple contracts - Better to find them and fix them all at once rather than possibly missing some by mixing the packs. Nevertheless its a good idea!\n\nThis pack actually only began as an idea for a contract pack for the Space Shuttle Missions, so these are the \u0027key\u0027 contracts in the pack; as a result some of the Soviet/Russian missions are lacking some TLC - Version 1.0.1 I hope! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T00:43:09Z","Content":"Awesome, when I get my career started, this\u0027ll influence my missions alot, I like to replicate real missions.

I have written the contracts in such a way so that anything that is launched is recovered or deorbited (such as the Salyut, Skylab and Mir series; a final contract involving these is to deorbit and destroy them once all contracts involving these are completed (as in reality,with the exception of Skylab having deorbited due to orbital decay\\*), for most of the missions, however I understand that there may be issues with the next update I am releasing which includes more \u0027long duration\u0027 missions such as Cassini or Messenger so I think my only advice would be to try to build these probes out of stock parts or a low ram eating parts pack, however I am writing the contracts from now on in such a way that they are completed before the need to remove a parts pack. \n\n2. My choice would certainly be KCT for this pack since although I have included a \u0027cool down\u0027 period on most of the contracts this is no way near the real life gaps between missions (I know I made 317 (well its more like 350 with the next update..![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)) but I did not want anyone playing solely on Stock to start going mad...) So I think that KCT should work well with the pack! Let me know if there are any problems so I can fix them (e.g if contracts just stop showing up beyond say 50 kerbal days after the last then I probably accidentally set it to 50 years instead ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)).\n\n\\*By the way, unrelated to this pack, I have actually been working on a system of orbital decay for both on rails and off rails vessels (hopefully during timewarp) which I also hope to share (if it works) soon! \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Agreed, as a Canadian i would love to see some things like, put on the Canadarmor Kanadarm on the ISS etc. Lots of nations have contributed to space exploration.\n\nCertainly, the CanadaArm-2 is actually the subject of the STS-100 mission but I will emphasize other nations involvement in an upcoming update."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:59:47Z","Content":"Every once in a while I give career mode a shot, and it has never yet kept my interest for more than a couple of days.

Still having an issue with the CNSA logo ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif) but I hope to fix this asap.\n\nThe next update will feature some more fixes to make the Soyuz missions more interesting, the Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests which will be a prerequisite for the STS missions, the Vega program and (some of) the Luna program. For the moment I have only included Rangers 7,8 \u0026 9 since these were the only successful missions. I will also try to remove all of the automatic text description generation that KSP puts in; which takes away from the realism! ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nMy time is divided at the moment between this mod, the gauntlet of exams for the next 20 days and my upcoming Orbital Decay plugin (see my [blog](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3589-KSP-Orbital-Decay?goto=next) for more), so I will be unable to release a new update for a few days but I will be around to bugfix if anyone finds any nagging issues! Enjoy! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
