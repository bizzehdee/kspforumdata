Here\u0027s how it began, Bob was on his way to get to a polar orbit, above 300km, so as to get some science from high above Kerbin. But something happened; the engines were not strong enough, and so Bob came crashing back down while launching. He landed safely after a dangerous re-entry in Kerbin\u0027s North Pole, where he explored for a while, climbed a higher area, and named the area \u0022Polar Lake\u0022, due to the large flat area that resembled a frozen lake. He was recovered safely, but it was a great adventure!
