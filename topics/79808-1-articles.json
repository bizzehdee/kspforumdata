Turn RCS BA on early in the build process, while you\u0027re still arranging the main pods, tanks, and engines, and arrange these parts so that the red ball is inside the yellow ball either completely (ideal) or with only a small part sticking out.

The 1st thing to consider is whether there is a real need to dock the assembled mass to anything, or whether the only docking will be by individual modules. If several combined modules won\u0027t ever be the active ship in a docking, then there\u0027s no need to worry about the RCS balance of the assembly. Balance is only needed for translation and translation (at least the side-to-side directions) is only needed for docking. Fore-and-aft translation, should it be needed to fine-tune orbits, is a no-brainer that happens naturally just by putting RCS blocks on with symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you DO want to dock a mass of assembled modules together, what you need to do is build each module individually as described above, using RCS Build Aid. First make sure their CoMs won\u0027t move, then put on the RCS thrusters so you don\u0027t get unwanted rotation. You want this anyway to assemble the whole thing in orbit. And if all the modules are more or less the same size and weight, the assembly will be close enough to balanced that either the stock or MJ RCS balancer will be able to deal with it. This works for ships up to this big:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/jDLMrc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2853/12241869945_2ed5bfc4ca_s.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212241869945_2ed5bfc4ca_s.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship was made in 3 modules: the lab and 6-way hub, the orange tank, and the engines. Each module was individually balanced and the assembled mass was well enough balanced that I could dock a bunch of similar things together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, sometimes modules are different enough in size and/or mass that just balancing each one in isolation won\u0027t do it. If that\u0027s the case, and you really do need to dock this whole thing to something else, then sometimes there\u0027s nothing for it but to save the modules as subassemblies. Then you can stick them all together in the VAB and balance the lot. This can be a bit complicated because each module still needs its own individual balance so you can dock them together, so you can\u0027t change any of the modules. But what you can do is add another module that\u0027s simply a counterweight for balancing the assembly just long enough for it to dock, then you discard it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, however, it\u0027s a lot easier to just dock individual modules to the growing assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T12:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBalance is only needed for translation and translation (at least the side-to-side directions) is only needed for docking.

And if the planet has an atmosphere, I\u0027ll put on some chutes to save a little on fuel even if they\u0027re way too small to land the thing by themselves.
