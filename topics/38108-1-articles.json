Currently, my Manta Mk IV plane has four Aerospikes; two for vertical and two for horizontal. I made an earlier model using jet fuel, but I found the tanks placed vertically for the vertical engines looked unsightly and inefficient. After many (many) tests and failures, I am beginning to wonder if jet fuel was the way to go. Any thoughts or tips for an overly ambitious pilot? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T03:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is one advantage to jet fuel, it\u0027s more efficient, as you don\u0027t need to bring oxidiser of your own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disadvantage is they don\u0027t work outside the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJets also lag behind the throttle, while rockets change thrust instantly, as you\u0027ve probably noticed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother disadvantage is that there are far fewer stock jet engines in the game, so they can be less convenient than using rocket VTOL thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you could try using jet engines on radial attachment points, or cubic struts with fuel provided via fuel lines, rather than putting them directly on the fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coneshot","CreatedById":69785,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T03:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJets are very efficient and run a long time but are hard to control in a VTOL due to long wind up times while changing thrust levels.
