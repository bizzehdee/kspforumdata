It accepts raw height data and builds a min/max table for each subdivision level, which is about a hundred times faster than the current method which builds a full-fledged collision mesh. Then it produces a list of candidate cells (shown in green) from a ray. The only requirement for these steps is that one of the candidate cells be the cell we\u0027re actually casting through, which is usually the case but there are a couple problem spots. I think I\u0027ve worked around those, but my fix involves a hand-tweaked value which only works if it\u0027s high enough and hurts performance if it\u0027s too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last step is to check each of the triangles comprising the candidate cells and pick the cell with the nearest triangle intersection.

A part which shuffled conversion products around would be fantastic. I think a very common configuration of mining and conversion is to have a mining craft, possibly a separate refiner, and lastly some sort of destination/transport tanker-tug all hooked together using KAS pipes. The problem is that resources don\u0027t happily flow across these pipes and take manual alt-right-click transferring. I use TAC fuel balancer to automate this but if Kethane handled this internally that would be better. A little pump part that took electricity and shoved around resources would be quite dear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As nifty as the Ke orbital scanning is it seems a missed opportunity to not have some sort of science-based discovery of Ke deposits. Perhaps different biomes on the Mun would have slightly different multipliers of qty and extraction rates. Scanning might be done for 1-5 trace elements which act as puzzle pieces to locate Ke. I obviously haven\u0027t given it complete thought but something to make it more of a game and introduce more fuzziness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damocles","CreatedById":92224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T21:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Majir, I have a suggestion for you!\u003Cp\u003EWhen generating a new save, you can input a generation \u0022seed\u0022 (Minecraft style), and then the generator takes the seed and generates a Kethane map.

Every so many ticks we recalculate resources on some of the packed craft, by calculating the power generated during the step by adding RTG per time unit to a simple simulation of sunlight power generated (do a simple raycast along a few points of the orbit since last update of craft, towards sun, and check for celestial bodies) and if the craft is not occluded, add in it\u0027s solar power per time unit. For this simplified process we\u0027ll have to ignore battery limits, of course. So now we have say 23,000 units of power in our 1000 unit battery. Now we take the current drain per time unit over that time frame, and subtract it and store it to the packed ship (clipping it to the range of 0..max battery capacity). Maybe we have zero, and we should notify any plugins that are checking power status through this mechanism that this vessel is without power and to behave accordingly (i.e. stop simulating scans, passing radio traffic, etc). If there\u0027s more than zero, then nothing bad happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA further enhancement might be a mechanism that allows players to define a shutdown priority for power failures, for example shut down SCANsat and kethane scanning first, then radio links, and shut down more power hungry radio links before lower power ones, allowing for craft to get back into a positive energy condition in a graceful and automatic way. To go with this, those items should power back up to their original (preferred) states based on the same priority, only in reverse, so that craft power down and go less useful then dark and useless in a graceful fashion if they spend too long in the dark or whatever, then gracefully come back up as they regain energy resources. This enhancement would actually toggle the stored state of the parts on and off accordingly of course, so if you switch to the vessel it is in sync with the simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should allow for a sufficiently accurate simulation of unfocused crafts\u0027 power resource usage / generation. With a fast enough CPU and/or low enough time acceleration and/or few enough unfocused craft, you might even be able to maintain essentially accurate results (by sufficient number of interpolated positions / small enough time steps per game universe update tick). This could potentially automatically be scaled to maintain some minimum level of performance, i.e. try to do all craft every tick and for say, 1 interpolated position / time increment per degree of orbit (or some other unit, per X MKm traveled perhaps), and widening the interpolation distance and/or reducing the number of craft simulated per tick (i.e. you have 30 craft, 15 get simulated one game state update, the other 15 the next)...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"johnsonwax","CreatedById":79077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T08:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BioSehnsucht\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BioSehnsucht\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis perhaps should be part of a generic plugin that all mods can easily take advantage, but ...\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps when a vessel is packed, store:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(stuff)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, create a 2nd part, add .2t or so to its mass, call it an RTG, and take away the power requirement.
