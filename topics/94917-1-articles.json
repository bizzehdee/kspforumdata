It\u0027s lets me play career mode without having to deal with a single contract.

Now funds are actually a factor in my space program and you have to make strategic decisions early on- such as doing a few small contracts before gearing up for a major one. For example, I\u0027ve just had to upgrade mission control to level 3 so that I can take on a \u0027build a new outpost on Duna\u0027 (with wheels) at the same time as the \u0027Explore Duna\u0027 and \u0027Explore Ike\u0027 contracts. The funding advance from each paid for the upgrade. The crew for the Duna expedition will be trained on Mun and Minmus exploration. It seems more like a real space program this way- do some commercial satellite launches for profit so you can then go off and explore. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve still never made use of is the administration building.
