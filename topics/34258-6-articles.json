First, the human eye doesn\u0027t work on an FPS system, and neither does the brain. If it did, we\u0027d see the spokes on a wheel hub while driving down the highway instead of a blur, or solid mass with the the calipers behind said \u0022solid mass\u0022. The brain makes a \u0022best guess\u0022 to what the situation is and blurs things together if necessary so it \u0022makes sense\u0022 and reduces strain. Second, it depends on the specific individual (Which is where that 1% is) and what they\u0027re used to seeing on a monitor (Yes, real life is different than a refresh rate on a computer monitor). Third, you put two monitors, side by side, one running at 60hz and another at 120hz and do anything, even running just calculator on your desktop and dragging it around, you will see a difference in what kind of response you get. The 120 will look smoother. This is, of course, assuming that the video card is setup to work at 120hz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe the original poster is arguing that the brain does work on an FPS system. He is arguing that there is a threshold for frame rates below which the beta movement and phi phenomenon that create apparent motion become noticeably distracting. Besides, there\u0027s no guarantee that we would see perfectly still images even if our brains did see in FPS because there are other factors in motion blur such as exposure time, ISO, and apature size. Examination of 24FPS film stills show examples of motion blur created by slower film speeds and longer exposure times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pontiac\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pontiac\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I bought my 42\u0022 TV about a year and a half ago, I stood in walmart, best buy, future shop, and other electronic stores, watching a wall of TVs for HOURS (in total, and yes, literally stood and watched commercials for a good 30-45 minutes at a time at different stores, sometimes the same store on a different week) to decide on what model I wanted. SPECIFICALLY I was looking to see if there was ANY difference in frame rates, or at least what the difference would look like, just to see if there was a difference between 60 and 120, as well as picture quality between manufactures and models, and THEN went up close to look at specific capabilities. I noticed the difference even BEFORE I looked at the individual capabilities of each TV. Standing about 20 feet back, I could see that the 60hz TV was a bit more \u0022jerky\u0022 between refreshes. What was showing on the wall of TVs was just through a video repeater, so it wasn\u0027t like I was looking at two different signals. Now, there are a few stipulations that I don\u0027t have the answer to, and someone can come bite me in the rear for... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; First, was the repeater working at 120hz? Doesn\u0027t matter as it was a stream to whatever the capabilities of the the repeater were AT MINIMUM. So if the repeater threw it off at 60hz, the 120s threw up at 60 and may have \u0022flushed\u0022 the two different images together. Point is, I could see a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Were the TVs themselves setup for 120? One would like to assume that the TVs come out of the boxes at whatever their top rate speeds were, not at less. Even if there was a chance, not all of them across several walls of TVs were configured as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Were they hooked up via HDMI, Component or Composite? I COULD see this being a significant difference, especially at the Composite point, but, this isn\u0027t the 90s and not many TVs that are being put out on display are run off a composite cables anymore. ESPECIALLY to show off its high end capabilities. (Composite = single cable that splits the RGB signal; Component = Three colors sent across three wires)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you ask the guy NEXT to me who was wondering WTF I was doing, and asked him if he could see a difference, he MIGHT have said no. Why? With absolutely no disrespect, his brain may not have been wired well enough to SEE the difference, or his brain didn\u0027t understand HOW to tell the difference, or he just wasn\u0027t paying attention to that kind of detail. Even with all that said, with my seeing that there was a difference AT ALL indicates that either I\u0027m special, like my mommy and daddy told me so, or, the whole FPS thing is just an excuse for bad performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s good that you took the time to look at TVs in a variety of places/times. There are a lot of factors that can affect your viewing experience including artificial light (which also flickers at rates depending on amperage), video feed, and TV type. However, you are confusing the TV\u0027s flicker rate with its frame rate. Frame rates are constant and decided by the video being shown. Films run at 24 FPS traditionally, NTSC runs at 30, PAL runs at 25. Your TV will always change frames at the rate specified by the source material. In addition to the source-decided frame rate, TVs also have a flicker rate to minimize eye-strain and promote beta movement and phi phenomenon. While the two are related, all TVs show their source-video at the prescribed rate, but they flicker at rates decided by the maker/model. I don\u0027t know if this is true for all TVs, but mine has its flicker rate hard-wired (though I am not aware what the flicker rate is on this model).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you met someone that is unable to see the difference between 60hz and 120hz televisions, it means that they do not perceive motion the same way you do, not that their brain wiring is inferior. That said, legions on particular portions of the brain do inhibit the ability to see motion and patients describe seeing life as a series of still images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiosity, what was the flicker rate of the TV you bought?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"csiler2","CreatedById":62800,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T20:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou compare apples to Mangos. TV Shows and movies are generally recorded wit a camera, in a movie with 24fps a single frame was exposed for about 1/24th of a second. Fast motions become blurry, as you can easily see for yourself if you have a photo camera with variable exposure time. TV shows which are recorded at 60 fps tend to look very sterile if compared to movies because 1/60th of a second almost eliminates this natural motion blur.\u003Cp\u003EAs pontiac above me has already mentioned you eyes work kind of similar. fast movements appear as a blur to you (very subjective however, since this varies for each person and alertness (adrenaline, alcohol, etc.) levels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a Video game however each frame is a snapshot of the game scene without temporal extent - it has an indefinitely short exposure time if you will. If you show 24 of these you will easily see individiual frames as opposed to a 24 fps movie scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are of course attempts to indroduce motion blur in games but at this point thats more to mask awful console graphics than anything else and it looks awful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that cleared something up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, film cameras control frame exposures by adjusting the shutter angle. The standard shutter angle is 180 degrees, making the exposure about half the frame rate. Higher angles correspond to longer exposures. Eg. I set my camera to approximately 180 degree shutter by setting my frame rate to 1/24 and my exposure to 1/50 for most shoots, but if I want to recreate a stop-motion effect, I will decrease the shutter angle by lowering my frame exposure(yes, I am a professional videographer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, only some TV shows are recorded at 60i or interlaced frames. The shows look sterile because each frame is only half an image and not a full image. 60i cameras are effectively recording at 30fps for each half-image, but quality is lost because interlacing was designed as a workaround for image buffering when video was first created. It also allows lower-end cameras to fake high frame rates. Many HD TVs now sow the frames together to recreate the originally intended 30fps, but at lowered quality. The sterility of TV shows using 60i cameras is known as the Soap Opera Effect and is generally seen in productions with limited budgets. High-end productions generally use(d) film or cameras capable of capable of recording at the requisite progressive (real) frame rates of 30 or 25.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfx","CreatedById":37282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T20:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, nothing you write is about the topic of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pontiac","CreatedById":62216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T21:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy reply wasn\u0027t for the OP.

I\u0027m bored at work?). The post was in regards to the advert that we see fluid motion at 20-25fps. I\u0027m not blaming Meraco. Don\u0027t think anything less of him/her, or of anyone for that matter. I don\u0027t care enough about them to warrant skip of a heartbeat of annoyance (Sorry, but its true, and it isn\u0027t meant to be mean or rude). What irks me is that this kind of \u0022knowledge\u0022 is out there, and its flat out false. I call out the eye ball science degree masters to define \u0027fluid\u0027, define \u0027average\u0027, and define the sample set tested to get the results of either \u0027fact\u0027, not to mention define on what devices and mechanisms were used to test this \u0027capability\u0027 and visual comprehension and speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe environmental conditions of all the TVs per store were the same, meaning that I\u0027m not comparing the TVs I saw in Walmart to the TVs I saw at Best Buy, and I understand you\u0027re not pointing at that. I can\u0027t obviously do that comparison objectively because they\u0027re two different physical environments and I\u0027m not trained that well. Although I did notice that all the trims were black..... anyways.. The baseline comparison on the TVs were subject to that exact environment where the TVs were place. For instance, Best Buy had two physically different environments for their TVs. One was in a \u0022dark room\u0022 with nothing but incandescent lighting -- or what seemed to be incandescent anyways, while their other models were sitting out on the main show room floor under fluorescent lighting. Looking specifically at how well the image flowed, vsync to vsync, or flicker to flicker, or frame change to frame change, I definitely could tell that there was a better, smoother transition between images between the higher and lower rate of screen updates. There were a few oddballs, but that happens when you do an analysis of anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for seeing life in a series of still images, I have absolutely no question that kind of thing happens.

This hurts performance - can indeed crash the game altogether. Add to this a suspicion of memory leaks here and there, and a game explicitly designed to have strong mod support being limited by its memory usage, and this is a significant problem area. A solution, at least for some users, would be to find a way to support 64-bit architecture and thereby expand the available memory. This, however, depends on the Unity engine, which, despite 64-bit support on every last one of their targeted platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, PS3 and XBox 360), does not support 64-bit architecture. For some reason. It\u0027s quite inexplicable to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGraphics:\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t really consider this a huge problem in and of itself. It\u0027s not the graphics of this game that will bring modern GPUs to their knees. Both DirectX and OpenGL are able to highly parallelize graphics computation, and can thus show KSP\u0027s level of graphics handily with any modern graphics card. Even high parts-count ships and bases ought to work here - the poly count and shader complexity just does not get that high, unless you use some seriously jacked-up mod parts or custom rendering mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhysics:\u003C/strong\u003E The real problem child IMO.

Especially bad is that it underperforms on non-nVidia computers, as PhysX targets nVidia hardware explicitly, but does not support ATi GPUs for physics processing, for example. But there are options: Bullet is a much superior physics engine which is apparently the target of an integration project with Unity - this would greatly improve performance, especially for non-nVidia users (like myself). Other physics engines exist, and could probably be integrated with Unity to boost its performance on physics tasks - which appears to be the real bottleneck for many-part ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECPU architecture support:\u003C/strong\u003E Unity does not support multi-core CPUs. This exacerbates the above mentioned problems with physics for non-nVidia users, as not only will they not get the excess power of the GPU exploited, their processor will be underemployed as well. I take heart at the mention of partial multi-core support mentioned by Squad, but really, this is something Unity really ought to have in the first place. After all, again, every last one of their target platforms support it. In fact, I\u0027d expect Unity to horrendously underperform on e.g. the PS3 with its cell architecture (8 cores supported by an underpowered control core), or on dual- and quad core mobile units, also a major Unity focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn short:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Squad can help themselves a fair bit by using a different physics engine, such as Bullet, and/or fixing any memory leaks in the game, and by hacking in partial multi-core support.
