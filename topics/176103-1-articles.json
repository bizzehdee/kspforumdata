Have you ever heard of \u003Ci\u003EProject Daedalus\u003C/i\u003E? One of the first detailed design studies of an interstellar spacecraft, \u003Ci\u003EProject Daedalus\u003C/i\u003E was conducted between 1973 and 1977 by a group of 11 scientists and engineers belonging to the \u003Ci\u003EBritish Interplanetary Society\u003C/i\u003E. Intended mainly as a scientific probe, the design criteria specified that the spacecraft had to use existing or near-future technology and had to be able to reach its destination within a human lifetime. Alan Bond led a team of scientists and engineers who proposed using a fusion rocket to reach Barnard\u2019s Star 5.9 light years away. The trip was estimated to take 50 years, but the design was required to be flexible enough that it could be sent to any other target star.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe proposed design would have been 190 meters long and have weighed about 2400 metric tons; 18x bigger than the largest payload ever launched to orbit. Therefore, it would be constructed in Earth orbit. \u003Ci\u003EDaedalus\u003C/i\u003E was to be a two-stage spacecraft. The first stage would operate for two years, taking the spacecraft to 7.1% of light speed, and then after it was jettisoned, the second stage would fire for 1.8 years, taking the spacecraft up to about 12% of light speed, before being shut down for a 46-year cruise period. Due to the extreme temperature range of operation required, from near absolute zero to 1600 K, the engine bells and support structure would be made of molybdenum alloyed with titanium, zirconium, and carbon, which retains strength even at cryogenic temperatures. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDaedalus\u003C/i\u003E would be propelled by a fusion rocket using pellets of a deuterium/helium-3 mix that would be ignited in the reaction chamber by inertial confinement using electron beams. The electron beam system would be powered by a set of induction coils trapping energy from the plasma-exhaust stream. 250 pellets would be detonated per second, and the resulting plasma would be directed by a magnetic nozzle. Due to scarcity of helium-3 on Earth, it was to be mined from the atmosphere of Jupiter by large hot-air balloon supported robotic factories over a 20-year period, or from a more abundant source, such as the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage would have two 5-metre optical telescopes and two 20-metre radio telescopes. About 25 years after launch these telescopes would begin examining the area around Barnard\u2019s Star to learn more about any accompanying planets, the main reason why the star was the chosen target, although we learned later that the star doesn\u2019t have any orbiting planets. This information would be sent back to Earth, using the 40-metre diameter second stage engine bell as a communications dish, and targets of interest would be selected. Since the spacecraft would not decelerate, upon reaching Barnard\u2019s Star, \u003Ci\u003EDaedalus\u003C/i\u003E would carry 18 autonomous sub-probes that would be launched between 7.2 and 1.8 years before the main craft entered the target system. These sub-probes would be propelled by nuclear-powered ion drives and would carry cameras, spectrometers, and other sensory equipment. The sub-probes would fly past their targets, still traveling at 12% of the speed of light, and transmit their findings back to the \u003Ci\u003EDaedalus\u003C/i\u003E\u2019 second stage, mothership, for relay back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the concept was far from perfect, it did demonstrate that we might be capable of building an interstellar spacecraft in the near future. And if not, it allows us nerds to at least dream of such a fantastic feat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[Development news start here]\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been an exciting week at the KSPHQ. \u003Cb\u003EPatch 1.4.4 was released yesterday\u003C/b\u003E, and with it, a wide array of enhancements: from performance and wheel suspension improvements as well as the in-game integration of some really cool Steam features, this patch is meant to further advance the KSP game experience. \u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/176077-kerbal-space-program-144-and-making-history-13-launching-today/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EClick here\u003C/a\u003E to read the full release notes\u003C/b\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAny successful release always comes with a broad spectrum of tasks, from last minute fixes and polishing to merging branches, preparing the release candidate, testing it and uploading the final build to all platforms. Any release always has all of the team on its toes. This one was no exception. We are very happy with the results, too. Since the very beginning we have taken feedback from the players very seriously and this patch includes several elements taken directly from community suggestions. For instance, the \u003Cb\u003Eintegration of Steam Workshop will facilitate both craft and mission sharing among Steam users\u003C/b\u003E, and let us drive visibility to some of those creations. Cloud Saves for both game saves and missions are also now implemented on Steam (Here\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=259581627\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean example\u003C/a\u003E of how you can setup your own Cloud in case you are not a Steam user).You can read more about the newly implemented Steam features \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/176018-upcoming-ksp-patch-adds-new-features-for-steam-users/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are \u003Cb\u003Ealready featuring some cool missions in in this newly born Hub\u003C/b\u003E, including a couple of missions made by some of our team. Simple, yet fun, these missions are meant to showcase how anyone can be a Mission Designer. Check them out and let us know your thoughts. We\u2019ll be adding more featured missions in time, so check the Steam Workshop Hub regularly. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cb\u003Eimprovement and expansion of the controller support for the game via the Steam Controller framework\u003C/b\u003E has also been a heavily requested feature. We\u2019ve added \u003Cb\u003Etwo different presets for you to choose from: the Advanced and Simplified Presets\u003C/b\u003E. The former is a comprehensive preset that includes all the commands and functions a veteran player would expect. The Simplified Preset is meant to be more approachable to players and be as similar as possible to the Cursor Preset from KSP Enhanced Edition. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/files/PS4_ControllerMap.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EClick here\u003C/a\u003E to see the new controller layouts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EKSP Enhanced Edition\u003C/i\u003E also has a patch on the way\u003C/b\u003E.

For instance, \u003Ci\u003EBlitWorks\u003C/i\u003E managed to include a missing element from the PC version into \u003Ci\u003EEnhanced Edition\u003C/i\u003E: The Physwarp. The Physwarp allows you to perform warps within atmospheres, but all at your own risk.
