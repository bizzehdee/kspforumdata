So I\u0027d like to simplify it for them so they don\u0027t have to open their persists up every other day (sometimes 3 or 4 times a day) just to add/remove science... especially since some of them don\u0027t know how to find and work all that stuff. So I\u0027d like a mod which opens a small window, with a button which says \u0022Addition\u0022 and when clicked, which switch to \u0022Remove\u0022. Below that button, will be a textbox so that they can enter how much they want to add/remove, and then below the textbox, will be a button which says \u0022Modify Science\u0022. \n\nIts a small mod, but it does take some minor skills... but its too much for me.

However there is not a way to do that because the game normalizes it to a 0 science value. If they have a line in the base code for the science system that prevents a negative science value for experiments, with subtractions only existing in the research center (which would make sense in order to prevent NaN errors) then it really WILL take a fancy plugin to achieve what you are looking for.\n\nI also tried making a science node in the tech tree that had a negative value, you cannot do that either as near as I could tell\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T22:19:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PringleMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:10:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Calm down friend.

Because what I was suggesting, CFG editing, is just utilizing a text editor. You can create new parts that are duplicates of existing parts with different values extremely easily, without even having knowledge of coding. Just change the value you need. It is possible that I am utilizing the wrong values in the science files with my attempts, so I would not totally hold out that it cannot be done without a plugin.\n\nedit: I dug around through the API in the classes related to science and experiments, and to be honest I don\u0027t even see a function that would allow you to directly subtract science without doing some crazy thing.

Do you have any interest in making this mod? (All it is is a simple menu, other people!)\n\nFriend, it is not a \u0022simple\u0022 matter, or I would happily make one for you. As it stands, I also am a pretty crappy programmer. My...issue(?)...is that ZooNamedGames has not shown any input into this other than saying he has to have someone else do it. He has not demonstrated that he has tried to come up with any solutions himself, be it through part editing (like I tried), science nodes, or any other gimmick. Those are all things that, if they worked, could have been done with single value changes to existing CFG files. Some copy and pasting would have created a new part and then hitting save in a text editor. That does not require substantial programming knowledge, it mostly just requires being able to read english.\n\nI can get behind not wanting to try and get everyone else to change save files. But if you look back over the thread, only one single person suggested a save file edit on page 2. And mostly they were saying that if people were able to install a mod, they should be able to edit their save. A justifiable statement.\n\nAnd ZooNamedGames, as someone who operates several servers for everything from Ark to Jedi Academy, and admins a forum, you do have time to work on this yourself. If it matters to you, take it out of some of your play time.\n\nAs it stands, friends, I am not sure that this IS something that can be done the way you want it to be done, as I said before. Looking over the API, I don\u0027t see a function in any of the classes that would really allow us to subtract science. I did not look at it too deeply, but it looks like the functions in the classes for science are there to say how much it is worth, and the experimentation I already did has shown that it will not take a negative value. There does not seem to be a hook for the science deduction from buying a node in the tree, but I could be very very wrong.\n\nWhat that all means, there is not an apparent way to even make the text box with 2 buttons like you want. It is not a matter of the interface, it is the part where you actually have it do something. As near as I can tell, the game will not take a negative science value input without accessing the persist anyways. At that point, it actually will be easier to just open the persist file.\n\nedit: I also tried seeing if science was stored on the same float value every time using Cheat Engine. The answer is no, so making a cheat table for cheat engine is out too.\n\nedit 2: I tried feeding a negative science value into the latest cheat happens trainer for Kerbal, which allows for custom science amounts. The game once again just turned it into a 0 value.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T20:15:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PringleMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T20:11:40Z","Content":"I am making a second post because it is sufficiently different.\n\nI had one last idea that I think will work well enough for what you want. IIRC, KSP Interstellar allowed you to upgrade parts in flight, consuming science in the process. The one specifically I am thinking about is the computer core which could be upgraded to an AI core, consuming 100 science. In later version of the mod, it pulled from the actual science pool rather than a resource that he had defined. I have no idea how he managed that, because like I said I don\u0027t see a hook in API for that, so his plugin may have been altering the persist directly. IDK.\n\nI think your best bet would be utilizing that. I don\u0027t know what the license was on his plugin, but you could probably strip out all of the other parts and resources leaving just the actual plugin. Then just make a copy paste of an existing stock part with whatever cfg module handles the upgrade part from KSP Interstellar. If someone else would like to look in to that, I think that is a good approach. I have given my share to this though, and I am too nervous about messing with another modder\u0027s stuff.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T20:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PringleMan**"}]}
