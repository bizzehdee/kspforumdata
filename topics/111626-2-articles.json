In the meantime, the lab is now processing its 50 points of data in the background. A few in-game weeks later, I come back to find it\u0027s turned that data into another 200 points of science, which are then transmitted back to Kerbin. So from that surface sample I\u0027ve got a total of 300 points--100 from returning the sample itself, another 200 from the science lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you process science through a lab for the challenge, you would get no \u003Cem\u003Eadditional\u003C/em\u003E points for doing so, but you could still return the \u003Cem\u003Eoriginal\u003C/em\u003E science to Kerbin for full points at end of mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is, while the lab could still benefit your career save, as the rules stand now it would basically be dead weight from the point of view of the challenge, seeing as its only other function is to reset Mystery Goo/Science Jr. experiments, and a scientist Kerbonaut can do this as well. Personally I think this is fine, the MPL is basically a source of virtually unlimited science points, so being able to use it would basically make the whole idea of Jebediah\u0027s Level pretty much pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carraux","CreatedById":60890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T13:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest then to dismiss the idea of generating science / bring science back at home (well, that\u0027s only my 2 cent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question for Jeb\u0027s Level: 5 Kerbanauts are required for this level.

A lot of that is probably because I will be abusing LV-Ns and Ion Engines for the trip to, back, and tooling around the Jool system, with chemical rockets only being fired when their thrust advantage is necessary (IE, landing). But now that I think about it, I only tested the feasibility of mining on Tylo, not on the low-grav moons, Bop and Pol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one thing I\u0027m debating - Ion Engines versus LV-Ns. My current design incorporates 16 LV-Ns and 24 Ion Engines in different stages. I\u0027m suspecting I\u0027ll need to do a lot of math for this, so my question is: Does the fuel/power consumption of LV-Ns and Ion Engines scale directly to the amount of thrust? I\u0027m considering the advantages of using a nuclear stage at all. During the exit from Kerbin, we\u0027ll be close enough to Kerbol to rely on the sun\u0027s power, and at Jool unless my math is messed up it\u0027d cost less in mass to run Ion Engines on radiotope generators and fuel cells than it\u0027d cost to run LV-Ns on LFO. Generally, smaller payloads are easier to get into orbit and more stable when attached via docking connectors. Additionally, it\u0027s easier to distribute Ion Engines across the entire payload to provide generally even thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m proud of my work in constructing a 16 LV-N stage that can fire literally indefinitely if supplied with LF, and that would be a huge asset at Jool, but Ion Engines may just be a better choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carraux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Carraux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would suggest then to dismiss the idea of generating science / bring science back at home (well, that\u0027s only my 2 cent)\u003Cp\u003EAnother question for Jeb\u0027s Level: 5 Kerbanauts are required for this level.
