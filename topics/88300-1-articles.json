I love the mechanics, and keep playing for the mechanics, but \u0022go there\u0022 doesn\u0027t seem like much to go on for an average player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, being that i have a little technical background, i thought of a mod to create, but being that i have a LITTLE technical background, i quickly decided i wasn\u0027t the one to make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod i\u0027m thinking of is quite small and simple, at least to begin with, a satellite dish to mount onto your spacecraft. that as long as it has power and a clear view to kerbin. can be sold out as a GPS satellite or alike, gradually giving you funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA future I had thought of for this mod was to have missions where companies hire you to shoot a satellite up for them that has to meet certain requirements such as the altitude it\u0027s at and the direction of the orbit around kerbin, and you could click your satellite (or control pod or whatever) and choose to finish the mission, and giving your satellite over to that company (making you lose control over it, and have to pay a fine if you \u0022accidently\u0022 crash into it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother future development idea would be to have simulated areas of kerbin that have a higher population density, giving your satellite more funds/min while it\u0027s signaling over that area. and furthermore (I realize this is not easy to do otherwise squad had already done it) model and actually put in some cities here and there, instead of just simulating high population.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T19:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88445-0-25-Fine-Print-v0-59-Resource-Harvest-Contracts-Configuration-%28October-7%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFine Print\u003C/a\u003E does it.
