I have a .... ton of mods installed, so at first I thought it was a memory issue, so I installed ATM regular. Still happened.

Are you running a 32-bit or 64-bit OS? Modded KSP pretty much needs a 64-bit OS with more than 4GB of RAM. KSP will try to take 4GB of RAM on its own (more on the 64-bit Linux version), if all you have is 4GB then you won\u0027t be able to run the OS and the game at the same time. Background programs are right out, especially massive memory hogs like web browsers."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T14:11:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, the developers at Microsoft who made .net don\u0027t know how to spell happened.\n\nHmmm, I don\u0027t often see rabid anti-Microsoft comments in this forum...\n\nWhat on earth (or Kerbin) makes you think that anyone at Microsoft had anything to do with that error message?

There is a hacky workaround that allows the 64-bit Unity Player to run KSP on Windows, but it\u0027s unstable for many people. Linux is a better alternative, since it\u0027s stable and 64-bit KSP actually works. The coming upgrade to Unity 5 in KSP 1.1 will hopefully bring a stable 64-bit client."}]}
