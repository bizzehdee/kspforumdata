It would also include a motorized rotating joint wich would be used to spin/despin the room, and move it for docking with the ring. The motion won\u0027t need to be more than a few cm. enough to clear any docking mechanism. But since this will be in a controlled environment, the need for guiding mechanisms can be kept to a bare minimum. It could also be two separate rooms in paralel, for redundancy if there is a leak in one of them. It could also contain tanks for transfering supplies on an automatic level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eactualy, there is a lot of possibilities with this sollution, even safety, redundancy and automation can be catered for, along with serviceability.
