This is mostly through the time honored way of trial and error. I\u0027ve sort of figured out how to dock and how to efficently do some orbit changes though lift off probably still has a lot more brute force then needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbals want to keep the planets orbit clean of debris so anything that goes up has to attach to the station or come back down. But since the goal is to get as much fuel up there as possible I want to minimize how much needs to be left behind in the boosters when I detach them and then turn them around to do a deorbiting burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven my engine (impulse in vaccum), dry weight and orbiting altitude what would the math be to figure how much fuel I need to add to make a deorbiting burn at the apoapsis (I assume this is something \u0022Delta V\u0022 related). My Kerbals aren\u0027t really concerned where the debris crashes since the planet seems to be nearly devoid of any settlements beyond the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-18T01:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2013 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T23:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to calculate it, but it takes VERY little thrust to deorbit something, about 2-3 seconds of retrograde burn on a Poodle engine to deorbit from a 100km orbit.

It takes \u0026gt;50m/s to bring something down to a sub-orbital trajectory. If your debris has 6-8 retro rocket sepatrons, it should be able to de-orbit itself. If you find that to not be enough, add more. I recommend getting Editor Extensions. You can then mount radially in up to 50x symemtry in 1x increments. I can get 50 sepatrons worth radially onto a 2.5m diameter part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T00:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo truly de-orbit, you need periaps on the ground since KSP won\u0027t calculate the atmosphere unless you are switched to the debris.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot strictly true; once it\u0027s below a certain altitude above Kerbin (~20km or so), the debris will be deleted automatically as long as you don\u0027t have another craft within a little over 2km of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a roughly circular orbit at 100km or so above ground level, a few backward-firing sepratrons should effectively deorbit just about any discarded stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T00:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout intervention the magic altitude to have your debris deleted by atmospheric reentry is 23km.
