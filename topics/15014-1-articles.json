That name was given to me by someone who organized a LAN-game (at school ha ha!) and I stuck with it ever since. It\\\u0027s a play on my last name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first heard of this game on YouTube from some reviewer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looked like my kind of game, so I downloaded the demo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some trouble with anti-virus giving false positives, having trouble setting up joysticks and spending days at general troubleshooting, I gave up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after hearing some stories about how people did awesome stuff in the game, I picked it up again. This time persevering and using a workaround in getting it to run properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing that, it was one adventure after the next!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time failing at something, a redesign or change of tactics got me further. It all cumulated (with some pointers) with a successful landing on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I wanted more, and so of course I bought the game. That was around version 0.14.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game is as much an education-tool as it is a game. I like how it gives my brain a good workout!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways thinking of improving a design. And the concentration needed to make a manual landing on the moon is intense!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have gotten even more admiration and understanding for the guys doing this for real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways...I love this game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways looking forward patiently for what you devs have in store for us next!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027l try to contribute if I can, but keep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T09:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what you mean about it being an educational tool and as for Mun landings, the message to the Eagle from Ground control always struck me as appropriate \u0027thanks a lot, you got a bunch of guys down here about to turn blue!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T13:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
