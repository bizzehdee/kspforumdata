I\u0027m not sure about integrating into mechjeb...I think it loses usability if it requires a special part on each vessel. Also, not sure if Haystack will be upgraded...it was very similar I hear. I honestly hadn\u0027t even heard of it when I first released, but it was definitely the inspiration behind the sort and filter features I just added. Still, if Haystack is done my code is available to anyone and I would be happy to help integrate into mechjeb if Sarbian is interested. We\u0027ll see I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhilMcgroin","CreatedById":80183,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T01:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a small request, is it possible to add some persistence to the location of the window?

It should also save the sort/filter settings and stay minimized after switching flights. Make sure you\u0027re updated to the latest version of the plugin (1.2) and KSP (0.21.1). You can see the plugin version if you minimize the window. There were issues with persistence in earlier versions but for me at least it\u0027s working, whether I switch flights using targetron or the flight center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be creating a config.xml file in the \u003Cem\u003EGameData\\Targetron\\Plugins\\PluginData\\Targetron\\\u003C/em\u003E folder located within the root KSP install folder (e.g. \u003Cem\u003EC:\\Program Files\\Kerbal Space Program\\\u003C/em\u003E). This is where the window location and everything else is saved, so make sure that file exists.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T04:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am having a problem where I can\u0027t right-click a vessel\u0027s name to select a docking port from within IVA.
