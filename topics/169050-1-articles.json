I\u0027ve figured out how to put the asteroid where I want it. I\u0027ve also been able to increase the mass. So far so good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how to scale it? I upped the mass, but the size didn\u0027t change. I\u0027m looking for the line(s) in the config that specify the actual size of the model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side note...If I scale the asteroid 10000x or whatever that is, will the colliders scale too. In other words, will the surface as depicted be close to the touchdown point for a claw?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-31T00:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like the modders will have the info you need, so your question has been moved to the modding subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
