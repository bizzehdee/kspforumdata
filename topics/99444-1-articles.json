That\u0027s why I made a handy spreadsheet to help plan out your next planetary communications network. Just enter your desired orbit height and satellite count and it will calculate whether the network will work around each body in the Kerbol system, as well as tell you what antennas (or antennae?) you need to connect it all together. Hope it helps you out! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo download the RemoteTech mod, go here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-0-90-0-RemoteTech-v1-6-3-2015-02-06\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-0-90-0-RemoteTech-v1-6-3-2015-02-06\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the spreadsheet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/agwmqnyixrdo7mc/AAC7mvok4xHrdGM_MoTuc-LQa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/agwmqnyixrdo7mc/AAC7mvok4xHrdGM_MoTuc-LQa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
