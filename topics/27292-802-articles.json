The flight was relatively short; \u003Cem\u003ESun Diver\u003C/em\u003E was passing within five kilometers of the station anyway (don\u0027t know how I pulled that one off and I don\u0027t think I could do it again), so the rendezvous took a single orbit. Docking was successful, Lubree was delivered to his craft and \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E returned successfully to Kerbinport, transferring its remaining fuel back to \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E. The evening\u0027s activities ended with Lubree\u0027s initial warmup burn. And warm up it did - the sixty tonne craft is propelled by a single NERVA engine, which after three minutes of burning had to be shut down to avoid exploding. As of this morning, \u003Cem\u003ESun Diver\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E apoapsis is a mighty 390,000 meters. I\u0027m hoping that things will get to where the engine will be able to burn for longer periods as the craft\u0027s fuel drains - otherwise the thing will never get out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, let alone get to a suborbital trajectory of Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the middle, I loaded Bob and tourists Jenedith, Jerbles and Phogy aboard \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E, also docked at Kerbinport and with a full tank of gas. With Jeb at the helm, the craft departed Kerbinport and was launched into a Kerbolar trajectory. The burn was successful, and the craft will exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI in about ten days. She\u0027s got about 60% of her fuel reserve remaining, so I should be able to get her back to Kerbin. Hopefully relatively quickly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also sent the recently refueled \u003Cem\u003ECarrier Pigeon\u003C/em\u003E craft docked at Munport 1 to Munport 2, docking specifically on the far end of the station\u0027s fuel module; rendezvous and docking were successful. The plan is to have \u003Cem\u003ECarrier Pigeon\u003C/em\u003E bring Munport 2\u0027s fuel module back to Munport 1 for refuel. I don\u0027t know yet if this plan will work or not - \u003Cem\u003EPigeon\u003C/em\u003E was designed to haul a seven tonne craft between Kerbin\u0027s moons, not a twenty tonne craft between space stations. Should work, but there\u0027s an operative there... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast thing before Lubree\u0027s run was (at long last) the arrival and successful docking of Minmusport\u0027s power module. The module\u0027s arrival brings Minmus up to a fully sustainable refueling depot, with ore refineries in orbit and on the surface capable of servicing any visiting craft. Naturally, I have no craft scheduled to head out that way any time soon. Though it does occur to me that I do have a contract to put a nine-Kerbal base on the surface...if I were to hook that up to the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E rig it would house a hell of a lot of engineers...on the other hand, I have nobody scheduled to go out there any time soon. Still. A hell of a lot of engineers...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeekend plans involve lots and lots of planes.

Just curious, makes a nice aesthetic!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerwin is right, I installed just the connectors from MKS Lite by RoverDude, shipped six of them up in a KAS container (which you can still see in the background, behind the mining rig), and used them to connect the modules. Functionally it\u0027s pretty much the same as connecting them with standard KAS pipes, except the MKS tubes look like they\u0027re actually big enough for Kerbals to transfer through. They really look better when used with other MKS parts, but I\u0027m trying to keep my current save mostly stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modules themselves were landed by a tug (which you can see in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=2282442\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2282442\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E) that attached to their upper docking ports, and returned to orbit after each landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T23:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you mean avoiding high G-force, then yes I do.\u003Cp\u003EI generally try to avoid having the crew taking more than 3.5g during ascent as it is about the same for real rockets (this launcher in particular tops at 3.49g), even if it means having to redesign my rocket to a non-optimal but \u0022safe\u0022 configuration (I also avoid throttling down cryogenic engines for realism, so that also forces me to pay attention to G-force in the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my manned launchers have max G-force during ascent of 3-3.5g, whereas I usually don\u0027t bother doing this for unmanned launchers and they often end up pulling over 5-10g in high atmosphere for quicker circularisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I am not good a non-ballistic reentries and often up having too high G-forces during reentries in RSS (over 8 is high for me); so this kind of makes avoiding high G during ascent pointless...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I like this constraint, it makes my game feel more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is indeed what I meant. I agree also about my ballistic reentries; the poor Kerbals I\u0027ve put in my Mercury capsule have pulled over 9(!) Gs on reentry, though this is in part due to having to use a solid retromotor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne further thing: the sources I\u0027ve found for man-rated G requirements say 3gs is the target, not 3.5. Do you have some other source you can point to, or are you (quite understandably) just a little looser?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
