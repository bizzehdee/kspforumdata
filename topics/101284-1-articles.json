This is Ceres per some Hubble color images taken years ago below. As you can see, the moon as a white/orange hue with a blue rim. Yet, all the images from DAWN so far has been grayscale. I wanted to ask (if anyone even knows), does DAWN even have true-color cameras equipped? Better yet - is Ceres really \u0022gray\u0022 or is it more like this spooky colored Hubble image? I want to see accurate color images, and if it hasn\u0027t taken any I can only speculate that either it isn\u0027t going to take color images (which is stupid IMO to spend millions on such a mission and not attach a color-capable camera) or Ceresa is really just a boring, gray rock and the Hubble image is in accurate for whatever reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://space-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/ceres.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ceres.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScientific cameras typically have CCDs that work over a large range of wavelengths with a filter wheel to get the various narrow pass-bands of interest.

They pretty much all have to go through NASA\u0027s Deep Space Network, which is a series of radiotelescopes around the World that are tuned to communicate with deep space probes. Of course, due to the rotation of the Earth and other alignment factors, any single antenna can only point at a specific location in the sky for a short window every day. The DSN antennas are also used for radioastronomy so they have to be shared with other science institutions. Therefore, DSN usage is determined by the allocation of time slots for each project, including Dawn, New Horizons, but also all the stuff on Mars and even Voyager and Pionneer. Each mission gets allocated time slots depending on their priority, requirements, and budget, and they have to struggle to get their data through the DSN at the moment the DSN antennas are pointed at their probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience missions are not for PR.
