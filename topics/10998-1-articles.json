I mean what do they to to make the actual textures. Not the uvmaps. I am asking how exactly do I get nice looking textures. Mine look like a bunch of pictures from cgtextures.com slapped together on a uvmap.

The images are based on vector lines, unlike Photoshop which is a raster based image editor (pixels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I create a blank canvas in Adobe Photoshop at the size of the texture that I need, 512x512 or 1024x1024, import the stuff I made from Illustrator on different layers, and tweak/adjust location and settings until I get the result I\\\u0027m looking for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above is just how my work flow is, you do not need any Adobe products to make a decent texture. GIMP or Paint.net are great image editing programs you can get for free that will work just as good. The most import thing to remember when creating textures is to always make an image much larger then what you actually need. You can always scale an image down with no loss of quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
