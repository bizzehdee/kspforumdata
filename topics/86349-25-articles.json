Most of your complaints are all about personal preferences. Some people actually like the idea of having a career mode with some purpose which includes contracts and funding. I dont know why this is an issue for you at all since those features are all voluntarily, which is how it should be. If you dont care about contract and funding then just play it without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the same thing about mods like mechjeb. I myself prefer to keep it as vanilla as possible and actually feel like mechjeb would take away from the gameplay as I like being in full control of the ships myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most of these issues like gui problems will most likely be fixed by the time it goes out of alpha and moves towards release. This game is stil alpha, which means there is alot of things that still has to be worked out. And this release they already made things a bit quicker by letting us go directly to any ship KSC without having to do it from tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are kinda acting like you know best and that everyone else is wrong when you say things like that they should drop career features that other people actually want in the game.

I see few difference between this \u0022alpha\u0022 game and many open betas I have played.

Instead of an open letter to squad why not write in an actual email (letter) to them. With suggestions as to what to do. You might actually help improve them game instead of bother all of use guys who like the game as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64 bit is unstable. It is a bummer. I agree, but thats about as far as the statement can go without becoming slander. There still is the 32 bit version which works fine. There is also the Linux version that runs much smoother on 64 bit. Still with its own problems but generally better than the windows 64. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must say I don\u0027t hold much against squad, as i bought the game basically half price a year ago. Yes the newest updates can mess things up, but I\u0027m getting them for free compared to someone that tries to buy it today. That is why I don\u0027t mind, for what breaks the game and gives me a few new things are essentially FREE to begin with. So I win in the end by getting on this alpha game machine. As does anyone who deals with all the issues of an ever changing in development game that comes out in \u0022alpha\u0022. Especially in this case where if you bought the first few version for like $20 you get 10$ of content over time FOR NO COST on top of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes the game is worth it, because what your complaining about is free stuff you got without paying. Now if you had to pay more to get the newest updates and they were messed up, yes you get a right to complain. But otherwise consider your purchase of the game an investment in the future, along with the perk of playing the game as it sits NOW.
