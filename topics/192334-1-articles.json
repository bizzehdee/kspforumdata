Its telling me that the minimum safe orbit altitude is 188,400m, low space altitude 112,000 and atmosphere 40,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this sound correct? With kerbin I believe min safe orbit altitude was about 80,000m? And as I understand it SSRSS just scales everything down to stock size. So if possible I need to know which cfg file holds the relative information for setting these altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-12T11:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203262-si2504/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022203262\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203262-si2504/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@si2504\u003C/a\u003E, your question has been moved to add-on discussions because it will be more visible to the modding community.
