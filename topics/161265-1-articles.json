Trying to transfer fuel from one ship to another and time slows down and B stops opening menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve started to build larger vessels and I\u0027m starting to get it more.

I seems to happen after playing for a while/ transferring fuel/switching vessels. Its a pain if your doing a test flight but a quick restart seems to get it working again for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrTetra","CreatedById":175601,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T08:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea usually dashboarding it works well but I built a mining rig and its pretty big. Even after a full system reboot i can only open one menu when transferring fuel and when I try to open the next, B fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it just means I cannot build that big.
