The best speed you can get out of an engine is not usually at it\u0027s max thrust, it\u0027s something a little after when thrust has decreased and drag increased to be equal. At max thrust, your aircraft would still be accelerating, so drag would gradually increase. By the time they\u0027re balanced, you\u0027re exceeding the max-thrust velocity of the engine, so its thrust has reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that makes some sort of sense... doesn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T21:32:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut I believe when air-breathing/jet engines are over-speeding the thrust drops off to a flame-out. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was never aware of over-speeding and do not think it was the reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat vessel test was from a higher altitude and diving down until I reached that maximum of mach 1.8 with an engine thrust of 119 kN.
