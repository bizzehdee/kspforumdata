Probably not. When I build my first working, mostly cool looking rover, I was so proud of myself. An option for free placement of girders, structural panels and the like would open up a world of creativity unseen in most games. Mods get us close, but just a simple on/off button next to the angle snap button would be so much better.

I\u0027m talking full on put anything anywhere free placement. Like I said, probably not the best idea for the game. IDK, having grown up with LEGOs that weren\u0027t premolded for Hollywood and CONSTRUX made us all feel like spacemen, I likely just need about a million more parts in the construction section. And before it comes up, if I had the brain matter to make my own mod, I would have already. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T10:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you want. Are you asking for part placement in midair?

WASDQE will rotate objects 90 degrees and holding shift while doing it allows you to rotate parts in 5 degree increments. Editor extensions, mentioned by Vaporo, allows even more options and freedom (I think including radial attachment of normally stack-only parts).
