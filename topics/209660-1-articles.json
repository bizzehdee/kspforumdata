You seem to have inadvertently tapped into another one of my major geekouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so, I\u0027m going to run down your list there and just comment on games I\u0027ve actually played, as opposed to things I\u0027ve heard second hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGloomhaven: Everyone raves about Gloomhaven. It\u0027s literally the #1 rated game on Boardgame Geek. I bought the digital edition to see what all the hype was about. Honestly, I wasn\u0027t thrilled. It felt like an RPG with a ton of mechanics implemented to limit what you\u0027re allowed to do. And, it\u0027s a legacy game, so the whole point is that the game changes permanently as you play through it. So I wouldn\u0027t recommend playing a copy that\u00A0 is sitting in a game library. If you really do want to give it a whirl and get the full experience, you can either shell out $150 for a physical copy on Amazon, or buy the digital edition when it goes on sale on Steam, I think I paid $10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScythe: Also another highly hyped game that I bought the digital edition for. It\u0027s fun, it\u0027s like a resource/process building game that also involves some player conflict. I liked it enough that I\u0027ve debated buying the physical edition for the family.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7 Wonders: No joke, one of the best games ever made. We have had the base game and several of the expansions for years, and they still get played on a regular basis. One of our all time favorites. One of the few on the list I would say you shouldn\u0027t bother playing the loaner, just buy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgricola: Legendary worker placement/resource allocation game. We have the first edition of Agricola, which from what I understand is much more dense and complicated than the second edition. We still enjoy it, but it is not everyone\u0027s cup of tea. Even we don\u0027t play with every option, and a typical game still takes three or four hours. If the one on their shelf is the new edition, I would say give it a try. You will either love it or hate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLe Havre: It\u0027s a fun worker placement/resource game, sort of like Agricola, but a bit simpler. Definitely worth playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPower Grid: I want to say this was the second game we bought when we started getting into German board games, what, fifteen years ago? It still gets pulled out and played every couple of months. Absolute classic. Buy it with confidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1960: Making of a President: Another very highly rated game that I went straight out and bought when we started getting into games. And, man, I really wanted to love this game. I loved the concept, the execution seemed great. We played it three or four times, gave it every chance. It just never worked for us. One of the games we wound up selling for quite a bit of money on EBay, since it\u0027s very popular and out of print. Give it a try, YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwilight Struggle: Another one like 1960. Seemed like it would be right up my alley, but when I actually started to get into it I realized that it was just too crunchy, too much detail. too many little fiddly rules to keep track of. It makes Agricola look simple and unsophisticated. Some folks love games like that, but they don\u0027t really get any traction in our house.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPuerto Rico: This was literally the first German-style board game we bought. At the time we started we were buying our games from a little game shop near our house, and when the owner found out we were just starting out he said, \u0022Start with Puerto Rico.\u0022 He was not wrong. Fun worker placement game, just complex enough to be interesting, but not complex enough to be a turn-off. Now that I see it on the list I\u0027m asking myself, \u0022Why don\u0027t we play Puerto Rico more?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDominion: I am not a fan of Dominion, I just don\u0027t like deck-building games. But I am the only person in my household who isn\u0027t. We have, like four expansions for it and it gets played constantly, maybe more than any other game we own, actually. So, in complete truth-in-advertising, you should give it a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGalaxy Trucker: This is just a stupid fun game. Go into it expecting to lose by complete random chance, with a willingness to laugh at your own misfortune, and you will enjoy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCatan: Catan is one of the most popular board games on the planet. It is universally reviled in our house. We bought it early on, played it a couple of times, trying to figure out why it was so popular, and never figured it out. It\u0027s a dice-rolling contest. There is a tiny bit of strategy involved, but once you figure that out it\u0027s all luck. If the dice come up well for you, you win. If they don\u0027t you lose. But unlike, say, Galaxy Trucker, the game doesn\u0027t do a good job of keeping you busy while it is killing you by random chance. If things are going poorly for you, you roll the dice, do nothing, and your turn is over. Terrible game, another one we wound up selling on EBay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChicago Express: Looked like a great game. Fun to play once. When we went to play it again, we realized that there was one-and-only-one winning strategy. Poor game design. Sold on EBay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTokaido: Played this once. One of my friends from California brought it when he was visiting, and it was so much fun. I really should pick up a copy. Maybe for my wife\u0027s birthday. \u0026lt;makes note\u0026gt; Just such a unique game premise and execution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetrayal at the House on the Hill: A great game, very unique mechanic that I\u0027ve never really seen anyone else try, except maybe Shadows over Camelot. Cooperative game where, somewhere in the middle of the game, the mechanic flips and one of the players randomly becomes the enemy that all of the other players have to defeat. You really do need a lot of people who are into the concept for it to be fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall World: My wife hates this game. She hates games that involve direct conflict, she just wants to ruin everyone else economically, like in Agricola or Power Grid. Small World is a war game, pure and simple. It has some twists to it, but the goal is to eliminate your opponents as quickly and efficiently as possible. I love it, but the rest of my family is meh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamel Up: Another simple, fun game. This one is dice-rolling, but it is more of a gambling/statistics mechanic. We bought it to be a simple game to play with our in-laws, and they hated it because our kids would run circles around them. They just sit there and crunch the numbers in their heads like little computers. It\u0027s amusing to watch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColt Express: Really fun game, lots of 3D elements. I think the only reason we don\u0027t play it more is that the train parts make it a pain to set up and put away. But the actual game play is really fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKingdom Builder: We bought this to play with the kids when they were little-littles. Not a bad game, but it has really simple mechanics and strategy. Haven\u0027t played it in years now, probably should sell it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTicket to Ride: Another perennial favorite. Gets played regularly in our house. Simple, elegant. The base game has some strategy flaws, but most of the expansions are better balanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCosmic Encounter: I love Cosmic Encounter. Everyone else in my family hates it. To be fair, I don\u0027t know what edition they have on the shelf there. I own the Mayfair edition, which went out of print decades ago. I hear the newer editions are inferior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSan Juan: Two-player card game version of Puerto Rico. Really fun, totally worth playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZooloretto: Another one we bought for the kids when they were little. Really fun and simple for youngsters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nViticulture: What a great game. Worker placement game with lots of twists and options. We have the Essentials expansion, never played without it, so I can\u0027t speak for the base game. But the version we have is really good. Highly recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcquire: Classic game. Used to play the Avalon Hill version in high school all the time. I assume that the newer edition is unchanged. One of those simple, but deep strategy games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSplendor: Another family favorite, although it is a bit hobbled around our house since it only handles four players. Still sees a lot of play when one of us is unavailable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPit: TWO! TWO! TWO! TWO! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Great game for punchy teenagers at 3:00 in the morning. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ECarcassone: Fun little game.

Really hard to find a copy these days. It\u0027s kind of like Galaxy Trucker, where the cards will hose you but you will be laughing so hard you won\u0027t care.

But I don\u0027t. My kids play it all the time, but I just never got into it. It\u0027s a very simple, random game.

It is universally reviled in our house. We bought it early on, played it a couple of times, trying to figure out why it was so popular, and never figured it out. It\u0027s a dice-rolling contest. There is a tiny bit of strategy involved, but once you figure that out it\u0027s all luck. If the dice come up well for you, you win. If they don\u0027t you lose. But unlike, say, Galaxy Trucker, the game doesn\u0027t do a good job of keeping you busy while it is killing you by random chance. If things are going poorly for you, you roll the dice, do nothing, and your turn is over.
