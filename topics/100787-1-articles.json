The game and all is ok, other saves or new starts are all fully functional, even when i rollback a couple saves on the (now) damaged save, the TAC button is there. Any idea how to fix it ? like ... where to edit what, since it pretty much boils down that the bug is tied to that specific save, so i assume the solution might be found in the save file itself ... but i have no idea what to look for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
