I\u0027m probably the weirdest 25 year old you\u0027ll meet - but watching classics like Boris Karloff\u0027s \u0022The Mummy\u0022 (1932) and comparing it to its sequel (or any other modern hollywood monster movie) almost makes you sick in the stomach. They had such a grasp over pacing, restraint, careful consideration to color, tone and contrast to express mood, and built anticipation with longer shots and very sparing cuts. It\u0027s an art that has fallen to flashy visuals, hard cuts every 10 seconds to maintain audience interest, and cheap thrills with explosions and OTT character designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI trained to work in the film industry (mainly Weta Workshop), but going through tertiary study i became more and more jaded when i realised how little VFX artists and technicians were paid for their talent, and how little respect they were given (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_%26_Hues_Studios\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELife of Pi\u003C/a\u003E).

Even though i am still young (ish) - I can\u0027t work 18 hour days anymore for below minimum wage, on contracts that expire in 4 months with no guarantee for work afterwards. The modern film industry, for all their flashy fast-paced action and glitzy hyped up marketing - chews up and spits out its workforce because they\u0027re cheap and expendable. \u0022Proper\u0022 film is nothing but moneymaking, riding off a common plot structure that does little to promote directors thinking and working creatively anymore. To do so is a risk that the studios can\u0027t afford to take. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2001 is a film that explores so much, so modestly (a $10 million budget!), and is really a testament to the science fiction genre you rarely see anymore. Kubric thought about realism first and flashy effects second (engines firing, no audio in vacuum, etc), consulted leading scientists of the day (yay Carl Sagan and \u0027realistic\u0027 depictions of advanced extraterrestrial life), explored so many important issues of the time (the Cold War and weaponization of space), and used soundtracks that were restrained and alluded to themes of ballet (spaceships spinning in space while docking).

Kubrick created art, and you can like it or not, muster the nerve to try and understand it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I dislike movies spelling everything out for the audience, I like to be taken serious as a viewer and not treated like a child (depending on the main target audience of course), I love to be surprised (as with the end of Odd Thomas where the realisation swam up my tear ducts or Sixth Sense that baffled me for the span of three hours after watching it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut: He could have been a bit more clear with some of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2010 is basically a movie explaining what happened in 2001 mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Icarus_Vice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Icarus_Vice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgain, had the third act been the main premise of the film, with it\u0027s chilling depiction of an AI, some excellent (if not slightly wooden) characters, and a sense of both paranoia and isolation, this film would\u0027ve been so much better.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember reading somewhere that Kubrick did this intentionally to contrast the cold behaviour of the humans to the confused emotional reactions of HAL. The AI has as much of a dilemma inflicted on it by the humans as they are affected by its reactions to this dilemma. The movie might even be seen not as a story of humans having trouble with a computer, but a computer struggling to fulfill its orders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Icarus_Vice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Icarus_Vice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for the cliches, this is the only place I can defend Kubrick.
