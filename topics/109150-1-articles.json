I can easily see your rocket is top heavy and you have no controll but those mainsails. You didn\u0027t tell when you start your gravity turn. I generally start my gravity turn at 20k and keep my velocity fairly low untill that point comes. If you are trying to turn while those 2 boosters are attached its probably causing uneven drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T05:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do people complain about a rocket being top heavy?
