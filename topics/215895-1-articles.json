I\u0027ve experimented with modding KSP before with some moderate success just before the final update, and since then haven\u0027t gone back to it because so many of the mods were outdated or incompatible with one another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d like to know is if there is a stickied post available that I can\u0027t find, or some sort of a guide like a \u0022One Stop Shop\u0022 for mods.

My recommendations would be \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Avoid any mod that isn\u0027t somewhat actively maintained\u003C/span\u003E and explicitly updated for the latest major KSP version (1.12.x), and stick to the widely used \u0022quality\u0022 mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Don\u0027t go overboard with how many mods you try to combine, especially the big mods, and don\u0027t try to combine mods that have some overlapping in functionality / purpose\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Some \u0022big mods\u0022 are doing things in a way that tend to cut them from the general ecosystem. Examples of such mods are Kerbalism or KSPIE. Those are two mods that work relatively well \u0022alone\u0022, but have tons of compatibility issues with many other mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I share the feeling that the KSP 1 modding scene has somewhat failed to deliver a polished experience, at least on the \u0022going beyond the stock gameplay\u0022 side.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m still profoundly dissatisfied with the modded career mode experience. There are good ideas here and there, but nobody managed to consolidate them in a polished and well integrated way. The best effort is again RP1, but its focus on realism isn\u0027t for everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, if you want some personal recommendations \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- For the planet pack, either \u003C/span\u003EJNSQ (a re-imagination and expansion of the stock system) or KSRSS (1/4 sized real solar system). Both provide great and somewhat up-to-date visuals and the 2.5x scale is a perfect balance for stock-sized parts to get that feeling of \u0022real rockets\u0022 instead of \u0022toy rockets\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- For additional parts, restock/restock\u002B and the near future suite (and various other part mods by Nertea). This provide everything you can possible need with minimal overlap, and with great integration, as well as some relatively polished gameplay mechanisms. The only\u00A0 thing that is somewhat missing is surface base parts, which can well covered by Planetside Exploration Technologies\u003Cbr\u003E\n- For progression mods, I would always recommend Strategia and the most well known Contract Configurator packs, which while not a game-changer, at least turn the mess that are the stock strategy and contract system in something vaguely coherent. I\u0027m not a fan of the various tech tree mods beyond CTT, I think the whole \u0022get science points to unlock parts\u0022 gameplay loop is boring and broken anyway, and alternate tech trees invariably come with tons of compatibility and balance issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- For life support, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and offworld base building mods, that\u0027s where things start to become real messy. There is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS/MKS option, which is somewhat complete and relatively well integrated with the various part mods, but I personally find the thing shallow, cumbersome and frustrating to play with as well as somehwat buggy. Kerbalism has great life support and science progression mechanisms, but its resource and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E systems are incomplete, it\u0027s reliability system is annoying, its radiation system is quite limiting and it is a bit buggy and has major incompatibilities with other mods. TAC-LS is cumbersome and buggy. For LS, Snacks is... somewhat decent if you want something simple. Offworld rocket building can be covered by EPL, which is... lets say functional.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- There are some mods attempting to implement whole new gameplay mechanisms like KCT, ScrapYard or Bureaucracy. I personally find them poorly thought and poorly implemented, and they come with their own caveats in terms of bugs and incompatibilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I\u0027m personally staying away from anything \u0022interstellar\u0022. That doesn\u0027t add much in terms of gameplay and the large distances are causing various bugs. In terms of parts and \u0022technologies\u0022 to get there, KSPIE is a hot and buggy mess, and FFT are just overpowered engines that don\u0027t really create much additional gameplay considerations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wowa Ilyich","CreatedById":204269,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-01T09:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Gotmachine for your insights. I stopped playing KSP1 because there is now way in hell I could enjoy a non-Kerbalism experience. Yet, as you mention, Kerbalism is not complete and as a player unfamiliar with modding, trying to figure out the various incompatibilities became a major frustration for me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, Kerbalism is what the stock game should deliver: What is the point in a space simulator that doesn\u0027t factor in life support? The science system and the automation functionality is GREAT. I really hope that KSP2 will integrate the Kerbalism experience in the future or that the modding community will be able to make a KSP2 Kerbalism truly great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-01T10:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy gut says the only way to get a very stable KSP1 mod ecosystem would be the unlikely addition of a very mod friendly API via community fixes or other and the recoding of major mods to this API.\u00A0 The API would provide a unified smart window manager, a unified keyboard and mouse input manager, a unified scheduling of mod code execution based on priority (alongside mod devs not flagging all their mod\u0027s code stretches as being the most important thing all the time... yeah right, lol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see a lot of probability of the above happening.\u00A0 \u00A0But maybe?\u00A0 Maybe someday when KSP2 is glorious and KSP3 is in EA and T2 in celebration decides to release dinosaur KSP1 code as open source (as long as I\u0027m dreaming...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-01T10:40:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2023 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gotmachine","CreatedById":163039,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-01T11:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP \u0022API\u0022\u00A0 or codebase isn\u0027t really the problem.
