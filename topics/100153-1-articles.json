It verifies an install against Squad\u0027s servers and applies any patches. Staying up to date and in control manually is better though.\n\nAnd welcome to the forums, even though this isn\u0027t your first post (questions should really go in [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials), rather than here, which is just for \u0027hello\u0027 threads)."},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T23:08:01Z","Content":"Okay thank you"}]}
