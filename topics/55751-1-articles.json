I have wished for some time that this was both easier and more consistent, and that you could do it with every other marker with hover numbers including intersect markers and ascending/decending node markers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T22:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purestevil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022purestevil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould the UI be updated in such a way that some of the important data could be displayed on the screen continuously when setting a maneuver node?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather appreciate if some data the game decides to throw at me when I\u0027m setting up my maneuver were not displayed at all.
