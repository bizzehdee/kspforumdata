The first two parts I am working are a welder and grabber for a rover so that it can use KIS/KAS to lay piping and such. The main idea for pack is to allow you to send a robot farm/mining rig ahead of your actual kerbals. The way I plan to balance it is to make it require alot more power and other resources and lower production then what a kerbal can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first two parts I am working on would be required for any of the future ideas to work.
