I made a Kethane scanner/ISA Mapper satellite. If I try and launch it the game either crashes, or the launch scene never loads. Removing the MAPSAT dish fixes the issue. I\u0027m not seeing any unusual RAM usage. I have yet to test with no other mods installed, but that\u0027s irrelevant because I\u0027m never going to be using just MAPSAT. I\u0027m going to run a few more tests, but right now it seems like the problem is MAPSAT-specific.
