They also can be usefull as an emergicency recover station to handle miss designed ships (I dit once or twice). A mobile lab is usually a good ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit is also significant if you want to explore a body, a refuel \u002B science station / mothership is more efficient on a polar orbit (I did that on Eeloo, that was very easy). On the other hand, a purely refuelling station around kerbin should be much better on equatorial plane (cheaper rendez-vous and good inclination for simple interplanetary trips).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Szkeptik","CreatedById":40456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just pretend the early satellites are TV sats or something and are owned by the corporation that contracted me to put them there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must say I deorbit them after fulfilling the contract \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like having useless elipses on my map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaerwek","CreatedById":143220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought it\u0027s a bad way to transmit science instead of returning it.

But to bring it back you must have a return vehicle. Probes are rarely return vehicles. Further more. When you get science, you want to have a scientist to remove science from equipement to redo science again. If you keep your data and you can\u0027t remove it, you can only do it once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you want to dock you probe on station, you need RCS equipement, which is usually not on probes (but nothing is impossible in KSP). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to collect science efficiently you have to send Kerbals.
