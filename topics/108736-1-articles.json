I.e. I don\u0027t like the idea of just putting them up there and forgetting about them. Like, research stations or something.\n\nCurrently my idea is to harvest research by flying up rockets, and returning them to Kerbin.\n\nBut then there\u0027s those \u0027put up a satellite missions\u0027... Ok, I get them up there, but what then?\n\nMods that work with 1.0.2 can also be suggested. I\u0027m not sure which actually add value here and are supported in 1.0.2."},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:21:45Z","Content":"Put a thermometer on it.

You hardly need this around kerbin but around Mun, Minmus and other bodies this can soon be an benefit."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:06:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Put a thermometer on it.

If you can, after the contract put the sat in a high elliptical orbit that skims both high and low orbit, or just plain low orbit, and if you get a contract to get science data you can switch to the thing for free money."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:20:07Z","Content":"A docking node and few spare tanks for RCS/Fuel.

Admittedly this becomes way more important with things like Life Support mods, and later game can be overshadowed somewhat by mining.\n\nThe docking node is really end-game. In early-mid game, you ahev to do it yourself with radial attachement node \u002B docking port. Those \u0022structural fuselage\u0022 are light weight and quite nice on a space station.\n\nAs for the OP question, It\u0027s quite strange to associate space stations and satelites. Those are totally different structures with different purpose ?\n\nOn satellite, stuff all the science you can, antenna and power production ? Transmit everything you can. Except for \u0022gravity\u0022 science you get from each biome in low and high space, they are usually not worthwile, except for contracts.\n\nSpace stations are very usefull for refuelling around other bodies (I still have a lot of doubts for Kerbin). They also can be usefull as an emergicency recover station to handle miss designed ships (I dit once or twice). A mobile lab is usually a good ideal.\n\nOrbit is also significant if you want to explore a body, a refuel \u002B science station / mothership is more efficient on a polar orbit (I did that on Eeloo, that was very easy). On the other hand, a purely refuelling station around kerbin should be much better on equatorial plane (cheaper rendez-vous and good inclination for simple interplanetary trips)."},{"CreatedByName":"Szkeptik","CreatedById":40456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:38:18Z","Content":"I just pretend the early satellites are TV sats or something and are owned by the corporation that contracted me to put them there."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:57:42Z","Content":"I must say I deorbit them after fulfilling the contract ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t like having useless elipses on my map."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaerwek","CreatedById":143220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:29:54Z","Content":"I thought it\u0027s a bad way to transmit science instead of returning it.

But to bring it back you must have a return vehicle. Probes are rarely return vehicles. Further more. When you get science, you want to have a scientist to remove science from equipement to redo science again. If you keep your data and you can\u0027t remove it, you can only do it once. \n\nAnd if you want to dock you probe on station, you need RCS equipement, which is usually not on probes (but nothing is impossible in KSP). \n\nIf you want to collect science efficiently you have to send Kerbals. Further more, I suggest you send some kind of refueling mothership/station. Create a very light lander and do some multiple landing and refueling.\n\nI did that on minmus and landed on each of 9 biomes. I got 4 pilots or scientists planting flags. Refueled 3 times. Without gravity and sesmic detector, I did 4500 science on one mission.\n\nIn beta 0.9, I did such a mission on Jool and brought back 41000 science points. (that was a really BIG mission)"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T16:00:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I must say I deorbit them after fulfilling the contract ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E I don\u0027t like having useless elipses on my map.\n\nI recently discovered that you can destroy ships and debris through the tacking station.
