PVGIS projects output for a panel of that size (about 0.25m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E) in the US right up by the border with Canada lying flat on the ground would generate about 30kWh per year (assuming only 10% efficiency and a whopping 25% system losses). 30kWh is 108MJ, if we assume that they get a hard life and only last 10 years then that\u0027s about 1GJ lifetime production. That\u0027s about equivalent to the embodied energy of 0.25m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of polysilicon (the silicon being by far the most energy dense part of the system). So to even reach break-even point you have to assume a very short life and very low efficiency in the worst possible location.

The cost of PV panels has dropped to the point that over their lifetime they\u0027re now around grid parity. In other words, the cost of buying the system is the same as buying the amount of electricity from the grid that would be produced over the panels\u0027 lifetime. Raw efficiency of PV cells may be relatively low, but that\u0027s immaterial when the \u0022fuel\u0022 is free. Operating and maintenance costs are low or zero, so the equation is dominated purely by capital cost. That up-front cost is still dropping.
