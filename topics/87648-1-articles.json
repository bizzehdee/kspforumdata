Most notably are Kerbal Construction Time, combined with Remote Tech, TAC Life Support, Scan SAT, Deadly Reentry and of course, FAR. All of these combined for a more immerssive and realistic challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELately I\u0027ve been very busy with overall updating related to the version, grabbing new mods, makings some adjustments etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you check it out and like. Oh by the way, this is also my first post on this forum, so its more like introductory thread.
