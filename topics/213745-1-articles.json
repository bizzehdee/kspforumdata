In fact... none of the debris I deleted actually appeared in the debris list in the tracking center. So now I\u0027m wondering what that list is showing me... Like, all the parts I deleted were named things like \u0022untitled ship 21\u0022 etc. But all the names in the list were like \u00221342kj-12k31o2-lk13o1-1k23o1i\u0022 (I\u0027m making that up but that was the format.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHum... actually they all went away after I saved, quit, and reloaded. So... maybe the tracking center was showing the right parts but listing the entity ID\u0027s or something rather than their names?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T03:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan confirm.
