The save vehicle menu closes. When I then later attempt to load the vehicle, all I can see in the load menu are the default pre-made vehicles. None of my saves are there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, if I quit to the main menu and reload my campaign, sometimes I vehicles will be in the load vehicle menu, but only for a brief period before they vanish again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
