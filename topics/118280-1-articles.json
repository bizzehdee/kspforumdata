I figured it might be a problem with AVP, but I did a fresh install \n\nand the problem is still there.\n\nThe thing is I have OPM installed, and this pretty much means my save isn\u0027t compatible with a completely fresh install. I couldn\u0027t reproduce the\n\nissue in a stock game. I did a fresh install with only OPM installed and the texture shaking was still there. There\u0027s a chance it could be an issue with Kopernicus or OPM, but\n\nthe problem happens on stock planets, especially on Minmus and Duna. \n\nI am running KSP with a GTX 970 video card. It seems that disabling shaders helps the problem somewhat, but not entirely. The thing is I have played\n\nKSP with OPM and AVP Int2 installed before and never had this issue. \n\nDoes anybody know what could cause the surface textures to go nuts? It seems that not many people have had this problem before. If anybody could\n\ncome up with a workaround that would be great.\n\nEdit:\n\nOkay so did a complete stock reinstall and the issue still persists. I launched a stock rover to Duna in a completely new stock save. The textures still\n\nkeep shaking and jittering. It seems like a Floating Point Precision issue. Has anybody seen something like this before? I\u0027ll try the save on a completely\n\ndifferent computer. If that also does not work, then I\u0027ll report this as a stock bug.\n\nEdit2:\n\nI installed KSP on an office computer just to try it out and the texture shaking was still there. Also stock install and also tested it \n\non Duna. It seems the only things that the two computers have in common is that they are both using Windows 10 and nVidia graphics cards.\n\nSo the shaking is there with a GT420 and a GTX970. Maybe it has something to do with Win 10 drivers. \n\nI also installed KSP on my laptop, and there was no texture shaking (although due to the laptop\u0027s poor specs the performance was horrible),\n\nthis leads me to believe that it is an issue with nVidia. Still can\u0027t believe that others are not seeing this behaviour.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T09:44:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Joonatanr**"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:34:40Z","Content":"\u0022So the shaking is there with a GT420 and a GTX970.
