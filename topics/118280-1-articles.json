I figured it might be a problem with AVP, but I did a fresh install \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the problem is still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is I have OPM installed, and this pretty much means my save isn\u0027t compatible with a completely fresh install. I couldn\u0027t reproduce the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eissue in a stock game. I did a fresh install with only OPM installed and the texture shaking was still there. There\u0027s a chance it could be an issue with Kopernicus or OPM, but\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem happens on stock planets, especially on Minmus and Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running KSP with a GTX 970 video card. It seems that disabling shaders helps the problem somewhat, but not entirely. The thing is I have played\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP with OPM and AVP Int2 installed before and never had this issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know what could cause the surface textures to go nuts? It seems that not many people have had this problem before. If anybody could\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecome up with a workaround that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay so did a complete stock reinstall and the issue still persists. I launched a stock rover to Duna in a completely new stock save. The textures still\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekeep shaking and jittering. It seems like a Floating Point Precision issue. Has anybody seen something like this before? I\u0027ll try the save on a completely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edifferent computer. If that also does not work, then I\u0027ll report this as a stock bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed KSP on an office computer just to try it out and the texture shaking was still there. Also stock install and also tested it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon Duna. It seems the only things that the two computers have in common is that they are both using Windows 10 and nVidia graphics cards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the shaking is there with a GT420 and a GTX970. Maybe it has something to do with Win 10 drivers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also installed KSP on my laptop, and there was no texture shaking (although due to the laptop\u0027s poor specs the performance was horrible),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis leads me to believe that it is an issue with nVidia. Still can\u0027t believe that others are not seeing this behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T09:44:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Joonatanr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022So the shaking is there with a GT420 and a GTX970.
