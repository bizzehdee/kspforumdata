Normally when you tweak the fuel load in a rocket you can only change in increments of 10% at a time. Even though you may be able to manipulate the green slider bar pixel-by-pixel, the numeric amounts in the tanks only changes in increments of 1/10 the capacity of the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust the other day I noticed that my install no longer does this. I can move the tweakable slider in any increment of one pixel and the fuel amount in the tank is reported in sub 1/10 increments (basically as fine as each pixel I move the green bar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you may think this additional granularity is a good thing but really it is not. First off, it makes it nearly impossible to maintain the right ratio of LF to Ox so that the tank does not have any surplus left behind. Secondly, I noticed when \u0022tweaking\u0022 tanks or boosters with symmetry, the symmetric counterparts do not always get the same amount of fuel, it is off by a tiny amount. This means booster stages become unbalanced and throw off the balance of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still on 23.5, and did not install any new mods when this behavior started. All I did was copy an existing part.cfg file and changed the name and some details to make a new variant on a part. Did I fat-finger some hidden key combo to toggle this behavior? How can I get the old 10% increment functionality back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERuahrc\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T07:39:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruahrc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T05:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you have a mod using KSPAPIExtensions installed. A side effect of the way it improves tweakables for other mods is that it changes the default step increment to 0.01. You can report it in that thread, but be patient because the creator, Swamp_ig, is currently too busy to maintain it, so two other modders are maintaining it in addition to their own mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unbalanced tweaks are not something I\u0027ve encountered, though. Can you replicate that with just one mod installed? If so, you should post it in the Add-on subforum, where issues with modded installs are discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Generally, outdated versions of KSP are not supported by modders.
