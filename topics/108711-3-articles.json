I can think of two possible issues that might be causing this.\n\n#1 - Your CKAN metadata is out of date. Make sure you\u0027re running the latest version of CKAN, then click the \u0022Refresh\u0022 button in the toolbar to update it.\n\n#2 - You\u0027re running an old version of KSP. TakeCommand 1.1.3 was the last version compiled for KSP 1.0.2. More recent versions were compiled against KSP 1.0.4. So if you were still on KSP 1.0.2 for some reason, then CKAN would try to install 1.1.3 instead of grabbing the most recent version (1.2). However 1.1.3 is no longer available for download through KerbalStuff because I don\u0027t want new users grabbing old, buggy versions. If you\u0027re unable/don\u0027t wish to upgrade to KSP 1.0.4 then you can try installing TakeCommand manually. I haven\u0027t tried 1.2 with 1.0.2 myself, but I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t work."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T15:51:27Z","Content":"This has to be stock ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatGuyWithALongUsername","CreatedById":140817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T02:05:15Z","Content":"I made a better core config that makes this mod compatible with other mods that have command chairs.\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[KerbalSeat]]{\tCrewCapacity = 1\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = TakeCommand\t\tminimumCrew = 1\t}\tINTERNAL\t{\t\t  name = GenericSpace1\t}}"},{"CreatedByName":"Godit","CreatedById":100211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T00:12:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E #2 - You\u0027re running an old version of KSP.\n\nSo thanks for your advice, otherwise I may never have noticed Steam failed to up date me to 1.04.
