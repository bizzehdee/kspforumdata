It\u0027ll change if I accelerate though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) After reverting to launch, only the command capsule is shown, at the height you\u0027d expect if the rocket were still there. This is not captured in the video, but it is also repeatable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods / Add-Ons:\u003C/strong\u003E None\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteps to Replicate:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file is included.

Accelerate, turn, don\u0027t touch anything, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) At roughly 12k meters, the rocket spontaneously explodes. Parts may be seen falling far below, there may or may not be an endless series of explosions on top of each other, etc, lots of buggy things happen at once. Aside from the rocket exploding, other buggy behaviors vary by run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFixes/Workarounds:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther craft don\u0027t have this problem, though IIRC some minor variations of this one did. It\u0027s possible I\u0027m remembering incorrectly, but: in one case I removed the \u0022Thud\u0022 engines. At 12k (following the above steps) it instantly bent at about 15 degrees in the middle, and started spiraling. Camera wasn\u0027t reliably centered, there was an \u0022infinite explosion\u0022 happening in one corner of the screen, etc it bugged out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFiles:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cl.ly/0r2r0j0o2Y0s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cl.ly/0r2r0j0o2Y0s\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA video showing the full sequence: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cl.ly/253C2V083o1c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cl.ly/253C2V083o1c\u003C/a\u003E (video is much larger than the page\u0027s player)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe log file, same contents as caught in the video: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cl.ly/2o1L3r0K1Y1i\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cl.ly/2o1L3r0K1Y1i\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy saves folder: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cl.ly/220J060G0v1y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cl.ly/220J060G0v1y\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is 100% repeatable on my device, so I\u0027m happy to collect any other information you may need.
