I downloaded at the end of the store purchase sequence.)\n\n**What Happens:**\n\nA few things, all on a specific (reasonably stable) rocket design, with no time warp:\n\n1) Explodes at 12k feet (100% repeatable, regardless of what I do)\n\n2) Shortly prior to 1, while not accelerating, speed tends to become constant. It\u0027ll change if I accelerate though.\n\n3) After reverting to launch, only the command capsule is shown, at the height you\u0027d expect if the rocket were still there. This is not captured in the video, but it is also repeatable.\n\n**Mods / Add-Ons:** None\n\n**Steps to Replicate:**\n\nCraft file is included. I have not tested it on a separate save file, so I\u0027ve included my whole saves folder in a separate zip.\n\nThe video should make things reasonably clear, and includes a real-time view of the log file, but for those not watching it:\n\n1) Launch the \u0022Big Lifter\u0022 craft\n\n2) I turn on RCS and stability assist, don\u0027t know if this is related or not\n\n3) Wait for things to settle down a bit and start the first stage\n\n4) Start the second stage when the first pair of boosters runs out\n\n5) Start the third stage when the remaining three boosters run out\n\n6) Do almost anything, if you feel like it. Accelerate, turn, don\u0027t touch anything, etc.\n\n7) At roughly 12k meters, the rocket spontaneously explodes. Parts may be seen falling far below, there may or may not be an endless series of explosions on top of each other, etc, lots of buggy things happen at once. Aside from the rocket exploding, other buggy behaviors vary by run.\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:**\n\nOther craft don\u0027t have this problem, though IIRC some minor variations of this one did. It\u0027s possible I\u0027m remembering incorrectly, but: in one case I removed the \u0022Thud\u0022 engines. At 12k (following the above steps) it instantly bent at about 15 degrees in the middle, and started spiraling. Camera wasn\u0027t reliably centered, there was an \u0022infinite explosion\u0022 happening in one corner of the screen, etc it bugged out.\n\n**Files:**\n\nThe craft file: [http://cl.ly/0r2r0j0o2Y0s](http://cl.ly/0r2r0j0o2Y0s)\n\nA video showing the full sequence: [http://cl.ly/253C2V083o1c](http://cl.ly/253C2V083o1c) (video is much larger than the page\u0027s player)\n\nThe log file, same contents as caught in the video: [http://cl.ly/2o1L3r0K1Y1i](http://cl.ly/2o1L3r0K1Y1i)\n\nMy saves folder: [http://cl.ly/220J060G0v1y](http://cl.ly/220J060G0v1y)\n\nThis is 100% repeatable on my device, so I\u0027m happy to collect any other information you may need. I\u0027m a programmer, and I have plenty of tools at hand (and would be happy to install more) if any would help diagnose this."}]}
