I press them and nothing seems to happen. I\u0027m trying to make part testing contracts go away completely because I never do them. Is it possible through this menu or is there a mod that eliminates certain kinds of contracts?"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T06:38:02Z","Content":"I believe there\u0027s a .cfg file that controls types and numbers of contracts. You should be able to set the max offered value for parts contracts to 0, which should prevent you seeing them at all. \n\nUnfortunately I\u0027m not at my KSP PC right now, so I can\u0027t check and give any details, but a little Google-fu should turn up something, I suspect."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T07:49:19Z","Content":"There also are mods that can do this from an ingame menu. Unfortunately I don\u0027t remember the names right now, but searching for mods that include the word \u0022contract\u0022 in their title should get you started."}]}
