Pitch up causes the lift generated to put a greater proportion of the plane\u0027s weight on the main gears and so decrease the load on the front gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T10:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWheel alignment I think may be the answer you are looking for.
