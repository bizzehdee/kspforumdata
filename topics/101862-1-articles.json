As far as I know, I installed them correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESent the probe up, things worked as expected, it arrived at Eve, did some science on the flyby. On the escape trajectory out of Eve, however, when I crossed the SOI boundary (I think that\u0027s when it happened), the craft did not end up in a normal orbit of the sun where the game thought it would end up (the orange result-of-maneuver line in the picture).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, the craft is now moving in one direction in space relative to the solar system. Let\u0027s call it \u0022east\u0022. Though the craft is apparently always moving in that direction, it \u003Cem\u003Ealso \u003C/em\u003Eorbits the sun as if it were \u0022stuck\u0022 to Eve, but still moving at a fixed speed in the same direction relative to the whole solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/weirdorbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdorbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s an output_log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_log_weirdorbit.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_log_weirdorbit.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas what the devil is going on?
