We\u0027ve sent people to Low Earth Orbit, and a few of them to the moon. We\u0027ve sent unmanned landers to Venus and Mars. We\u0027ve sent out some probes doing flybys of some other bodies. That\u0027s it. None of these things require asparagus staging in KSP, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is, we\u0027re more efficient and much better at rocket science in the real world. The delta v to get to a Low Earth Orbit is around 9.5 km/s. In KSP that kind of budget puts you in orbit around a *different* planet. The payloads we send up in the real world aren\u0027t tiny, either. The Apollo landers were quite heavy compared to what you\u0027d send up in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true that the Falcon Heavy that has been mentioned in this thread will use some basic variant of asparagus staging (two side stages that pump their fuel into the center one). But it will not actually beat the payload capacity the Saturn V had 50 years ago! So we still don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E asparagus staging ... we\u0027re kind of only seeing it at all because SpaceX is trying new things to make their rocket safer than other rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut bear in mind the reason it won\u0027t beat the payload capacity is the reusability function. The Falcon Heavy could give the Sat V a run for its money if it didn\u0027t need 15% of its fuel for landing its boosters. It mightn\u0027t beat it (I can\u0027t remember if the exact lift capacity was greater or not), but it definitely comes close, and is a much smaller rocket for its troubles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Sorry I\u0027m wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFH can lift 53tons, SV is 120tons. Still, FH is \u0027only 1.4m kg\u0027 vs \u0027only 2.3m kg\u0027, so you\u0027re getting just under half the lift for half the mass, but at much less than half the cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T09:31:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmappedout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
