It\u0027s early career, so I have limited parts. I threw together a craft that used two X200-32 Fuel Tanks, a single X200-16 fuel tank, and a Skipper engine as a liquid fuel booster stage, with a couple of Thumpers to help it out in the lower atmosphere. Everything went fine until I was about 30-40km up, at which point the Skipper started overheating. And it\u0027d keep overheating until it exploded, even at reduced throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is weird, because I\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E had a Skipper overheat before. Not in any of the other previous versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI slapped some radiators onto it to see if that helped. It didn\u0027t. Radiators didn\u0027t seem to change anything, no matter how many I put on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ran a test in my sandbox save, to see what was going on. Created a similar setup as the liquid booster, clamped it to the launch pad, and ran it until it overheated, both with four of the large radiator panels and without any. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/68Jdq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
