It\u0027s early career, so I have limited parts. I threw together a craft that used two X200-32 Fuel Tanks, a single X200-16 fuel tank, and a Skipper engine as a liquid fuel booster stage, with a couple of Thumpers to help it out in the lower atmosphere. Everything went fine until I was about 30-40km up, at which point the Skipper started overheating. And it\u0027d keep overheating until it exploded, even at reduced throttle.\n\nThis is weird, because I\u0027ve *never* had a Skipper overheat before. Not in any of the other previous versions.\n\nI slapped some radiators onto it to see if that helped. It didn\u0027t. Radiators didn\u0027t seem to change anything, no matter how many I put on.\n\nSo I ran a test in my sandbox save, to see what was going on. Created a similar setup as the liquid booster, clamped it to the launch pad, and ran it until it overheated, both with four of the large radiator panels and without any. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

That means the radiator needs to be on the fuel tank next to the engine to have any hope at all of having an effect (better yet, a lightweight part between the engine and tanks that can heat up quickly)\n\nEDIT\n\nIn saying that, I can\u0027t get the Skipper to explode on the pad (or anywhere close). Sounds like something is bug\u0027d\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T06:39:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 06:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:36:19Z","Content":"If you upgraded your KSP install (rather than a clean, new install), then I recommend getting rid of your physics.cfg and downloading (or if you\u0027re using steam, verifying your game cache) to get a fresh Physics.cfg.
