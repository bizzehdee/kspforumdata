You had the extremum, which is the peak before slip, the the asymptote value, which is what it drops to after you\u0027ve exceeded the grip and serious slippage is happening. Real world, this is always less (other factors like tyre heat not withstanding). In U4, rather than staying steady after exceeding the extremum value, it dropped to the asymptote and merrily\u00A0climbed steadily back up. Infinitely. So a little slip occurred, then was brought back into check as the grip (incorrectly) built again.\u00A0\u00A0There was a forum post\u00A0I can no longer find which\u00A0contained\u00A0a lot of experimentation,\u00A0graphed the results and explained in depth.\u00A0The new U5 collider behaves correctly, in that once grip is lost, it never builds again and\u00A0the wheel runs away.

It\u0027s still not without its challenges, and there\u0027s a lot of work to do to get things working as well as I\u0027d like. I suppose the worst thing is the grip/mass settings that cause either bouncing or drift mode when approaching anything reasonable, and I can\u0027t figure out why it seems like the brakes are slammed on when motor torque returns to zero, which doesn\u0027t happen in my U5 test rig.
