Parts now can withstand ridiculous temperatures. Seperatrons in particular. This does not make sense to me as heat from engine exhaust was just added and existed in seperatron exhaust for far longer. Is this just an oversight because using seperatron exhaust made for some very interesting systems.\n\nUsing seperatron exhaust you could make fused cluster bombs by destroying a core unit by burning... releasing several projectiles originally attached to that central part. You could also use seperatron exhaust as a stock weapon for fun. \n\nWas this intended or is this a bug that will be fixed? I like my seperatron heat. I was making a fireworks system using them but now that is off the table.\n\n![GcLAqpv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GcLAqpv.jpg)\n\n**The above is an example of how exhaust heating does not work in 1.0.3**\n\n![LxyjsUU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LxyjsUU.jpg)\n\n**You would think a mainsail would be able to do the job right?
