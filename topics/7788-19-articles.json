Yes, it\u0027s a challenge to get into space, but damn, it\u0027s a full, working nuclear reactor. At least it\u0027s aerodynamic compared to plastering RTGs over everything, and saves you having a thousand solar parts. Your RAM thanks me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSMBattery\u003C/strong\u003E added to Specialized Electrics alongside large stock battery. MASSIVE Buff to the battery; weight kept at 3 tons as original, but (assuming half is battery and half is xenon containment, as the capacities suggest) ElectricCharge multiplied by 750% and Xenon multiplied by 2000% to reflect the weight difference between this and the very light stock parts. Too much? Well maybe the stock ones are overpowered for their sized, but I\u0027m not changing *them*. Added a title that matches the other items, since it was just \u0027battery\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSM25m4XEngine\u003C/strong\u003E added to Nuclear Propulsion next to LV-N. Updated with some new properties to keep it sane and stock-like. Mass multiplied by 6. That\u0027s a lot, but scales with the thrust. Otherwise it\u0027s just a cheaty part with no reason to ever pick LV-N. Electrical generation increased to match that of the little LV-N. I haven\u0027t scaled it up any further. Hey, go use the Nuke reactor... Overheating animation added, but heat production reduced to half what the stock nuke engine produces - it overheats too much. This is advanced technology, so, er, they\u0027ve fixed that problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSM25mIonEngine\u003C/strong\u003E added to Ion Propulsion alongside normal Ion Engine. Scaled up the mass (again) to reflect its much greater power than the little Ion Engine. it produces 40 times the thrust, so I made it a bit less than 40 times heavier (to reflect some economies of scale), and included twice as much resources to make up for any annoyance thus caused!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSM Fuel Tanks\u003C/strong\u003E added to the Tech nodes of their nearest \u0027neighbours\u0027 in the stock fuel tanks. Since they actually have a little bit lower capacity than usual originally, I increased their strength a bit, to give a reason to use them beyond looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSM25mDecoupler \u003C/strong\u003Eadded to Advanced Construction alongside similar stock decoupler. Small weight increase but improved strength to scale with the default stronger decoupling force.

Small weight decrease, because for some reason it was *heavier* than the larger decoupler in the original release. IDK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSM25mToStrut\u003C/strong\u003E adapter added to Specialized Construction alongside stock girder adapter.

Made to be at stronger than the original little girder, but cannot be surfaced attached, because logic (it\u0027s four sided).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSMStrutCargo\u003C/strong\u003E added to Specialized Construction alongside other trusses. Kerbal Attachment System container module added. Shouldn\u0027t break anything if KAS is not installed, I think. Justifies the increased mass. Moved to Utility alongside Hitchhiker and KAS boxes. Still carries Kerbals, for some reason. Meh. Perhaps it\u0027s for dead bodies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDSMStrutDecoupler\u003C/strong\u003E added to Specialized construction alongside other truss stuff.

Considering that it\u0027s an actual nuclear reactor, it\u0027s actually very underpowered with its current stats. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Affordable_Fission_Engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECompare to reality.\u003C/a\u003E At its current power output, it ought to mass about a ton and a half (basing that on the SAFE-400 being about half a ton, and outputting 100 kW of electrical power, about a third of this reactor\u0027s output). Alternately, at the sixteen tons you\u0027ve increased it to, it ought to output at least an order of magnitude more power than it currently does...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper! Thanks for the explanation; I had been thinking in terms of gameplay balance rather than technical aspects (which you are clearly more knowledgeable about than I). I\u0027ll probably change it in my own game, perhaps not quite down to 1.5 but certainly less than 16 - the damn thing is making even my Mainsails cry, so the actual gameplay is suffering. The poor Ion engine will have to push the thing soon and it\u0027s not looking forward to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 1.5tons it would be a no-brainer to include it in any moderately sized craft, negating the point of an RTG or even the large solar panels. I\u0027ll put the weight a bit higher than that if I can\u0027t think of another \u0022downside\u0022 to give it.
