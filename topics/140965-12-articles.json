This type of manipulation converted areas of European forest (namely evergreen) overtime into non-evergreen mixed grasslands and farmland. If we were standing in Europe today, have just plopped their by visitors we would remark about the well-developed pine and cypress forests, these forests altered the soil favoring their existance after the last ice age. Humans altered that balance. \u00A0 We can say that by 8000 years ago humans had fully reached this capability. What really is different today and for humans versus all other humans is that we can do this over so many ecological backdrops, from the coldest places on earth, to the hotest, from the wettest to the dryest, to the highest. In terms of terrestrial exploitation we and our domesticants are living at the extremes of the complex eucaryotes. Humans include as part of their diet more different types of complex animals and plants relative to any other species on earth.

Within the last 50,000 years or so progression to the adle-adle, the adze, the bow and arrow. In addition complex homebuilding allowed people to move from world areas with amicable night-time temperatures to temperatures at night that were well below human tolerances. This had fully occurred by 30,000 years ago, at least the dug-out is in the 50,000 year range, beyond line of site travel is over 30,000 years ago.

Indeed, most of the psychological \u0022pieces\u0022 of human psyche seem to be present to some degree in several animal species. However, those pieces do not form into the potent, self-propelling force that they do in every human child who has some benefit of socialization with conspecifics. Interestingly however, those few poor children who have been denied anything resembling proper socialization (Genie being the key example, but there are others too) are in some respects less humanlike in their psyche than are thoroughly nurtured nonhuman animals like Kanzi the bonobo or Alex the math-doing grey parrot, or Koko the gorilla, etc., etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this tells is that, we may have been \u0022fairly human like\u0022 though not quite truly human for a long time.

By the time a functional MRI can be carried around like a camera and can be used more-or-less anywhere these fields will have reached the starting line of their adolescence and within a generation I predict that models of what \u0022minds\u0022 are and how they relate to the cells and structures that comprise them will have revolutionized to the point that our current models will seem nearly like medieval superstitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, you cannot say these sorts of things if you are hoping to work in academia; the modal \u0027tolerance\u0027 for revolutionary thinking and for skepticism about prevailing models in general seems to be at an historic ebb tide, though not because people are less curious I think.

In terms of terrestrial exploitation we and our domesticants are living at the extremes of the complex eucaryotes.

Olduvan are tools, the owner was Homo habilis spp and later. Acheuleen is much younger and of course Homo erectus spp. (the assumed owner of the Acheuleen) did produce tools.

That is why the \u003Cstrong\u003Euse does not define the purpose of a tool, the shape does\u003C/strong\u003E.
