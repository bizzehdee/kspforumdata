I think, under 1000 km, the craft IS under acceleration (or deceleration). I saw my periapsis slowly goes down (very very slowly...), maybe cause of the atmosphere?

It only seems to affect ships that are in approximately equatorial orbits, not polar orbits. But yeah, if you\u0027re below 1Mm near Jool, the game refuses to let you warp."},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T00:10:45Z","Content":"And hopefully they\u0027ll do something about those stupids impossible aerobreakings with less useless heatshield and ships not exploding at 198 000m."}]}
