Getting off of the surface of Eve is one of the hardest challenges in the game. You could strand a Kerbal there with a one-way trip if you are the cruel type, but I would just work with Duna first."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:34:45Z","Content":"Duna.\n\nThey\u0027re roughly as easy to get to their SOIs, but landing on Eve is a prison sentence unless you work REALLY hard. For days. Or months. Gilly (Eve\u0027s moon) is super easy to land on and take off from (it\u0027s so small I actually thrust down toward it to speed up the landing) but it\u0027s so small and eccentric it can be difficult for a new player to intersect.\n\nDuna, on the other hand, needs nothing more than a few parachutes (more is better. The atmosphere\u0027s pretty thin, and don\u0027t be shy firing the rockets to slow down at the end to make sure you\u0027re going slow enough) to land on and a ship not much bigger than what you took to Mun and back the first time you did it. Ike is the opposite of Gilly. It\u0027s HUGE and the problem is generally figuring out how to NOT interact with it. It\u0027s very similar to Mun so landing on it - once you get there - should be a nice familiar thing to boost your confidence during this new endeavour.\n\nDuna, I suggest people do FIRST. Eve, I suggest they tackle LAST."},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:35:06Z","Content":"If you want to only land a probe on the surface, or if you don\u0027t mind stranding a Kerbal: Eve.\n\nIf you want to land and return from the surface: Duna.\n\nBoth planets have atmospheres, so you can aerobrake. Both have moons that are easy to land on. Landing on Duna is more difficult, but you\u0027ll be able to get home. Landing on Eve is easy (just bring parachutes) but getting back home is the most difficult mission in the game.\n\nMy vote always goes to Duna first."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:40:00Z","Content":"@OP: 279 posts on the forum and you\u0027re just now starting interplanetary travel?

Or are you just dropping a probe? \n\nKerballed: Duna. Pretty easy to land/return from, and doesn\u0027t require a lot of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC V to get there.\n\nProbes: Eve. Easy to drop stuff on, chutes work well. Requires less transfer \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC V.\n\nI would recommend dropping a probe on Duna before you send Kerbals, just to get the feel of it. You might need a powered lander on Duna as well."},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:40:29Z","Content":"Eve is slightly easier to get to and land on due to the thicker atmosphere and higher gravity. You can land just about anything with parachutes. Gilly is also very simple to get to from Eve- you can land on it with just the EVA jetpack. Taking off from Eve, however, is one of the more difficult engineering challenges in KSP.\n\nDuna is slightly more tricky due to the much thinner atmosphere reducing the effect of aerobraking, plus Ike has a habit of getting in the way as you\u0027re encountering Duna. It\u0027s far simpler to get back from Duna though. I launched a mission to Duna and Ike, and I ended up landing on Ike first due to a chance encounter following aerocapture. For Duna, I\u0027d have the main ship establish itself in orbit and then deploy a lander to the surface.\n\nI\u0027d go to Duna first if you want to do a round trip exploration. Eve is good for unmanned probes and permanent colonies."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:41:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am about ready to start my interplanetary exploration.

Getting there is rather easy (easier than Duna on account of its much larger SoI and faster orbit, meaning that transfer windows occur more frequently). I also find it prettier than Duna since it\u0027s purple and has oceans, but that\u0027s only my personal preference. Eve\u0027s one of my favorite places to go, even though I\u0027ve never made a proper ascent from its surface - it\u0027s just so pretty to look at from orbit and from the surface.\n\nDuna\u0027s fine too, though - That was the second planet I visited when I started, and it\u0027s also a nice place.

The main thing is to think carefully about who you send if you do a one-way trip.

Eve, while a great place like any other (although my fav is the entire jool system for the many moons and laythe jet planes), is rather tough to do anything once you get there. Eve itsself is crazy hard to take off from, as you need at a bare minimum 12000dV, which is no small feat evenb for the experienced players. Its usually a 1 way trip, landing there is easy, bases can be paradropped down, and well youi cfan run around on the surface, but getting back to orbit is very hard. Gilly is also not very new player friendly, as its orbit is very hard to get to without knowing how to deal with eliptical orbits. That said, it has almost no gravity, so you can land anything there (that has at least 1 engine ofc). Duna has ike, which is much easier to deal with, and while landing on it isnt that easy, its more or less similar to a mun landing (which ill assume anyone who wants to got to duna has done at least once). Finally, duna, unlike the later game jool and other places, doesnt require nukes at all for a return trip, so its relatively cheap and easy to get to duna early game (heck, the kerbalX can get to duna and land, and that stock with very early game parts)."},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T09:04:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Duna can be malicious for landings though, the air is thin.\n\nIn my current playtrough I explored Duna (multiple landings all over the planet) with my Moho-grade nuclear-powered lander.
