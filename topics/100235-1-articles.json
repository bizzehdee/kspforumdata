Eve itsself is crazy hard to take off from, as you need at a bare minimum 12000dV, which is no small feat evenb for the experienced players. Its usually a 1 way trip, landing there is easy, bases can be paradropped down, and well youi cfan run around on the surface, but getting back to orbit is very hard. Gilly is also not very new player friendly, as its orbit is very hard to get to without knowing how to deal with eliptical orbits. That said, it has almost no gravity, so you can land anything there (that has at least 1 engine ofc). Duna has ike, which is much easier to deal with, and while landing on it isnt that easy, its more or less similar to a mun landing (which ill assume anyone who wants to got to duna has done at least once).
