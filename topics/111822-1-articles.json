AVC nags you, which you can ignore, and CKAN provides a button to update all your mods, but it is a manual button press (after you manually load CKAN and manually refresh the available mods)\n\nBoth AVC and CKAN are 100% optional for the user, but for those users that like AVC, it requires support from the developer.\n\nDeveloper includes .version file: User has to explicitly install AVC in order to use it, can choose to stop using it at any time\n\nDeveloper includes .version file and MiniAVC .dll: User gets to choose whether to use MiniAVC on first startup\n\nDeveloper doesn\u0027t include .version file: User has no choice whether to use AVC or not\n\nCKAN doesn\u0027t require developer support (other people can write the .ckan file) but it obviously works better if the developer keeps it updated (easiest by just using KerbalStuff as one of your download sites).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have one plugin and AVC is bigger than that plugin. Also, AVC gets updated more frequently than that plugin. It isn\u0027t worth it.\n\nYou don\u0027t have to include the MiniAVC .dll in your plugin (and shouldn\u0027t include the full AVC); you just need a .version file, which is like 5 lines of text.\n\nI think AVC is actually more worth it for infrequently-updated mods. For the mods that update all the time, people are more apt to check for new versions; however for something that changes once every 6 months, they\u0027re not going to check manually if it\u0027s been updated.\n\nLikewise I use an RSS aggregator (feedly.com) to read web comics - because they\u0027re infrequently updated, I\u0027m not going to check 20 different sites every day to see what\u0027s been updated or remember to check them on a schedule; instead I check one page to tell me what\u0027s new."}]}
