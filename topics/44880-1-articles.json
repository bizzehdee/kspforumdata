To that end I\u0027ve been using a design made using the techniques from Temstar\u0027s Nova design. Since I\u0027ve been having trouble getting anything I make to orbit with any fuel left I\u0027ve been using MechJeb to get up and let me see what I should be doing. All of my latest design though have been getting to some altitude then slowly drifting off course falling back to earth and going up in a fantastic ball of flame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe root cause is that the thrust is breaking my connections between stages. It\u0027s not shaking apart or twisting apart it seems like it is just pancaking the joints. As soon as that happens MechJeb loses control or I lose a stage. I\u0027ve tried addign struts but it doesn\u0027t look like I can do that very well between sections. Are there stronger components or something else I can do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course when I went to grab screenshots of this in action it worked without a problem....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the Craft file if you want to be hands on. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ij8u24v6h1tbwp/Rionnag%20Cluster%20Test.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9ij8u24v6h1tbwp/Rionnag%20Cluster%20Test.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T01:31:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sg\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ACobairOg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded Craft file.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"piiscool","CreatedById":81420,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T01:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can add struts on side decouplers that fall of with the stages.

The hardpoints will go with the coupler or separator so they\u0027re not keeping weight on the rest of the rocket. Depending on thrust and other factors, 8 around will keep things together but can still wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a craft to put two full Rockomax 64 tanks into orbit and all I had to do to cure its wobble under thrust was to lock the gimbal on the Skipper engine in the center. Once I did that I no longer needed struts to hold the two tanks together across the battery pack, RGU and other parts between, though other parts that stage off have struts bracing the upper tank until it gets into the gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my #1 nemesis for a while, things folding up, breaking off and major failures going into the turn. Once into the turn it seems to be much less violent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething you can do is turn on SAS and launch manually then enable the MechJeb ascent autopilot when you get to the altitude just before the gravity turn. MJ *always* goes full throttle at launch even when it wouldn\u0027t need to. Once it gets some altitude, or if your rocket is hitting terminal velocity, MechJeb has a softer hand on the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T05:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe following parts missing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer7500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emumech.mechjeb1m\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alioth","CreatedById":80036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T13:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor very large rockets I find that Mechjeb (and to a lesser extent, SAS) has far too high gain for course correction and tends to start the whole craft oscillating.
