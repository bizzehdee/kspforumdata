I haven\u0027t had any issues transmitting from far reaching planets with the basic antenna.

If you have a probe (or even a lander) with a ton of experiments, and want to (or have to) move on to the next biome asap, it can be helpful to transmit more quickly. Of course, this comes at a cost. The highest end antenna expends almost twice as much energy per packet spent as the prior models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI typically use the original antenna for most missions - and then really only to transmit EVA and crew reports. Interplanetary probes get the second option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find transmit speed to be hardly ever critical, so I use the tiny one - because it\u0027s simply the best in every other way, small crafts actually benefit from the lower transmit speed / ec cost per packet. And ofc it\u0027s cheaper, smaller, lighter and can be placed pretty much anywhere. I was kinda hoping there would be some incentive to use the other antennas because they look good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make those antennas useful (and give you a nice big challenge to boot), play RemoteTech!
