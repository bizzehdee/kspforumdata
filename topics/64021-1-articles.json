Take note of the weird gravity effects. Also relevant challenge is get a Moho intercept and land there. If you bring a lot of dV, you can play around a bit after you arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve: land a craft on Eve that can take off again and reach orbit. Take note of the higher gravity there (1.8x) and also realize that you\u0027ll want a bit lower than 2x TWR while you\u0027re going through the thick parts of the atmosphere. Maybe 1.5 to 1.75 (that\u0027s 2.7-3.15 Kerbin TWR). Aerospike engines are a good choice as they wont lose efficiency in the thick atmosphere, and landing on high elevation points will make a huge difference but I nearly succeeded in this challenge from a beach and with mainsails for half the trip (by burn duration). I didn\u0027t run out of dV, but failed in 1.) not being able to land (I instead spun up the engines and jettisoned the parachutes a few meters from the ground) and 2.) phantom forces destroyed it for no apparent reason as it was almost out of the atmosphere. But I digress... \u003Cstrong\u003Echallenge ribbon if you succeed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus: Extreme EVA. It\u0027s actually not that difficult. The fuel margin is small but entirely tolerable. The most important thing is trajectory. On liftoff, you want to head almost horizontal and get just enough lift to clear the hills. On landing, you want to try to come in horizontal also, and be slowing your motion across terrain more than your motion downward--try to maintain the same trajectory as you slow down. You want to slow down evenly until yoou reach a perfect stop just above the surface. If you\u0027re slowing too fast, wait a bit till you get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn: not so much a challenge but fun (I think) - build a fueling and research station in low orbit around the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. You\u0027ll want at least half an orange tank of fuel, a mobile processing lab, and either medium or small docking ports (or both). Then build a small research lander and you can take it down to the surface and back up to the station pretty easily. Plus, I think landing is fun once you get the hang of it. Tricks I\u0027ve used to make landing easier: 1.) angle yourself almost horizontal 2.) suicide burn to save fuel 3.) use RCS translation to stabilize during final descent 4.) put lights on the lander for night landings. If you land in a spot near multiple biomes, you can grab data from all of them. Screw using a rover, just EVA there. Also you can fly the lander over pretty easy if you\u0027re good at landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna: land with both parachutes and engines. Make your chutes open early, they take a while to take effect. Come in as steep as possible. Try to land at a low elevation to make it easier, or at a high elevation for a bigger challenge. If you do it right, you should need a very short burn right before landing, saving a ton of fuel with those parachutes. Then when you\u0027re done, take off again and note how easy it is to take off, since the air doesn\u0027t hold you back much and you can do it with a high TWR. If you do it right, you use the thin atmosphere for cheap descent AND cheap ascent. You can\u0027t do that on any other world (relative to its size I mean).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke: one-way extreme EVA. The fuel margin is small, but it\u0027s possible for a kerbal to EVA from the surface into a very low orbit, or from a very low orbit to land on the surface. For additional challenge, make a super low orbiting station and a ground base, then EVA back and forth between the two. When Ike gets biomes, you could drop cheap landers on each biome, consisting of just a Mk 1 lander can and barely enough dV to land, then have a kerbal EVA from one to another, collecting science along the way and using the capsules to refuel (as well as consolidate reports), and finally have that kerbal EVA off to orbit to the waiting station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool: aerobrake. If you come in shallow enough, you can end up streaking for a long time. It\u0027s pretty and fun. Also, fly a plane down inside, do some loop-de-loops or other controlled maneuvers inside that atmosphere, then activate rocket engines and come out to an orbit. This will earn you wings on your Jool ribbon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe: bring an air-breathing jet and fly around. Also grants wings. Extra challenge: use the same plane for wings on Layth as well as Jool - do a big long streaking aerobrake at Jool, descend into the atmosphere and fly around, then pop out and go to Laythe, and land there under powered flight. Alternatively, you can just drop a probe in with a parachute and score lots of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo: land. Or land and take off again. That second one earns the Tylo challenge wreathe. Easiest way to land is come in super steep with a super high TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop and Pol: land with an ion-powered probe. It\u0027s tricky because of the reduced light from the sun at that distance. Pol is easier. For practice, try landing an ion probe on Minmus first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T10:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had lots of fun with my \u0022mission\u0022 to put a flag on each pole (north/south) in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
