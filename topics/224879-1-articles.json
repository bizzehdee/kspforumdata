When I upgrade a building, and then leave the game and join it again, the upgrade disappears, and the money I used to upgrade it doesnt come back it still disappears. Am I doing something wrong? My friend had 2 dlc installed so he disabled them (as I dont have them ) because we thought it is going to mess with the mod. I only made careful changes in the settings through the xml, but I have no idea what to do now. Someone know how to fix?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
