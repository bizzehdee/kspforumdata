On prototype 2, I used 8 engines to lift 62.82 tons of the same design but with added Lazor system, missiles and ISA system and It needs 90% thrust. This seems to work better with a bit of thrust left over. I have also noted that due to the low center of gravity at the rotation point an added engine in center back of craft is needed to keep craft on level controllable flight angle. For my craft I have added 4 KerbX falcon 1 engine to give me 1040 of forward line propulsion. Attached are hanger shots with info tabs open.
