My edition was published 1980-ish.

He begins with the field of telecommunications. Trans-Atlantic cables were expensive, and could only handle a low volume of messages. The communication satellites changed all that by making Trans-Atlantic calls and faxes cheaper and more abundant. This has economic ramifications, improving trade, besides the human factor of someone being able to speak to their family from a distant place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Westinghouse Corporation was getting tired of paying for its employees to fly everywhere for their business meetings. They began using telecommunications equipment, and the number of their people flying was reduced by 20%. That reduces pollution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGeology and Cartography:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, geography. How do you think they made maps before satellites? Were they probably very accurate? No, especially in remote locations. French scientists used Echo I (1950s) to determine the distance between Europe and North Africa to an accuracy of 12 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIn Brazil, scientists at the Brazilian Space Exploration Office reported that, by comparing a satellite image and the best existing maps at the time, they had found striking results. The Amazon was drawn on the maps with an error, in some places, of over 20 miles. Several tributaries were found to flow in entirely different directions than previously thought. In some cases, the differences approached 90\u00B0.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sad thing is, the pictures revealed that several dozen bridges built as part of an Amazon superhighway were completely superfluous. Were the satellite pictures available earlier, much money could have been saved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSatellites are used to watch and study tectonic plates. They give advance warnings for volcanic eruptions, and other natural disasters, but we\u0027ll get to meteorology later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EResource Management:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, look at an atlas from the time he wrote this. There were still areas of low detail, where cartographers had little data. Yet, in future, he points out, we will have to develop new centers of agriculture to fight world hunger. Resource management is a very important area of satellite usage today. A satellite can tell you exactly what kinds of trees are in a forest, or what kind of rock a range of mountains includes. It can measure soil types and gather data which helps humans efficiently use only what land they need, instead of older, more wasteful methods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmospherics:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, satellites play a role in studying the atmosphere.

GPS is of unlimited utility. It helps shipping, airliners, etc. in massive ways, every day. Using GPS to optimize air traffic over the North Atlantic saved $46.5 million dollars (1976) a year. The benefits are greater to shipping. By saving one percent in the areas of both astronomical navigation and fuel usage, the industry would save $150 million a year. I\u0027m certain it is waaay higher today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: I\u0027ll edit this post to add the rest of the summary later; I\u0027ve gotta put this down now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMeteorology:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIn August 1969, pictures from the new Essa satellites arrive. The weathermen noted a cloud formation similar to those from which hurricanes were known to develop. As they watched, hour by hour,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Camille\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHurricane Camille\u003C/a\u003E grew and moved across the Caribbean. On the night of August 17, it hit.\u00A0 The Mississippi overflowed its banks, and Pass Christian registered a stormtide 26 feet above normal. It had the second-lowest air pressure of any hurricane in the United States. It flattened 6,000 houses, and severely damaged 50,000 more. Property damages amounted to more than 10 billion 2020 USD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly ~260 people died. The satellite data, by providing advance warning, had saved more than 50,000 lives. I dare anyone to put a price on that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHay, after being mowed, needs to dry for three days before being collected. If it rains on the hay in that time, it rots and becomes much less valuable. Weather satellites predict these three-day windows. According to the book, at the time of publication, that capability would save ~$28 million per harvest, per state. That number is surely much higher today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, space exploration has saved billions of dollars, created an industry, and inspired tens of thousands of people. I think it is safe to say that the savings to the economy from space exploration have \u003Cem\u003Emore than paid\u003C/em\u003E for all space activities, scientific or otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, we have used the vantage point of space to save countless lives.

He begins with the field of telecommunications. Trans-Atlantic cables were expensive, and could only handle a low volume of messages. The communication satellites changed all that by making Trans-Atlantic calls and faxes cheaper and more abundant. This has economic ramifications, improving trade, besides the human factor of someone being able to speak to their family from a distant place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Westinghouse Corporation was getting tired of paying for its employees to fly everywhere for their business meetings.

How do you think they made maps before satellites? Were they probably very accurate? No, especially in remote locations. French scientists used Echo I (1950s) to determine the distance between Europe and North Africa to an accuracy of 12 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIn Brazil, scientists at the Brazilian Space Exploration Office reported that, by comparing a satellite image and the best existing maps at the time, they had found striking results. The Amazon was drawn on the maps with an error, in some places, of over 20 miles. Several tributaries were found to flow in entirely different directions than previously thought. In some cases, the differences approached 90\u00B0.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sad thing is, the pictures revealed that several dozen bridges built as part of an Amazon superhighway were completely superfluous.

There were still areas of low detail, where cartographers had little data. Yet, in future, he points out, we will have to develop new centers of agriculture to fight world hunger. Resource management is a very important area of satellite usage today. A satellite can tell you exactly what kinds of trees are in a forest, or what kind of rock a range of mountains includes. It can measure soil types and gather data which helps humans efficiently use only what land they need, instead of older, more wasteful methods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmospherics:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, satellites play a role in studying the atmosphere.

It had the second-lowest air pressure of any hurricane in the United States. It flattened 6,000 houses, and severely damaged 50,000 more.

If it rains on the hay in that time, it rots and becomes much less valuable. Weather satellites predict these three-day windows.

Humans at the basic level are not capable of comprehending existence beyond their prime function- reproduction- and thus stray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, thankfully education and greater comprehension (within the context of homo sapiens cognitive ability) exist in 2021.

Looking at history, one might argue human behavior at the nation/state/tribal level has only worsened since then, although not because of space, for other non-related reasons. But space has had little to no\u00A0impact. While there is a large environmental movement that was especially aided in recruiting by images of the Earth, it seemingly has had little impact on policy- it is only right on the door step of irreversible/non-remediable climate change that changes in policy are starting to become *acceptable* but even then\u00A0it is still quite perfunctory.

No interest in the neighboring village, no interest in the mountain next to the village, no interest in the wild animals that run in the forest around the mountain. You are not allowed to study anything not originating in the village- no science, no history, nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually the neighboring village may come and pillage and ransack your village. A landslide will occur from the mountain and destroy the village. And you will overhunt the animals and have no more food. Those clouds up above may not come anymore one day, and you cannot grow food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow imagine you are in your country. Now do not hold any interest in anything outside of it. No interest in the neighboring countries, no interest in the river that flows through the neighboring country and into yours, no interest in the sailing ships you see passing your coastline, or the armored soldiers on horses that ride along your border. You cannot study anything outside of your country- not military technology, not engineering, not economics- nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually the neighboring country will launch a military invasion and either completely kill or enslave your people. Eventually the neighboring country might build a dam on the river, destroying your country\u0027s access to water, dooming crops and wildlife- destroying your country\u0027s food supply. And eventually your country will run out of resources and society will collapse, while the neighboring country seeks new territories or allies and continues to maintain a steady supply of resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow imagine you are on Earth. I cannot say what threats may come from the sky. But there is certainly a potential for them to exist. And just as the speeds that objects in space move with are enormous, there will be little time to solve a problem coming from space once it is detected. Furthermore, just as the problems go up in scale- from your house being destroyed, to your village being destroyed, to your nation collapsing- the problems from space will be enormous and threaten everyone. Therefore it is important to start learning now. That \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the ideal scenario- to find and solve a problem before it causes suffering and death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow let\u0027s look at some of those smaller scale issues again-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Your country will run out of resources\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of these will occur any time soon. Just as you would like to prioritize your relationship with your wife or maybe the fighting between your two boys over a theoretical storm, or you might want to prioritize the church in your village in need of repairs or the building of a shelter for orphans over the hypothetical landslide, or you might want to prioritize poverty relief and improving medical care over the hypothetical resource depletion, no one is saying we need to build space colonies or interstellar arks right now. All that is being done now is basic learning. As I said earlier, it is important to start learning now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you might ask why government money must be spent on this. After all, research in other areas often does not\u00A0rely on such seemingly large amounts of government money. The unfortunate answer lies in the nature of how rocketry began, and to a lesser extent the nature of operations in space. Rocketry could be described as a peaceful application of missile development. Due to national security reasons, strict oversight is necessary to prevent leaking of technology to potential enemies. It is not possible in the current international situation to let private organizations go around building rockets willy nilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore objects in space have great potential to hurt people. The best example is the uncontrolled reentry of space debris, a lesser example would be the potential- albeit highly unlikely- of contamination of Earth with alien organisms from another planet that could cause an ecological disaster. The government must participate to allow for oversight, accountability, and guidance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you might go even further and try to point out different aspects of space exploration that seem wasteful. Perhaps they are. You may think studying Jupiter provides little to no benefit for humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo this I say the following-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. As I said, \u0022we\u0022 are\u00A0simply learning about space. We can\u0027t identify problems we don\u0027t know exist yet, and therefore unfortunately cannot pinpoint our efforts towards \u0022useful\u0022 exploration. Therefore space exploration is somewhat generalized, not aimed towards gaining knowledge in support of solving any specific problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. We do not live in a novel or movie where one MacGuffin saves the day. Real life has multiple working parts.

I love it when we get deep threads like this. Thank you all.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO, I don\u0027t see much in the way of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeconomic\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0justification for deep space exploration. At least, not today. The only things I can come up with are unlimited hydrocarbons from Titan and metals from the asteroid belts. And He3 from Saturn or whatever, if that ever happens. Beyond that, I just scratch my head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etomorrow\u003C/em\u003E, figuratively speaking, we could have an economic use for space. There is a law of economics (I forget the name...help!?) which says we cannot predict distinct future inventions in detail without actually inventing them, if in thought only. In other words, you can\u0027t predict the rise of an original idea without having the idea. I can\u0027t think of a better way to phrase it... But the point is that we could have a need to go to space sometime in the near future; we just can\u0027t see it coming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, people didn\u0027t really need mass production of steel until the railroad made it necessary. And no one could have predicted railroads without inventing the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, that\u0027s not an argument for deep space exploration \u003Cem\u003Etoday\u003C/em\u003E. You could say that we should launch probes now, to make using space easier later on, when we need it, but that has no economic benefits in the present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince there are few economic reasons at the moment,\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0we can resort to philosophical arguments. For example, if the person you\u0027re debating is religious (I hope this doesn\u0027t violate forum rules...), you could say that the universe is designed to be explored and enjoyed by mankind.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also say that it\u0027s really none of their business what other people are doing on their own time, provided they\u0027re not hurting anyone while they do it. They may refute this by saying that not intervening to help the starving is harming them by inaction, but you can reply by pointing out that they can no longer indulge in any luxuries, lest they harm by inaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd lastly, if they\u0027re honestly looking to keep money from being wasted, and not just going after space exploration because of a vendetta they have, there are many, many more \u0022wastes\u0022 of money present, at least in the U.S. Federal budget, than NASA.

There are a lot of important stuff that we\u0027d get if we did manage to not get stuck with a single planet, sure, but given the barrier needed to be passed before we get there, let alone the \u0027smaller\u0027 barriers one must take before it, gives that only those who have the resources and the will would even attempt it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy sole problem is that we\u0027ve never quite do anything in a global scale as humanity in the exact same will.
