Phonenix is a great program for learning but the games get boring, so what I believe that\u0027s possible is to make a mod that uses the Phonenix cord and your R.C. remote to control the crafts in KSP. Since Phonenix already has the drivers capable you might be able to use those exact drivers but jury rig the software.
