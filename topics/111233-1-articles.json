I need it for Liquid Hydrogen. Since I\u0027ve disabled Ore being tweakable, the Hydrogen has become a challenge. I need something that can regularly send in a supply to fuel my NERVAs, and I was wondering if the contraption I built can do the job.\n\n[i\u0027ve hacked in some Ore for testing purposes, in case you were gonna ask]\n\n![BgG84cl.png](http://i.imgur.com/BgG84cl.png)\n\nThis is my atrocity. Please, contain your enthusiasm.\n\nThis is a prototype, and I want your opinion on it. Here\u0027s some pros and cons to the current design.\n\nPros:\n\nFuel cells are fed by the refinery\u0027s excess, which makes the cycle self sufficient. \n\nHolds up to 6.2 tons of Liquid Hydrogen in total.\n\nCells can power both drills at once.\n\nHolds a total of 118.1 tons in Ore.\n\nCan drive over slopes under decent gravity.\n\nBrings it\u0027s own pepperoni to-go.\n\nCons:\n\nLow power storage.\n\nPower production is insufficient for multitasking.\n\nAbove 88.57 tons of Ore, the tanker can no longer drive safely, and becomes stationary.\n\nDocking port required for non-specialized craft.\n\nMay require maintenance, but holds no crew.\n\nLiquid Hydrogen and LFO storage unit is a little floppy.\n\nHates large slopes.\n\nRequired near constant supply of pizza.\n\nDo you think this is an efficient design, or the worst you\u0027ve seen yet? What could it use?\n\nDISCLOSURE: The LFO is purely for the fuel cells. It\u0027s not for transfer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-16T09:11:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2016 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T10:53:21Z","Content":"Not efficient in the way of storage, you have a gigantic volume of ore but only 450 \u0027slots\u0027 for LF.

So the ore storage is still not neccesary. And if time is not an problem, you can timewarp through te mining and converting so than you even need even less storage for everything (exept LF for electricity of course).\n\nAnd if you delete at least one stack of ore containers, you can allign the ore storage, converter and LF storage on only one set of wheels instead of two wich you have now."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:25:04Z","Content":"I\u0027ll go ahead and build something of this specification and see how it goes."},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:31:08Z","Content":"Good luck ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:01:44Z","Content":"Hard to say, as much depends on where you\u0027re doing your mining. In very low gravity areas like Minmus, a rocket based platform can be far more mobile and maneuverable.

I would definitely supplement with a couple gigantor solar arrays.\n\nAs for the wheels buckling on the target planet - well, can only test it out I suppose.\n\nAnyway, like the design - got an industrial look to it."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:12:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hard to say, as much depends on where you\u0027re doing your mining.

The mining output bonus from an engineer is enormous, very noticable even at just 2-3 stars.\n\nWith more ore coming in at the same power draw, your LH2 production greatly increases because the fraction of ore you lose to keep the cycle self-sustaining is much smaller. You can also add more fuel cells to allow \u0022multitasking\u0022 that way, and still be net positive.\n\nFor the lulz, just stick a radial attachment port on top of an ore tank and mount a mk1 capsule. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T07:20:11Z","Content":"I\u0027ve decided to stick with a slightly improved Mk I design.
