much higher than parachutes can cope with.\u00A0 There are a variety of landing strategies, but my personal favorite is this:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EPut a pair of tiny drogue chutes on the lander, and one regular

surface.\u00A0 But then give it just a very brief blip of rocket power right at the moment of touchdown to cushion the landing.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIt\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epossible\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to spam enough parachutes to land on Duna on chutes alone... but I like doing the above, instead.\u00A0 Reason:\u00A0 you need so many parachutes that they\u0027re heavy.\u00A0 The fuel you burn in that little-blip-right-at-landing is a lot lighter than all the extra parachutes, so it saves mass.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, \u003Cstrong\u003Etake off \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eefficiently\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E from Duna\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Its atmosphere is a lot thinner than Kerbin\u0027s, and your local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is likely to be higher, so you can do a significantly more aggressive gravity turn.\u00A0 Saves \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Do it right, and you can get to low orbit for around 1200 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne decision point is whether you want to do a direct land-and-return mission, or do an Apollo-style orbital rendezvous.\u00A0 Both of these can be made to work, and it\u0027s not that big of a deal either way.\u00A0 It\u0027s a matter of your personal preference and play style:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA direct land-and-return means that your lander has to have at least 1810 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E remaining, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eafter\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E landing.\u00A0 So that\u0027s a respectable chunk, and it means your lander\u0027s going to have to be fairly good-sized, which in turn means it\u0027s going to be a fairly big (and therefore more expensive) craft upon takeoff from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the Apollo-style mission, you leave an orbiting vehicle around Duna, and the lander only carries enough fuel to descend to the surface and then return to orbit.\u00A0 There are a few ways to slice this.\u00A0 You could make the orbiter be just a fuel tank, i.e. the lander is also the Kerbin return vehicle, and it simply refuels from the tank upon returning to orbit.\u00A0\u00A0 Or you could make the orbiter be the return vehicle, with its own crew pod and engine, so that you leave the lander parked in Duna orbit when you go home.\u00A0 Either way works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Apollo-style mission allows for a smaller craft, because that\u0027s a big chunk of fuel that you\u0027re not schlepping down to the surface of Duna and back again.\u00A0 This means that the overall mission can be smaller and therefore cheaper.\u00A0 However, it does present more of a navigational challenge.\u00A0 First, it means that on initial approach to Duna, you need to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eaerobrake to low orbit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than descending directly to the surface, which is certainly doable, but it\u0027s challenging-- Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin and so vertically shallow that the difference between \u0022aerobrake too much and go down to the surface\u0022 and \u0022aerobrake not enough and go flying off into space\u0022 can literally be only a few hundred meters of altitude.\u00A0 So it\u0027s finicky and will probably take a fair amount of trial-and-error to get right.\u00A0 Also, it means that you need to be able to do orbital rendezvous and/or docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what it boils down to is:\u00A0 Apollo-style is smaller and cheaper but needs more piloting and navigational skill; direct land-and-return is bigger and more expensive, but simpler to do.\u00A0 Pick what works best for you.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022

more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 There are a variety of tools out there to help with this-- my personal favorite is \u003Ca
