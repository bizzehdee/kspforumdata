So anyways, the main thing the PC is going to be used for is gaming. I am not going to spend anywhere over $1000 at the very very max, and would like to stay below $800 if possible.

The Intel build is a tiny bit over $800, while the AMD is under $700. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only major difference between the two is the Intel CPU is better, but because of the cost the GPU isn\u0027t as good. Looking at a benchmark database, (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E=2362\u0026amp;cmp[]=2284\u0022]CPU Data,\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E=51\u0026amp;cmp[]=2697\u0022]GPU Data\u003C/a\u003E) the performance gap between CPUs is much higher than the GPUs. Now, for gaming (besides KSP and some others) the GPU is the most important. However, the CPU upgrade path in the future is practically non-existent on the AMD side of things (they are moving away from desktop APUs, and thus that socket in general), while the Intel side has one more generation left on the current socket. GPUs are much easier to upgrade in the future, as the hardware for them exists on both AMD and Intel boards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in conclusion, I would purchase the Intel build (or a modified version), because the CPU performance \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E is better, and the upgrade path in the future is much better than AMD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as for explaining the Intel build:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECPU: i5-4690k - The go to intel CPU, can\u0027t go wrong here.

The motherboard could be good or decent, but as long as it works it cannot actually be too bad. This processor will not overclock anyway, so if you have all the ports and slots you need you should be good. The processor and the RAM are pretty much as good as it is going to get anyway. If the PSU is actually 350 watt and made by a decent party it should be enough, unless you invest in some crazily powerful card.
