I would prefer to be able to keep the responses to my questions separate though, to avoid confusion with other people.\n\nAnyways, I\u0027ve got a decent PC now and can run the majority of games I play. But I\u0027m interested in a lot of new higher end games and would like to have a PC able to run them. Plus, I would like to get a little bit of PC building experience under my belt anyways. So anyways, the main thing the PC is going to be used for is gaming. I am not going to spend anywhere over $1000 at the very very max, and would like to stay below $800 if possible. Here are the parts I have chosen:\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/djsnowboy267/saved/HvMXsY](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/djsnowboy267/saved/HvMXsY)\n\nI don\u0027t have a hard drive chosen because I am going to use the two hard drives I have now and just transfer. For the most high end games I will be playing, I would have to say Arma 3, Planetside 2, possibly Elite: Dangerous or maybe Star Citizen.\n\nAny recommendations at all are welcomed, as I have never built a PC and only have basic knowledge. Thanks guys!"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:25:52Z","Content":"[http://101science.com/Radio.htm](http://101science.com/Radio.htm) ;p \u003C-Start here!

It features a i5-4690k and a R9 280x. However, I\u0027ve also made a build with an [AMD](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Hackal%C3%B6ken/saved/HVXZxr) CPU, featuring a Athlon 860k (an APU with a broken GPU, better and cheaper than a 5800k, on par with a 7850k) and a R9 290x. The Intel build is a tiny bit over $800, while the AMD is under $700. \n\nThe only major difference between the two is the Intel CPU is better, but because of the cost the GPU isn\u0027t as good. Looking at a benchmark database, ([=2362\u0026cmp\\[\\]=2284\u0022\\]CPU Data,](http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B) [=51\u0026cmp\\[\\]=2697\u0022\\]GPU Data](http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B)) the performance gap between CPUs is much higher than the GPUs. Now, for gaming (besides KSP and some others) the GPU is the most important. However, the CPU upgrade path in the future is practically non-existent on the AMD side of things (they are moving away from desktop APUs, and thus that socket in general), while the Intel side has one more generation left on the current socket. GPUs are much easier to upgrade in the future, as the hardware for them exists on both AMD and Intel boards.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I would purchase the Intel build (or a modified version), because the CPU performance *now* is better, and the upgrade path in the future is much better than AMD.\n\nNow, as for explaining the Intel build:\n\n- CPU: i5-4690k - The go to intel CPU, can\u0027t go wrong here. Only upgrade currently is an i7, but you have no need and they are expensive.\n- Cooler: Hyper 212 EVO - About the same price as the other cooler you selected, but better. Also a go to.\n- Motherboard: ASUS Z97-K/CSM - ASUS is a good brand. This board has the Z97 chipset, which allows good overclocking, and has everything else you will need.\n- RAM: G.Skill NS Series - This RAM doesn\u0027t have a heat spreader, which is a requirement if you are using a Hyper 212, so the RAM fits. It is at a lower speed than the previous RAM, but there is a negligible performance difference.\n- GPU: XFX 280x 3GB: Very similar to the 280, but a bit better. Also more expensive, but worth it I think.\n- Case: Cooler Master Storm Enforcer - The case you picked. No problems with it that I can see.\n- PSU: Corsair CSM 600W - Technically not needed, but the wattage came really close. This is only $5 more than the CSM 430W however, so definetely worth it.\n- Optical Drive: Asus DRW-24B1ST - Also something you picked. An optical drive is an optical drive.\n\nHope that wasn\u0027t too confusing...

It is faster than most AMD processors and still almost as fast as the new Intel top models. For gaming, there is not that much that is better. I seriously doubt you would notice any difference between a 3770 and a newer i5 or i7 and in specific cases the 3770 should actually be faster.\n\nI do not know what motherboard you have, but you might want to consider upgrading rather than building new.

However, this unit had trouble reading not only backup discs but also commercial discs and such that worked fine in any of the LG units (or the Panasonic or Pioneer or Sony units). Random read errors, stalls, poor performance, etc. I bought a random LG unit to replace it (Windohs says it\u0027s a GH24NS90 device), and all the problems went away.\n\nGranted, these things are slowly becoming obsolete (you can even install windohs from a USB stick these days...finally), but you might as well buy one that works."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T18:58:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I considered upgrading, but I have kind of a small case and not a very good power supply.

The motherboard could be good or decent, but as long as it works it cannot actually be too bad. This processor will not overclock anyway, so if you have all the ports and slots you need you should be good. The processor and the RAM are pretty much as good as it is going to get anyway. If the PSU is actually 350 watt and made by a decent party it should be enough, unless you invest in some crazily powerful card. Noise could be another reason to upgrade, but a fairly quick modern GPU combined with that CPU should not require a much larger PSU.\n\nI would add the proper parts that are missing now and be happy, you could assemble a pretty awesome computer with that. Add a SDD, a video card and maybe a new case and I think you are pretty much there, after checking the PSU out. You could think about a CPU cooler, again, to mitigate the noise. Building a PC with these parts will definitely result in better performance than the AMD system you initially posted and since you save money that you can now spend on a better video card, it will also be faster than a new system with an i5.\n\nCan you see any brand or manufacturer on the PSU unit?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had literally half a dozen of \u0027em and used to use them for heavy duty backup/data export purposes with extreme reliability\n\nAre you making backups to CDs or DVDs?

I\u0027m well aware of the limitations of modern optical media in terms of shelf life. The data stored is validated by multiple types of checksums (CRC32, md5sum, sha1sum), plus PAR1/2 data is lavishly provisioned on each and every disc. After a decade (I write the month and year on each disc with a marker), the data is verified, and moved to a new disc (which, to date, has been a reduction in the number of discs as between 2000 and 2005 it was mostly CD-ROM)\\*. The retired discs are retained as added insurance. The most valuable data is also backed up to multiple sets on media from different vendors.\n\n\\* - unless I decide I don\u0027t really care about that data anymore at all, in which case it just moves to the retired discs box."},{"CreatedByName":"Djsnowboy267","CreatedById":34545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T20:05:07Z","Content":"Cracked open the case and had another peek inside to see if I could find anything new... power supply is an AcBel HBA008-ZA1GT 350 Watt power supply.
