One of the most fun parts of KSP is blowing things up right? So, what if there were missions with objectives to \u0022test Part X to failure\u0022? Maybe even under certain circumstances? Like overheat this part, or smash it.\n\nWhich leads into the other part of my idea. Which is, maybe don\u0027t give all the information on components until they have been used in such and such a way? i.e. For a landing strut it says \u0022weight: 0.1, drag: ???, crash tolerance: ???\u0022 Until you actually fly it then it will tell you drag, and smash it and then it tells you crash tolerance.\n\nThis could be really great and add all sorts of information to each parts shown performance data.\n\nCould really make the game feel even more huge than it already does."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:38:36Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nI really like this idea. But there should be an option once starting a new game on whether or not to enable this."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T16:52:40Z","Content":"Squad hates the idea of random failures, but the idea of parts testing allowing this at least makes it voluntary. I agree completely, BTW, rescue missions, or trying to squeak back to Kerbin are some of the most fun things you can do in KSP, IMHO."},{"CreatedByName":"renniSaint","CreatedById":140853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T20:29:32Z","Content":"Yeah, definitely not random failure. That\u0027s no fun. But it would be a fun way to add to add game play and achievements to gather without adding another \u0022number\u0022 like money, science, etc. \n\nOn am unrelated note t-minus 4 minutes on Falcon!!!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T20:33:40Z","Content":"Actually, random would be plenty fun, but squad doesn\u0027t like it, sadly ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
