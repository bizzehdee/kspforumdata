Even a basic reactor will let drills and refineries work through a dark side rotation regardless of how long it is. It also can save a lot of space on what can be an already cluttered station making docking easier and less fraught with accidental decoupling of solar panels and radiator systems. They\u0027re also more fuel efficient than the fuel cells (3-5 years on internal fuel increasing if you throttle the power output a bit) which makes them a boon for long time, constant draw facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T18:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E*Inconspicuously sets up hidden microphones, in hopes of harvesting feedback...*\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222603898\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140624\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464364804\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145279\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cairol\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Cairol said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen have the nuclear reactors advantages over lets say, fuel cells?

If a typical stock solar panel produces 70 to 90 Ec/s per ton invested, a NF fission reactor will go no lower than 140, and the most efficient models exceed 230 Ec/s/ton (radiators included). That means they remain mass competitive with solar power even around Eve, and definitely everywhere further out from that. Fuel cells are 75 Ec/s/ton, and RTGs are ca. 9.3 last I checked, so reactors easily beat all those too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe downside is that they are expensive to research (if you use CTT, as you should!), expensive to buy, use expensive fuel, and, yes, require you to haul some mass and account for them in your ship design. Can\u0027t just give you something this overpowered without making you think about it at least a little bit, now can we \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E So perhaps for Eve, you might still opt for solar power anyways, because it\u0027s cheaper and simpler. But Kerbin and beyond, these are just hands-down the best option you have (barring other mods),\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daeridanii","CreatedById":157101,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T16:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022verdana, geneva, sans-serif\u0022\u003EHonestly, once I get them, they\u0027re practically the only parts I use.
