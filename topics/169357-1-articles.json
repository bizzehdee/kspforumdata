That should drop the temp a bit if there was significant built up. While you have it open, you could clean off the old heat sink grease and\u00A0apply \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAE8P6DF0942\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArctic Silver 5\u003C/a\u003E instead (be careful when applying as it is slightly conductive due to the silver content).

Make sure fans haven\u0027t quit working.

If all else fails on the desktop, you can get a bigger heat sink and higher CFM fans.

That\u0027s a massive improvement from 70\u00BAc plus! Is there any improvement in the length of time before it crashes? If not,\u00A0it might actually be the GPU causing the crashes. Try bringing all your settings down to the minimum settings on graphics and see what happens. If it doesn\u0027t crash, I would incrementally start bumping up the settings until it starts crashing again and then back down a notch. And that would be a wise choice. If you don\u0027t have to be mobile, desktop is ALWAYS the better gaming solution.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
