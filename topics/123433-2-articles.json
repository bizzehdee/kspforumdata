My list of mods is E.V.E. (With Avg\u0027s cloud pack), the Firespitter plugin included with this pack, KJR, KerbinSide, the Sub Pack itself, Ship Effects, and Stock Bugfix modules. When I Hyperedit the sub I built to the water, I get a message on the screen saying \u0022Time Warp Claw Bug, Quicksave and Restart Now!\u0022 (presumably from stock bufix modules), despite not having any non-submarine pack mods on the craft and not using time warp. Next, the ingame log is spammed with a message saying the file MPlog.dat (or something like that) in the PluginData folder cannot be found, and if I try to revert the game the game locks up, the revert menu is broken, and when I opened my ingame log (that still worked, but I couldn\u0027t scroll through it) there were a bunch of Null Reference errors. I tried to put the log in a spoiler here, but due to the sheer amount of spam, it was 850k-900k\u002B characters, and my web browser freaked out and when it finally loaded I couldn\u0027t post because the character limit on the forums is 100k characters.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, the second problem, the MPLog.dat I can fix. I\u0027ll put a patch up in a few minutes. It\u0027s something I\u0027ve known about but didn\u0027t expect that kind of problem. As for the claw error, yes, that\u0027s Claw\u0027s mod.
