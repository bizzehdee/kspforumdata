Sure, each user would create their own custom design, but it would be permutations on themes.

And it allows for a lot more freedom when it comes to flag design and personalization. The only limits are one\u0027s imagination and if there\u0027s an intent to share images of your craft on the forum, since flags that contain forbidden content would not be allowed to be displayed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve designed a lot of flags for forum members since 2013, more than I can remember (I know this because I see the archive files I keep and go, \u0022oh, yeah, I remember doing that one!\u0022).
