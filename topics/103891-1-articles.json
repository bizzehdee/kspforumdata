It\u0027s basically a rocket made out of carbon sheets that make it light, cheap and therefore disposable. I was just wondering if anyone has the modding expertise to recreate it in ksp in the form of a mod. Here\u0027s a link to the website: [http://www.rocketlabusa.com/](http://www.rocketlabusa.com/)\n\nAnd just in case you are wondering why it says USA is because it is being funded by a US company based in NZ. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Yeah, that makes sense."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T22:53:23Z","Content":"Its like a cute little Falcon 9! \u003C3"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T22:55:15Z","Content":"Indeed it is!

Almost definitely the lowest-thrust pump-fed kerosene-fueled rocket engine ever.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T23:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 11:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kibble**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T00:00:06Z","Content":"Yup! The wonders of modern technology. It\u0027s supposed to launch sometime this year, though I\u0027m not sure when. Rocket Labs did do their last launch from Great Mercury Island in NZ. It wasn\u0027t anything special just a sounding rocket or thereabouts.\n\nEDIT - It is supposed to carry less fuel than a 747 and like I mentioned above, it\u0027s light so it does not need a huge amount of thrust.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T00:03:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jumpyyoza**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T00:13:25Z","Content":"Only can take a 110kg payload thats pretty small satellite."},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T04:30:04Z","Content":"Yep, well that\u0027s more than enough to provide the internet so that you can spend more time on the forum or whatever else it is you do on the internet ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T04:33:04Z","Content":"Although you asked for mod, I\u0027m working on a stock one."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T04:57:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep, well that\u0027s more than enough to provide the internet so that you can spend more time on the forum or whatever else it is you do on the internet ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nWell maybe alot of sat can weigh in around 6,168 kg this rocket can only do 110kg what you taking new battery up to replace the old ones lol, Nice looking rocket, 110kg that around 240 Ib where the dragon is 10,450 kg to LEO."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T05:40:39Z","Content":"[https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxwhh77m6osq49b/Electron.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxwhh77m6osq49b/Electron.craft?dl=0)\n\nStock \n\n[![screenshot2288_zpsze8pxgza.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2288_zpsze8pxgza.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot2288_zpsze8pxgza.png.html)\n\n[!\\[screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png\\](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png)\\[/url](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png.html)\n\n![screenshot2299_zps45ulrggg.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2299_zps45ulrggg.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T06:50:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxwhh77m6osq49b/Electron.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxwhh77m6osq49b/Electron.craft?dl=0)\n\u003E Stock \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2288_zpsze8pxgza.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2288_zpsze8pxgza.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png[http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png.html)[\\[/url](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png.html)\n\u003E \n\u003E http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2299_zps45ulrggg.png[http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2299_zps45ulrggg.png](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot2297_zpsme3hbaqs.png.html)\n\n[Cool, thanks Yukon!
