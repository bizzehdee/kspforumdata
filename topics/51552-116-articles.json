After that no direct contact may be established between craft and KSC whatever antenna is installed on the craft since KSC antenna will be out of range. You may solve this in two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Buid a rover with giant antenna and move it just outside the the launchpad or airstrip and set it to connect to active wessel (you will need a probe core on this thing for a relay). I belive Scott Manley use this approach I have seen such a relay in his videos. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. RT2 intended solution progress you comsat network further and further to have full coverage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Simply edit the RemoteTech_Settings.cfg and edit the line Omni = 7.5E\u002B07 to Omni = 40000E\u002B07 this way command center will be able to connect anywhere in the Kerbol system as long as you have proper dish pointed to KSC and there is no obstruction to signal. It will be somewhat unrealistic since there is no omni antenna with such range actually possible. I guess if the mod development will progress, It would be nice to have upgrades with command station in KCS where you can install move powerfull antenna as the game progresses. Since having such short range is also somewhat unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u003C/a\u003E - Please read thise guide it will cover all the information about usage of this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-21T06:38:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2014 06:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ghost13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T06:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERicardo, I believe when you have a dish pointed at the active vessel you must have the corresponding dish pointed to that vessel. If I remember correctly, that target selection is a dish to dish not a cone setting, resulting in a dish pointing to Kerbin not making a connection to that dish. The way to use it you would have the sat set its dish to active vessel, and the active ship pointed at that sat in order to have a connection. To connect by pointing toward Kerbin you would have to be in a SOI which has a dish pointed in that direction, for example pointing a sat dish at Duna, your ship in orbit around Duna with a disk pointed to Kerbin would then have a connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It took me quite a while to figure it out myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghost13","CreatedById":78837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T07:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u003C/a\u003E - Maybe some if this guide shuld be incorporated into the mod as help or something.
