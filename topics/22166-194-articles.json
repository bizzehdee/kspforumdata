Now, not only do I have a working version of Kethane, but now I also know this procedure for future releases of KSP. Plus, I have Kethane\u0027s code to look at and study to try and figure out how to mod things myself. Now I just need to figure out what I want to mod that hasn\u0027t already been modded.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take this the wrong way guys, I mean this with every fluffy thought you can imagine, I really do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t you dare take this procedure, update a mod to a new version of KSP without making actual compatibility changes, and then complain to the mod author that it doesn\u0027t work. This will work *in this specific case* because the code is already updated to take into account the changes introduced by the new game version, Majiir just hasn\u0027t had the opportunity to package up an official build. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll probably even get some more mileage out of this in the future, when new changes don\u0027t introduce big problems (or similar instances of git updated but no build), especially if you want to use it to learn some programming. But please, please, please remember that if you do this and it doesn\u0027t work, it is not the mod author\u0027s problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T21:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by enneract\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
