Changing engines is the precise opposite of \u0022optimization\u0022 and *especially* \u0022bug fixing.\u0022 The point of doing optimization and bug fixing is that you make minor changes to code. You don\u0027t do big things; you only change things if you absolutely have to. Switching engines creates new bugs. It\u0027s changing the code from something where the team has a pretty good sense how things work and what to do, and has incorporated all sorts of tweaks to fix issues, into an incompatible physics engine and a new game engine. It\u0027s not a simple task. If it were, this would be Unity 4.4 (I think). Likewise, the kind of optimization you do late in the release cycle is as unobtrusive as possible; big changes have heavy bug potential.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s entirely possible that, had this come out six months ago, Squad would have changed over. Had it come out in December, Squad might have considered investing some dev time into seeing how it works, and trying to hack a port together to see how it runs (and see if it\u0027s a bugsplosion, a won\u0027t-compile-splosion, or runs decently well). But it came out in March, well into the final push for release. At that point, no matter what Squad had said about U5 a year ago, it\u0027d be *insane* to go all-in on U5. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if they tried compiling against U5, but if there were *any* serious issues, you\u0027d be crazy to put off your 1.0 to change the game engine when you\u0027re nearing release (keep in mind, Squad also had and has a much better idea of the status of KSP\u0027s development than forumers; I suspect they knew they were nearing experimentals).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they had made the engine more effecient, then who cares if it is called optimization or not?? They have not even done anything serious when it comes to optimization anyways, so going to a new engine wont hurt anything and can only IMPROVE it. Just because they are porting the game over, they dont have to release it until it has been tested and properly bug fixed. And just because it is a new version number of unity, does not mean it will be insanely difficult to port over. KSP was not so long ago running in unity 3 and the task of porting it over to version 4 was according to the devs for most part a very smooth process. Unity 5 has also been designed with ease of upgrading in mind, so that the process is as painless as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for your information it was squad themselves that stated that Unity 5 was such a high priority that they would immediatly start working on it as soon as they got access and would even halt development of other features temporarily so that they could spend every resource on porting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was also squad that decided to suddenly out of nowhere push for 1.0, even though it was said it would remain in beta for quite some time. No one forced them to do this and it is in fact a bad idea to do so until the damn game is both polished and finished, which includes unity 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wonder why you people just assume that it is virtually impossible to port to unity 5, when everyone who has experience with it states the opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there might be a few bugs here and there and some changes in code, but end result would lead to a better game in literally every way and will even make future development easier since unity 5 takes care of quite a few bugs, issues and performance problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T17:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beduino\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beduino\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Unity 5.0 physics could be expected to work up to 2x faster than in previous versions\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould vs should. The numbers I\u0027ve seen indicate a worst case speedup in the 10-20% range, and unless U5 lets Squad run multiple PhysX threads per craft, we\u0027ll probably see something close to that worst case for KSP when you\u0027re only dealing with a single craft. Docking two craft of similar complexity will be quite a bit nicer since we should be able to run each craft in a separate thread, coming close to doubling the FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think people are getting overly wound up over the issue. 1.0 has gone to experimentals, so there\u0027s almost no chance of it getting ported to U5. The devs have stated that they\u0027ll be evaluating a switch to U5 soon after 1.0 gets out the door, so a U5-based 1.1 is quite possible (or possibly 1.0.X, though I suspect those versions, if they exist, will be strictly for bug fixes). At this point we\u0027re basically debating which version of KSP should be called 1.0 and questioning whether Squad\u0027s evaluation of U5 will be adequate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying that U5 won\u0027t be an improvement over U4 for KSP, and I definitely look forward to seeing KSP moved over to U5.

They then explained that even though it will be multicore and will increase performance with large part counts we should not expect double the performance from lets say dual core systems. Also talked about how they were excited about the improved physics engine as well and that this would most likely also improve performance as well as the improved graphical capabilities which could allow them to at a later date make the game prettier by using the GPU which was more or less underutilized right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen they finally talked about how that it was such high priority that they would focus most of their resources on the port and even halt other development once unity 5 is released until that work has been done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was of course not a promise since they usually end such announcements with a disclaimer saying that things can change further down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe order might be a bit out of order but this is roughly what was said during that squad cast and they seemed really excited and optimistic about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it really shows that Squad themselves understood that Unity 5 is important for this game and that it would be better to port it sooner than later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the recent change and push towards 1.0 I fear this port will never happen...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T02:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boxman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boxman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith the recent change and push towards 1.0 I fear this port will never happen...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t.
