We\u0027ve all seen the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nasa-warp-drive-007.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimage \u003C/a\u003Eof a hypothetical warp drive equipped spacecraft. Probably total science fantasy, but it sure looks pretty. Seeing that image, I immediately began to wonder : let\u0027s suppose you \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Ebuild a spacecraft that vaguely resembles the rendering, with a working FTL warp drive, but other than the warp engine, you did not have any technology we cannot reasonably extrapolate from known principles and physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this discussion is not about the warp engine. Let\u0027s just pretend it works, and suppose that you could travel 10s of light years in a matter of months. So you are out exploring, and you encounter a planet similar to the Earth in that it has a similar atmosphere composition, at least half the surface is water, and it has a surface gravity of 10 m/s^2. How convenient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are quite excited to land on that planet with a landing party and meet the alien \u0026lt;strike\u0026gt;women\u0026lt;/strike\u0026gt; organisms up close and personal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, the wizards back at NASA have loaded up your starship with a vehicle capable of, at a minimum :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Taking off and landing from an earth like planet (in atmosphere, gravity, and element mix) without help from the ground with \u003Cstrong\u003Ehumans onboard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. For an even harder challenge, it\u0027s an SSTO that must make orbit with no missing parts except fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would the form of the vehicle even look like to pass a napkin test? This is, to me, a fascinating challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where I\u0027m at so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicle starts with a similar lifting body design to the space shuttle and various space-planes, but it has to be even larger than the space shuttle orbiter. It has a massive reactor in the back, similar to the one used by Project Pluto, but it\u0027s dual mode, capable of working to superheat both atmospheric gas and stored onboard hydrogen for thrust. There\u0027s a crew capsule in the very nose, protected by a shadow shield. (this is the main reason it has to be large : the larger it gets, the relative mass penalty for shielding against radiation from the reactor becomes smaller)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s 7 main phases of flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Reentry - Vehicle uses similar mechanism to previous spaceplanes. Though it\u0027s quite rear-heavy from the reactor and it has mostly empty fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Soft Landing - Once it reaches cooler altitudes, damper doors over 2 turbine air intakes at the front of the vehicle are slid open. These are turbines powered by the reactor (via a hot-air power take-off turbine in the back and a long driveshaft) and they compress incident air and feed it to the reactor in the back. With sufficient power, you land this vehicle onto a calm patch of the ocean\u0027s surface on hydrofoil skis that deploy from the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Take off. After a stay on the ground, you have to start from 0 m/s to even get enough speed to get off the water. Good thing you have compressor turbines that can compress outside air to feed to the engine. You don\u0027t need a TWR of \u0026gt;1 to take off like a seaplane, maybe 0.3-0.4 or so will do it. (not certain how much skis reduce drag compared to tires on a runway). \u003Cem\u003E The moment you depart the water surface, you jettison the modules containing the skis and any floats.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Fueling. Once already in the air on nuclear thrust, you fly around for hours to days to fill your onboard fuel tanks. On an earth like planet, you do this by collecting water from the atmosphere with condenser coils, electrolyzing it for the hydrogen, then filling your onboard tanks with liquid hydrogen. \u003Cem\u003EOnce you have full tanks, you jettison the modules containing the electrolysis equipment. \u003C/em\u003EYou might have done this stage before takeoff if the atmospheric concentration of water is low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Transition to ramjet flight. Faster and faster you go. Once you are going fast enough, you\u003Cem\u003E jettison the modules containing your main wings and the compressor turbines and all the equipment needed to drive them. \u003C/em\u003E The craft is now only flying due to nuclear ramjet thrust and the main fuselage, sans wings, is enough of a lifting body to stay in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Transition to scramjet flight. \u003Cem\u003EYou shed part of your ramjet air intake\u003C/em\u003E...at high speeds...leaving only a smaller intake for scramjet air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. To space. From extremely high altitude, and up to half orbital velocity, it\u0027s time to go to space today. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re going at 1/3 orbital velocity already, and your nuclear engine gives 1000 ISP when configured for hydrogen. So your scramjet is already going 2.6 km/second, and you need 6 km/second, even, plus a little margin. Half the mass of your remaining craft has to be fuel, stored as liquid hydrogen which is not very dense, and you\u0027ve still got your crew compartment, radiation shield, and monster nuclear engine. If you had several modules to the nuclear engine, you could make this more efficient by dumping the extra modules later in the burn once you have shed enough weight in propellant. For bonus points, these modules would be optimized for handling atmospheric air, while the core would be designed with channels for liquid hydrogen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Waiting in orbit. You need enough stuff working to wait in orbit. Your monster nuclear engine is still incredibly hot and dangerous, producing 1/3 of the many gigawatts of power it had to produce right up to engine cut off. Realistically you\u0027re gonna have to dump it, you don\u0027t have the mass budget for radiators to keep it cool once you\u0027re out of propellant. So you jettison the entire propulsion section, leaving just the crew capsule and enough batteries and life support on board to stay alive until the mothership picks you up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, this design barely seems plausible on a napkin. Even if you posit incredible engineering talent, better than anyone who has ever lived, to develop this vehicle, I don\u0027t know if it could ever actually work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we\u0027re gonna land and take off with an intact vehicle we can use for another shuttle run, this isn\u0027t gonna work. What design \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Ework? Once we send down the red-shirts to make sure it\u0027s safe, the captain is going to want to join them in the interspecies exchange with the alien women. So the shuttle needs to be able to ascend to orbit and pick him up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T17:19:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EzinX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, an SSTO trumps a starship, huh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, an SSTO trumps a starship, huh?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming the starship is powered by pixie dust that ceases being magical when you get near a planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see your point, though.

Let\u0027s assume the structural mass is 5% of the fueled mass - this is comparable to a F9R first stage, and it uses kerosene fuel (high density \u002B non-cryogenic = good tank mass fractions) and the highest TWR liquid-fueled engines ever flown, so this is VERY optimistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: (payload mass \u002B fueled mass) / (payload mass \u002B 0.05 * fueled mass) = 8.60.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epayload mass \u002B fueled mass = 8.60 * payload mass \u002B 0.430 * fueled mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.60 * payload mass = 0.570 * fueled mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efueled mass = 13.33 * payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elaunch mass = 14.33 * payload mass, or 1433 tons for a 100 ton payload. This is much lighter than a Saturn V, but we used an unrealistic mass fraction for our rocket: it\u0027s more realistic to assume dry mass is around 10% of fueled mass for a cryogenic stage. This gives us a launch mass of about 5400 tons, which is close to double a fully fueled Saturn V (and the Saturn\u0027s payload is a bit more than 100 tons actually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, now let\u0027s switch out our hydrolox engines for a solid-core NTR with an isp of 900 s, and keep the mass fraction the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith our higher isp, we get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(payload mass \u002B fueled mass) / (payload mass \u002B 0.10 * fueled mass) = 2.93.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur launch mass ends up being \u003Cstrong\u003E373\u003C/strong\u003E tons for a 100 ton payload. Holy mackerel! Doubling our specific impulse didn\u0027t half our launch mass, it cut it by more than ten times! Unfortunately, our actual mass ratio won\u0027t be that high, since (a) nuclear engines and their associated shielding are heavy (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the vehicle needs to survive reentry for safety reasons, and \u00A9 again for safety reasons we\u0027ll want fairly high structural safety margins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s look at a rocket with a dV of 19,000 m/s (enough to make a propulsive landing on an Earthlike planet with no atmosphere and launch back into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith hydrolox engines, our launch mass must be e^(19000 / 9.81 / 450) = 74 * (dry mass of rocket \u002B payload mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops. Even the lightest rocket stage we\u0027ve ever built, launched with no payload at all, is still three times too heavy.

Or, better yet, we could use some type of fusion reactor. For that matter, less than a gram of the antimatter used for the mothership will provide plenty of energy to reach orbit provided we can find some way of using it to make a jet or rocket engine usable in atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if we\u0027re exploring the stars with a ship like this, it\u0027s reasonable to assume we\u0027re looking for potential colonization sites. If a planet has so little atmosphere that we can\u0027t aerobrake or run a nuclear-thermal jet engine (Mar\u0027s atmosphere makes both difficult but possible), then just leave and find another target, and send a small robotic lander to do some basic measurements on the feasibility of terraforming the place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T21:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EzinX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EzinX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe you built the descent vehicle after you already arrived, or sent a probe earlier.

The first landing, you\u0027ve got 10% or so (don\u0027t know the exact amount but it\u0027s a small fraction of the max fuel load) full tanks, and your vehicle is loaded down with cargo for doing ISRU, setting up the base camp, etc. Even though your vehicle is moderately heavy for it\u0027s size, you deploy parachutes (that\u0027s how you get heat shield separation) and you do a propulsive landing to go from your terminal velocity (couple hundred m/s maybe) to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou fill up to completely full tanks on the ground, and leave absolutely everything behind.

Heat shield plates would be thin plates of some kind of wonder ceramic-carbon-composite whatsit that can tolerate the heat. And, you only drop the plate protecting your engines in flight. The plates protecting your fuel tanks you would drop before launching again. (you\u0027d use em to make shacks to live in or something on the ground).

That\u0027s why you gain net fuel this way, because the engine sustains your speed during the hypersonic flight, and it does the burns to put you back into orbit at a very high ISP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m wondering what other options there are to get the needed performance. Perhaps ablative laser propulsion? (the mothership would carry a very large laser onboard). It would vaporize a chunk off the lander vehicle to give it net thrust with an ISP of better than 2000. (and high thrust as well). And ablative laser propulsion propellant is solid blocks of homogeneous material - you could probably make it from a large variety of possible elements found on other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems include the fact that your laser mirror has to be gigantic to get a decent spot size. If the mothership is in geosync, it has to focus precisely on specific spots on your ascent vehicle from 35k meters away, at the correct angle...probably be easier to set up a mirror on the ground that acts as a relay and beam combiner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T21:11:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EzinX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re talking about crazy magical propulsion methods, yet you insist on jettisonning parts that quite easy to reuse even with current technology: heat shields, landing legs, and molten reactor cores.
