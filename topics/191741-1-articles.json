Which means that all you have to do is strap a bunch of these to the sidewalls of a spaceship and it can lift into the air. You could stick some to the front and it could fly forwards, put some devices on the back hull etc. Unlike the hovering ships in scifi media, this one will have quite the air gust beneath it, so you would not want to be stand just below it for fear you would be blown aside. You could ascend until the air thins out, but after that you are back to nuclear fission/propellant, methalox, or LH/LOX rocketry or nuclear\u00A0pusher plate. Pick one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommerce: Maybe alchemy becomes easier. Suddenly we can make new elements and states of common elements\u00A0at a whim. Metallic hydrogen too, although I have a feeling you would need the mother of all anvils compressing it to keep it from exploding violently. One could even make new forms of clothing that have never been seen before. Same goes for many electronic devices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistant heating: One could put a device in a room and cook a hamburger patty 20 feet away. Simply by extending the field to encompass the beef and then by moving the atoms or subatomic particles\u00A0inside the beef fast enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFission/fusion: Please, please tell me the device could not be abused by creating nuclear fission or fusion with hamburger. I have a feeling I won\u0027t like the answer though. At any rate if so, uranium would no longer be special. Instead every power on Earth would be tripping over themselves to get a hold of the device or it\u0027s blueprints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMedical: I am sure this will have many medical applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuclear Fusion: Why not? You would not have to worry about keeping the self sustaining fusion reaction compressed anymore. So long device is working the fusion will continue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiators in space: Not sure how or if the device could improve radiator fins. I do know that heat makes atoms move around more, so with the device you could swap heat around the ship more efficiently, but you\u0027re still not getting rid of it any faster unless your radiators cover a sufficient area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could we not do: Sorry but warp drive is likely still out of reach since it requires exotic matter (negative matter) which may not exist IRL. Not sure if we can make antimatter with the device, but if so, the first nation that gets it will have the potential to be a superduper powet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I can think of, you can add to this or clarify matters as you wish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-18T01:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if it could freeze atoms to be perfectly still, no thermal vibrations at all?\u00A0In other words, hold them at absolute zero.
