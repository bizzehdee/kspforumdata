We like to differentiate certain content based on the medium: Squadcast is on KSPTV because it\u0027s a livestream, in depth dev blogs about features are on the forums, a lot of community highlighting happens on Facebook and Twitter, and so on. Even regardless of where we post things, they\u0027ll end up here sooner rather than later: Squadcast summaries, people posting our Tweets... that\u0027s great to see too!
