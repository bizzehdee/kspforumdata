Sometimes I get 20 meters away from the target, next time it\u0027s 5 km!.\n\nSo I\u0027d like to know if there is a good procedure for surface rendezvous.

I used to use suicide drops to keep the approach lined-up and more predictable, but that comes at the expense of DV to land softly. Learning to transition from a suicide drop to a more gradual descent is when I got good at \u0022sticking a landing\u0022 on-target. So yes, practice makes perfect -- but if you can spare the DV, a suicide drop might be your ticket.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI also forgot to mention that while it\u0027s no good for last minute adjustments (unless you\u0027re talking sub-5-ton crafts), using RCS to guide your descent is totally legit, especially if you\u0027re up high, but drifting off-course.

Less than .1 m/s high up can be a difference of hundreds of km.\n\nIf the body has no atmosphere, the trajectories mod can show you trajectory WRT surface in body fixed mode. Simply set a sub-orbital path that overshoots the target.\n\nIf the body has atmosphere, trajectories tries to simulate drag.

(If your surface TWR is \u003C1.4, start your burn a little earlier.)\n\n5) Destroy the node by clicking the red X to the right of the navball.\n\n6) Keep burning retrograde, and gradually pitch up to keep your vertical velocity near 0m/s. The lower your TWR the more you have to pitch.\n\n7) Push your retrograde marker onto the anti-target marker continually, and a little bit toward the horizon if you want to keep from crashing into the surface. The retrograde marker can be pushed with thrust on its far-side.\n\nUse quicksave and load to practice. It takes some practice to perfect this. Use the Velocity^2/Acceleration\\*2 formula to determine if you need to decrease thrust, it isn\u0027t necessary to pause and use this formula to get nearby, but it is very helpful in order not to use too much fuel.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/q06l1CUlIfY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe video is a demonstration and a slightly less than perfect vertical surface docking.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T22:24:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SanderB**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:31:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The video is a demonstration and a slightly less than perfect vertical surface docking.\n\nI\u0027m getting this video is private?\n\nEDIT: working now\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T00:11:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:48:24Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/q06l1CUlIfY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n, it should be visible.
