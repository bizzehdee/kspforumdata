With a powerful zoom lens you can see small details far away. That\u0027s resolution, but if it is dark you may have trouble seing anything. You could try cranking up ISO (gain) but at some point you are just introducing more noise. It\u0027s too dark for a good picture. Opening up the iris will let in more light and give you a better picture, but if you\u0027ve already reached the largest aperture, you\u0027re kind of stuck. Your options are either to buy a new camera that has better low light performance (with radio telescopes this won\u0027t work since they are already cutting edge and there is littke room for improvement there) or you can use a bigger lens to catch more light (more surface area for radio signal gathering).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the distance between antennas helps us see small things (resolution), while total collecting are helps us see the dark, faint objects (sensitivity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain sniped by Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
