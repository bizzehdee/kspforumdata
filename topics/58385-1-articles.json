A friend and I had a discussion recently: I was suggesting a part that would serve as a variable/switchable aerobrake: Basically a solid body out of which would swing a group of \u0022wings\u0022, each with the flat side facing forward to maximise drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter kicking the idea around for a few minutes we decided that, *if* the drag model was updated to take proper account of angle of incidence, then really all that needs to be added is a very sturdy general purpose hinge, with a short but solid arm to attach more parts onto. You could then position as many hinges as you liked around your ship, and attach any, uh, \u0022negatively aerodynamic\u0022 parts onto them that seemed appropriate to build the aerobrake... Or you could use the same part to built a crane arm, etc. (Main problem being how to control multiple hinges if you didn\u0027t want them all just to open and close together.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that the same \u0022basic hinge\u0022 and \u0022arm\u0022 ideas are cropping up in this thread...
