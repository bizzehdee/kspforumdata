Because it was exactly as straightforward as I expected, I present JSeebeckUtils.\n\nIMPORTANT FEATURES:\n\nAs the name implies, approximates the [Seebeck Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect#Seebeck_effect)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwill generate ElectricCharge proportional to the greatest temperature gradient local to the part.\n\nCan be assigned to any part (including struts)!\n\n**IS IN BETA**: Balance is very much questionable at this point; feedback from play-testing is required.\n\nConsider using this alongside Nertea\u0027s (alpha/beta) HeatControl Mod: [read more here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51395-WIP-Nert-s-Models-Current-NFElectrical-HeatControl-testing?p=1884792\u0026viewfull=1#post1884792).\n\nYou might also be interested in coupling this with [JDiminishinRTG](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115938).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just launched, sitting on the pad...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot0_zpsb0p8pw25.png](http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z216/prime1010/JSeebeckUtils/screenshot0_zpsb0p8pw25.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Built up some heat!

Parts launch at equal temperature, so power generation at launch will start at zero.\n\nFor modders or super-users:\n\n \\* Just add ModuleSeebeck to any relevant part.\n\nCHANGELOG\n\n    *** 2 May 2015 (v0.9)    * Beta release (for KSP v1.0.2)    * General-purpose PartModule    * Provided sample configs for Squad parts    * Provided ModuleManager configuration for JDiminishingRTG\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T21:45:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KwirkyJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:32:51Z","Content":"Think something like this would only work on large parts that have one side in the sunlight and one side dark and then on the darks side of a planet there wouldn\u0027t be any heat."},{"CreatedByName":"KwirkyJ","CreatedById":62790,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:43:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Think something like this would only work on large parts that have one side in the sunlight and one side dark and then on the darks side of a planet there wouldn\u0027t be any heat.\n\nDue to the nature of the system, it is not a gradient on a single part; rather, it is the gradient between parts. A single-part vessel will, unfortunately, always generate zero power with this implementation. Unfortunately, calculating heat flux across a single part in isolation is a bit beyond what I intended to model\n\nSomewhat by design, it is intended for use with other mods that generate heat (JDiminishingRTG, for example, or perhaps NearFuture Electrical or KSPI-extended) or, in stock, heat-generating parts such as LV-Ns or drills. By supporting compound parts such as struts, one can get some significant gradients indeed.\n\n...Will see what comes of it, anyway, and thanks for the consideration."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:49:23Z","Content":"I\u0027m all for new things to try ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:39:57Z","Content":"I love it!
