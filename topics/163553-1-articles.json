When minimum temperatures are reached, the parts wouldn\u0027t explode or anything. They would merely stop functioning. However, based on a setting in the difficulty options, if a command module or spacesuit reached minimum temperatures, the kerbals could be at risk of freezing to death. Different kerbals would have different time limits for staying below minimum temperature, basically like gee tolerance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else that should be added would be parts specifically meant for heating the spacecraft. Drills, converters, fuel cells, RTGs\u00A0and active engines would passively generate heat. Liquid fuel tanks and idle liquid fuel engines would have an incredibly low minimum temperature. Landing legs and airbrakes, as well as xenon tanks and ion engines would have a fairly low minimum temperature. Wings (whose aerodynamics would simply not work quite right when too cold), command modules and passenger modules would have a medium minimum temperature. Probes, batteries, solar cells and reaction wheels would have a high minimum temperatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, surface temperatures. Planets would all have ground temperatures, including the ones without atmospheres. However, part temperatures would be affected by the ground much more slowly than by the atmosphere. Therefore, you could probably last on Eeloo or Minmus for days without a heating system. You wouldn\u0027t have to worry too much about Jool\u0027s moons, as they are heated by tidal forces. With Duna you would probably want a heating system, seeing as it has an atmosphere. Also, unlike atmospheric temperature, surface temperature would change depending on whether it was day or night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness2","CreatedById":158940,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-24T09:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface temperature should transfer heat much more quickly than atmospheric temperature, but only to the parts in direct contact with it.

All structural components, landing legs, struts, wings and lifting surfaces, docking ports, and panels should operate just fine no matter how cold they get. Fuel might be an interesting thing to have fail when it gets too cold, or it could have difficulty burning. Maybe some functions would happen slowly while the ship is cold. Getting any crew module\u0027s core temperature too low could kill any kerbals inside, though the kerbals would generate some heat and all parts with crew or passenger capacity would have internal heating which would draw electric charge to keep warm. That way you mostly could ignore heating, but in the event your power fails, it is possible for your kerbal crew to die from the cold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotskerb","CreatedById":145907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-25T05:26:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223129548\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221500888278\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158940\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, thereaverofdarkness2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour spacecraft could get very cold when flying in space a long ways away from the sun or in the shadow of a planet, unless something on the inside were generating heat.

Chemical batteries would burst or rapidly discharge, and\u00A0propellant tanks more violently so. Structural parts could be unaffected, or they could fail (frozen struts become brittle and crack, overtemp I-beams melt and shed their connected parts). \u00A0Aerodynamic parts would be subject to the same constraints as structural parts, after all a wing is basically a plate with a convenient shape.\u00A0\u00A0Moving parts would have to be inoperable in extreme cold, if solely due to thermal expansion or contraction causing joints to seize (unless they\u0027re made of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInvar\u003C/a\u003E or some other special alloy).
