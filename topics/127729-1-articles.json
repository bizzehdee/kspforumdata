It reduced what I need from 1068m/s to 981 (initial boost) plus 4 m/s of course corrections. The course corrections make an exact number difficult because you need more of them when using Mun but it is hard to get a repeatable number. Here is the album showing that flight.

In the mission below I used 5 flybys of the Mun to reduce the dV needed to get from LKO to a Duna encounter to 878m/s.
