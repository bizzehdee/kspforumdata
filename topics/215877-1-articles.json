When i attach a craft to the anchor with the chop-o-tron jr, i can\u0027t anymore use anything on the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to build a base for mining on mune but it slide on the ground so i try to use the ground anchor to resolve this but when i\u0027m attach to it, i can\u0027t turn on the drills, the lights and anything else. All the buttons are blocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have engineers on the craft. I install the anchor in EVA. I try the parking brake mod to, but it still slide a little and everytime i go back to the base i have to enable it again and again, so with the time the base slides a lot and get destoyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone have an explanation for the ground anchor, or a other solution to stop micro slides it will saves me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
