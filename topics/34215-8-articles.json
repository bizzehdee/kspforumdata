That persistence file is a huge mess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome on, guys. How hard is it to deorbit your stuff - or, at least, if you aren\u0027t going to deorbit it, terminate it from the tracking station! There are freakin\u0027 46 pieces of debris in orbit, and I don\u0027t even know how you strung the stuff out for a quarter orbit all along the same trajectory. 46 pieces in orbit? I never had that many, even when I was a noob; I learned to deorbit stuff long before I had forty six pieces of it floating around. Geesh. Even if your mission requires you to dump debris without using the fuel to deorbit it, at least have the courtesy to terminate the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only that, there\u0027s junk all over the Mun. It looks like there was a crash, which, nevertheless, four or five \u0022Jetension\u0022 probes survived, so the save thinks there are nine flights ongoing, which destroys framerates for guys with less heavy-duty computers. Apparently there\u0027s a Mun base ongoing, even though no-one discussed that here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, both stations are overbudget on parts. I don\u0027t know how many modules are on the fuel depot, but it\u0027s at 92 parts already (which makes me think it\u0027s three modules). The science station, which I know only has three modules, has 107 parts - that\u0027s 17 parts over budget between the two other flights, because I made darn sure my module had exactly thirty parts. Seriously? 30 parts is the hardline, guys - you\u0027re supposed to shoot for 25, but you get 30 in case you absolutely need one more part for something. I agonized over my core, thinking about what I could take out to pare it down to 30, and I did everything I could do to eliminate extra parts. Apparently, I needn\u0027t have bothered, because no one else has seemed to follow that rule. And if one of the guys on the science station did, then the other one absolutely failed and included 47 parts (at \u003Cem\u003Eminimum\u003C/em\u003E) which is well over half again as many parts as are allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome on.

I\u0027ll take part of the blame myself, I should\u0027ve made a concise list of all the rules before we started building, so everyone had an idea of what\u0027s what. In fact, I\u0027ll be doing that here (as well as adding these to my first post)! These are things we\u0027ve all agreed on throughout the thread, so hopefully there\u0027s no confusion. It\u0027s understandable if someone missed a rule when it was being discussed, so we\u0027ll have this list for reference. Anything else you guys would like to see added, lemme know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKCBP Rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The limit of 25 parts per module, this is perhaps the most important with so many people involved. We need to keep the parts count as low as possible, since we all know how bad the lag can get, especially for those with not so beefy PCs. There is a leeway of 5 parts, in case of an emergency and you absolutely need to add a few extra pieces. Keep in mind this still means you should aim for 25 parts, not 30. We\u0027re currently over-budget on both stations, so we have to keep a close eye on this for future modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No docking dead-end modules. If you take up a docking port, there should be at least one additional docking port on your module of the same size. Station-to-station ports should be Senior-sized. Should be pretty obvious why this rule is in place, we don\u0027t want to block off the expansion. In the same vein, try to attach your modules to a port that makes sense. We\u0027ll probably have to rearrange some modules around anyways, but as long as there\u0027s plenty of docking ports available it won\u0027t be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Debris - don\u0027t leave it behind! More specifically, when you launch your module, have a way of deorbiting any debris. Still, it\u0027s not a problem if you\u0027re unable to deorbit, as long as you ensure that you terminate its flight before posting the save file. We wouldn\u0027t want a random piece of rocket to crash into our awesome builds, after all. Keep those orbits clear!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Mods - they are sort of allowed, just not on the final module. It\u0027s no problem if you use mods for the launch, as long as whatever you leave behind on the station is built solely from stock parts. This also ties in to the rule above about debris, since we don\u0027t want modded parts floating around in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The builds and the order of uploading - please stick with what\u0027s been assigned. I don\u0027t want to be a jerk about it, but we\u0027ve got so many people involved in the project that we absolutely need everyone to follow this rule. The order might change depending on the situation, but the builds we\u0027re currently working on should be our focus. The project will eventually have stations and ground bases all over the system, so let\u0027s take it one step at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The recording - your video should be of good audio and visual quality, though that\u0027s a given. Let\u0027s put a time requirement on it, too, say between 10-30 mins. Most importantly, please talk a bit about the project and your module\u0027s intended purpose. Cinematic videos and such are totally cool as well, just make sure to leave a little tidbit at the end with the previously mentioned info. This is just to keep things a bit more coherent than it currently is, it might be a little hard to keep track of what\u0027s going on to someone unfamiliar with the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Please post your submission in the other thread. I don\u0027t mind if it gets posted here as well, I just want to make sure that the other thread gets the attention it needs. Since it\u0027s in the Live from Mission Control sub-forum, it only makes sense that the actual videos get posted there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I got all the important things?

Since .21 i\u0027ve been having the feeling its a bit laggy in the actual space centre. But right now the problem was in the VAB: launch button did nothing except gray out all buttons exept \u0027exit from VAB\u0027, and once i exited and came back my load craft button didn\u0027t work either. Hoping to get the module up this week, although there might not be narration on my video yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my current design. Layout of the tanks is subject to change, depending on how well this actually gets to space, but the docking ports will generally stay where they are. The floating probe cores, RCS tanks and thrusters will be decoupled once the module is attached to the station, they\u0027re just for docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tGVUYbG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tGVUYbG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoping to get this in space in the next few days, after that i\u0027ll just have to refuel the tanks and ill be done :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-17T08:24:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2013 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spyritdragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T09:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPress alt\u002BF2.
