I havn;t noticed this glitch wiht other combinations just the TD-12 to the FL-T400. I have noticed other parts clipping the decouplers when attached but since they don;t Z-fight it\u0027s very ignorable. The 400 though is flickering like a strobelight. Will this be fixed in 1.4.1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
