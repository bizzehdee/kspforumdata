That puts you in the ballpark. Then you divide by the efficiency (about 60% for VASIMR, I think) and that gives you the proper power. The thrust and Isp numbers are often fudged, though, since VASIMR means VARIABLE SPECIFIC IMPULSE Magnetoplasma Rocket. So you have a peak Isp (with low thrust) and a peak thrust (with low Isp). Usually they will quote both at the peak values to make the thing sound better. The efficiency is also a function of the mode that the engine is operating in, so there is a lot of variation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually, the power requirement is the best place to start. Take the power requirement, multiply by the efficiency and divide by 9.81 m/s/s, then divide by peak thrust to get Isp at peak thrust, or divide by peak Isp to get thrust at peak Isp. These will give you your two modes of operation (assuming equal efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another problem with VASIMR, though that they haven\u0027t completely nailed down: the plasma may not detach from the magnetic field of the rocket, causing it to loop around and hit the spacecraft. It\u0027s not really dangerous, I don\u0027t think, but it does cost you thrust. That means that the efficiency that is quoted is likely an overestimate. This effect is not easy to pin down, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the OP, we have an example of a 6000 s Isp, 4 N thrust engine. If we do the math with 60% efficiency, we see that the power requirement for that would be 400 kW. That\u0027s twice as much as the VASIMR they are planning to fly on the space station in 2015. Solar panel power production mass is quoted (by the VASIMR people) as between 2 and 7 kg/kW. That means we\u0027re looking at ~2 tons of (high tech, never before flown) solar arrays, plus heat rejection systems (radiators), plus the VASIMR itself, plus tankage. If we fly that vehicle with no payload, we are looking at a burnout acceleration (acceleration on the last drop of fuel) of about 3.6 m/s per HOUR (give or take a factor of two). or about 0.001 g. That means if we had a vehicle accelerating at that rate from LEO starting today, it would take it until between July and October to escape the Earth\u0027s gravity and build up speed for an interplanetary transfer (delta-v requirement for these low thrust, spiral escapes is much higher, like 10-20 km/s, than for impulsive burns in LEO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe really need some better power options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T08:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Horn Brain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Horn Brain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe really need some better power options.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose that\u0027s precisely why gutza1 asked about the prospect of using nuclear power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is then - can you build a 400 kW fission reactor weighing less than the ~2 tons the solars would weigh?
