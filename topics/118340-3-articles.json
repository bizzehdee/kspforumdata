This is simply an object pack for KerbalKonstructs, which does all the heavy lifting when it comes to placing objects. Even if these guys only make a single cfg (whether it be for RSS or stock) there is nothing stopping you from placing these objects and launch sites anywhere you want on Kerbin, Earth, or any planet accompanying them, with KerbalKonstructs and making your own cfgs.\n\nAnother edit: If you want a \u0022beta\u0022 you can grab my missile row towers and KSC VAB [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cxk47mvaa6982ik/BaconKSC2.rar?dl=0)\n\nYou will however have to learn how to use KK\u0027s in-game GUI to place the objects yourself (unless you happen to be using 0.90 RSS) because the planet names have changed compared to the ones in the cfg\u0027s (and I\u0027ve been too lazy to update that link), but you should only have to do this once, save the cfgs, and they will be there for you to use every game start afterwards.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T23:35:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris P.
