But what would be cool is if you could stop by one of them and recharge your vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s say there\u0027s one of those solar panels or RTGs nearby and your rover is running out of juice. You drive to one of them (let\u0027s say it has to be 20m radius) and then \u0022Recharge\u0022 option shows on one of the batteries\u0027 tweakable panels. You click on that and the battery starts recharging. You could basically \u0027Martian\u0027 your way back to the base/whatever if recharging your rover wasn\u0027t an option because your solar panels broke or you never had them in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-29T10:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2019 10:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Wjolcz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chryssalid 8492","CreatedById":197332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-29T11:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wholeheartedly support this idea because having to push your rover 2 kilometers uphill back to the transport because the solar panels broke after a rollover is quite vexing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
