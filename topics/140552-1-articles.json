However, this is not with every ship, just most of them. And - as far as I can tell - always on a more complex ship with more parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happened in 1.1.1, and is now happening in 1.1.2. I updated all mods to current releases.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running a heavily modded save. My\u00A0assumption, based on the fact that it\u0027s not all ships - is that this must be due to an issue with one of my modded parts. And it must be one that I use often, given how many ships are affected.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s difficult to work out. Because to test things, I have to keep trying to load ships, and every time in hangs, I have to close and reload, which takes\u00A0over 5 minutes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any quicker way to determine which part is responsible, or do I need to suck it up and spend a few hours doing trial and error?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T09:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Oafman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T10:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, assuming it is one or more particular\u00A0parts then\u00A0I would suggest finding the smallest vessel you have that reliably hangs and then create\u00A0test vessels using the various parts that vessel uses (search the craft file for \u0022part = \u0022 without the quotes)\u00A0until you find one that causes it. \u00A0Try to more unusual parts first, or compare a few different craft files to find the ones they use in common (if more than one then this could be tricky).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, take a look at the end of the output_log.txt or\u00A0player.log file to see if there is any indication of what the problem might be. \u00A0It might also be an idea to upload a complete log so people can take a look for anything else that could be a concern...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T11:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.
