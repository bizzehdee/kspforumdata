If you want to go from Kerbin to Duna, you need to make a particular burn to get there. Assuming you\u0027re in a parking orbit around Kerbin, the most efficient burn is going to happen at one instant in your orbit. With a real rocket, it is spread out over time. If that time is relatively brief compared to your orbital period, it is a good enough approximation of instantaneous that only very minor fudging is required to fix the burn from its idealized version. With a very long burn time (TWR\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) the burn is spread out over a significant fraction of the orbit. This results in a very messy, difficult to predict burn. Further, it wastes much of the Oberth effect\u0027s ability to optimize your burn. By burning while slowing down you\u0027re losing out on maximum energy per delta-v. You can minimize that by making several small burns and gradually kicking yourself into higher and higher orbits, but in the end you\u0027ll have to commit and make a transfer burn, and if nothing else, your real life time is worth something here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get into orbit your ship must accelerate to some velocity and ascend above the atmosphere (or at least the top of the mountains.) That change in velocity and the delta-v associated with the altitude change are the most basic parts of delta-v for ascending to orbit. If you\u0027re familiar with the impulse-momentum theorem, you can consider all forces acting in the rockets direction of motion as applying an impulse to it (F dt) and that impulse creating an associated change in momentum (m dv). That\u0027s where things like wind resistance can translate into a delta-v. The constant backward impulse from wind resistance equates to a loss in momentum that your rocket engines have to compensate for. The component of gravity that is in the direction that the rocket is traveling does the same (thus the concept of gravity drag and why we make gravity turns while burning.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only assume you meant TWR\u0026lt;=1 rather than TWR\u0026gt;=1. If that is the case, then yes, you\u0027re right. TWR = 1 is the case for thrust balancing weight. Anything higher and it is (at least theoretically) possible to go arbitrarily high/fast. For ascents you\u0027re typically looking for a TWR = 2. That seems to be a good balance of upward thrust and economy of scale. On planets with atmospheres it also is the most efficient way to ascend - always moving upward at terminal velocity. Once you start a gravity turn it becomes less important. For planets without an atmosphere bringing along a smaller engine (lower TWR but less total mass and greater delta-v as a result) is often a better option, but you don\u0027t want to go much below 1.8 or so for an ascent or you\u0027ll lose a bunch of delta-v to gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR = 2 includes drag. Isp is lower in an atmosphere because the gases being ejected from the rocket nozzle are blocked by the air outside the nozzle. They can\u0027t exit freely, at full speed, so the rocket is less effective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T04:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rusty6899\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rusty6899\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe way I see it, TWR should only be relevant in sub-orbital flight, where T \u0026gt; mg or else you won\u0027t budge / will decelerate if in the air.\u003Cp\u003EAnd; acceleration=(T-mg)/m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have heard people on here talking about TWR in orbit, but my understanding was that you are weightless in orbit and your thrust/mass ratio is relevant (g=0 in the above equation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo bad assumptions there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your mass is not constant, ergo your acceleration formula is invalid.

Most folks will tell you to shoot for an initial stage I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E of 1.6-1.7, with the idea being that the average TWR for the stage from the time it lights to the time it runs out of gas is around that magic 2.0-2.2 range (where thrust, gravity and drag are optimally balanced). I find for planning purposes that if you take your payload for the stage and divide it by .04, you get the amount of thrust that stage is going to need to have a TWR in that general vicinity. You then plan your engine cluster accordingly, add it to the payload mass, add the mass of everything else involved with the stage except the fuel tanks, and then you work Tsiolkovsky backwards to figure out how much fuel you\u0027re going to need (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57553-How-to-modify-Temstar-s-asparagus-logic-for-serial-and-onion-staging?p=774607\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post774607\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI did a rather thorough example of this just recently\u003C/a\u003E).

Oberth merely states that the faster a rocket is moving, the more fuel-efficient its engine runs, as in getting more delta-V per unit of fuel. This happens whether the rocket is accelerating in a straight line or following a curved path around a planet. But this effect comes from the momentums of the rocket and the exhaust stream, and the exhaust stream\u0027s momentum is pretty much its mass flow rate. Momentum is mv, so mass is just as important as velocity. This is why Oberth only really helps chemical rockets. Ion engines have huge exhaust velocities but are moving only trace amounts of mass at any given time, so their mass flow rates are very low. This is why you can put such a small fuel tank on an ion probe and do a grand tour with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you\u0027re on a tight fuel budget, you can combine Oberth OT1H and orbital mechanics OTOH to save some fuel. Orbital mechanics, not Oberth, is what makes a rocket move faster at Pe than anywhere else. Oberth, not orbital mechanics, is what makes Pe burns more fuel-efficient than burns elsewhere. But this is only really applicable to fly-bys on open orbits, like say Voyager. If you\u0027re in a closed orbit and want to stay there, then all you\u0027re doing at Pe is adjusting your Ap. And you\u0027re only going to make an Ap adjustment at Pe anyway, whether or not Oberth does anything for the type of engine you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr so it seems to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberFuber","CreatedById":90736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T00:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETWR (or technically, the mass of your ship) is very important if you want to enter orbit around a planet (especially planets without atmosphere).

Because Oberth effect is not about delta-v. It is about kinetic energy of the ship. It has nothing to do with propulsion method. It\u0027s a consequence of how kinetic energy is calculated - E=(m.v^2)/2. Assuming unit mass of the ship (1 kg), if your velocity is 1 m/s and it grows to 2 m/s, your kinetic energy grows from 1/2 J to 4/2 J, i.e. by 3/2 = 1.5 J. If your velocity is 10 m/s and grows to 11 m/s, your kinetic energy grows from 100/2 J to 121/2 J, i.e. by 21/2 = 10.5 J.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the matter of Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T00:32:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T04:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alistone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alistone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd for your latter question about optimal T/W ratio for ascent:\u003Cp\u003ETry to have a T/W ratio of 1.5 to 2 for the first half of your fuel; after 12,000m the higher the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt varies a lot by craft, but on my more massive ships I tend to be slightly lower (I suffer more gravity losses and slightly less air resistance losses; BUT my \u0022max Q\u0022 is less because I\u0027m traveling slightly slower throughout the ascent meaning my ship tends to stay in one piece rather than breaking apart).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften people put extra or larger rockets on the center stack to help T/W improve later in the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally you are trying to match terminal velocity at each altitude; if you are going too fast then add more fuel.

The higher you go the lower the TWR should be, that\u0027s because right after starting gravity turn the importance of TWR diminishes quite fast, and if we have less engines (lower TWR) more of the fuel energy is transfered to payload itself, making the launcher more mass efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, while flying vertical at terminal velocity is the most fuel efficient method for given craft, after we get to some vertical speed (enough to coast out of thick atmosphere) gaining more will only net us losses. That\u0027s why we do gravity turn but then if we turn the ship at an big angle to velocity vector, we get big steering losses, and if we try to avoid that by starting it early we get increased drag losses. In the end the most efficient way is actually to \u0022coast\u0022 at low thrust (flying below terminal velocity) until we fly more horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the second part where thrust is important as we accelerate semi horizontally, but it ends quickly as we gain orbital velocity, lowering the gravity drag. And since we still have a lot of vertical speed stored accelerating fast in middle atmosphere only increases drag losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point the difference between accelerating fast and slow doesn\u0027t bring us much improvement. And if we bring less engine mass up there, it means we have saved a lot of fuel (more than we would have gained from more efficient - high TWR flight profile).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
