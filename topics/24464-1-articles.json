If it\u0027s the later, some struts might help with structural rigidity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you really need the second set of wheels? The big rover wheels? They require electricity for power, which is redundant if you\u0027re going to be using engine thrust. Also, since they\u0027re made for rovers, they have a maximum safe speed and will pop if you exceed that. It may be higher than your landing/takeoff speed. Either way, two sets of wheels adds weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ram intakes have a better air/drag ratio, so replacing the scoops with those will allow the plane to reach higher speeds. And that\u0027s important, because for spaceplanes, the trick is to build up as much speed as you can in atmo and only use the rockets to circularize the arc you achieve on jets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, you\u0027re using LV-N nuclear engines for your rockets. They are fuel-efficient, but quite heavy and have a tiny thrust. That\u0027s not good for SSTOs, which need to build up speed quickly before gravity drags them down again. I\u0027d suggest replacing those with the 50 thrust rockets, which are weaker but also MUCH lighter, or some of the stronger engine types that will convert fuel-weight to speed at a much more rapid rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I see an RCS tank, but hardly any thrusters for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, I think that much weight would benefit from substantially more lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Assault Bunny","CreatedById":61177,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T08:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why it would be useful if the spaceport actually worked.

You don\u0027t need the thrust in space, and that way you pretty much double the T/W while getting a plane 1 ton lighter (better mass ratio, so better delta-v). If you say you lack thrust to get out of atmo, I am assuming you can make it to at least 20 kms and \u0026gt;1,200 m/s, ideally 25kms and \u0026gt;1,500m/s. Oh, and forget about standard jets, they are wasted weight when you go over 10,000m IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a flight trick: when you are nearing flameout, turn the rockets on and thrust back to around 50-66%: you can get an additional push from the jets until ~30kms. But beware, you are courting a flameout induced spin that way, you\u0027d better be quick at turning them off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least, if all else fails, MOAR INTAKES! With 6-1 intake-engine ratio or higher you can get to such high speeds (\u0026gt;2.200m/s) you can circularize on ion engines, I kid you not. A handy trick: by adding a strut to the front of the tanks, you can clip two intakes per tank (without activating part clipping, too), and they actually look better IMO (one upside down on the back of the strut or the tank, the other on the front of the tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I don\u0027t use the spaceport at all, I upload all my crafts to mediafire and post the links here.

Or possibly a pair of LVN\u0027s. burning them inside the atmosphere has a stigma everyone keeps talking about but in truth they are more efficient than every other LFO engine available starting at 10,000m! Mind you were talking 400isp at 10km, but at 20km were already over 750s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, using LV30\u0027s to get out of atmosphere is fine, but chances are your going to use enough of your fuel supply that you\u0027ll need to refuel in orbit if you want to take the plane anywhere besides back to the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought is this. Center engin LV909, next out is a pair of turbojets, then outside that a pair of LVN\u0027s. just use the 909 with the LVN\u0027s while you are getting out of atmosphere and dissable it as soon as you are clear of the atmosphere. Circularize with the nukes and perform everything else with them until you are ready to land again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the intakes(ram not scoops). I would personally go with 8 intakes per jet if you can find the space for them, that will get you to 28km at half throttle I wouldn\u0027t try for higher with a dual turbojet setup, as a flameout on a wide craft like this would be very hard to recover from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-28T09:46:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2013 09:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Assault Bunny","CreatedById":61177,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T11:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, there\u0027s nowhere to put more ram intakes on.
