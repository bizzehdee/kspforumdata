They were in fact flashing between hot and cold very rapidly. It was like the heat \u0027packets\u0027 were too large when hitting a lightweight part. I saw similar flashing a few days ago with Novapunch parts connected via decouplers. When I increased the mass of the US bases the problem went away. At a mass of 5.0, instead of 0.5, the octocore didn\u0027t overheat. More importantly, at a mass between 0.5 and 1.0 it would overheat more slowly. Heat capacity is therefore based on mass, which does make some sense. Then I dug through the cfgs for parts that cool things, specifically the aero parts that cool incoming air, and noticed the \u0022thermalMassModifier\u0022 attribute. It seems to act as a multiplier for heat capacity bypassing the need to increase part mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try adding this line to the octocore cfg:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022 thermalMassModifier = 2\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should increase the part mass for purposes of heat to 1.0.

For the rotating core thing, give Infernal Robotics a try. That brings in rotating mechanisms, hinges, and robotic arms that you can use for spicing up space stations. Its one of the only mods I know of that can rotate joints, so I assume its a pretty hard thing to develop around.
