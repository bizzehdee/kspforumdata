I am here with a tutorial to save the day!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I would like to explain some KSP Terminology to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Delta V is basically how much effort it takes for your spaceship to edit their course in the cold vacuum of Outer Space. Like say, your spaceship has 2000 Delta V. You wanna use a maneuver node that takes 1000 Delta V. You do that Maneuver Node and you lose 1000 Delta V. Simple Right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Delta V budget is basically how much Delta V your spaceship has in total with each stage combined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Prograde marker is basically where your forward velocity vector is located on the NavBall.(Which is the artificial horizon on the bottom of your screen)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Retrograde marker is basically directly oriented away from your prograde marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond of all, let\u0027s get down to business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you\u0027ll only need a 3 stage spacecraft in order to make orbit. In case you haven\u0027t made one yet, do so from the VAB. (or Vehicle Assembly Building)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, once you\u0027re on the LaunchPad, activate SAS by pressing the T key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, throttle up to 100% and hit Space Bar to activate Stage 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongrats! You have successfully lifted off of the LaunchPad, now all you need to do is the hard part, which is doing the math required for getting into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, get yourself within 10 kilometres above Kerbin\u0027s terrain, then begin your Gravity Turn. (which basically is turning right and keeping yourself within the blue part of the NavBall, otherwise, you may fall back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, after getting yourself above 30 kilometers, you should be on a 90 degree heading, which is the horizon. Good. You have escaped Kerbin\u0027s densest part. Now it is a question of raising your Ap node to above 70 km. That is for you to learn, but now I don\u0027t have anymore time.
