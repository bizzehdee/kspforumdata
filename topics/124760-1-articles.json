I\u0027m posting here because my game is heavily modded, but I don\u0027t think my question necessarily requires me to list every mod I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a craft with the shielded docking port. And it seemed to work before--I was able to open the shields, dock a craft, and undock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now the craft\u0027s docking port says \u0022Status: Locked,\u0022 and won\u0027t give me any options to toggle the shields. And, even with my docking port aligned well and magnetically attracted to another docking port, it won\u0027t actually dock--the two crafts remain separate, I can\u0027t transfer crew or resources, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to believe one could edit the persistence file to fix this--but I haven\u0027t found anything obvious, and might not even be looking in the right place. I don\u0027t generally edit persistence files so maybe I\u0027m just clueless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone point me in the right direction, please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeatCrown","CreatedById":101431,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T04:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, It\u0027s the age-old docking port bug.
