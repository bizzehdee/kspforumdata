So I\u0027m sure a few of you have read my mission report I started a couple months ago:\n\n[A Spacetime Oddity: My Kerbal Space Program](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111017-A-Spacetime-Oddity-My-Kerbal-Space-Program).\n\nI\u0027m posting this thread because with 1.0, so to will an updated version of the Oddity, and because everything is going to be changing it really will be truer to the purpose of my mission report than the first Oddity was: playing KSP and learning about what makes the game tick.\n\nAnd so, I\u0027m asking those who have read it before, or who haven\u0027t read it but would like to help, I would like some feedback so I can make Oddity II even better than the first.\n\nSome changes I plan to make:\n\n- MOAR photos!\n- Some added videos\n- Better data collection\n- A splash of extra humor\n\nSo beyond these points, does anybody else have any suggestions? What do you like about it and what can I fix?"}]}
