It also provides support for Nils77\u0027s excellent Kerbal Planetary Base Systems. If you haven\u0027t seen KPBS, check it out! The design and art quality is simply stunning.\n\nSwitchback  \n\n- The attachment nodes now support symmetrical installation of parts.\n\nBuckboard 2000 \u0026 3000  \n\n- The Buckboard 2000 \u0026 3000 can now be converted into an ore-powered generator. It consumes Ore to produce ElectricCharge. The generator can break down (unless you opt-out via Pathfinder\u0027s Settings screen), and it generates heat. It also benefits from the Pathfinder Geology Lab\u0027s Metallurgy research. In career mode, the generator conversion is available after you research Advanced Electrics. Thanks for the suggestion, Geschosskopf! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nKerbal Planetary Base Systems  \n\n- Added support for Kerbal Planetary Base Systems. While not as efficient as Pathfinder\u0027s modules due to their size, they can still contribute to your Pathfinder base, and still benefit from efficiency improvements created in the geology lab.  \n\n  \\* The K\u0026K Planetary Habitat MK2 can be used as part of Pathfinder\u0027s habitat wing.  \n\n  \\* The K\u0026K Planetary Laboratory can be used as part of Pathfinder\u0027s science wing.  \n\n  \\* The K\u0026K Planetary Greenhouse uses Pathfinder\u0027s greenhouse module code.  \n\n  \\* The K\u0026K Rocket Fuel tanks now hold a variety of different resources (and default to LiquidFuel/Oxidizer).\n\nOther  \n\n- You can now access the Pathfinder Settings window from the application toolbar.  \n\n- You can now dump resources in flight without having to switch templates. Click \u0022Dump Resources\u0022 once, then again to confirm.  \n\n- The airlocks on the inflatable modules have been offset to make it easier to enter the desired module. NOTE: due to space constraints the Casa now only has one inflatable airlock. A new version of the Casa is planned that won\u0027t break existing bases.\n\nBug Fixes  \n\n- The internal screens in the Ponderosa/Casa work better now. Click on a screen to select an image from your Screenshots folder. You can also enable random selection of images; currently the images will change once every 30 seconds if configured to do so, but a future update will let you configure the screen switch time.
