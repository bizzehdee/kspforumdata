The Mk2 is positively spacious by spacecraft standards. Particularly when you consider kerbals are less than a meter tall, whereas the Mk2 is over 1.5m tall in the center. At its center, a kerbal could stand on the shoulders of a second kerbal in an Mk2 fuselage. In fact, stooping just a bit, he could stand on the other\u0027s head. In seated position, you could put one kerbal directly above another in the center.

They aren\u0027t meant to solidly prove anything either way, just to show, as scientifically as possible, how much room there is and is not. This is an attempt to cram an even larger number of Kerbals in than are currently being discussed. I used a cargo bay because I don\u0027t feel that showing Kerbals on the outside of the ship really tells us much. I stopped after only three Kerbals because I felt I had sufficient data for PJ Space Plane Ergonomics Mk2 (I had a full twelve Kerbals waiting to participate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPertinent data about the experiment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cargo deck is longer than the passenger module in question. Please note the truss in the center (bad placement, sorry). The truss marks the extreme end of a passenger module and an actual passenger module was attached to aid in placement. It is accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA floor was put in place as we probably won\u0027t have the seats sitting on curved floors. Twelve seats were placed. They were not given optimal placement and the floor could have been lowered a bit. Without helmets and with the seats spaced further apart we can definitely get a good number of Kerbals in there. This experiment is neither a success nor failure as its purpose was to gather data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy takeaway from this experiment is that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHelmets are out.
