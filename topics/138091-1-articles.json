HIstorically, we actually cannot see direct evidence of quantum mechanics except via developmental or evolutionary process, evolution was all about us but it was only darwin and mendel, using highly theoretical constructs stipulated that quantum effects were causing macroscopic presentation and preservation of the information. IOW a blip occur and was captured and carried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust about everything we see is a direct consequence of the laws of mass action, the action of the water in the glass used so many time. As one presenter points out this is a rational scale observation completely fitting in its description, but once you throw in life, its no longer fitting, because life can (key word is can, and but rarely does) replicates quantum events, no matter how unlikely or thermodynamically unfavorable in the biological context, they can eventually be trapped and placed in a favorable context. This is were the universe gets screwed because the fine scale laws run into problem, because the laws that disorder the universe order life. So once we are talking about biology the distinction becomes important. But if this can occur with biology, it can occur with other things also. The contradiction of biology is that the probability that a mutation is retained is rare in the course of evolution, probabilistically, (given both position and representation) is so remotely low as to say its impossible. But, the combinations of these \u0027events\u0027 (which we call spontaneous, but at the quantum scale are really just the normal operation of the universe) and thermodynamic and kinetic forces eventually stabilize and create a diverse systems that is responsive to change and appears to progressively evolve (although we have this fuzzy disclaimer that mutations cannot predict evolution, except sometimes when it does de-facto predict within statistical limits). Fine scale evolution does not progress, so a quantum mutation cannot feel the progression of the responsive state, but at a macroscale it does (meaning over long periods of time and observing the states between individuals). IOW if we go back 400 million years, there was nothing on the planet that could have become space-worthy species, not even within 50 million years of highly selective evolution, but over 400 million years of reciprocating chaotic mostly low selection and much of the heavy stuff on immune genes and digestive genes, we get there. There is nothing innate to the Earth system that predicts this would happen, so many things could have gone wrong, the progressed state has so many ways to destroy itself, but one particular aspect, the progressed state is chaotic in the way it creates diversity (which we are rapidly reversing).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe advanced now to a point we can see quantum effects (such as double slit experiment or PMT measuring nuclear decay). So we can fashion ourselves as hypothetical beings. With plum-pudding models replaced by a nucleus and a electron (wave/particle) we can now see some digitalization of the universe, but the physics says no, it goes much deeper, at least 10^30 times smaller, both in time and space, and in fact space-time is irrational at that scale. Suppose there is a simulation and a being that controls the simulation, in this hypothesis we presuppose that the being can only control say things like how fast the universe can inflate, and the relationships between quantum gravity and space-time (i.e. gravitational constant which I don\u0027t believe is entirely fixed), plank\u0027s constant etc. He might be able to shift things here and there a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow suppose we are the privileged life form on earth, and as part of that Einstein is something that the being has been pushing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the development of Einstein and Mutations that form the germ line that formed him, these are quantum effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets now say that a cosmic ray traveling to earth with an energy of 100 TeV and so close to the speed of light from our perspective its clock is moving at plank\u0027s time. IOW it has no ability to change. Its moving in its own space-time, which is to say one space-time of a near infinite quantity.\u00A0 So you have de-facto infinite parallel universe in the observable universe from our many space-time perspectives. Now suppose there is a finite scale to the processor. That particle collides with the outer atmosphere and either that shower creates the Einstein gene or developmental abnormality or does not. If there is a reasonable fine scale, say plank\u0027s length, then beings cannot really control. For a being to control it would have to have something much finer than plank\u0027s scale and time, it would have to be able to deduce precisely what is going to happen as quantum effects. Which space time is the being in, ours or the particles, if its in the particles it cannot deal with the complexity of earth-space times, if it is in the earths then the particles space-time is all but untouchable until that initial interaction. That being would have to operate in all possible space-times at once if not that being is operating error correction it would have to have the ability to stop the universe in a local and implement a sort of anti-dithering corrections that would allow fine scale control. So that\u0027s one way to get around size, lets take the other argument. Suppose we have infinitely small scale control, and of course now we can see below plank\u0027s time, and we also have infinitesimally large number of space-time frames. Lets say we have a perfect computer in which we need only say 1000 units to store each bit of information (position, space-time vectors, etc) and each unit can have its own processor that can do any of the basic calculations.That machine to calculate what happens in our universe would have to be many times the size of our universe, it would have to be potentially as many times our universe as there a \u0027points\u0027 in our universe. That in and of itself is not evident in the physics of our universe. It would be assumptively impossible for a being to have both a simulation and control of the universe to a level that Einstein\u0027s precise existence is controlled. The maximum control is that the being could establish conditions (for example the entropy and enthalpy arguments) such that evolution is likely to occur and then maybe changes the gravitational constant around a meteor that steers it into earth 65,000,000 years ago.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis then devolves to the next question; ok how much control can we actually have? If your program any simulation you realize one thing, the amount of control you have is much less that amount of resources that are available to control, So for any machine we can create, no matter how great we can only control down to magnitudes greater than the simulation scale, that is because our control is composed logically of simulation scale complexity. Since we can only observer, very indirectly,\u00A0 to a certain scale, our control is far smaller. Fpr the most part human beings are natural manipulators, we do not control, we put two fish in a barrel, they breed and we take their spawn and put them in a pond and allow them to feed, or we chose cattle and allow them to mate, produce calves, we plant the grass but it determines how it grows. The most genetically modified organism is not from a laboratory, its bread wheat, we did not create it but by selecting emmer\u0027s wheat and then allowing emmer\u0027s wheat to grow near goat grass and then selecting the hexaploid version and then refining that selection we get something that might take 100 years of molecular biology to replicate from the same starting species. It is through manipulation, not creation that humans largely control. We don\u0027t create the rain, we irrigate, we discourage herbivores not of our liking and encourage those of our liking. We remove competitors, sometimes foolishly, then add them back (such as your dog). We are great because we are one of the (if not the most) environmentally exploitative species.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that answer the question \u0027that god doesn\u0027t play dice with the universe\u0027, the question is the universe a simulation, philosophically, answers the question that control beings have little choice but to play dice, just as we play dice, otherwise they would be inefficient beings in their control, but as manipulators we are sometimes inefficient, we make bad gambles is that necessarily a function of scale. I think ultimately scale is limiting. In fact you could say that gambling addictions show how irrational we can be about risk taking, but once again chaos in the system prevents this from imploding the human system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then the next question is mathematics in control of the universe or is mathematics a thing that just pops out of the way natural systems can logically behave and interact. If the first is true, if mathematics leads the physics, then we are essentially living in a simulation, but if the second is true that it is coincidence that we can do with vending oranges and apples what the relationships of things at the lowest scale, that probabilities designed for banking system just happen to also work in a modified sense at quantum scale. Just coincidence. The problem is that economics is nothing more than ecology of sentients, and mathematics formalizes the distinction (meaning that non-sentients cannot rationalize and abstractualize their actions and examine the derivatives and integral of their actions at the limit of the processing capability of the analytical systems). Because we could say that physics is the chaos of the ordered universe and mathematics makes the distinction.\u00A0 Philosophically we could reason that life can create order from increasing disorder because it exerts control (can manipulate whether things become more disordered or not) that life begins to usurp control from the machine, little by little, until it fathoms mathematics and begins whole scale ordering. In theory if the universe is a simulation then life is an instability in that system that could eventually cause the simulation to collapse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody asked the panel what is the relevance of planks scale units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T18:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvolution is not about us.

And more to the point, if you sit on the earth the earth is accelerating you agaist the elliptical that is the non-inertial. That is the space-time. The feynman lectures points this out, its easier to understand if you convert spatial dimension to one and note the travel. If you are ten light seconds from me you see my space-time of my ten seconds ago, but i am now\u00A0in a different space time. We use the ground as a reference frame because it is so finely-layered space\u00A0time that we cannot see the differences\u00A0but they are there,\u00A0we appear to be sitting on a non-inertial reference frame, but the flattening of our butts on that frame tell us otherwise. The ISS shows that our system and minds developed to equate this as a low potential\u00A0energy state, remove the ground under us to the center of the earth and watch what happens. if we remove what we think is a low potential energy our bodies respond by reducing the effort it spends to conteract it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big inflation\u00A0happened at a point so small that we cannot even\u00A0measure it and now the opposite points in the universe travel away from each other greater than the speed of light at thier comoving reference frames and we are also orbiting orbits of orbits\u00A0that are embedded in that mileau.\u00A0\u00A0If\u00A0you randomly choose any point and any reference frame\u00A0it is but impossible to go back to it as time passes,\u00A0but we can reach for points that happen to move with us.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese reference frames are valid in the relativistic point of view as long as we don\u0027t convince ourselves, like newton did, that they are non-inertial and they are identicle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople say they gointo\u00A0\u00A0space, but actually we cannot survive\u00A0without comoving matter. We are never in space, even in the ISS we have removed much of the potential energy present on earth and suppoted on earth, but in space we replaced that with the kinetic energy of the ISS in which humans then create little kinetic difference.

It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to 0.08542455. (My physicist friends won\u0027t recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with about an uncertainty of about 2 in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.) Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to pi or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms? Nobody knows. It\u0027s one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the \u0022hand of God\u0022 wrote that number, and \u0022we don\u0027t know how He pushed his pencil.\u0022 We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don\u0027t know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2009Richard Feynman\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFSC = \u003Cs\u003E0.08542455\u003C/s\u003E 0.08 and consequently you need to eat double, drink double and . . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Emperor of the Titan Squid","CreatedById":158183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T22:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T01:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, we can also frame it as a \u00A0class ical philosophical question: can we prove that this whole universe is not just generated 10 minutes ago, exactly like how it was 10 minutes ago right down to every atoms position, and all our memories were implanted?
