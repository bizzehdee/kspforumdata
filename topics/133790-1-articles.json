So if you put something in front of the wing, or put the wing inside the fuselage, it would still generate drag. The only thing is that the drag would get applied in a different area, so it may behave a little differently than you might have thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T06:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also use the offset tool to make the two wings not be precisely overlapped, to avoid the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
