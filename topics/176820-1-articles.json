then, Earth\u0027s atmosphere is dense enough to cause orbital decay on a scale of years out to at least 250 km.\u00A0 The general definition of the Karmann Line is the height at which orbital velocity is the same as the speed needed for wings to support the weight of a craft.\u00A0 This is obviously based on a\u00A0 number of assumptions (an airframe that can handle high Mach numbers is top of the list, since you\u0027re around Mach 22 equivalent to get an orbit), but effectively, it\u0027s the point beyond which the atmosphere doesn\u0027t matter in the short

number of posts indicating people blow their fairings around 50 km if still under boost, when launching from Kerbin.\u00A0 So, if you\u0027re launching from Kerbin, you might reasonably discard the fairing at the end of any coast phase that ends above 50 km.\u00A0 This could vary depending on the payload -- that big dish antenna might be a good candidate to hold onto the fairings until 70 km
