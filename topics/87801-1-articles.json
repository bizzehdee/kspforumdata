I\u0027m on a fully up-to-date install of 64-bit Arch Linux, and I just updated to 0.25 via Steam. I have tried launching KSP both directly and via Steam with the same effect. I have also looked through the Linux thread as well as the Arch-specific problems and can\u0027t find my issue anywhere. I was modded, but I removed all of the mods to see if it helped - it does not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe symptoms:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am able to use the VAB and other areas of KSC without any problems. However, when trying to launch a craft (either via the VAB or by choosing one directly from the pad in the KSC overview screen), I am greeted with this lovely interface: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mediacru.sh/ArA0ln02D8Cb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mediacru.sh/ArA0ln02D8Cb\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can switch back and forth from the map view, though coming back into the game view is sometimes different - I can find the camera where it was before, or rising over Kerbin as if in orbit. Additionally, entering the map view has me centered around Kerbol rather than Kerbin. I cannot exit to the space center - clicking the button does nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran KSP up until the point where the bug occurs and collected some information: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/f41c0e73e75b8c3eb1d6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E~/KSP.log\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/94dd26aaccd23a054231\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Estdout\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Esircmpwn@homura ~\u0026gt; archey3 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u002B OS: Arch Linux x86_64\u003Cbr\u003E # Hostname: homura\u003Cbr\u003E ### Kernel Release: 3.16.4-1-ARCH\u003Cbr\u003E ##### Uptime: 2:38\u003Cbr\u003E ###### WM: i3\u003Cbr\u003E ; #####; DE: None\u003Cbr\u003E \u002B##.##### Packages: 1291\u003Cbr\u003E \u002B########## RAM: 2116 MB / 15741 MB\u003Cbr\u003E #############; Processor Type: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz\u003Cbr\u003E ###############\u002B $EDITOR: vim\u003Cbr\u003E ####### ####### Root: 26G / 113G (23%) (ext4)\u003Cbr\u003E .######; ;###;\u0060\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003E .#######; ;#####. \u003Cbr\u003E #########. .########\u0060 \u003Cbr\u003E ######\u0027 \u0027###### \u003Cbr\u003E ;#### ####; \u003Cbr\u003E ##\u0027 \u0027## \u003Cbr\u003E #\u0027 \u0060# \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the Nvidia GTX 680, proprietary drivers (343.22-2), with a quad-head setup (running KSP on one display, though)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T21:03:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SirCmpwn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T19:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I have seen that many times, though have never found reproduction steps, it seems to happen on scene change exclusively though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you see there is Unity failing to load the appropriate resource, in this case it\u0027s the planets themselves, and all we get is voidspace like you see in the pic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually the only \u0022fix\u0022 is a restart of the game, but if this is happening repeatedly then the resource may simply not be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect your logs to be full of null references, and if a redownload of KSP doesn\u0027t fix this then there may be something wrong with the file permissions preventing KSP from loading them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirCmpwn","CreatedById":112036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T19:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, I have seen that many times, though have never found reproduction steps, it seems to happen on scene change exclusively though.\u003Cp\u003EWhat you see there is Unity failing to load the appropriate resource, in this case it\u0027s the planets themselves, and all we get is voidspace like you see in the pic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually the only \u0022fix\u0022 is a restart of the game, but if this is happening repeatedly then the resource may simply not be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect your logs to be full of null references, and if a redownload of KSP doesn\u0027t fix this then there may be something wrong with the file permissions preventing KSP from loading them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try a reinstall and double check the perms later today and get back to you.
