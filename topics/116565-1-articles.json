I\u0027m currently working on it but am not sure I\u0027m doing it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contract has you put 1 or more the SENTINEL probes in a specific Kerbol orbit between Kerbin and Eve. This shows a target orbit just like any other satellite contract and I\u0027ve got the probe on it already. The actual IR telescope part has a button to log data for some quick science and a button to start the survey. I\u0027ve hit these buttons and got a message that the SENTINEL is now working. I\u0027ve also got 35 years to complete the contract and as I\u0027ve just started it, time is not yet an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m unsure about is what I\u0027m supposed to do now. The goal is to find 20 Class D asteroids that \u0022threaten Kerbin\u0022. The contract says this is supposed to happen passively and that I\u0027ll get progress reports. So far, I haven\u0027t gotten any reports (but it\u0027s only been on station a month or so), which is why I\u0027m wondering if the above set-up steps are all I have to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I need to track any of the asteroids found by the SENTINEL?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is \u0022threatening Kerbin\u0022 defined? Does that mean actually entering Kerbin\u0027s SOI, or even impacting, or just in the neighborhood?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr do I just sit back and let it all happen in the background?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that the SENTINEL is finding some very interesting things already, though. I\u0027ve got asteroids in orbits inclined over 45^. I\u0027ve got other asteroids in comet-like orbits with Aps way, way out beyond Eeloo and Pes down near Kerbol. It might be fun to visit such things someday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T16:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ClF3","CreatedById":148396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T13:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually started a contract like this myself a day or two ago. Plonked a sentinel on one sat that was going to a specific Kerbin orbit for a contract, figured i\u0027d add the sentinel (two birds, one stone kinda thing), found out it needs a Kerbol orbit so redirected it after cashing in the contract (plenty of delta-v, I tend to overengineer:D).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaunched a second one, gave a wrong order to mechjeb and got it in a 2mil km Pe orbit around the sun (with 4km/s required to get the orbit back up from an ion engine, I decided to leave that be). Launched a third one to get into the proper orbit. While time warping for the SOI change for the third, I got 2 messages about spotted asteroids which also updated the contract. So it does look like it auto-completes eventually, it\u0027ll just take time. More sentinels appears to increase the detection frequency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T13:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust leave it with the telescope looking away from the sun (and adjust it some three times a year) and you will be receiving reports of \u0022Suitable asteroid found\u0022 every couple weeks/months.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharpy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharpy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust leave it with the telescope looking away from the sun (and adjust it some three times a year) and you will be receiving reports of \u0022Suitable asteroid found\u0022 every couple weeks/months.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
