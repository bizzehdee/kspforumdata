Please answer.\n\nIf you remove parts that are needed for a craft in flight, that craft will not load: it\u0027ll be removed from existence.\n\nYour best bet is just to restart career after 1.0 is released; a lot of players (myself included) do that with every new release."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T02:20:34Z","Content":"The ships will just not load. That\u0027s really not a lot of mods. I have 27 and I\u0027m still on the small side. I would just get rid of NovaPunch and RT2. The others are a lot of fun. I would also recommend KIS as it will replace the grabbing and placing part of KAS."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T02:25:12Z","Content":"The ships just wont load in the editor...In the list where you load them, it will say that they have missing parts, and if you click to load it, it just wont do anything...\n\nIts best to load the ships in the editor BEFORE deleteing part mods, and pull any non-stock parts off the ships. Easy to do with external parts, but critical assemblies (ie fuselages/fuel tanks/crewed modules/etc) will have to be switched with something stock, and if you cant do that, then yeah, your ships will pretty much be worthless without the mod(s) installed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E Your best bet is just to restart career after 1.0 is released; a lot of players (myself included) do that with every new release.\n\nProblem with this, is new releases of KSP seem to come quickly, every 3 or 4 months... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ...lol"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarapple","CreatedById":137606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T03:00:01Z","Content":"Thanks for the answers!
