Great work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the weird distances reported by SR when orbital debris re-enters, I\u0027ve had problems with debris reporting as if it was 700\u002Bkm away on two occasions, both from the same type of vessel but with two different projected landing zones. I use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93685-0-24-0-25-Trajectories-v1-0-0-%282014-11-17%29-atmospheric-predictions-FAR-NEAR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrajectories\u003C/a\u003E mod to calculate true landing areas so I can get the most from recovery. So the two instances:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst\u003C/strong\u003E landing was projected to impact right on top of KSC by Trajectories, which means the orbital line passed overhead and entered Kerbin about 2/3 of the way to the next continent to the east. What I didn\u0027t consider when creating this deorbit path for the debris is that if left on rails to deorbit then atmospheric calculations are not done the same way and the object was \u0027deleted\u0027 somewhere east of KSC, probably 1/4 of the way to that next continent. Distance was reported by SR as ~870 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESecond\u003C/strong\u003E landing was after a reversion to assembly to modify the upper stage of the rocket, deorbit stage was the same as before. This time I put the orbital path to enter Kerbin about 50km east of KSC and Trajectories projected impact on the western side of the mountains short of KSC. Left on rails, the debris was deleted somewhere over the mountain range or just east of them. Distance was reported as over 600 km from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be dropping more debris from LKO and trying to hit KSC with it as I play, so I\u0027ll try to remember to grab some screenshots and more accurate numbers.
