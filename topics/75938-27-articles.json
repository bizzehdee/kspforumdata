Post a few pics, if you would? I take it you\u0027re running the latest version and have made sure to uninstall all the old versions of the plugin? 1.6a will have changed this behaviour. The tracks have to detect which direction and side of the vessel they\u0027re on to be able to function. This is rather ill defined by the root part and control pod orientation, so there may be particular arrangements I\u0027ve not tried that foxes the orientation detection code. Try keeping the root part in the default orientation in the SPH.

Okay, so that\u0027s a rather isolated situation I had, but it was annoying. The firespitter version was interesting, except for the fact that when trying to launch a water-craft I discovered what it was actually doing. It was first spawning you at the standard location, then it was moving you to the new location by, for lack of a better word... bumping you... in the general direction on your destination and then smacking you to make you stop. I\u0027m sure it was more technical than that, but the effect was that it was a rather violent procedure. The visual aspect of this was that all the parts of my craft were temporarily turned to their natural orientation and, upon reaching the destination, the parts were re-orienting themselves based on their strength with the nodes they were attached to. It was like it was reassembling itself on the spot. Even worse, when my craft came to a halt it was not on the water, but actually a few meters above it and... get this... it was facing nose \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E into the water.
