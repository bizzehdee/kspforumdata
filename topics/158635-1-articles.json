When your intent is simply to reach a fundamental prograde equatorial orbit over Kerbin (in my title I say \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E but it could be high too), is there any reason/s one would prefer the default orientation of north on the launchpad and do a traditional gravity turn east, rather than orienting yourself east and interpreting an eastward gravity turn as a negative pitch maneuver? I do the later. I just feel more comfortable making it a function of pitch. Though logically I know it\u0027s no real difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me it seems they should have the same result, all other things being equal, and that once in orbit for whatever your reasons you can just rotate your orbiter to the desired position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL,DR;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes orientation on the launchpad matter or is it simply a matter of comfort and preference?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-03T13:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly personal preference, assuming that your ship is symmetrical.

Many people do this in KSP too, for realism or looks or whatever. However in KSP you can easily orient your rocket in the right orientation on the pad so you only have to pitch down to get to where you want to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, IRL they do pitch up grav turns in all manned flight, as negative g is much easier to tolerate for the human body.
