Me and all my close KSP fellas been waiting for this for a really long time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t mean that at first. What I\u0027m working on is the code that draws the tooltips itself, and the GUI style that goes with it. So far the work has been on improving the general look and feel of the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I have been going over the code from the parts that generates the text you see that\u0027s specific to each part, today in fact, I\u0027m getting into reworking the content of the tooltips, specifically as it relates to the module code that outputs the info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, things like TWR and delta-V are beyond the scope of a part tooltip. That would require a new panel in the editor dedicated to displaying those values for the current craft you\u0027re building... Except for SRBs which are self contained, we have no way to determine the burn time of an engine (or it\u0027s delta-V) from the part alone, so that\u0027s a separate feature we\u0027re talking about there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is definitely something I\u0027d like to add in at some point in the near future though, probably not on this update, as things are quite busy enough as they are, but we\u0027ll get there at some point. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, there is new information that you can see on the new tooltips already, stay tuned for a dev post about it Soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T15:24:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forums are not the place for political discussions, nor for linking the game to certain political systems.
