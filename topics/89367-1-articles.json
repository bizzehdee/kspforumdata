Just saying. This should be support or gameplay questions. First of all, uninstall mechjeb. Then try it. I don\u0027t really have much else advice, except you should contact a mod to have this either locked or moved. You will get more specific attention in the proper regions of the forum.

Sounds like you\u0027re not suffering. Apparently it\u0027s all SAS, I gave up trying to fly and went rocket and they\u0027re not working either.

No I am not having this issue, but it could be linked to your crafts being from a previous save.

The only way to stop it was to turn on mechjeb\u0027s KillRot, or use any other button, prograde, retrograde etc... Turning on SAS didn\u0027t stop the spinning. The RCS thrusters were actually firing...i even restarted KSP and it still did it. Flew the rest of the mission with KillRot on...
