This would most likely be free (this may change if I have to upgrade my server for the purpose of this service, but I don\u0027t think it will be anytime soon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParticulars are to be determined. But before I launch myself into this, I would like to know if people would be interested in this service.

It is a 4CPU/2GB of RAM server, running Debian. The webserver itself will probably be Apache, but I may provide both Apache and Nginx if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also very easily manage all kerbal-related domain names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think of this?
