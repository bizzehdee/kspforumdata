If you quit now because some posters have felt your art was too suggestive of themes they deem inappropriate, won\u0027t you be betraying all those who have enjoyed your art and have always supported it? It is understandable that some people would get unsettled by Nazi-esque art, considering that they committed many atrocities in WWII. But this is to be expected, as everyone has their own opinion, and most people tend to be very vocal about it. Maybe they had great-grandfathers who fought in the war, and have extremely anti-nazi feelings? If I have learned anything in life it is that everyone has a reason for their opinion, and while it may sometimes be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding, it is always legitimate. What is important is to \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E allow these people to influence you, as appealing to them by stopping PfL accomplishes nothing. Their opinions don\u0027t have to control your decisions. You asked why you should continue PfL? Because while some people might not have very positive feelings towards Nazism, they are irritated NOT because of your art, but because it reminds them of history they don\u0027t like thinking about.
