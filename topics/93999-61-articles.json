Unfortunately as soon as contracts for the outer planets start appearing the whole system breaks (even if you don\u0027t accept them). Contracts vanish every time you switch between ships, and even if you try sticking with one ship all the way through it seems to have problems recognising when the contracts complete. I\u0027ve had a look over at the Kopernicustech threads, but there don\u0027t seem to be any answers over there.

Even Squad is dropping support for a 64-bit Windows version with 1.0 as it\u0027s caused nothing but trouble. Only when they can get a 64-bit version working without problems will KSP and its mods be able to really take advantage of the power of 64-bit. It\u0027s a bummer, but that\u0027s just the way it is.
