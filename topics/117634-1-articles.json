But no matter how I arrange the ducts, either directly to the core stage or in a spiral series, the only fuel that\u0027s registering is that in the central fuselage (the one the \u0022Nerv\u0022 is attached to directly). Is there a way to do this, or is it some sort of limitation of the nuclear engine?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T12:15:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaxwellsDemon**\n  \nChanging to \u0022Answered\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T18:55:13Z","Content":"fuel ducts are directional.

My number one reason for two-way flow is being able to better manage CoM issues by fuel feed. Sometimes you just simply can\u0027t get something stable but really need to get it to orbit whether it be for a station or what have you and having the ability to more precisely manage fuel flow would be welcomed over here. It\u0027s not impossible at all to acheive what I what with the current ducts, just less parts and less clicking my way."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:25:21Z","Content":"The better way would be the ability to switch the flow direction in flight.

For example, how can I make [this tug](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/ksp/1.0.4/screenshot847.png) supply all five engines continuously? Fuel lines from the center outward cause the center engine to run dry first, lines from the outriggers inward cause the outer engines to run dry first.\n\nThat said, such things can often be worked around by designing a bit differently, and doubled fuel lines can make any other cases work."}]}
