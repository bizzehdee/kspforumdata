How feasible would it be to load up the ISS with supplies and propellant and just drive it out there? It\u0027s already a pretty well developed spacecraft and mobile science laboratory. Suppose we docked a large propellant tank, and used the engines on Zvezda to take it on a tour of the solar system!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore departure it would have to be modified with some radiation shielding, structural reinforcement, additional storage space for consumables, flight systems....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be done but if you wanted to take a jaunt out to saturn it would be better to use the ISS as your craft assembly base and make something that\u0027s designed for such a journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably extra solar panels too, not as much juice further out. The main problem would be that it\u0027s reliant on constant visits from Progress/ATVs to deliver supplies and haul away the rubbish. I guess you could send a little fleet of them with it\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
