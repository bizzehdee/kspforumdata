This would be huge for filming Air-to-Air AI combat with the BDArmory Mod. It would also be useful if you are piloting a craft in combat by allowing you to focus solely on flying, and not moving the camera. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it could have some kind of distance limit, so it only works within 5km or something. I don\u0027t have any thoughts on how it would work with 3 or more craft however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBaha has \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94171-1-0-Camera-Tools-v1-3-%28compatibility-fixes%29-May-16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethis camera mod\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, so I know it isn\u0027t impossible to make something like this.
