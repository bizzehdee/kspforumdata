There should be an option called \u0022Take Data\u0022. You can now repeat the process with the command pod and see an option to store data. Keep in mind that you can only store 1 type of data from every \u0022area\u0022 so if you have 2 materials bay experiments you can only store one in the command pod. The other either needs to either be transmitted, retrieved from kerbin by bringing the part back, or deposited into a different pod. If you try to deposit duplicate experiments you will get a message telling you can\u0027t and upon attempting to board the pod you will be prompted to dump the duplicate data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brienne","CreatedById":59216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
