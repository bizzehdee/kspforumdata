And possibly spare a runways destruction. Although I don\u0027t know the specific values enough. I\u0027m looking at a vehicle weighting different amounts depending on the fuel used and which way to use it. In this case air breathing at takeoff and then fills up with a lot of oxidizer. I was hoping to spare cargo space by using a single tank for fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original design is supposed to be a giant diamond shape based on dividing by the sqaure root of 3 for each dimensions to get the other parameters.(with the goal of getting 120 and 60 degrees for more optimal flight.) I\u0027m trying to find the limits of the vehicle and the fuel tank is what naturally fits in the vehicle in it\u0027s center. But I\u0027m wonder if a pure sphere vehicle would be better as I think it reduces the structural cost and weight of the vehicle. Unless I\u0027m doing the math wrong.

I originally accidentally did the calculation in cubic inches and thought it was clear for my desired weights. The sphere on the other hand is only like 21 tons for 1/6th of the total volume. And I assume better structural strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines are on a partial sphere plates on the top and bottom of the craft that go with the spherical part of the craft. The vehicle is supposed to go at takeoff/low altitude flight aiming into the 120/60 degree front then swing the body sideways or rotate the engines 90 degrees and fly into the 60/36 degree edge for hypersonic flight. I\u0027m assuming a complete sphere would reduce this need but add drag overall and potentially lower mass for the body.

Potentially using the raptor engines space x runs? I don\u0027t know if you can simply take the air and bypass it into the exit of the rocket or afterwords as a way of mixing it? One idea was to set all the engines midline into another object that would encompass the entire thrust of the rockets and then funnel it to another location farther in the rear and in essence be a second giant vector exit consisting of all other thrust. If the air was bypassed to this area and ignited could you split the lox addition between in engine and out of engine for different mixture ratios to reduce the total lox carried.

If you funnel all the thrust would you be able to minimize or eliminate the problems of asynchronous thrust sources? IE maintain only 1 engine thrust loss instead of multiples. Or in worse case scenario maybe only 2 from the engine in the opposite corner to the lost engine. Let alone be able to do something like try to artificially allow both the vacuum engines and regular raptor 2 engines fire at the same time by artificially adjusting the realities in the second larger chamber to extend their usability potentially.
