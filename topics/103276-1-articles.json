Once an X amount of all resources required, and X amount of kerbals are located within a certain radius of each other, you will have an option [Found Colony] where [Recover vessel] would normally be.\n\nNow you have a colony that can sustain it self with a certain amount of kerbals. Further down the colony tech tree will allow you to collect resources colony. Which will require more missions to planet/moon to deliever the resources to begin the collecting of materials.\n\nNow your colony can sustain life, and is collecting it\u0027s own material. Now you can build a vehicle assembly building on your colony, instead of costing money, it will cost X amount of resources, and ship parts will also cost resources, instead of money.\n\nI feel like this would be a really cool mod or addition to the game. It would work well with the mutli star system mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Tabris","CreatedById":122933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T01:00:34Z","Content":"[EPL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-0-90-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-1-2) \u0026 [MKS/OKS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-8%29-2015-02-27) let you do exactly that."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T07:53:30Z","Content":"add the kolonists mod into the bunch, it even lets you breed kerbals in space.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106103-0-90-Kolonists-v1-0-1-Jan05?highlight=kolonists](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106103-0-90-Kolonists-v1-0-1-Jan05?highlight=kolonists)\n\nworks best with MKS/OKS."}]}
