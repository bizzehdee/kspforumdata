All else being equal (dV needed, positions, ignoring (un)wieldiness of the design), is it cheaper in terms of fuel expenditure to ship one payload of 40 tons, or two payloads of 20? Does this answer depend on the payload size or the dV? Basically, is there a point at which a mission, base, etc, becomes so large it\u0027s more efficient to ship it out in parts than it is to do one large burn?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T05:50:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV (and therefore fuel), it\u0027s equally efficient, whether done as 1 40 tonne mission, or 40 1 tonne missions.

This is my Duna Command Center base. I lifted it into orbit as one whole part. Then I sent up 5 nuclear engines and fitted them to the base and sent it to Duna. So with something like this, it\u0027s easier to piece the engines to it as separate missions, but it would be more efficient to launch it all up as one with the nuclear engines already attached. But my orbital vehicle was simple enough and once you get into higher tonnages, the lifters get more complex to rig. So it really depends on what you want to do. I\u0027m a pro at docking anything in orbit so I found this way to be easier than building a complex lifter because I already had lifters that could lift the things that I had rather than build a new one just for this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna Command Center is about 80 tons or so with full fuel in the landing engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the lifter.
