I used an upgraded version of my trustworthy Swift SSTO which is intended to be used as a small ground-to-space-station one-kerbal shuttle (there exists a two-seater version where the inline docking port is replaced by a second cockpit). The main difference with its predecessor is that it uses two rapier engines instead of a turbojet coupled with two lv-909. This gives it a very welcome thrust boost, both in atmosphere and in space, at the expense of fuel efficiency. Given its intended role and the fact that it propels itself mainly with RCS once in orbit, this is a more than acceptable trade-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is however worth noting that this flight was not exactly a routine one : it was my first attempt at delivering a functional payload in orbit with the Swift.

In the case of your multi-role vehicle the only thing I can think of is that if it is VTOL you may need to make a special effort to make sure the craft begins the take off by moving horizontally. The rule is intended to ensure K-Prize launches are space plane launches, if the craft can move horizontally at all then that satisfies the rule, even if it needs to deploy vertical engines to lift off due to the limitations on rover wheel speeds it will satisfy the rule if it is able to start by moving horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXeo thanks for your mission report. Thanks in particular for taking the trouble to provide a screeny showing how the scooter fuel complied with the rules.

Unfortunately while I am sure you can solve this issue, there is still one slight snag which shows up in the screenshot entitled \u0022Engaging RCS to help with attitude control.\u0022 In this image the RCS thrusters on the scooter appear to be actively helping the craft to maintain attitude during lift off.

Apparently the rule is intended to distinguish staged vehicles from K-Prize space planes. I am also seeing two pairs of LV-1R radial rockets on the scooter which obviously were not used inadvertantly in the lift off because they were not activated which is in keeping with the other efforts made to stay within the rules. So its clear that the use of the RCS blocks was an oversight and was not intentional. I hope you understand this would set a precedent which could then be abused. So how do you want to play it? Would you like the mission linked as a gatecrasher or would you prefer to do the mission in such a way it qualifies. As the mission stands there are two things that can be done to make sure it qualifies, you could deactivate the RCS blocks during the launch until after decoupling or you could use the RCS blocks but complete the mission without leaving the scooter in orbit.

The OP states the rules clearly and all mods are allowed except those which alter stock flight physics. Mechjeb is perfectly acceptable. Personally I would encourage anyone playing KSP to experiment with manual control as it is rewarding when you get the knack and you feel like you have learnt something when you begin to understand the relationship between navball and craft flight, though I admit it can be a long and quite explodey learning curve. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EXeo, OK I will leave the linking until the mission is completed.
