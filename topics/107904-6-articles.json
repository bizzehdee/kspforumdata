The weighing should be done based on science multiplication factors? So if you have orbitted Kerbin (1x), Mun (3x), and Minmus (4x), you should have a 1/8th chance of getting a contract for Kerbin, 3/8th\u0027s chance for Mun, and 4/8th\u0027s chance for Minmus"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T04:38:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could make it generate a random number.

However, the contracts are split by prestige (1 star - Kerbin, 2 star - Mun/Minmus, 3 star - others). Because of the way KSP generates contracts, it\u0027s hard to do the logic you proposed across prestige levels. In future I may have it allow some more dynamic weighting by prestige though, which would allow what you described to be implemented."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T05:57:25Z","Content":"Hopefully will get this in a release state tomorrow.
