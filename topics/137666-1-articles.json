In fact, you need \u003Cem\u003Ezero\u003C/em\u003E science from the surface of Kerbin to get through career mode. It can be a helpful extra, but if you find yourself running out of science, you have a different problem that you need to address. If you don\u0027t address it, farming the KSC biomes will merely be an onerous short-term bandaid, and that problem will come back to bite you in the hindquarters again and again as you continue playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNamely one of these three:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- You consistently miss out on performing your available experiments in all of the situations they qualify for.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- You consistently ignore tech nodes that include science experiments when choosing what to research next.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- You are unaware that a large amount of science is locked behind building upgrades.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECase 1:\u003C/strong\u003E A \u0022situation\u0022 is comprised of two different things: your location, and your altitude. The location part can be general (\u0022at Kerbin\u0022) or biome-specific (\u0022at Kerbin\u0027s Highlands\u0022). The altitude generally includes \u0022landed\u0022, \u0022low above\u0022, and \u0022high above\u0022. On a planet with an atmosphere, there also exists \u0022flying\u0022 and \u0022upper atmosphere\u0022. On a planet with a surface liquid, there also exists \u0022splashed down\u0022. You can see your current situation when you perform a science experiment. For example, triggering a crew report halfway through a launch will tell you \u0022Crew report while in Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere\u0022, meaning that this report is specific to this exact situation. You can get science for it just once, but you can still get science for crew reports in \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tricky part comes when you want to know where all the possible places to perform a crew report are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, you\u0027ll want to know where altitudes change - where you go from \u0022flying\u0022 to \u0022upper atmosphere\u0022 to \u0022low above\u0022 to \u0022high above\u0022. You won\u0027t be told where these thresholds are; and for every celestial body, they are different. You will have to explore and pay attention to find them yourself. That\u0027s how science is done!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, you\u0027ll want to know in which situations an experiment is even valid. For example, a crew report is valid at all altitudes, but there exist experiments that are not. A seismometer, for instance, obviously cannot measure anything if it is not landed on something. Again, apart from a few helpful hints you occasionally find in a part\u0027s flavor text, it is up to you to discover (or reason out) these details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, you\u0027ll want to know if the experiment is general, or biome-specific. In the example above, collecting a \u0022Crew report while in Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere\u0022 tells you that it is a general experiment. There\u0027s no need to repeat this experiment again elsewhere on Kerbin, because it doesn\u0027t matter what part of the surface you are above at this altitude. But beware! After returning from your spaceflight and preparing to recover, you might decide to collect one last report... and suddenly receive a \u0022Crew report from Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands\u0022. So while the \u0022upper atmosphere\u0022 altitude was not biome-specific, the \u0022landed\u0022 altitude very much is! You\u0027ll find this repeated, in various combinations, across all of the other experiments as well. You\u0027ll have to test them at various altitudes and check whether or not you can extra science from another biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the science and exploration gameplay of Kerbal Space Program. It is up to you to discover what works where in which capacity. But because this is reasonably complex, new players often miss out on science because they don\u0027t perform their experiments in all available places. They\u0027ll unlock the EVA report, take one on the launchpad, one in space low above Kerbin, and one while landed, and call it a day... when in fact they could have taken up to \u003Cem\u003Enine\u003C/em\u003E of them in space low above Kerbin (plus one in space high). Even in an equatorial orbit, which doesn\u0027t catch all biomes, there\u0027s six (missing only tundra, poles and badlands). Missing this much science hurts progress, and if every single experiment misses a lot of science due to failing to check all situations... yep, you get stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do not care to do all of the discovery yourself, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/69538-104-sciencealert\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethere\u0027s a mod for that\u003C/a\u003E (which may or may not already be updated for 1.1 by the time you check it out)... just don\u0027t later come to the forums to complain about there being too little gameplay in the science system \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECase 2:\u003C/strong\u003E New players often think that they need to push the rocketry nodes in order to be able to go to more destinations and thus collect more science. This is a misconception. As soon as you have unlocked the Terrier, you can reach all destinations in the KSP solar system without too much trouble. Further progress in the rocketry nodes only gives you parts that allow you to reach those goals more easily, with less parts and less design effort. This is why, after making a beeline for the Terrier, you should consider focusing more strongly on unlocking new science experiments instead, while practicing to construct more efficient rockets with the parts you already have at your disposal (as well as learning to fly them better).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECase 3:\u003C/strong\u003E Once you get into orbit for the first time, there is a glut of science to be had from biome-specific EVA reports. However, to be able to take EVA reports, you need to be able to go EVA in the first place. This capability needs to be unlocked by upgrading the astronaut complex. With 33 biomes between Kerbin and its two moons, simply collecting EVA reports at various different altitudes will unlock you several new tech nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you start making plans for your first Mun or Minmus landings, you will want access to one of the highest-yield science experiments in the whole game: the surface sample. Not only does each sample pay out a huge amount of science, but they\u0027re also biome specific, meaning you can do them in many different locations. This obviously also requires you to go EVA, necessitating the astronaut complex upgrade. But on top of that, your R\u0026amp;D facility needs to be upgraded in order to be able to unlock these experiments. Think of it as installing extra equipment to be able to examine these samples. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-22T12:35:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2016 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T12:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222529522\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137666\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461284549\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159656\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Victor3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Victor3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0should I just keep going out into the system, on my own, to gain science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the contracts aren\u0027t there, sure. \u00A0You will need to generate cash to do this, but that\u0027s what tourists and satellites are for. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can build a craft capable of sending a crew\u00A0to Minmus and back again (or the Mun, but Minmus is easier), you\u0027ll find all the science you need.
