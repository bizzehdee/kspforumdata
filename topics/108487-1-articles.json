I was a merely a test pilot - all bravado and little learning, yet he was a scientist of the highest calibre with degrees from both Karvard and Kambridge.\n\nHe struck me then as a quiet, reserved man with an iron will. What I never knew at that time was how determined and how loving of his friends he was - for this, he paid the ultimate price, and we should all remember his brave sacrifice.\n\nNot just a cosmonaut, not just a scientist, he was a poet, a family man and a hero.\n\nWhen I got caught for trying to steal a rocket from the hangar, who covered for me? Bill.\n\nWhen I was stranded in space without fuel to get home, who came to rescue me despite it never having been attempted before? Bill.\n\nI was the first Kerbal sent to land on the Mun - a huge and somewhat undeserved honour - I survived but The Hephaestus, my craft tipped over upon landing. Stranded on the surface and unable to take off, mission control advised I wait for a rescue. I performed the experiments I had been asked to perform with my heart heavy as I knew that hope of rescue was remote. Then, in the middle of the Kerbin night, I got a message from mission control, but oddly not on the normal frequency - it was Bill, without the authority of his supervisors. He said if I could somehow get myself into orbit - by scraping my horizontal ship across the ground at low speed I might get airborne and be able to get some kind of orbit cobbled together - and if I managed it Bill would be there to grab me from the heavens. This I did, and thanks to Bill\u0027s guidance got myself aloft and into an orbit. But the good fortune ended there - the orbit I\u0027d managed to establish was insanely difficult to reach with the limited craft we had on Kerbin and as the hours ticked by, my heart sank again knowing that rescue was unlikely. Then suddenly - a message from mission control - Bill was already on his way!\n\nHe rescued me did Bill, stationing his craft nearby so I could jet across, and he gave me the biggest bearhug of my life when I grabbed hold of the ladder - almost making me let go! We boarded, and I waved goodbye to what remained of the good ship Hephaestus, happy I was with a friend again, and we set off together back towards Kerbin.\n\nOn re-entry into Kerbin, disaster struck. The fuel Bill had remaining after he had rescued me was so little that we were forced to make an obliquely angled descent. The roar of the compression heating from outside was unbearable despite the heatshield on the base of the craft. First the solar panels exploded, then the barometers, and then finally, the capsule underneath mine -the one containing Bill exploded due to the heat. Why God spared me from the same fate I can only speculate.\n\nTo many, Bill was the greatest scientist of his generation, or the greatest hero of his generation, or the greatest cosmonaut of his generation.\n\nTo me, he was my friend. I will miss him always.\n\n - Jebediah Kerman\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T21:26:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bigcalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:26:55Z","Content":"Sounds like one heck of a rescue mission - and that\u0027s one heck of a piece of writing to go with it.
