So my line of thinking was then \u0022Okay, so how about sepratrons to push the parts away from each other?\u0022.

I found that the _SPEED_ at which you stage makes enormous difference on the success or failure (in the sense of if it hits the rocket or not) of decoupler / separatrons. I think there is even a bug open about it (\u0022decoupler behave different depending the speed\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would recommend you would be to CUT the engine prior to activating your stage.
