However, there is some basic scientific illiteracy that they lack at some times during the article. For example, they say that it works by \u0022reflecting light off of alien planets\u0022 which is possibly the dumbest thing anyone has ever said about exoplanets. Considering the closest exoplanet to the Earth is 4 light-years away, it would take at least 8 years for the light to reach the star and reflect back to Earth. Not only that, you would have to predict where the planet would be in 4\u002B years, and where\u00A0your telescope would be in 8\u002B years. Even if that much was possible, who\u0027s to say that the planet won\u0027t reflect the light at an unpredictable angle, given that planets aren\u0027t perfectly spherical? How the instrument actually functions, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S47/82/89C62/?section=topstories\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaccording to Princeton\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is by localizing and focusing on the light coming from the exoplanet, allowing you to make more detailed observations about the planet.
