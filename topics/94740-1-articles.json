In previous versions (0.23, didn\u0027t have time to fly planes in 0.24 and 0.25), my planes flew perfectly well, having no troubles midair. But now, it gets torn apart during their fligth, supposedly because of a structural failure between two parts of the fuselage (cockpit, fuel, cargo bay). I didn\u0027t change anything on my planes, except the wings, because the previous one were getting in the ground after the loading of the plane for the \u0022launch\u0022 (but were still considered as being part of the plane).
