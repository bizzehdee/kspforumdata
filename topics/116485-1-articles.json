Also if the plane\u0027s CG shifts due to fuel being burnt it \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E become unstable in flight. I would compromise and keep the CL slightly behind the CG. Your plane will be a little slower to change direction, but much easier to handle in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep the rear landing gear slightly behind the CG and CL. The easier the plane can pitch up on the runway for takeoffs, the easier the plane will take off at a lower speed.

If it\u0027s far, the plane will be lousy to fly, constantly trying to pull downwards, but that\u0027s still something you can live with. If it\u0027s in front, your plane will be flip-happy, loving to turn tail forward, and that is NOT something you can just live with. It must be way back (in your example screenshots that did count as \u0022way back\u0022) for the plane to pull downwards so hard you won\u0027t be able to compensate by pulling up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but for KSP where the CL and CG are, the plane does handle fairly neutral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in this plane the CG did shift slightly closer to the CL as fuel was being burnt, but stayed ahead of the CL.
