So my question is: Is it possible for me to have two dock connection points like I currently do but still make the rest of the ship built around it? Because if I was to just stack those engines then add the fuel cell in later it would only connect to one point (coupler) instead of how I want it. I know I could just do one coupler build around the fuel cell and support strut the back half, but for some reason I think a small part of me would die on the inside if I did that...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T22:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you can always use the orange tank as root part instead of the pod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E But I think you can fix this one using I beams to fix the falling engine part in place ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chainheart022","CreatedById":119599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T22:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even think of using the tanks core as the center... that\u0027s genius.

You\u0027ll have to rebuild the entire engine nacelle/Sr. Docking port piece ON TOP of that middle engine. Then you\u0027ll have to tweak it around so that this new Sr. dock port is lined up with the Sr dock port on the orange tank.

So when you build that top most engine by connecting the docking port, it becomes a \u0022child\u0022 piece.
