When suddenly, I run out of electric charge! What happened? Apparently, even though Laythe was BAYTHED (see what I did there?) in light, Jool had come between Kerbol and my ship. I was wondering if anyone could make a mod that casts the shadow of planets onto other planets, allowing for solar and lunar eclipses. I don\u0027t know how difficult the mod would be, or even if it\u0027s possible. But if it were possible, it would make a nice visual mod."},{"CreatedByName":"sam.johnson841","CreatedById":104846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T16:28:02Z","Content":"I believe i read somewhere that it currently inst possible/is hard to make work, although Unity5 should make is far easier to do, so **IF** im correct you will have to wait util 1.1 or whatever its called.\n\n -Sam"}]}
