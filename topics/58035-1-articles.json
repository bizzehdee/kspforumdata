Parts just randomly start to go crazy no matter how much struts I add to them (lol) when physics kick in on the launchpad. I\u0027ve found quite a nice solution to it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cs608922.vk.me/v608922052/27b/qqfUQeaKsgA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qqfUQeaKsgA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a \u0022pump\u0022 to slowly load fuel into rocket tanks seems to work quite fine, but is a bit time consuming. I\u0027ve never really tried making oversized rockets, but it works just fine with the medium ones. Just push alt\u002Brightclick on both of the tanks and load fuel from the static ones, also requires to empty tanks before flight. Hopefully this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T17:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunch clamps have always solved the \u0022Dancing Rocket\u0022 issue for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially placing clamps higher up on the rocket (Sometimes I need to add girders to the the sides of the rocket so the clamps can reach without clipping through lower parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tend to build \u0022down\u0022, meaning that if I have radially mounted tanks/engines on higher stages, I place in-line decouplers on the bottom and add tanks and engines directly below them to improve support. I can see you\u0027ve got unsupported upper stage engines in this design, so building down from the those may lend some stability to your design, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T18:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow high is that rocket?
