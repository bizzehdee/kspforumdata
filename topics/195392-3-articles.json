Yes, at this point, even complete removal of for-all-intents-and-purposes dead or never-to-be-completed-or-fixed features is on the table in my opinion. Why insist in including simulation of leg/gear suspension if the only thing we can ever reliably make them do is play Wacky Springs (tm) all day? Why even bother with semi-realistic friction if the nearest real life equivalent we can actually simulate is Holiday On Ice or Glacier Creep?

It\u0027s ten times worse with mods. For example in an episode of beyond Kerbol, the ship was halfway out of Fust\u0027s (about Duna sized) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E before the burn was complete, and the trajectory was definitely off, probably wasting 200 m/s in correction burns. Also, an idea I had about lag is the higher the burn time the less small maneuvers, so a quite 1 m/s burn could have 0.01 m/s burns 10 m/s would have 0.1 m/s, and 100 m/s would have 1 m/s. That way big burns would have low accuracy, because high accuracy is unnecessary, and small burns would have high accuracy to be more precise. Also, as the fps dropped it could increase the the it took to calculate to use was resources, also, you could have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cutoff for the more accurate burns, so for example, a burn would need to be more than 200 m/s before the more accurate system would be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalneyKerman","CreatedById":202955,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T17:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if this has been said already, but what annoys me most of all about KSP is the awful, leaky memory management.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GigFiz","CreatedById":205457,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T20:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
