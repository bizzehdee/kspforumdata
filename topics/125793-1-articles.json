There are also parameters to change the shot sound (look online for free laser sound effects, drop the file somewhere in the BDA directory tree, and then change fireSoundPath to point to it) and bolt size (I think tracerStartWidth and tracerEndWidth govern this). You may also want to change bulletDrop to false if your energy weapon shouldn\u0026#39;t be affected by gravity, and possibly mess with bulletMass, bulletVelocity, and accuracy as you see fit - since you\u0026#39;re well into the realm of soft sci-fi anyway, you can pretty much set these wherever you like. You can also change the ammo with ammoName, and the amount used per shot with requestResourceAmount - if you\u0026#39;re making sci-fi energy weapons, you might want to change ammoName to ElectricCharge and requestResourceAmount to something proportional to how much damage it does. I don\u0026#39;t know if setting requestResourceAmount to 0 for unlimited ammo will work, but you can always play around with it - my guess is it will still require the resource defined by ammoName to be present on your ship, but won\u0026#39;t actually use any, which makes ElectricCharge a good choice since most ships that use a pod will have some available by default.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBDA is a great mod to tinker with, since everything is pretty open to alteration and easy to navigate - overall, you can probably expect any given edit you make to the config files to do pretty much exactly what it says on the tin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=2]*If you\u0026#39;re not comfortable with editing part configs, change that!
