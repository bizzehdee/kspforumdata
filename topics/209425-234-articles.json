you technically overclock the memory when you load the xmp profile. last couple builds those worked flawlessly. but if this memory was engineered to be overclocked, is it really an overclock? its being used as the manufacturer intended. same goes with turbo. usually you just optimize your cooling design to get as close to the max turbo a cpu can handle. im happy to use these features in this way and dont really like messing with that stuff manually. stability is more important than a couple more fps. nice hash, which ive used to fund half this build (you could even count the gpu because its roi\u0027ed itself twice) does this overclocking calibration on the gpu. i used the best efficiency option and it ended up downclocking the gpu slightly to get me a better hashrate/watt. im fine with this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbeen trying to hit those bb drops but i always end up missing them. going to a physical store is not an option for me. the cost to travel to the nearest city with a best buy would be a few hundred bucks, cost of living in rural alaska. going with a 6800xt is also an option, its supposedly slightly better than what im using, im also open to seeing what intel arc can do, but it sounds like they are delayed. id go as low as a 3060 ti. im also concerned about fitment. im using the zotac mini version of the 2070 super and it was a beast to install. i think the best way will be to do custom cables, because the ones that came with the psu are way too long and are currently taking up the space that a longer video card would go.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-11T21:58:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2022 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-11T22:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224076165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187327\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641936683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n44 minutes ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncoolant evaporating right out of an aio loop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the guys I referenced had that - although he had other problems as well (his was an early AIO he bought off a friend who was going for a super premium look with a custom water block)...
