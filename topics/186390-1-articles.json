Once you deploy a seismic sensor on the Mun which then becomes low-powered or unpowered due to lack of sunlight, and then have an impactor on the Mun, you\u0027ve broken your career save - as this will start generating hundreds of messages per minute.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only workaround I\u0027ve seen is manually deleting entries in game files.
