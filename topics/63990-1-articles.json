Landing on minmus is simple as long as you manage to kill your lateral velocity. Other huge benifit is that stock 0.23 have biomes only on Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. And due to the minmus low gravity you can have a lot of surface samples in different biomes using your EVA Jetpack or simply flying your spacecraft from spot to spot.
