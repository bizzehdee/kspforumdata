The original design was featured in a general merchandise catalog. The latest version has been improved to include an enclosed cockpit and better handling characteristics, though ejection seats are still not a design consideration. At extreme speeds, the craft can in fact take off from the highway, though stability is problematic at best and manuverability is hampered. Once the fuel is exausted, the rocket tends to coast to a stop. Catastorphics mishaps with this rocket have included tilting off of the tires, launching off of cliffsides, and worse case, colissions with brick walls or painted rock formations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Wile%20E%20Coytoe_zpstp4bfbpz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u243/TheSpaceballs/Wile%20E%20Coytoe_zpstp4bfbpz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload the Ship File:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByygDcuGFHYPWG5jcFVnSWxQeGM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByygDcuGFHYPWG5jcFVnSWxQeGM\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T22:28:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Matagorda Space Program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded SHIP File\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TopHeavy11","CreatedById":154744,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T13:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrace yourselves.
