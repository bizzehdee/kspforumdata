Only enough for a 2 second burn, and I was travelling at 100 m/s . I saved it up and used it but it only reduced my m/s to 80. I knew I wouldn\u0027t survive, so in my panic, I made Jebediah EVA, and let go of the ladder, in a desperate attempt for the mission to succeed. The very same instant, the lander crashed into the surface and exploded, pinging poor Jeb off into space. Initially, I was happy; he had survived. The I looked at his trajectory: Up for about 280,000 m, then down back to the lunar surface. I quickly looked up the jetpack controls. I tried to bring Jeb back to the surface of the mun but after wasting 50% of my jetpack fuel I gave up. With no other option left, I waited until apoapsis and began to burn, in a desperate attempt to create an orbit. I watched the percentage of fuel go down, quickly. I stopped at 10% left, and checked to see if I had achieved an orbit. I was nowhere near. I shut my eyes and held down shift until I heard it run out. I checked the map. I got Jeb in an orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And this is where he lies today, in worryingly fluctuating orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mustanger","CreatedById":96356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T23:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow comes the best part of a failed mission managing the rescue.
