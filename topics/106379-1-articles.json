Great design!\n\nShould be 1.0.4 compatible. Im going to get them again and make sure they do. Dont think SQUAD has intentions to change water... I wish they added boat parts etc for stage recovery missions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nUPDATE:\n\nBoth crafts do work on land and water ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). Relatively the same status as said above but now you can 4xs warp and everything should be good. Just dont press the Q or E or you will roll the ship upside down and.... you get the memo. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Happy sailing\n\nUPDATE OF AN UPDATE:\n\nNew video should be up shortly. It is to show you how fast the dasher travels and fuel efficient it is across the poles. I think it only took like 11 mins of recording while at 4xs speed. Timelapse coming soon ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T19:10:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghostbuzzer7**"}]}
