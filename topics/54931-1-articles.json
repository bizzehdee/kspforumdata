If you\u0027ve built with enough delta-V to still accomplish your mission after that, that\u0027s fine. For me, though, fuel = options, and the more efficiently I get there, either the more things I can do once I get there, or the more reserve fuel I have to store when I get there, or the larger the payload I can send there with the same sized launch craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, especially for destinations like Jool and Eeloo, the time between Hohmann transfer windows is much smaller than the travel time to get to that destination. Kerbin-Eeloo windows occur about once every 116 days, and the travel time to Eeloo is about 400 days from Kerbin orbit, so you might as well just wait for the next window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, when looking at Eve or Duna, the windows are significantly farther apart than the travel time (As I recall, Dunar transfer windows are about 220 days apart, with the typical travel time being about 75 days), so when those windows come around, I generally try to throw as much stuff as I have prepared, like with the 20-spacecraft fleet depicted below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.21/Screenshots/screenshot723.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot723.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, that was in 0.21, where I built up quite a bit of support infrastructure in the Kerbin SOI prior to the departures of the Dunar and Eve fleets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T08:03:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue for me is that a transfer is rarely perfect, and the more time I spent on \u0022exact dv\u0022 and \u0022perfect transfers\u0022, the more time I spent running out of fuel, stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a fairly generic transport that pulled my launcher to Laythe.
