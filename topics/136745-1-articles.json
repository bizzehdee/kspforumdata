I don\u0027t think so. 90 W is the smallest amount used in microwave oven. 1W is just a thousandth of that. I do not know the amount used in WiFi but it should be less than 10 W (just looked that up on my WiFi transmitter, which says a power input of 12 W and I believe most is used for transmitting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what\u0027s the purpose of your experiment ?
