I\u0027ve got a ship design that when I use LOCK STEERING it see-saws madly on the roll-axis (the axis you rotate around when using the \u0022Q\u0022 and \u0022E\u0022 keys), to the point where it\u0027s swinging back and forth on an arc of about 270 degrees. As I understand it, and I haven\u0027t looked at it so this is word-of-mouth from erendrake, it\u0027s happening because the steering controller logic isn\u0027t using a good dampening algorithm. (i.e. nothing like a PID controller), and is instead completely reliant on the fast speed of execution to allow it to steer entirely by looking at the current position and ignoring the current rotational velocity. That can set up oscillations in craft that have a lag between control input and ship reaction. If there\u0027s a lot of parts that can twist when rotated, and the ship has a lot of powerful torque, the oscillations can get bad. My only advice for now is build ships as ridigly as possible. Making the steering algorithm better is on the list of future things to do, but there were bigger bugs to hit first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JT2227","CreatedById":33932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T02:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen using the realfuels mod, how do you use one of the fuel values as an input?
