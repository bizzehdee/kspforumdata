If i use struts, im afraid the struts will just cling to the bottom stage and pull it along with the rest. The point at which it decouples it\u0027s powered by 3 skippers and 2 mainsails - no exceedingly large accelleration. I even have to power them down a little due to overheating sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strategia","CreatedById":68581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T08:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut some cubic struts (as in, the tiny girders) on your rocket on either side of the decoupler, preferably at 4x symmetry or higher, and connect them using struts (\u0022real\u0022 struts, space tape). The game doesn\u0027t actually model the struts as objects; they just create an intangible physical link between their attachment points.
