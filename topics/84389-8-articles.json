Nice 1, I\u0027ve added it to the white list. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe StockDragFix and setting a forced mod onto a craft. In the initial design of KX this wasn\u0027t possible, but I redesigned how mods are associated with craft so now it is possible (to deal with other partless mods like tweakscale). The problem with this mod is that it won\u0027t be detected by the part mapper so it\u0027s not in the database. I really don\u0027t want to add a way to add mods manually via the site, because otherwise someone might just add a mod like that rather than running the part mapper and that doesn\u0027t help improve the knowledge base for everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to make the part mapper include plugin only mods too so they get added to the knowledge base and then add an interface so you can select them and add them to the craft.

So you could setup a mod pack that listed all the mods you play with so you can quickly do a search for craft that are compatible with your install. Also, if you\u0027ve uploaded a PartMap and/or a number of craft, then the site already knows what mods you use. So the idea was to have pre-set packs of mods based on your uploads and allow you to setup your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this turned into is a feature that allows you to save searches and comes with a couple of set searches (based off your part-map and craft uploads), some example searches and allows you to save your own search. So rather than just saving mod info (as the original \u0027mod-pack\u0027 idea was going to) this saves all aspects of a search; mods, filters, any key-words entered and sort options. non-logged-in users get a set of example searches, logged-in users also get searches based on their uploads and can delete the example searches and define their own and save them. You can also share a search as a url, when you click save search it will also give you a url to copy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen making that bit I realised the mod-filters part of the search was kinda confusing, because of the need to add/remove \u0022stock parts\u0022 to really make them work properly (and that \u0022stock\u0022 is split into Squad and NASAmission and using just 1 or both did make a difference). So I\u0027ve taken that out which simplifies that quite a lot. Actually, it was really very confusing before, I think this simple change makes a big improvement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does mean you can no longer filter for craft by specifically Squad or NASAmission but that wasn\u0027t so useful anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso made some changes to the mods index, but that\u0027s being a bit slow right now so I need to look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh forgot to mention, a couple of 0.90 specific things;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.90 craft now have size info listed on their details tab as this info is now in the craft file.

So it picks up on both stock and mod science parts (at least it gets the DMagic Orbital Science ones), it looks for parts that have DeployExperiment EVENTS but which are not command pods (as they also have DeployExperiment events for crew reports). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all craft now have a list of what science parts they have if you click on details on a craft page. I need some icons for the stock science parts, would any of you guys be able to help with making those?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are now new search filters and the search interface can now have sets of filters toggled on and off. There is a more filters menu which now enables you to switch on a new \u0022science filter\u0022 and \u0022part count range\u0022 filter and also turn off the existing versions filter (I could give you the option to turn the main filters off too, but I thought that was overkill). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe science filter\u003C/strong\u003E gives you toggle buttons for each of the stock science parts that will limit the results to craft that have the selected parts, or you can select \u0022any\u0022 to find craft with any science part (including mod science parts). You can also search for a craft with specific mod science part by using the text interface and typing \u002Bsci: followed by a part-name ie: \u002Bsci:dmSolarCollector \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe part count range filter\u003C/strong\u003E gives you a slider that enables you to set upper and lower limits for part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe example / saved searches have been updated to include a couple examples using the new filters. Worth checking them out as they show what the search is capable of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re almost at 600 craft now! You guys have uploaded some really awesome looking craft!

Blocking bumping might be a little tricky; I can easily do a checksum of the current craft file to compare with a checksum of the new file, but even if you don\u0027t change a craft in KSP but hit save then it changes the unique ids used to associate parts, so the checksum would be different. Comparison via checksum would be the fastest way to check, but not fool proof. Checking specific details of parts and part placement would be more solid, but would have much more of a processor overhead (and the craft upload is already a very intensive process). I shall try and think of an efficient way to check. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EApart from the goo and Sci Jr, there\u0027s science icons used for the contracts in Gamedata\\Squad\\Contracts\\Icons - would it make sense to use them (if you\u0027re allowed)?

I wonder if using them would be a copyright issue? My other thought was just to load the sci parts up, scr-shot them using the KVV and then PS them to be black and white and less detailed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry no updates to note this week. Couple minor fixes but nothing exciting. I\u0027m working on Hangars (which are proving to be a little more complicated that initially planned).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne exciting thing to note though is that I\u0027m talking with the CKAN guys about having a way for KerbalX to provide a kind of config file along with a craft download that could be used to tell the CKAN tool which mods to install for that craft, and perhaps more specifically which parts it needs to install so if you get a craft that uses some parts from a bunch of the really large mod packs it won\u0027t just install the whole pack and cause you to run out of memory. Anyway, this is just in the talking phase right now, but I think it could be a really useful features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone played with the new search filters (by science parts and part-count range)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - oh, there is actually one minor new feature, you can filter for craft that have a specific part. There isn\u0027t an click-able interface for this filter as I don\u0027t think it\u0027s one that will be that useful in the main search, it is used internally to select the craft to show on a specific parts page, but you can also use it in the main search by entering a keyword into the search field. Say you want to find all craft that have a mk1pod then type \u0022\u002Bpart:mk1pod\u0022 into the search. You can select by multiple parts ie; \u0022\u002Bpart:mk1pod \u002Bpart:fuelline\u0022 which will find craft that have both those parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-08T12:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2015 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T11:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi guys, I made A unifficial login for people to post crafts even if they don\u0027t have an account.
