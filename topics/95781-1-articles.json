WHy do contracts give science? Are you saying that private companies would know more about space flight than the actual space administration? Perposterous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love setting my game to high expenses, having a hard time making money and such, requiring mining operations and careful resource management as well as stage reclamation and I want to be able to get science at a normal rate, but I hate contract science. However, when you reduce science gain in difficulty, it not only reduces contract science but reduces science from science parts, too! That\u0027s unfair!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I would love to see is an addon that removes ALL science gain from contracts, instead forcing the player to have to do multiple missions into space to do their science, as the game was MEANT to be! (In my opinion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone help me out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if anyone wants to make a mod that increases all part costs by 300-400% and reduces fuel cost to 20% or so I\u0027d love that as well. Force the player to think about each stage they drop! Force the player to consider building reuseable space ships!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T00:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99664\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EContract Science Remover\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101322\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EContract Science Modifier\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragonchampion","CreatedById":115668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T00:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much!
