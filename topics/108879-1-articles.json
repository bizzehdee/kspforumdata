At the very least it would awesome if this was a toggleable option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two reasons for this thought. Firstly, I like to launch unmanned rockets, and sometimes after a dozen or so launches in a row I will slip up and send a homie into space without proper return attire. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy fault. I realize that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the second thing is the game always decides to auto-send Jeb into space. And damnit I like Jeb. I\u0027d rather send anybody else! I only send Jeb up on a proven safe rocket for space station victory high fives. And even then sometimes I kill him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the brilliant game, I\u0027m still playing it non-stop since I bought it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Newblar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MacroNova","CreatedById":126611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T13:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree - it\u0027s way too easy to forget to properly crew your ship. I\u0027d love an option to add it as a mandatory step before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guilty of it as well, but I have done it so much I\u0027ve basically beat it into my brain to check the crew to suit my particular mission. I think it just takes some dedication in its current state, but some mandatory step to crew your ship sounds like an interesting option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
