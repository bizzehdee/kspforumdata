I\u0027d take something like a helicopter kerosene turbine or maybe even a train/submarine/tank diesel turbine for power, and have both a CVT drive from that turbine to the wheels that can be used at high speeds, and a generator/battery/electric drive setup to be used at lower speeds for optimal torque.

Yeah, it can give you accelerations significantly higher than 1G, which you might want, but it\u0027s a nightmare to build. Although, if we use bleed air from the turbine and run it into an afterburner style booster in the back... I mean, it\u0027d give you the cartoonish flames out the back and maybe another half a G of acceleration while eating half of your fuel tank for that one silly boost. That actually does sound very Batman. Yeah, lets go with that. No real jet power, but a jet afterburner utilizing bleed air from the compressor on the main power turbine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, armor plating, obviously, but I think it should be kept to critical systems. If you start building a turbine-driven tank, fifteen minutes in you\u0027ll realize you\u0027re designing an Abrams, and that doesn\u0027t seem to fit the style. Just your basic ballistic protection against gun fire for the driver and critical systems. Tires I would make airless. They\u0027re a hassle for civilian vehicles, but are used in some military vehicles, and I think they\u0027re a must for this build. One less thing to armor, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t have any weapons on Batmobile, which is a shame, but harpoons aren\u0027t as silly of an idea as it might seem and would fit the style. You can design a launcher based on a standard police grenade launcher - might even be able to repurpose the ammo from either gas grenade or beanbag rounds. A fairly simple harpoon will puncture most street cars, embed well in a trunk, and allow you to bring that vehicle to a halt. Especially, seeing how this Batmobile is probably going to weigh like a semi with everything we\u0027re putting into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, one thing I haven\u0027t seen a lot of in Batman films/games (I\u0027m not much for comics) is cammo. I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to be disguising this version of Batmobile as someone\u0027s sedan, but there are now adaptive e-paints for cars on the market, that might help it blend in better with the environment in the right sort of situations.
