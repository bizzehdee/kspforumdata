As Mipe mentioned, I might be thrown off by the KSP ratio, where as there seemed to be a lot of wing for the plane, but the KSP parts are incomparably too heavy for them. I wasn\u0027t complaining for not getting enough lift at all, its quite the opposite, I\u0027m complaining is quite hard to get the plane to slow down instead... Now given, propeller planes suffer indeed from heavy drag when tuned down, but mostly sure all planes will almost immediately lose speed and altitude when powered off. The level demonstrations were more to show just how long it took to lose speed without loosing altitude, the minimum speed in the last one were just for the fun of it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try to find data on a planes lift/drag ratio which happens to equal the glide ratio (distance traveled forward divided by altitude lost). \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare that to L/D from FAR flight data.
