I usually set the ejection force slider bar about a third to halfway along and this helps the fairing clear the payload. Also make sure there is enough clearance inside the fairing between the payload and the fairing base (use something as a fairing adapter). I also use clamshell deploy, but I think that makes the fairings more solid rather than less solid, so that might not have the desired effect for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
