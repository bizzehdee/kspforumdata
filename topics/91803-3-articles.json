He admitted that they were looking for \u0022partners\u0022 (either commercial or other nations) who would come to them and say \u0022Can you put us on the moon\u0022 and he would answer \u0022Absolutely we can\u0022 and that they would use the Enhanced SLS (ESLS, the upgraded future version) to take a partner\u0027s lander to the moon and lend them their expertise to explore the moon and \u0022maybe send a couple of NASA astronauts along\u0022 to help them out and learn some things\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was sort of talking the folksy way he does, but its really one of the few public statements he has made about doing things at the moon. Just previously he was talking about us becoming \u0022Earth Independent\u0022 and that future Orion flights were meant to earn us that capability. Such that ISS-based human flight duration studies would continue through 2024 and then switch to \u0022the moon for 5 to 10 years\u0022 before sending humans to Mars in the 2030s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting. Its good that they DO have plans and desires for Lunar studies beyond just flight-test flybys. Even if they don\u0027 want to start a \u0022moon landing\u0022 program they have a desire to see it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow awesome would it be for the ESA or JAXA to aim for a Moon landing in the 2020s, hitching a ride on the SLS?
