No, it is definitely NOT a feature, it may well be a bug provided there are absolutely no factors which may be contributing to the rotation. Try time warping, that will lock the craft on rails temporarily. When you stop the time warp, if the craft starts to tumble again, check everything, and yes, please provide screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
