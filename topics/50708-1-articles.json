I can then send them all from the results screen, but it would be nice for those times when you don\u0027t want to send the results right away and just close the results screen, or when you come back from an EVA and want to send those results, to have an action group on the antenna to transmit data, but there is none. You have to manually select the antenna and tell it to transmit each time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those hardcore players trying to fly in IVA mode only, it would make it possible as they wouldn\u0027t have to switch to ship view, select the antenna, transmit, go back to IVA, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for those times when you need all your hands on the controls and want to transmit, having a simple button press to transmit all data would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - antennas need a transmit data action group setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T20:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a Kerbal in and external command seat, you can do EVA reports / surface samples and immediately transmit them without storing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like transmission to be action groupable, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T21:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also thought that it would be useful to make transmission with action group. But if you run an experiment, you get the dialog and you need to decide what to do with the result anyway - it\u0027s not more clicking than anything else if you click on the Transmit button for each of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dweller_Benthos","CreatedById":15418,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T14:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that as well, you just click transmit a bunch of times and be done with it, but there were a few occasions where an action group setting for it would be nice. Most of the parts have action group availability for a bunch of things, I imagine it\u0027s just an oversight at the this point and, I hope, will be added later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
