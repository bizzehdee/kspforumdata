I was playing career mode (!) last night and was wondering a few things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. What is the most efficient way to get thorough the tree? Best I could figure on my own was to go down the science/electronics path as fast as possible to get all the science gear as fast as I could (more experiments per mission), and only get structural stuff as necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. (Related to 1) I think I saw it mentioned that using different parts and recovering craft also gives more science points, but I don\u0027t see that mentioned on the wiki yet, anyone have any info?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. With the new biomes and such, is there any plan to add an official mapper to the game? It seems like it is becoming more and more necessary, and it seems like it should be integrated into the science gathering aspect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. On that note, how is modding working with the new mode? Can I make parts that generate science, and incorporate them into the tech tree? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for all the questions (that most people who are up to date probably already know and discuss to death) but there is a ton of new info and I am still trying to get caught up. These forums produce a lot of content to weed through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requiem762","CreatedById":82185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T18:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
