Though it cannot land on water from the air like the *Spirion*, it trumps the other with its sheer speed, a whopping **120 m/s** in the ocean.\n\nThe *Dawn Racer* gets its name from the uncanny speed that it can achieve: **220 m/s** on land. Even on hilly terrain, if the craft is limited to a relative vertical velocity of under 10 m/s, it can go at any speed. It can also fly as an aircraft at approximately **160 m/s**.\n\n***Instruction Manual***\n\n1 - Toggle extra intakes. Reduces drag by a large amount.\n\n2 - Toggle backmost landing gear. Easy takeoff mode.\n\nTo take off, you **must** be on land. Warranty voided if water takeoff is attempted.\n\nHit 2 to raise the back gear. Gently pitch up, and don\u0027t strike the engines on the ground. Go as far back as you dare, and soon you should achieve liftoff. Raise your gear and soar to your heart\u0027s content.\n\nWhen you want to come back down, don\u0027t even bother throttling down. Hit the ground at under 10 m/s of vertical speed (relative to the terrain, if you\u0027re coming up on a mountain, you\u0027re screwed.) and you should be A-OK!\n\n**You must land on... well, land.** Ocean landings have resulted in Termination of employee contracts, shortly before their deaths. New applicants are still in the mail, so don\u0027t you try this too!\n\nTo go on water, simply enter at under 20 m/s. Careful of the long nose.\n\nThe craft is tested up to 120 m/s of water speed, but this is not advised. Stick to under 90 m/s if you want to be assured of your safety, and consequently your life. That or your paycheck, whichever you hold dearer, because we can\u0027t pay you when you\u0027re dead.\n\nExiting water is not difficult, however: do not exceed 10 m/s of forward speed. Engines striking the seas of Kerbin is common. Deploy your landing gear beforehand, as well.\n\nEnclosed below are several photographs of this craft in action. Learn to use it well, recruit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![kOAx2wP.png](http://i.imgur.com/kOAx2wP.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![tHb12Xd.png](http://i.imgur.com/tHb12Xd.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hdWjgDy.png](http://i.imgur.com/hdWjgDy.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Kh88X9N.png](http://i.imgur.com/Kh88X9N.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![HzsAZqH.png](http://i.imgur.com/HzsAZqH.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nGood luck, recruit.
