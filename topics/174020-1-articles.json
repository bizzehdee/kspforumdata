Basically whatever isn\u0027t directly exposed to the oncoming air (is in a heat shadow of another part) is icy cold so parts (or the part of a part) which aren\u0027t exposed are still radiating away heat just fine. Now that would make radiators really good during reentry, and that would make it obvious that the heating model is borked. So there\u0027s a hack: active cooling for radiators/thermal control systems is basically just switched off during re-entry, it\u0027s not that the environment is too hot to radiate heat into, it just arbitrarily stops working (well not exactly arbitrarily, but the point is it\u0027s not the laws of thermodynamics that stops it working, it\u0027s a hack which goes \u0022looks like re-entry! better switch off the active cooling of radiators!). Nevertheless, radiators thanks to their large surface area can still passively radiate away heat into the icy cold of the heat shadow, they just aren\u0027t actively sucking heat out of other parts, being limited to normal part-to-part conduction which is not\u00A0as effective. Though more likely a radiator will actually have a greater effect from the extra drag it causes than passive heat radiation, they have a pretty extreme \u0022drag to mass\u0022 ratio and if you want your plane to slow down better than it flies, add radiators (or for the best of both worlds, put them in a cargo bay).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that in KSP the plasma wake does not generate heat, IRL it bathes the vessel in infrared radiation but in KSP it\u0027s a purely visual effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-19T14:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2018 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by blakemw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-19T15:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the airplane\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nVUk1G5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022699\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nVUk1G5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221012\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand here is an exploded view of the mk1 fuselages attached either side of the main body\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hBB00UN.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hBB00UN.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn stock settings, unless you\u0027re re-entering at 5000 m/s from a Jool trajectory, only the Kerballed bits are at risk and the cockpit in particular.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Clipping stuff inside the structural fuselages does not hide them from drag or heat, the game still sees them as radially attached stuff on the outside of the ship, regardless of how you offset.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0And that stuff will make huge drag btw.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust swap to an inline cockpit and if that\u0027s not enough,\u00A0 increase wing area so you can make more lift and drag on re-entry.\u00A0 \u00A0 Lift keeps you out of the thickest atmo till you\u0027ve slowed up a good amount, and drag obviously reduces your speed and therefore heat too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lego_Prodigy","CreatedById":187421,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-20T13:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK I swaped the pointed cockpit for the inline cockpit.
