As others have pointed out, it\u0027s highly improbabl that any software of the complexity of a modern game will have no bugs whatsoever on release; we don\u0027t know what bugfixes SQUAD have in store for 1.0, and we do know that they\u0027ve committed to further updates beyond 1.0. Critics, please do continue with your valuable input of keeping an eye on what\u0027s not yet right with the game and letting SQUAD know about it, but please try not to be too negative about the fact that the 1.0 release is likely to be with us sooner rather than later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also add that personally I haven\u0027t seen Mr Kraken at all in v0.90, which is a vast improvement on 0.23.

There are a lot of dedicated but far less familiar players that could break the game in ways you never even dreamed up, because they DON\u0027T know everything and do a lot of wacky stuff that veterans know you just don\u0027t do,and won\u0027t even think to try. This is especially important since this will be actual release you are going to get a flood of new players. Previously this was all the early access players. A new build would come out of experimental\u0027s, and get punished by us regular folk...and lots of new bugs would be uncovered. This time around the game won\u0027t have that benefit. It will be getting punished by a lot of new players who are gauging the game as a fully release, bought off the shelf game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I am not saying go picking people all willy nilly. But it would have been nice to see some sort of process where players could apply for a shot to test it, and if you have access to the hours played on steam use that to get a good range of players. Me? No i would not be interested, but I feel that more time and a larger test pool needs to be used for that big 1.0 release. Or as someone said before, a few weeks where early access players abuse it. Since this is FULL ON RELEASE, you NEEEEEEEEED to have all your ducks in a row. This is prime time, going gold, all the marbles.

I would stop sale of the game in early access on steam and the website. Have a two week period where only those who own the game can download the 1.0 update, and let them beat it into the ground, while also giving all the mod authors that are not special enough for the elite club to optimize and bug fix their own mods.

Also, the reason they havent given us a list of squashed bugs could be because they arnt sure they are all gone yet. I\u0027ve programmed far simpler software, fixed bugs, then encountered them again later on. So something like KSP, they might think they got the bug, but wont say they did until the testers take a go at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"showell373","CreatedById":120061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T03:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI sure hope that EA never try to get their hands on this product and development team....straight to the crapper if they do....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T03:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoa whoa whoa whoa, what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYe Gods. o_O\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*In Jafar Voice* FAS-TAAAAA!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T06:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Esme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Esme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m a bit too old for that kind of screaming, but \u0027Yaaaaay!\u0027 from me, a round of applause, and \u0027jolly good show, SQUAD!\u0027. Tea and bikkies all round!\u003Cp\u003ETo SQUAD\u0027s critics, I can only say that there was a certain well-known company whose products I boycotted many years ago simply because one outstanding feature of their games proved to be that they were clearly never game-tested adequately, with the \u0027final product\u0027 released with game-breaking bugs that were never fixed despite which numerous expansions were sold, and customer complaints were solidly ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD, however, gives every impression of being a company that really cares about their product and the player experience. As others have pointed out, it\u0027s highly improbabl that any software of the complexity of a modern game will have no bugs whatsoever on release; we don\u0027t know what bugfixes SQUAD have in store for 1.0, and we do know that they\u0027ve committed to further updates beyond 1.0. Critics, please do continue with your valuable input of keeping an eye on what\u0027s not yet right with the game and letting SQUAD know about it, but please try not to be too negative about the fact that the 1.0 release is likely to be with us sooner rather than later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also add that personally I haven\u0027t seen Mr Kraken at all in v0.90, which is a vast improvement on 0.23. I\u0027m running 32-bit KSP on a second hand machine with 4GB RAM total, a creaky old graphics card, and Linux Mint. Sure I\u0027ve got the graphics quality turned down, but the game still looks great, and yes, I use mods, between 3-12 of them. depending on what I\u0027m trying out at the time in prepapration for my forthcoming attempt to colonise the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - \u0027Yaaaay, v1.0!\u0027 I\u0027m very much looking forward to it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^ This. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand people\u0027s worries, but some people seem to be forgetting that SQUAD has shown great care in wanting to squash bugs and release proper updates. Sure there\u0027s going to be bugs, and with how games are these days, bugs will always exist in some form or another in any game, but like the above mentioned. The kraken has yet shown itself to me at all in the .90 playing the game as I should be, and over all is very well optimized for many varieties of computers both old and new. This is something even AAA companies fail to do on a large average. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have full faith in 1.0 release. Bugs.. probably, in-fact I\u0027ll bet on it. Game breaking bugs? No way, because even .90 doesn\u0027t have any... Will it be \u0022release worthy?\u0022 Definitely. It has everything a full release game should have. Solid game-play, solid mechanics, few bugs, no game breaking bugs, and on top of that has a very passionate modding community already behind it to only further the experience. If that isn\u0027t enough SQUAD has already said they\u0027d continue updating KSP after release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENay-say all you want, SQUAD has done it right, and while the \u0022release\u0022 may seem \u0022rushed\u0022 to many, it really isn\u0027t when you consider how \u0022finished\u0022 the game was at .90.
