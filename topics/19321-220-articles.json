With that set up, adding 2 or 4 jets to have the same kind of control a Harrier has, with the current FAR nerf, will result in thrust that\u0027s either slightly above or nearly double what the Harrier has to work with.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it all comes down to what assumptions you make regarding hidden internal components. Do the VTOL vectoring engines (1) all connect to a single internal engine or (2) connect to their own individual internal engine. If it\u0027s the latter, than the thrust scaling up with the addition of each engine part is justifiable. At a certain point you run into absurd situations where internal components should leave no room for fuel (but then again the same is true of stock engines). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI mean, are you lightening the thing down to below 14 tonnes like the Harrier needs to take off?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was actually an 18 ton aircraft, but who\u0027s to stay I can\u0027t assume I\u0027ve got 2 hidden Pegasus engines in the fuselage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve never gotten the \u0022too realistic\u0022 argument with respect to changing the numbers that go into a particular function. Frankly, I think RSS-sized Kerbin is awesome, because it acts like you would expect. Besides, the goal here is accuracy in aerodynamic modeling, with only minor concessions to gameplay; I\u0027m already conceding that jet engines should remain super-ultra-crazy-drink-no-fuel efficient, there is no reason to leave them the oddity of having TWRs higher than rocket engines (considering the main advantage of rocket engines is TWR, that\u0027s messed up). Hell, the original point of the nerf was to keep the game enjoyable so it wasn\u0027t attach-engine-achieve-orbital-velocity-in-atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I get all that. And it makes sense with most forward-thrusting jet engines, as they continue to fly, just differently. The thrust-nerf is justified in 90% of cases. I\u0027m just pointing that the negative consequences for VTOLs were significantly greater. In the end it may not be worth bending over backwards to avoid breaking VTOLs, but I didn\u0027t see any mention of this issue, so I thought it merited at least a mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m starting to think I should just strip out all the jet engine behavior and tell everyone, \u0022You want jet engines?

Then if people don\u0027t like it, they can just delete that entire file safely, rather than looking for specific lines within \u003Cem\u003EFerramAerospaceResearch.cfg\u003C/em\u003E (and possibly breaking something).
