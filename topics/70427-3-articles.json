Kipard: I\u0027ve thought about smoothing out planes even more, eventually once I factor in drag planes will look less shaky.

However, it\u0027s a bit of a hack and not as good as support for the Through the Eyes of a Kerbal mod. With the FirstPersonEVA mod active, camera shakes will still occur while in regular EVA which is a bug and I couldn\u0027t figure out how to shut it off on short notice. Anyway, only people using that mod and while not playing first person will see the bug which isn\u0027t a big deal for me at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T00:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERe: plane shake: how about G-force?
