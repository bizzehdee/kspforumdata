I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t really help much with troubleshooting, as my work on the parts was simply repackaging them to work on newer versions of KSP and adding some more size variations. If your craft has power and you are not in time-warp, they should simply work. Do you have any mods installed that affect how part animations work? It\u0027s possible that there might be a conflict, somehow.
