So, I went and bought a new Maxoak 50000mAh power bank to use with it. It was going fine until it kept shutting itself off while I played KSP. If I wanted to play KSP, I\u0027d have to lower my rig\u0027s GPU to low power mode, or else it would trip the power bank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked at what happens whenever I did this, and apparently the battery rapidly alternates between being charged and not being charged while on higher performance modes. It would be stable, but the Maxoak is programmed to automatically shut itself off if it\u0027s not charging something. This makes it totally unusable.\u00A0 I went to Reddit with this, and I\u0027ve had no luck.
