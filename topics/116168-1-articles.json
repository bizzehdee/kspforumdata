Along with those I have plenty of other mods installed. Since my GameData folder is filled with the fine works of the modding community, don\u0027t expect pretty graphics here. With the RAM limitations I have, I preffer content over eye candy for the most part.\n\nOne note on realism: while I do play with RSS and RO (ongoing, for the first time for me), I am not trying to recreate the most realistic game behaviour that would be possible. RO has the limitations on engine ignitions deactivated for example. Remote Tech runs without signal delay. And I have several mods (and mod parts) installed, that are not \u0022certified\u0022 for RO (throttleable stock-a-like top stage engines for example, even though their characteristics make them less efficient in RO/RSS, the convenience of fine-adjusting the thrust is something I wouldnt want to miss). I am also not planning to recreate real ESA spacecraft like the Ariane series (although I might at some point) nor the ISS etc. This game is quite a step up in realism for me. But I am not going all the way yet. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nMy GameData currently looks like this (content may change during the diary):\n\n![UPbWTgO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UPbWTgO.jpg)\n\nThe game is running in sandbox mode, since career mod is currently not compatible with RSS afaik. KCT is putting some restraints on the progress though. And I am trying to not let efficiency go totally down the drain (like launching 1 ton sattelites with a 100-ton lifter due to lazyness ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ). Mid- to longterm goal are manned missions to Mars and maybe beyond (sidenote: I havent landed anything intact on Mars in RSS in the past so far when trying out the mods).\n\nAs always, comments, questions and critics are always welcome. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPS: sorry about my sometimes incorrect english. Its not my primary language, which is also the reason why my diaries are more image-focused compared to other storytelling mission report topics. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The first object to be brought into space of course has to be a communication sattelite. Crammed with dishes, antennas and solar pannels, these standardized probes will probably play an important role in the communications network that has to be established. The inductor engine with its supply of Argon gas gives it enough dV for repositioning into any orbit around Earth or even move to other orbital bodies.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![NB5sY7N.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NB5sY7N.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The ComSat is strapped onto a standardized light lifter and production was beginning...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![t26oIP5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/t26oIP5.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E 120 days later, the rocket was finished and rolled out onto the pad...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Hgr5bFn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Hgr5bFn.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E First lift off into the clear sky over French Guayana...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![j5sFWdZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j5sFWdZ.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The first SRB-based lifter stage pushing the rocket through the gravity turn...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![vOA1t9E.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vOA1t9E.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Fast ascent to avoid the signal gap over the Atlantic, where ground stations would not be able to reach the vessel...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![przxE3B.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/przxE3B.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Second stage taking over...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![CJQ3bdl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CJQ3bdl.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Exiting the atmosphere... fairings dropped...\n\u003E \n\u003E ![JJbK67J.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JJbK67J.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E When the second lifter stage was burned out, a stable but excentric orbit was achieved.

Excluding the exosphere, Earth has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:* \n\n- *Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)*\n- *Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)*\n- *Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)*\n- *Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)*\n- *Troposphere: 0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)*\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThe real ISS sits just above 400 km and is still subject to atmospheric effects (has to adjust orbit regularly since the upper atmosphere is slowing it down).\n\nIn RSS the atmosphere ends at 130 km.
