One of it\u0027s results is trickier re-entries. Hitting the lower atmo with high speed usually has explosive results. That\u0027s not a problem if you are coming down from a low orbit in a shallow angle, as the upper layers eat enough speed. But careless suborbital flights, or interplanetary aerobraking without a heatshield will be painful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe atmo change also means your most ideal ascent profile will no longer will be \u0027upwards than turn right\u0027 as in some earlier versions. You can start a proper gravity turn now after a few thousand meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd mods? Dunno, whatever you feel missing or want more of. Some people prefer parts, others go for more planets, better textures and visuals, contract-packs,autopilots, more readouts, subtle improvements of stock mechanics, added realism, etc. Though unless you have some supercomputer, avoid installing mods you don\u0027t really need. KSP runs in 32bit at the moment, so it can\u0027t really use much ram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough Chatterer and Kerbal Krash System are my favorite universal mods - they\u0027ll bring much fun regardless of the rest of your setup of how you play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd unless you computer was considered a potato even years ago, add Planetshine and Scatterer - those improve visuals greatly for the cost of no noticable performance loss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T20:09:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin vonKerbal","CreatedById":157973,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T20:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022go vertical until 10km up then pitch 45 degrees\u0022 method no longer works.

I assume you\u0027ve recovered by now from all the changes. I\u0027ve always played (since 0.18 so not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0early) as if the things that didn\u0027t matter did matter\u2014no sudden 45\u00B0 for me, always going for what seemed \u201Crealistic\u201D re-entries to me. To be honest I still don\u2019t know for sure what constitutes a realistic re-entry, but traversing a quarter of the globe in flaming ball of plasma seems more realistic to me then entering the atmosphere at a 90\u00B0 angle coming in at 3000 m/s, open the chutes at 500 AGL with a blistering 35G and have the crew still smiling after landing. As a result, the various updates weren\u0027t that game-breaking to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I\u0027d play without any mods first, to get a feel for \u201Cthe new game\u201D first. Maybe add non-part mods and none-physics changing mods first. KAC, chatterer, DPAI, etc. And then start adding back the mods you\u0027re used to, a couple at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T22:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t already noticed, you should know that KAS has been split into \u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E mods: Kerbal Inventory System (KIS), which provides kerbals with the ability to pick up and put down parts (although now only engineers can attach and remove parts, and only if they have tools to do so); and Kerbal Attachment System (KAS), which has all the winches and grappling hooks and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvustech","CreatedById":111036,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T18:00:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone. \u00A0 I haven\u0027t gone into the visuals mods yet, but I\u0027ve got the USI suite and KAS/KIS and SCANsat all back to life. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve discovered flying aircraft is actually *easier* than it used to be, but rocketeering takes a good bit more work. \u00A0\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 isn\u0027t always functional anymore, either. \u00A0I had one design which kept burning up in the atmosphere trying to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eleave\u003C/em\u003E, going beyond the temp threshold for the Mk1 pod. \u00A0I ended up fixing this by adding weight, using two adapters and one of the mid-size gray fuel tanks in place of the smaller tanks you get in the early game. Easily the first time I found it easier to get a ship up to orbit because I added weight, much less that weight being fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
