I\u0027ve seen and/or used and tested a few mods out there that seemingly do a part of what I asked. What I have in mind is that some basic resource, like ore, would need to be transferred or shipped to a processing plant that would then split that up into several other interim resources. These would then need to be shipped or transferred to another set of processing plants that would create a series of final products to be sold in the kerbin market place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMarket place? Economy? Yes, a simple supply/demand model that could work on a daily/weekly scale.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote, I\u0027m stopping here because the idea might be plain stupid or impossible.
