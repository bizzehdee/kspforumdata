After two years, the XT has been redesigned. You can find the link to the old one at the end of this text.\n\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in 1984 Lowell wanted to compete with the cheap Japanese sports cars that had flooded the market. Instead of designing one themselves they decided to buy a design from a well known designer. It was cheap to produce with a low part count and had an excellent low drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zFkSWAe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zFkSWAe.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe XT showing it\u0027s typical wedge shape.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lowell XT was launched in February 1985 to the global market, only three days after the Subaru XT. Subaru immediately sued Lowell because the shape of the two cars had too much in common, also the name XT was a problem. This was settled out of court but costed Lowell a lot of money, and they also payed the press a lot to keep the case silent. Part of the agreement was that Subaru would name the XT \u003Cq\u003EAlcyone\u003C/q\u003E for the local market. In return Lowell agreed to redesign the front and drop the hidden headlamps in favor of a more standard design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221T7X0dw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1T7X0dw.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOn the left the 1987 XT, on the right the 1985 XT.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was determined the designer had stolen the design through corporate espionage.

However there were complaints as well. The ride height was more akin to a sedan and the springs and shocks were too soft, comparable with a sedan as well. To prevent tipping over a set of tires was used with less grip, resulting in relatively poor cornering and stopping power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WKemXPx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WKemXPx.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe complaints were heard and in 1986 the design team started with modifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ride height was lowered, also the wheelbase increased.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSprings and shocks were set to max.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe roof was redesigned using lighter materials, this lowered the center of mass.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe hood was replaced with one using less parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe front was redesigned, making it lighter and giving it a more modern look.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe rear lights were replaced with lighter versions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe interior received a lighter floor plate.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe fuel tanks, engine and Boost Flap were lowered and drag reduced.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWheels were set at a camber of 3 degrees.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDownforce was set to zero.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe changes were dramatic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMass dropped from 6.81t to 5.59t.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPart count dropped from 114 to 94.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMax speed increased from 336 km/h to 396 km/h.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMax sustained G in corners increased from 2.1 to 3.0.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFeatures stayed the same:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n2x Juno jet engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBrake lights.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBoost Flap.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStock parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I-Lowell-XT-1985-11\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELowell XT 1985\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I-Lowell-XT-1987-10\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELowell XT 1987\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
