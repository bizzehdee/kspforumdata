Fins produce little to no drag when flying straight, but as soon as the rocket tries to flip, the fins are turned into the airstream and start dragging hard. This rights your rocket back up.\n\nAlso, *more boosters* ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Between 10 and 20 km you should already be at least 45 degrees pitched over, likely more. If you\u0027re only going between 200 and 300 m/s at that point, your rocket will simply fall out of the sky like a spear thrown by a nerdy elementary school kid. Even in the old \u0022souposphere\u0022, you\u0027d have been too slow; now with the more realistic, less soupy aerodynamics, you\u0027re even more too slow.

Add more fins.\n\nIt\u0027s almost always better to rely on active guidance of an unstable rocket than to increase the mass and the drag of a rocket to make it stable.\n\nFins are like training wheels. They can help you pilot a rocket, if you can\u0027t fly it well enough otherwise. But if your piloting skills (or autopilot) are up to the task, fins just reduce the overall performance. Real rockets generally don\u0027t use fins these days, unless they\u0027re intended for low-altitude flight, because the guidance systems have become good enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:58:13Z","Content":"Echoing others:\n\nYou need to keep your CoL below/behind CoM throughout the atmospheric portion of the flight in order to maintain aerodynamic stability. Heavy bits at the front, draggy bits at the back: think of a dart or an arrow.\n\nAdding fins to the bottom and removing draggy things from the top will lower the CoL. You may also be having CoM shift problems; tanks drain from the farthest first, so a rocket made of many small tanks will shift its CoM downwards during flight. Using the right-click menu to lock off a few of the upper tanks in the early stages of the flight may be helpful.\n\nSecond stage fins can be helpful. For example, this rocket has fins on both first and second stage. If they were on the first stage only, it would lose stability after dropping the boosters; if they were on the second stage only, the CoL would be above CoM during the booster burn, again causing a loss of stability.\n\n![TKql5df.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TKql5df.jpg)"}]}
