My name is Rafael Calonzo Jr., and I am the Senior 2D Animator on Kerbal Space Program 2. You may be wondering \u2014 as I did when they first approached me for this role \u2014 why would a realistic space travel simulation need two-dimensional animation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u2019s go back to a weekday morning in 2013. Nate Simpson (KSP2 Creative Director) and I are working on an ill-fated mobile title. He mentions how tired he is from playing some game into the early morning hours and \u2014 as proof \u2014 sends me a link to a forum post featuring his very complicated (yet still plausibly realistic) spaceship. It was gathering ample praise from the other forum dwellers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI poke around the site as he continues to rave about the game\u2019s unyielding faithfulness to real science and technology. I nod politely and promise to give it a try, but in my head I have already decided that some nerdy pastimes are too impenetrable, even for nerds like me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour years and several jobs later, Nate inquires whether I\u2019d like to join him on a new project that is basically his \u201Cdream game.\u201D As he starts describing it to me, I interject that it sounds like that game he was obsessed with years ago that, full disclosure, I never actually tried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can guess, he confirmed that yes, that was the game, the new project was its TOP SECRET sequel, and actually it\u2019s fine that I didn\u2019t play it because now could I help\u00A0 make tutorials for people like myself?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTutorials? Nobody LOVES tutorials. They are the vegetables Mom makes you eat before you get any dessert. It doesn\u2019t matter how essential those vitamins are or how fancy the veggies are dressed up, you just want to choke them down (or slyly spit them into a napkin) so you can get to the chocolate cake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure aria-describedby=\u0022caption-attachment-6361\u0022 class=\u0022wp-caption aligncenter\u0022 id=\u0022attachment_6361\u0022 style=\u0022width: 640px\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Figure-2-768x432\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/5RcBfsQU4fjR4FkT9X6kQG/6dd54776b3cec085b6759581b7f66a08/Figure-2-768x432.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\u0022wp-caption-text\u0022 id=\u0022caption-attachment-6361\u0022\u003E\nFigure 2 It\u2019s not rocket science (yes, it is)\n\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut from our very earliest meetings, we wondered how we could\u00A0 recapture that cohort of players who tried the original KSP but would give up before they got to experience the real \u201Cmagic\u201D of the game. However, to actually progress that far, they\u2019d need to \u2014 NO BIG DEAL \u2014 learn a little bit of rocket science. What could we do to keep those players engaged, while stealthily imparting the skills and knowledge they\u2019d need to really flourish?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually the question became: Is it possible to make tutorials that \u2026 sneak veggies into the dessert? Could we make instructional media that was approachable, with lessons that would creep into your head without you realizing? What would those tutorials look, sound, and feel like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe spent some time reflecting on what types of instruction managed to survive in our brains since childhood. Like most Gen-X kids raised by television, we could count to twelve before kindergarten because that pinball machine from \u201CSesame Street\u201D looked cool and had a soundtrack that slapped. We can still sing about how bills and conjunctions function because of \u201CSchoolhouse Rock.\u201D We\u2019ve won half the battles by knowing how to pet strange dogs and not hide in old refrigerators thanks to \u201CGI Joe\u201D PSAs. And as adults we binged dozens of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKurzgesagt explainer videos\u003C/a\u003E like the colorful, addictive-yet-informative fun-size candy that they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur super-unscientific findings: \u003Cstrong\u003EWORDS \u002B MOVING DRAWINGS = \u00A0IDEAS STICK TO BRAIN GOOD.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the concepts we experimented with in pre-production had mixed success.

Especially when I tried to portray actual vessels and parts from our game. And unfortunately the strokes around everything were prone to making weird seams on the characters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure aria-describedby=\u0022caption-attachment-6362\u0022 class=\u0022wp-caption aligncenter\u0022 id=\u0022attachment_6362\u0022 style=\u0022width: 640px\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Figure-3-768x432\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/7K73y5JLcECxscESr85Guh/d6f14d9c1feec5bdb70e8ccb93889865/Figure-3-768x432.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\u0022wp-caption-text\u0022 id=\u0022caption-attachment-6362\u0022\u003E\nFigure 3 Please turn off all personal electronic devices and 12 point outer strokes, Jeb\n\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAt different points of pre-production, we even considered making the tutorials pre-rendered 3D, real-time 3D, or real-time 2D puppets. Eventually we settled on a flat, pre-rendered 2D style that would be easier on production and (hopefully) more legible for the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure aria-describedby=\u0022caption-attachment-6363\u0022 class=\u0022wp-caption aligncenter\u0022 id=\u0022attachment_6363\u0022 style=\u0022width: 640px\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Figure-4-768x432\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/7zePO8zyhOqroxen8gRNjq/014a348a920d27b05bc962f9a32e471f/Figure-4-768x432.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\u0022wp-caption-text\u0022 id=\u0022caption-attachment-6363\u0022\u003E\nFigure 4 Goodbye outer strokes, hello outer space\n\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPre-production was also the perfect time to refine the content of the tutorials before we made any final assets. Each completed tutorial script was run through a text-to-speech utility to create \u201CRobo-talkies\u201D of the narration. Then I would draw dozens of corresponding storyboards and combine them with the Robo-talkies into an \u201Canimatic.\u201D This picture book-style rough cut of the video gives enough of a sense of the visuals and timing that I can share it with the team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure aria-describedby=\u0022caption-attachment-6364\u0022 class=\u0022wp-caption aligncenter\u0022 id=\u0022attachment_6364\u0022 style=\u0022width: 640px\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Figure-5-768x432\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/6FrJV8wH1RRqjTUsIRiIiq/06b92b78bd17aa9d69bb08a229b021e9/Figure-5-768x432.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\u0022wp-caption-text\u0022 id=\u0022caption-attachment-6364\u0022\u003E\nFigure 5 A storyboard from a scene I was really looking forward to animating, but it didn\u2019t make the cut. Get well soon forever, Buzz.\n\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe completed storyboards and animatics for all 32 tutorial scripts added up to 47 minutes of animation \u2014 half an animated feature! Which is kind of a lot for one guy (me) to produce and more importantly, way too much for the players to sit through. So we redistributed the content, making skill-based lessons into interactive sequences, while reserving the animations for scientific concepts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure aria-describedby=\u0022caption-attachment-6365\u0022 class=\u0022wp-caption aligncenter\u0022 id=\u0022attachment_6365\u0022 style=\u0022width: 640px\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Figure-6-768x432\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/5iGauDoco5I05QtABFYGpY/605b997ced7d1c0c246f680cf1d5d2de/Figure-6-768x432.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\u0022wp-caption-text\u0022 id=\u0022caption-attachment-6365\u0022\u003E\nFigure 6 We heard you liked planes in your rocket game\n\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce we had our scope dialed in, we conscripted a ragtag production team to bring the videos to life. My fellow \u201CRafael\u201D at Squad, Rafael Gonzalez, and a selection of other talented artists cranked out the cartoonified planets, backgrounds, and vessels in record time. Tom Witte and Cisco Martinez, two colleagues of mine from the CD-ROM Wars who\u2019ve since graduated to the motion graphic world, lent their multitude of animation super-powers and made my life so much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure aria-describedby=\u0022caption-attachment-6366\u0022 class=\u0022wp-caption aligncenter\u0022 id=\u0022attachment_6366\u0022 style=\u0022width: 640px\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Figure-7-768x432\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/47UxxKgLSIJhA2UvovtNtn/c5d1aa1048251470e3e7a7cc27003573/Figure-7-768x432.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cfigcaption class=\u0022wp-caption-text\u0022 id=\u0022caption-attachment-6366\u0022\u003E\nFigure 7 Dream, build, fly\u2026 into the ground\n\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs much as we enjoy making these things, we know that nobody buys this game to sit and watch cartoons.
