Even the official Kerbol wiki notes that the solar lumens output of Kerbol matches that of a class M Red Dwarf.  The stock system having a small yellow star is actually kinda physically impossible as we understand things... lol,\n\nFrom the offical wiki entry for Kerbol:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Based on its given size and temperature, Kerbol\u2019s luminosity would be 56.7 yottawatts, however this is contradicted by other in-game physical parameters. The value of the solar constant at Kerbin is 1360 W/m\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ^2^, which implies a solar luminosity of 3.16 yottawatts (0.008 Solar luminosities) and a surface temperature of 2840 K. These values are consistent with a [Class M red dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf \u0022w:Red dwarf\u0022).\n\u003E \n\nAnyhow, yes I will upload my mod.  Just a second.  It does not same to mess anything up, but it does require Kopenicus for some small changes (Sun surface temp and name changed to Kerbol, basically), and AVP for other visuals.\n\nHere.  Even without Kopernicus and Astrononomers Visual Pack, you get the color changes no problem and nothing malfunctions:\n\nPlease keep in mind this overwrites your stock scatterer config, because I was too lazy to do modulemanager stuff and was just hacking around.  You can reinstall scatterer from stock to get rid of it.\n\nEDIT: Old Alpha Link removed, see below for download\n\nI am releasing this as open domain, license in the zip as a .txt announcing that it is no license, unlicensed.  This is hardly a proper release, so I really don\u0027t care.  Just sharing a config. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nINSTALL:  Just extract the subfolders of the gamedata folder in the zip into...  wait for it, the gamedata in your ksp install.\n\nIf you want to tweak this, just look at the files I included.  I bet you can figured it out.  Remember that computers think of colors as pairs of Red Green and Blue, in that order.  SunColor in this mod is set to strength of each being 1.0, 0.15,0.15 respectively.  You could make blue stars or green stars if you got crazy, lol.\n\nFINAL THING FOR TODAY (as I am getting offtopic):\n\nI\u0027m officially making this a mod, but will be maintaining it offsite at a community I frequent more.
