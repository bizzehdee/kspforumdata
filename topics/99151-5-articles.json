Especially the youngest, whom he\u0027d found wandering in the darkness and adopted. He loved them so much, with the help of beings called the Servants, he created the whole universe just to please them, and set it dancing to the Great Song. For ages and ages they danced and circled one another in happiness. But one day, the great evil that lived in the darkness descended upon them, for it was none too happy to see such merriment, and creation, and life. It was recorded only as the Adversary, and it did battle with the Sky King right there in his dance hall. The Sky King struck off its right hand, but the Adversary\u0027s counter-stroke was about to strike down the King himself, when the youngest daughter threw herself upon it, and gouged out its eyes with her brooch pin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But she was young and small, the Adversary overpowered her, held its blade to her neck, and demanded the Sky Kings kill all the Servants, and then himself, with his own blade. The youngest daughter was cunning, however; she stabbed herself in the right hand with the brooch pin, her own blood mixing with the Adversary\u0027s, and threw it to the Servants, imploring them to bind the Adversary with it. The Sky King begged them not to, but they acted quickly, and trapped the Adversary within the girl, transforming the brooch into the seal. But the Servants warned that the seal was imperfect, and would eventually degrade and weaken.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas listened, enthralled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now here\u0027s where it gets interesting. The seal was divided into three parts, the first stayed with the youngest daughter, the other two, as well as the Hand, were given to a figure called the World-Mother, and then to her two sons for safe keeping. In the end, the poor girl went mad, and the Sky King was so devastated that he cast the Servants out into the darkness, but not before they distilled some of their power, and gave it in a vessel to the World Mother, for when it was needed again. The Sky King\u0027s grief was too much for him to bear, so he turned himself and all the people of the universe into stars, so they would never feel again, except the World-Mother and her sons, who guarded the seals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s.... awful.\u0022 Edgas said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey fired the thrusters again, \u0022Not every fairy tale has a happy ending, lad,\u0022 Chadvey said softly, \u0022you should hear the one about the mermaid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you think all that really happened?\u0022 Edgas asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course not,\u0022 Said Chadvey with a great laugh, \u0022Ah\u0027m pretty sure Jool is a four an\u0027 something billion year old gas giant planet, not the repose of an ancient demigod. But the allegory is certainly compelling, once you add this: the probe to the Jool system several years ago detected anomalous readings nearly identical to the one on the M\u00FCn when it flew past the smallest, farthest moon... which is thought to be an \u0027adopted\u0027 asteroid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas thought for a moment.

The probe did indeed run out of fuel and crash into Jool... \u003Cem\u003Ebecause\u003C/em\u003E of the maneuver that brought it to within a few kilometers of the surface of Bop. Took me years of digging to uncover that, rebuilding backup tapes byte by byte, and one extremely unpleasant summer goodwill tour through Ussari picking through intercepted transmission recordings.

What he thought might be\u00A0the engine bell was enormous, but instead of solid metal it was a lattice of flimsy looking stringers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked back at Chadvey, \u0022how do I not know about this?! That must have taken dozens, \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of launches, I never saw any contracts!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Take a closer look, lad,\u0022 Chadvey said with a wink. Edgas did, and as they neared, it became obvious. The logo was right there, emblazoned on every other sphere. And on the ones it wasn\u0027t, it was spelled out in letters a meter high. Layland-Wutani.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Company?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Agency had no hand in this one,\u0022 said Chadvey, \u0022the Company financed the whole project. Then contracted the Ussaris to launch it from a site in Cerima. Easy to keep secrets there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why? It\u0027s enormous, what could they possibly need a ship that size for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ostensibly, it\u0027s for a crewed Grand Tour of all the planets. What the real purpose could be, Ah haven\u0027t the foggiest. But we\u0027ve caught it at an advantageous point in the construction. The drive system, most of the fuel, basic living quarters, and one small lander are assembled, but none of the heavy science modules or mission landers. Means we can burn all that fuel and reach the Jool system in only two weeks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022TWO WEEKS?!?\u0022 Edgas exclaimed, \u0022that\u0027s impossible!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s another reason they had the Ussaris build it. They\u0027re willing to use technology even the Agency won\u0027t touch. You\u0027ll get to see shortly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey produced another object from... somewhere. Where was he getting all this stuff anyway? Then Edgas recognized it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A G.I.Jeb Real Action Hero Walkie-Talkie\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\u2122\u003C/span\u003E?\u0022 he gawked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh you\u0027re familiar with them?\u0022 Chadvey asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I had one when I was a kid. But why do \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E have one?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey grinned, \u0022cheap, disposable, low-power, virtually untraceable, and the electronics are so bad it even distorts your voice. Only a couple of hundred meters away now, should be in range.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe keyed the mic on the small radio and was greeted by a burst of static, \u0022zebra? Zebra? This is lungfish.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pause, then a hideously garbled static-laced response, \u0022lungfish, this is zebra.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good, they\u0027re there,\u0022 Chadvey said to Edgas, \u0022now the challenge phrases.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe keyed the mic again, \u0022Pyrex. Pickle. Blowfish.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother pause, \u0022Waterford. Cheese Dibble.

John has a long mustache.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey looked slightly concerned, \u0022the chair is against the wall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA crackle, then hiss, \u0022tip my canoe...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey looked relieved now, \u0022and tie it, too.\u0022 He turned back to Edgas, \u0022good, everything is in... what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas continued gaping for a moment, \u0022if you say \u0027I\u0027m a little teapot\u0027 next I\u0027m kicking you out that hatch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey pinched his brow, \u0022now why would Ah say a ridiculous thing like that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at him blankly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Besides, that\u0027s the code for a political coup in Cerima. The last one was just the other day, they\u0027re not quite due again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas raised a palm to his face. Another rolling wave of nausea was working its way toward his gut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, no more time to dally, best we be on with it,\u0022 said Chadvey as he fired the thrusters again, \u0022you may recognize the design...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas watched as the small ship neared the docking port. Indeed he did recognize it. The central module was the same design as the space station, and the M\u00FCnbase. Chadvey deftly guided the mule towards the port, completely by hand, until a thunk and series of clicks signaled it was secure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Welcome, lad, to the\u003Cem\u003E R/V Determined Consternation\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The\u003Cem\u003E what?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, they wanted to call her the\u003Cem\u003E Righteous Indignation\u003C/em\u003E, but Ah guess that name was already taken.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngineers. Pfft. The two Kerbals squeezed past the control panel to the docking hatch, Chadvey pressurized the collar, and they swung the pod\u0027s hatch open. A face appeared for a moment in the small window of the other hatch before it too swung open with a slight hiss. Two unfamiliar Kerbals waited on the other side. Two...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lads!\u0022 Chadvey exclaimed with his arms wide, \u0022ach, but it\u0027s good to see you two again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chadvey, you shaggy old goat!

They\u0027ve been with me since nearly the beginning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat bizarre crackling reality sensation was back, strong, this time. Edgas looked from Jerdous? To Burdous? And back again. They? stared back at him. Finally, one of them rolled his bulging eyes and clicked his tongue, and the other offered a hand and an uncomfortable grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, we\u0027re twins,\u0022 said the one with his hand out, \u0022I\u0027m Jerdous, he\u0027s Burdous. Er, welcome aboard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas shook his hand, feeling decidedly... unwell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-25T05:43:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2017 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T17:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003EChapter 30: To Boldly Go...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey broke the awkwardness, \u0022do you have the seal? Is it safe?\u0022 Jerdous took a small, wrapped object from his pocket. Edgas stared in amazement as he took the cloth off. It was identical to the white disc Chadvey had shown him, but unbroken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The second seal?\u0022 Edgas asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye, we found this on Minmus a while back. Kept it a secret these past years. It was our confirmation that the legend might be more than just an old story.\u0022 Chadvey wrapped the seal up and handed it back to Jerdous, \u0022keep this safe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What about the third one?\u0022 asked Edgas again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That would be the whole point of this little endeavor, now wouldn\u0027t it?\u0022 Burdous said, still looking annoyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One thing at a time, lads,\u0022 Chadvey said, \u0022how soon can we get underway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re almost ready,\u0022 said Burdous, \u0022I just need to do a final alignment check on the containment array.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good,\u0022 Chadvey sounded relieved, \u0022the sooner, the better. Ah\u0027ve pulled so many strings now the whole thing\u0027s bound to unravel. It won\u0027t take long for them to figure out what happened to us. Ah\u0027d like to be gone before they do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, what?\u0022 Edgas had finally put the numbers together, \u0022we\u0027re stealing \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E space ship?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous looked offended, \u0022we\u0027re going to bring it back! Well, probably.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No sense dawdling in the doorway, let\u0027s be on with it,\u0022 Chadvey said. As he and Edgas floated into the docking tunnel, Edgas turned and began to close the mule\u0027s hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, leave it open,\u0022 Chadvey countered, \u0022the depressurization will help blow it clear. No way to control it on auto from here.\u0022 Jerdous shut the inner hatch, moved some levers, then hit the docking release. There was a loud \u003Cem\u003Ethud\u003C/em\u003E, and the small window in the hatch fogged over for a moment. When it cleared, Edgas could just see the mule tumbling away. He suddenly felt very vulnerable. And sick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey and Edgas doffed their launch suits and stored them as best they could in the docking tunnel before the four of them floated into the interior of the ship. The design heritage was unmistakable, but similarity to the M\u00FCnbase ended quickly. Where that had seemed open and roomy, this vessel was nearly claustrophobic. Every available space was crammed with equipment and storage. The galley was in the same place, but smaller. There was no EVA deck or proper airlock, that space was packed with consumables and a very serious looking medical bay. There were far more gauges and displays on the command deck, and six seats arranged around the perimeter. Edgas asked about the large hatch in the \u0022floor,\u0022 near where they had entered from the mule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s my engine room,\u0022 Burdous snapped, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E stay out of there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Easy, B,\u0022 said Jerdous, then he turned to Edgas, \u0022you\u0027ll have to excuse him. He\u0027s very protective of his little project here.\u0022 Burdous gave him a dirty look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, yes,\u0022 Edgas said, trying to sound amicable, \u0022Chadvey said this will get us to Jool in only two weeks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re flarping right,\u0022 Burdous said with a wicked grin, \u0022ten days in this configuration if I could run the engine at full tilt. You\u0027ve heard of a fission fragment rocket?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas thought for a moment, \u0022yes, actually. It\u0027s like a nuclear reactor with one end open... channeling the atomic chain reaction products into the exhaust even as they\u0027re undergoing fission, using magnetic fields. But I thought they were like ion engines; high efficiency but low thrust?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous gave him a considering look, \u0022so you do know a thing or two. That\u0027s an accurate, if elementary description.\u0022 He ran a hand lovingly along a beam overhead, \u0022but the Ussaris aren\u0027t afraid to take it eleven. This baby has an afterburner! All those spheres along the spine are full of hydrogen. Once the engine is running at the bleeding edge of its envelope, we inject it into the exhaust stream, loosing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E but ramping the thrust up by several orders of magnitude. And as if that weren\u0027t enough, the exhaust is still so hot that every few billion hydrogen atoms, a couple will undergo fusion into helium, kicking the thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E up even more. It\u0027s technically not sustained fusion but the bumps are imperceptible to us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe grinned evilly at Edgas again, \u0022what \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E means, is that we accelerate toward Jool at .8 gees for seven days, then turn around and decelerate for seven days. And if anything goes wrong we won\u0027t even be aware of it \u0027cause we\u0027ll be sitting in the middle of a two hundred megaton thermonuclear explosion.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas swallowed hard. Chadvey was grinning. Jerdous looked like he\u0027d heard it way too many times. Edgas \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E wasn\u0027t feeling well. His face was starting to feel all puffy and his brain and his ears kept arguing about which way was up, if there even \u003Cem\u003Ewas \u003C/em\u003Ean up, and his stomach was about to tell both of them in no uncertain terms to just shut the heck up, which ever way that was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, alright, that\u0027s enough scaring the new guy,\u0022 Chadvey said, \u0022let\u0027s move on.\u0022 They floated up the ladder to the crew deck. Jerdous and Burdous clung \u00A0casually to hand holds, while Chadvey just... floated, his legs crossed, his hands on his knees, and a wide grin. He just sort of drifted, rotating slowly. This room was the closest resemblance to the M\u00FCnbase, only here there were a full six accommodations instead of just three, each room with a number on the door, and a couple of unmarked ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You can take berth five there, Edgas,\u0022 Jerdous pointed, \u0022there\u0027s some clean clothes inside, and personal stuff. Also a tablet and some thumb drives in the drawer. Chadvey had me gather up all the documents I could about the seals and the Company. Should fill in on some of the holes. Maybe you could give us some fresh insight as well.\u0022 Edgas felt a disturbing burbling in his gut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey kept listing, not seeming to care, \u0022good point. Our first priority will be to secure the third seal from Bop.\u0022 Now Chadvey was completely upside down, his bushy gray hair wandering in all directions. Edgas\u0027s throat began to spasm. \u0022After that, Ah\u0027m not quite sure, but Ah do have a plan. Details just need some fleshing out, and...\u0022 He looked at Edgas, concern in his voice, \u0022are you all right, lad? You\u0027re looking rather green...er\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous gasped. Jerdous realized the danger and began pointing frantically, \u0022space bathroom! Space bathroom!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey\u0027s eyes grew wide. He grabbed Edgas, and half guided, half shoved him through the door, slamming it behind him. This was instantly followed by hideous, wet \u003Cem\u003Ehurk\u003C/em\u003Eing sounds from the other side. They went on and on, pausing only for the occasional cough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, now, catastrophe averted,\u0022 Chadvey said with a wide grin. Jerdous and Burdous stared open-mouthed in horror at the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But...\u0022 said Jerdous softly, \u0022...that\u0027s the closet...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was an especially forceful and drawn out \u003Cem\u003Ehurk\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey\u0027s grin only faded for a moment. \u0022Not anymore it\u0027s not.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESome time later...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were again gathered on the crew deck. Edgas hung from a handhold with a squiggly grin. He felt so much better now. Always did afterword, just had to get it out of\u00A0his system. Part of the acclimation process to microgravity. Jerdous looked uncomfortable. Burdous glared. Apparently he\u0027d been rather attached to that old shirt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey passed out some small bits of what looked like folded plastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022GentleKerbs,\u0022 he began, \u0022we are about to abscond with a vessel the value of which exceeds the GDP of most nations. Now, despite the somewhat questionable legality of our endeavor, we do so for the good of all Kerbalkind. In light of that, Ah\u0027d like to propose a toast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe produced a beverage bag of some thick, dark liquid, and squeezed a little out into each plastic \u003Cem\u003Econtraption\u003C/em\u003E.

How long \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E he been out, anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, I thought I\u0027d missed breakfast,\u0022 he finally said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You did,\u0022 said Burdous, \u0022and second breakfast, and elevens. This is lunch.\u0022 He had a tablet propped up next to him, still watching the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas blinked. He sniffed and... could it really be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s old, lukewarm coffee in the pot, lad,\u0022 said Chadvey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Help yourself to the pantry,\u0022 said Jerdous helpfully, \u0022we\u0027ve got like five years of food here with just the four of us, though the last of our fresh food will run out soon. Hope you like dehydrated mystery food in a box.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas followed his nose to the well-stained coffee \u0027pot,\u0027 more of an odd hybrid between a conventional coffee machine and a \u0027space-coffee\u0027 machine. He poured ink-black liquid into a standard mug, and took a sip. Grainy, burnt, and acrid enough to make the eyes water, but just slightly. Ahhhhhh, yes, \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E was the stuff. Another thought occurred to him, and he began furiously searching through the various cupboards and spaces. They had to have it somewhere, they \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Looking for something in particular?\u0022 asked Jerdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mush,\u0022 replied Edgas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mush...?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mush!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s many things in there that could be called mush... though I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen them labeled as such...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Must be here somewhere...\u0022 Edgas mumbled as he fumbled through drawers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mush?\u0022 Said Chadvey, \u0022that doesna sound verah appetizing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This, coming from a guy whose national dish is offal boiled in its own stomach,\u0022 said Burdous glibbed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027ll put hair on yer chest, lad,\u0022 Chadvey grinned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hair on my...? I\u0027m a Kerbal, why would I want hair in strange places?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Some of your space babes have hair in strange places,\u0022 offered Jerdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You leave them out of this!\u0022 Burdous brandished a spoon at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas took only slight notice of the banter. He was a Kerb\u00A0on a mission, it \u003Cem\u003Emust \u003C/em\u003Ebe some-- THERE! In a case across the room. That was an odd place to keep it. He trundled over, picked up the nondescript unmarked white box, tore it open and gingerly sniffed... Victory! He went back to the galley, not noticing that the others had gone silent. He poured some of the white powder into a bowl, added two parts hot water, mixed thoroughly, tried a small spoonful.... oh yeah, this was \u003Cem\u003Emush\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe took a large mouthful, and sat down at the table, still chewing. Only then did he notice the other three staring at him, eyes wide, mouths agape, horrified. Coffee dribbled slowly down Chadvey\u0027s chin. Burdous had a half-chewed mouthful of... something. Jerdous\u0027s fork had stopped half way to his own mouth, and a morsel of food lay forgotten on the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 said Edgas around a mouthful of mush.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing moved. The only sound was the distant thrumming of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas swallowed, \u0022what?? Do... do I have something on my face?\u0022 He pawed randomly at his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey looked at Jerdous, who looked at Burdous, who looked at Chadvey, who looked at Burdous, who looked at Jerdous, who looked at Edgas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s... not... food...\u0022 he said slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Its hull sealant,\u0022 said Burdous, \u0022for emergency repairs...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at Burdous, then at Jerdous, then at Chadvey. Then he shrugged and took another spoonfull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMmmmmmmmmmmm, fresh mush\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where did you \u003Cem\u003Efind\u003C/em\u003E this guy?!\u0022 Burdous asked Chadvey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So one thing no one\u0027s explained yet,\u0022 Edgas began, still chewing on mush, \u0022what exactly happens if we don\u0027t do... um, whatever it is we\u0027re going to do? What if the other seals break?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is he really that dense?\u0022 Burdous said to anyone who would listen, \u0022bad things, ok? Very. Bad. Things.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I heard, as it were, a voice like thunder, saying \u0027come and see\u0027, and I saw,\u0022 intoned Jerdous, looking blankly at the table, \u0022and behold: a pale horse. And his name that sat on it was Betrayer...\u00A0and Hell followed with him. He spake thus unto the Beast: \u0027Arise!\u0027 And so it did. I saw the sun become as black as night, and the M\u00FCn become as blood, and the Beast didst appear out of the darkness upon a chariot of fire. It had six heads, and upon those six heads were six horns, and upon those six horns were six diadems. Lo, I saw the Beast descend among the people, upon the righteous and wicked alike,\u0022 Jerdous suddenly looked up, and looked right at Edgas, \u0022and there was\u00A0wailing, and gnashing of teeth.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas swallowed his mouthful of mush hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ach, enough with the drama Jerdous,\u0022 said Chadvey, rolling his eyes. Then he turned to Edgas, \u0022as you can probably tell, Burdous here is our engineer. Jerdous is the anthropologist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s... an odd specialty for a Kerbonaut,\u0022 Edgas squeaked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous grinned warmly, \u0022I\u0027m also the pilot. \u003Cem\u003EHe\u003C/em\u003E runs the engine, I make sure we\u0027re pointing the right way. Fearless Leader there tells me where to point it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey clicked his tongue, \u0022It was Jerdous who first discovered the tablet and convinced me Ah wasna crazy mahself,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rediscovered,\u0022 Jerdous said with a hint of eye roll, \u0022sitting in a plain-looking box in a warehouse full of plain-looking boxes, forgotten for decades. I\u0027ve been to the temple site, and similar sites all over Kerbin, trying to piece this together. That quote was from the Third Prophetess of Gerin. Every culture has a slightly different take on it, sometimes deeply buried, but they all agree on one thing: if the seals are broken and Ba\u0027alzacropth is released...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kraken,\u0022 said Chadvey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yog-Sothoth,\u0022 said Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous rolled his huge eyes, \u0022if \u003Cem\u003Ewhatever \u003C/em\u003Eit is crosses into this reality... everything \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E in this reality will cease.

Suddenly he wasn\u0027t very hungry anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E purpose again?\u0022 Burdous pointed at Edgas with his spoon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027ll be clear enough in time, lad,\u0022 Chadvey said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dead weight if you ask me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Engineers,\u0022 Edgas sighed, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Epfft\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EDid you just pfft at me?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I \u003Cem\u003Epfft\u0027\u003C/em\u003Eed at you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t you dare \u003Cem\u003Epfft\u003C/em\u003E at me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EPfft\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You take that back or so help me...!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EPfffft\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gah!\u0022 Burdous screamed, \u0022I swear by the Queen\u0027s frilly brassier I will \u003Cem\u003Estab \u003C/em\u003Eyou with this!\u0022 He brandished his spoon threateningly at Edgas. It looked dull, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Children,\u0022 said Chadvey with a belabored look, \u0022we \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E all on the same side here.\u0022 Jerdous was smirking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me,\u0022 Burdous said, getting up, \u0022I have to go recalibrate the containment matrix.\u0022 He disappeared up the ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous sighed, \u0022I\u0027ll go talk to him.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally Chadvey stood, rubbing his face. He clapped Edgas lightly on the back, \u0022he\u0027ll come around, lad. He\u0027s always been a bit... picky.\u0022 Then he, too, disappeared up the ladder, leaving Edgas alone with his mush.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas stared into it for a long time, as if seeking counsel there. He was so used to it, he almost hadn\u0027t noticed at first. The crinkly-reality feeling, it was... stronger around those two. Especially Burdous. Well maybe. Maybe it was the twin thing. They sure didn\u0027t act like twins, though. But... could he be...? No, Edgas shook the thought away. That made no sense anyway, why bring them all the way out here just to...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBecause it\u0027s convenient, if overly dramatic,\u003C/em\u003E the scientist in him said, \u003Cem\u003Eno need to hide anything. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBah, he shook the thought away again.

Pity to waste good mush, but his appetite was gone. Maybe he should go have a look at those documents. He still had no idea what was going on, just felt dragged along by forces beyond his control. But one thing he was certain of. Whatever the truth was, the endgame was rapidly approaching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-26T05:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2017 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T17:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMan, the Eds and Billy sure got a long way into the \u0027Not food\u0027 locker. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I don\u0027t see Munbase fusion cuisine catching on though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally enjoyed the last few chapters.
