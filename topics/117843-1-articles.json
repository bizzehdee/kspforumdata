Let\u0027s thrash it out here.\n\nHere\u0027s my working definition of a self sufficient colony:\n\n- it could survive and eventually thrive \u0026 grow even if Earth \u0027disappeared\u0027\n- it case obtain all it\u0027s required resources \u0027under it\u0027s own power\u0027; i.e. it can use solar power or mine far flung asteroids and still be self sufficient\n\nI guess that\u0027s it?\n\nWhy do I think \u0027yes of course\u0027:\n\n- Earth is currently an example of a self sufficient colony - so they are clearly possible\n- To make another one you\u0027d need:  \n\n    1. sufficient quantity and variety of raw materials\n    2. sufficient energy\n    3. a benign enough environment to embed the colony in\n    4. sufficient \u0027capital\u0027 - by this I mean $$, hardware, knowledge, \u0026 culture\n    5. sufficient population to ensure a big enough market and genetic / cultural diversity\n\n    [\\*]It seem hard to argue that the solar system fails 1, 2 or 3. It\u0027s got all the raw materials earth does, just distributed differently. It\u0027s bathed in solar energy.

I wouldn\u0027t call the question decided one way or the other.\n\nYes, it\u0027s a complex issue, and it will probably take an active hand guiding and correcting the ecology, with probably an minimum influx of materials required to keep it going because of the inevitable inefficiencies. But the same people that built it would be living inside, ready to take an active hand in the maintenance of their home.\n\nI also disagree that Earth isn\u0027t proof that there can\u0027t be a closed-loop sustainable environment. Sure, conditions have changed over time, and we have evolved with them, but that is precisely the point. The *habitability* has been maintained for a *really* long time (nothing lasts forever, not even stars, so this is not a question of \u0022forever\u0022), even as the equilibriums came and went. And that is without *any* intelligent active influence trying to correct the bad trends like algae blooms, or invasive species, or human-caused global warming. And even then there are some promising examples, if we hadn\u0027t stopped using CFC\u0027s, Earth\u0027s ozone layer would be mostly gone by now, and we would be facing large environmental issues, and some tiny steps are being given in order to stop making a bigger mess of the global temperatures.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No one has succeeded yet. True. But that\u0027s \u0022yet\u0022.\n\u003E You seem to be assuming that the colony will be on a celestial body. There\u0027s no need for that. Bernal Spheres or Oneill Cylinders are perfectly viable. And if anything, they\u0027ll have very similar environments to a few locations on Earth.\n\nExactly. People tend to forget that the environment inside a big free-floating colony is probably more conductive to human life than Earth\u0027s... just because it was engineered to be so. No adverse weather, constant temperature, filtered and monitored atmosphere, no natural disasters... Hell, *gravity and radiation dosage are design parameters*, you can put them at the levels you like. Ditto for population density, if you are too many for the land inside the station, you build more land. There are calculations floating around out there showing hundreds of thousands of times the land area of Earth can be built using only main asteroid belt material. It would be like living in the most domesticated garden you can think off!\n\nThe *really* big hurdle is how you go from a 300mT station assembled from Earth components in 20mT launches bought with the lion\u0027s share of the world\u0027s space agencies budget, to a *kilometers* long steel behemoth built with off-world materials in a microgravity environment, that is itself dedicated to building copies of itself covering operation costs Kod knows how (what would those costs even be? difficult to say at this point). The scale of offworld industry required is just not of this century, and the path to growing one such industry is murky at best. At least economic growth is in our side, I once saw a calculation that showed building an interstellar Orion wouldn\u0027t more than 10% of the US budget by 2100, IIRC.\n\nRune.

They are open loop that relies on a constant resupply from what you can consider a semi-infinite reserve of air and water. Stick a glass dome over their heads and cut off their rivers and they will die.\n\nAccording to that approach of determining what is closed loop, not even the entire Earth is closed, since it receives the necessary energy from the Sun.\n\nHowever, OP has clearly stated that this hypothetical colony is not entirely closed, since it too receives, not only energy from the Sun, but also material from asteroids (space ecosystem).\n\nTake a look at this:\n\n[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html)\n\nHe hasn\u0027t opened the bottle since 1972, so apart from the light (energy) getting into it, it\u0027s closed system, and on a very tiny scale to boot.\n\nScale that up, actively control the population and you can have an almost closed system. There will have to be replenishments since the atmosphere will leak and there will be other material losses, but I believe it can be done if done on a large scale.\n\nMy guess is that a few tens thousand people with plenty of robots, and better space engines could survive without Earth."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:27:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E On a ring or cylinder space station with 1g inner wall acceleration and a decent metal hull, having children in space would be no issue at all.\n\nYou don\u0027t know that.

First of all, you need some sort of resource to build the colonies, to extend them, and to produce any goods other that recycled food, air and water. You won\u0027t get the materials out of nowhere. That means that you need access to some sort of celestial body, whether it\u0027s a moon, a planet, or an asteroid. If you are getting your material from a celestial body, they why bother taking it all the way to orbit? And again, what is the point of building an O\u0027Neill cylinder when you can build the same self-sustaining colony for much cheaper and much safer, on the ground?

First, it isn\u0027t a colony. We didn\u0027t dump people on it and build it. We evolved from it and we will keep on evolving as the rest of our environment evolves (and inevitable extinction is part of that evolution, whether you like it or not).\n\n If I magic-ed another Earth into one of our Trojan Points would it count as a \u0022self-sufficient colony in space\u0022 for you?

There is nothing appealing in living in an underground vault and condemning your kids to drink recycled urine, hydroponic lettuce, and never feel a breeze of fresh air on their face (if you can even have any kids when exposed partial gravity and cosmic radiation). It is the total opposite of why humans have ever migrated. There is simply no reason for anyone to want to colonize the solar system at a large scale (beyond some remote research stations), because the most hospitable places in the solar system will never be more comfortable or safer than the most unhospitable places on Earth.\n\n Rather than sitting in a hole drinking my own urine this is more the kind of thing I had in mind:\n![colonyart2.jpeg](http://archive.spacefrontier.org/HighFrontier/images/colonyart2.jpeg) though to be fair I imagine it would be more like living in a mall \u002B apartment complex for a long while.\n\n[http://www.space.com/22228-space-station-colony-concepts-explained-infographic.html](http://www.space.com/22228-space-station-colony-concepts-explained-infographic.html)\n\n[http://www.nss.org/settlement/physicstoday.htm](http://www.nss.org/settlement/physicstoday.htm)\n\nOne of Earth comfortable hospitable spots.\n\nPeople adaptable and there some unpleasant places to live on Earth itself.\n\n![skYQ1XN.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/skYQ1XN.jpg?1)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E BTW, you really don\u0027t want to be procreating and bearing children in space, the unforeseeable consequences and foreseeable consequences would argue that any \u0027colony\u0027 would be a people who are in the middle of their childrearing years or older, have had their children on earth.\n\n I think it\u0027s fair enough to be concerned with the issue, and to propose and investigate potential problems - but as far as I\u0027m aware we don\u0027t have a know show-stopper for a sufficiently shielded spinning colony.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First of all, you need some sort of resource to build the colonies...
