First, it isn\u0027t a colony. We didn\u0027t dump people on it and build it. We evolved from it and we will keep on evolving as the rest of our environment evolves (and inevitable extinction is part of that evolution, whether you like it or not).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E If I magic-ed another Earth into one of our Trojan Points would it count as a \u0022self-sufficient colony in space\u0022 for you? If it wouldn\u0027t then you standards are maybe a little too high, if it would then this Earth can be an \u0027in principle\u0027 existence proof for \u0022self sufficient colony in space\u0022 (albeit absurd as a practical proposal) and we just have to see how to \u0027scale it down\u0027 to something more reasonable. I think if it took a few hundred years to go to the point that \u0027the colony\u0027 could survive Earth disappearing then it would \u0027qualify\u0027. \u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EColonizing space is going to be uncomfortable, unpleasant, expensive, and dangerous. There is nothing appealing in living in an underground vault and condemning your kids to drink recycled urine, hydroponic lettuce, and never feel a breeze of fresh air on their face (if you can even have any kids when exposed partial gravity and cosmic radiation). It is the total opposite of why humans have ever migrated. There is simply no reason for anyone to want to colonize the solar system at a large scale (beyond some remote research stations), because the most hospitable places in the solar system will never be more comfortable or safer than the most unhospitable places on Earth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Rather than sitting in a hole drinking my own urine this is more the kind of thing I had in mind:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://archive.spacefrontier.org/HighFrontier/images/colonyart2.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022colonyart2.jpeg\u0022\u003E though to be fair I imagine it would be more like living in a mall \u002B apartment complex for a long while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com/22228-space-station-colony-concepts-explained-infographic.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.space.com/22228-space-station-colony-concepts-explained-infographic.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nss.org/settlement/physicstoday.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nss.org/settlement/physicstoday.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of Earth comfortable hospitable spots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople adaptable and there some unpleasant places to live on Earth itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/skYQ1XN.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022skYQ1XN.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBTW, you really don\u0027t want to be procreating and bearing children in space, the unforeseeable consequences and foreseeable consequences would argue that any \u0027colony\u0027 would be a people who are in the middle of their childrearing years or older, have had their children on earth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I think it\u0027s fair enough to be concerned with the issue, and to propose and investigate potential problems - but as far as I\u0027m aware we don\u0027t have a know show-stopper for a sufficiently shielded spinning colony.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst of all, you need some sort of resource to build the colonies...
