Let\\\u0027s see if I remember correctly: appears for the first time at 100km, at 20km the distance numbers appear and stay on, at 5km the name of the other vessels is added, at 1km it switches over to distance in meters, at ?? the little box vanishes because you can see the ship itself, and at 10m? all the labels disappear again so you can see the other ship better, but you can still get a distance reading by hovering the mouse over the center of the other ship\\\u0027s capsule. If this display gets in the way you can turn it on/off with the F4 key. So you can\\\u0027t change the settings, but it does get more helpful as you get closer.\n"}]}
