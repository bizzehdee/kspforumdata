You start with nothing but some money, the very most basic parts, and a mission agent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) You start with basic versions of a variety of types of parts, a bit of science already done, and a small refuelling/research satellite in orbit with docking ports on it for future expansion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) You start with a wide variety of parts, maybe a third or a quarter of everything yoou can ever get, a good chunk of science already done, a large station in orbit around Kerbin, a large base on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and a small base on Duna with a small station in orbit around Duna, and finally a multi-stage interplanetary mission craft orbiting Kerbin ready to leave at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould give people the option to start from scratch if they wat to experience that, or skip ahead if they\u0027ve already done it too many times or if they\u0027re just a lazy spoilsport who doesn\u0027t feel like actually playing the game fairly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T04:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode covers #1, sandbox mode covers #3, theres no real need for an in-between IMO.
