The first stage is a solid rocket motor, second stage is a liquid fueled engine and tank. Payload mounts atop the second stage beneath a fairing.\n\nUpon detaching the rocket from the carrier aircraft, I immediately switch to the rocket (I do have FMRS, so I can recover the other vehicle). THe rocket\u0027s staging is no longer Solid - decoupler/liquid - fairing/payload jettison. It\u0027s now something else, like fairing jettison - solid/decoupler - payload jettison - liquid. It\u0027s always the same scrambling of the sequence for a particular rocket... but different between rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:58:56Z","Content":"Try setting an action group for the decoupler and activate it that way instead of through staging."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:02:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Try setting an action group for the decoupler and activate it that way instead of through staging.\n\nMight have to wind up doing that to ensure the desired results."},{"CreatedByName":"JoCRaM","CreatedById":84138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:06:51Z","Content":"change the root node to the top of the air-launched rocket. when you separate the plane will carry on doing it\u0027s thing, with it\u0027s staging messed up - but there shouldn\u0027t be any staging on the plane."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:18:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E change the root node to the top of the air-launched rocket. when you separate the plane will carry on doing it\u0027s thing, with it\u0027s staging messed up - but there shouldn\u0027t be any staging on the plane.\n\no.O\n\nOh, I am SUCH an idiot.

The benefit of the decoupler remaining there is that the offset CoG helps pitch the nose up during the climb... Since I only have fixed fins at that size, every bit of nose-up moment helps!\n\nAlso... I\u0027ve discovered that I do need the added kick of the decoupler firing to get it clear of the cargo bay when flying at ~900 m/s.
