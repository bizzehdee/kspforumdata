The first stage is a solid rocket motor, second stage is a liquid fueled engine and tank. Payload mounts atop the second stage beneath a fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon detaching the rocket from the carrier aircraft, I immediately switch to the rocket (I do have FMRS, so I can recover the other vehicle). THe rocket\u0027s staging is no longer Solid - decoupler/liquid - fairing/payload jettison. It\u0027s now something else, like fairing jettison - solid/decoupler - payload jettison - liquid. It\u0027s always the same scrambling of the sequence for a particular rocket... but different between rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry setting an action group for the decoupler and activate it that way instead of through staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022A_name\u0022 data-cite=\u0022A_name\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry setting an action group for the decoupler and activate it that way instead of through staging.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight have to wind up doing that to ensure the desired results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoCRaM","CreatedById":84138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Echange the root node to the top of the air-launched rocket. when you separate the plane will carry on doing it\u0027s thing, with it\u0027s staging messed up - but there shouldn\u0027t be any staging on the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoCRaM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JoCRaM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Echange the root node to the top of the air-launched rocket. when you separate the plane will carry on doing it\u0027s thing, with it\u0027s staging messed up - but there shouldn\u0027t be any staging on the plane.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eo.O\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I am SUCH an idiot.
