(shadows are useful there ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nstage the service tower to free the service tower\u0027s arms.\n\nswitch to each of the two set of arms, and use your roll keys to open them. (you can use T to \u0027hold\u0027 the position of the arms.)\n\ndrive carefully to place the service tower around the rocket (up to nearly touching it with the tower\u0027s platforms), then switch to the arms to close them around the rocket (again with the roll control)\n\nto prepare for the launch, simply do the previous steps in reverse : open the tower\u0027s arms with the roll control, move the tower away from the rocket, and close back the tower\u0027s arm.\n\n**Launch sequence :** \n\ncrank up the throttle to the max, then hit space to lift-off ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) all of the pads systems are automatic and start at the same time as the rocket\u0027s lift-off (smoke generators and launch arms retractation)\n\ni usually like to start my pitchover between 5000m and 6000m - not a lot of time before the 1st stage burns out.\n\nonce the first stage is empty, stage once to both separate and activate the 2nd stage engines, and stage a second time to drop the interstage fairing. (this one part is hard to get infos on ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) some people says it detaches after, others something else - and the russians launch videos are particulary unhelpful on this point ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\ncontinue your g-turn (i generally aim for 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon at 20 / 25km, and 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 30 / 35km)\n\nonce the 2nd stage is empty, stage once to separate and activate the 3rd stage verniers for separation, and stage a second time to active the 3rd stage main engine. stage a third time shortly after to eject the payload fairing.\n\ni usually try to get an apoapsis around 100km and a periapsis around 20km with the 3rd stage before staging it (so both the stage and the blok D fairings would fall back) - if you burn out earlier, the blok D has a bit of reserve fuel to allow you to continue the mission.\n\ncircularise / correct your orbital angle relatively to the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with the blok D. (there\u0027s no reaction wheels at this point ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) use both the gimbals and the RCS to control the attitude ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nmake your m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn transfer (i pick use the standard one here (around 837m/s of dV from a 100km LKO) , no need for a Free return trajectory) - i aim for a 30km / 35km m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn periapsis - then separate the blok D from the ye-8 lander.\n\n**Lander operations :**\n\nfuel is tight from here, so be sure to quicksave several times ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nuse RCS / main engine gimbal to control the lander\u0027s attitude. (can create some unwanted roll sometimes, especially as the fuel tanks drains), but it can be corrected easily)\n\nshortly before arriving at your m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn periapsis, make your circularisation burn with the main engine. (should be a roughly a 1mn burn) \n\nthen, make a manoeuver to lower your m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn periapsis to less than 10km around your target landing zone (try to target a flat zone ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) the rover don\u0027t like disembarking on steep slopes ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).\n\nonce you near the periapsis, start your landing sequence - kill horizontal velocity while trying to stay under 100m/s of vertical velocity - slow down more and more your vertical speed as you approach the ground. (you can control that through both the spacecraft angle and throttle) early during this part, your drop tanks will be empty (check their fuel levels, but there\u0027s as much fuel in the drop tanks than in the lander itself), stage once to drop them (at this point, they will impact the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn) ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nonce you are near the ground with almost no horizontal velocity and under 10 m/s of vertical velocity, use action group 1 to switch to the two low power engines for the landing. (don\u0027t forget to crank your throttle up at this point - the engines are much less powerful than the main engine, but it gives you a much broader throttle control range)\n\n**Rover operations :** \n\nfor low gravity driving safety reasons, i disabled some of the wheel engines ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nonce you landed, stage once to decouple the two ramps. (if you landed on a slight slope, one of the two doors might fall back towards the rover, but it\u0027s not a problem - the rover will be able to push them - move the rover slightly away from the ramp, then back towards it to push it in it\u0027s correct position)\n\nturn on your parking brakes before decoupling the rover from the lander. once the rover is stabilized, move carefully down one of the ramps. - note, there\u0027s a control bug with the rover, you might have to click on the probe core and click \u0027control from here\u0027 to restore correct control. the probe core is slightly visible at the front of the rover)\n\nonce the rover made it on the ground, activate the parking brakes before decoupling a last time to deploy the solar panel. (the separatron hidden inside the rover will both push the solar panel away (it will dock back automatically to the rover) and provide stabilisation to the rover during the solar panel docking (the wobbling of the rover during solar panel docking was enough to flip the rover without the separatron ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))\n\nfinally, click on the rover\u0027s small ladder to deploy it to mimmick the rover\u0027s antenna ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) - you are free to rove around m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with Munokhod ! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nand congratulations, KSC\u0027s kitchen staff is angry at you, because you stole their pressure cooker to transform it into a rover ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nof course, you\u0027re free to disassemble the rocket itself to check how it\u0027s made ^^\n\nHave fun ! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T19:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sgt\\_flyer**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T19:38:33Z","Content":"That\u0027s a rather cute little critter there ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T20:12:37Z","Content":"I think your one of the best, most innovative builders on this forum man. \n\n This is a great piece of work and a great demo of your amazing tiny hinge.
