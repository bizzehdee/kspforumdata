Guess we\u0027ll have to wait until someone makes a new and improved."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T08:27:26Z","Content":"The observations most folks have been getting so far generally put the new LKO delta-V requirement between 3500-4000 m/s of delta-V, depending on how well you fly. The 4500 figure is indeed based on the old aerodynamic system, and it\u0027ll probably be a while until folks will have time to update the delta-V maps."},{"CreatedByName":"cramtenahc","CreatedById":25140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T08:28:18Z","Content":"Ok thanks !

The lower TWR the higher you\u0027ll have to start he turn - for high TWR around 50m/s vertical speed, for very low TWR perhaps when surface velocity is 100m/s and more. Slight burning effects above 10km seem to indicate the most efficient ascent path (height/velocity relation)."},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:49:31Z","Content":"I\u0027ve achieved 2,746 m/s of vacuum dV in a 100t vehicle, pitching to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 degrees very early on and lessening thrust to 20m/s at some point to prevent burning up.

I had no problems when following that guide, even in 1.0; although this is a habit I picked up from spending some time playing with RO/RSS for a while. Following that general guide also will make it easier to get rockets with lower TWR upper-stages into orbit, as they may not be able to pick up enough horizontal speed to reach stable orbit from a higher-altitude turn. I also happen to just like getting my periapsis out of the ground at least, during ascent, if not completely out of the atmosphere.\n\nIf you\u0027re using MechJeb\u0027s ascent guidance, I\u0027ve found that setting the turn-start altitude to around 1.8km with a turn shape of 80-90% and turn end of 0 degrees works out fine for almost all my designs, although anything over a 1.9 TWR(SLT) needs to have a lower turn start than that. Or else it\u0027ll get flipped/torn apart during ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:56:39Z","Content":"A decent DV budget for 1.0 was around 3,400 m/sec assuming you calculated it with vacuum Isp.\n\n 1.02 has increased the drag, so I don\u0027t know what the new DV budget is.
