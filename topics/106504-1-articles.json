I had no problems when following that guide, even in 1.0; although this is a habit I picked up from spending some time playing with RO/RSS for a while. Following that general guide also will make it easier to get rockets with lower TWR upper-stages into orbit, as they may not be able to pick up enough horizontal speed to reach stable orbit from a higher-altitude turn. I also happen to just like getting my periapsis out of the ground at least, during ascent, if not completely out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using MechJeb\u0027s ascent guidance, I\u0027ve found that setting the turn-start altitude to around 1.8km with a turn shape of 80-90% and turn end of 0 degrees works out fine for almost all my designs, although anything over a 1.9 TWR(SLT) needs to have a lower turn start than that.
