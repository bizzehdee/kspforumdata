It seems those pesky rocket designers had too much to drink and switched the order of two parts and we are asking for Divine intervention to correct the problem. From the images below you can see the TR-XL Stack Separator (stackSeparatorBig) and Docking Port Sr (dockingPortLarge) are reversed. I am sure I can complete the mission and just have the LV-909 Terrier burn off the Docking Port Sr after separation, but I would rather leave the docking port intact on the science lab portion. I intend to keep the Science lab in orbit. It would still have the Docking Port Sr at the other end, but this is a chance to fiddle. I know I need to address the solar / strut clipping, but I will do that later for new builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6u6wekQppUdenVVMWR2emRoRDg\u0026amp;authuser=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBroken\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6u6wekQppUdMnBkM0p3ajBRUlE\u0026amp;authuser=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFixed\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the SFS file which has the \u0022broken\u0022 vessel has the following relevant parameters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EprobeStackSmall (item 0) is my root part\u003Cbr\u003EattN = top, 74 (attachment node top is part 74 - stackSeparatorBig)\u003Cbr\u003Eposition 0,0,0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EstackSeparatorBig (item 74)\u003Cbr\u003Eparent = 0\u003Cbr\u003EattN = bottom, 0 (attachment node bottom is part 0 - probeStackSmall)\u003Cbr\u003EattN = top, 75 (attachment node top is part 75 - dockingPortLarge)\u003Cbr\u003Eposition = 0,0.19999885559082,0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EdockingPortLarge (item 75)\u003Cbr\u003Eposition = 0,0.299999237060547,0\u003Cbr\u003Eparent = 74\u003Cbr\u003EattN = top, 76 (attachment node top is part 75 - liquidengine3)\u003Cbr\u003EattN = bottom, 74\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ename = liquidEngine3 (item 76)\u003Cbr\u003Eparent = 75\u003Cbr\u003Eposition = 0,1.06281852722168,0\u003Cbr\u003EattN = top, 77\u003Cbr\u003EattN = bottom, 75\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I get away with just changing the parent, attN = top, attN = bottom parameters - switching 74 with 75, and position? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the order of the Part { } matter within a Vessel { } as long as the numbers are correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the position the center of the part or is it the face of contact with its parent? - Trying to figure out what the position parameters would be when switching the separator with the docking port.
