Indeed they are and they have served to influence the evolution of commercial airliners into their current configurations and operating regimes. Attempts have been made with aircraft like the Concorde and Boeing Sonic Cruiser to break out of that niche, but after 50 years of jet airliners being in existence, we are still plodding along sub-sonically below ~42000 feet\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E. Any aircraft design that is intended to operate outside of that niche will have to deal with the problems that exist there, and those may render the design too unsafe, too impractical or too costly to be viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003ESome business jets operate above that level, but for the people that can afford to fly in them, the convenience of uncongested airspace is probably worth the extra cost of certification, structural weight and operating restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin Dallas Multipass","CreatedById":79477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T21:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@PakledHostage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t you get higher fuel efficiency in the FL400-500 range, possibly counterbalancing the increased cost and weight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recall this as one of the reasons why several business jets are designed for silly altitudes up to 51k feet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: From what I read the typical cruise altitude for the sonic cruiser would have been around 45k feet\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T22:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith all due respect, I didn\u0027t realise that being a particle physicist made you an expert on aircraft structures engineering and regulatory compliance?

There can certainly be nuances that I cannot foresee, but it is rather unexpected.

I know that\u0027s sort of what OP was going for, but if I\u0027m talking about viability of a certain approach, you can pretty much assume that I\u0027m ignoring any economical factors. So, like, if I make assumption about crew being trained to deal with depressurization, I assume they have military-like training and can deal with it in under ten seconds. In practice, it might not be possible for airlines to keep crews that are this well trained due to economical realities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to fly supersonic airliners, I can\u0027t imagine any physical reason why we couldn\u0027t work around all of the problems. Feel free to correct me, but I\u0027d be completely shocked to learn otherwise. But I can easily believe that all of these fixes would cost too much for this to be worth it for passenger transport.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
