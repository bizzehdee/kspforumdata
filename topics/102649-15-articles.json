However, the thrust from the engines is always a constant acceleration, meaning that the belt must continuously and rapidly accelerate if it wants to overcome the acceleration of the engines.\n\u003E \n\nCorrect on all points. The caveat I\u0027m trying to point out is that all of this applies to a car on the belt as well. The \u0022thrust\u0022 output of car\u0027s engine does drop off with wheel speed, and there is an upper limit in theory, but it\u0027s way beyond the red line. Since a car is designed to overcome significant air resistance at cruising speeds, which isn\u0027t going to be present in the belt setup, it will still take an accelerating belt to keep a car in place if the driver is gunning it, and either the RPM limiter will kick in or something will mechanically fail long before this system reaches any sort of a steady state.\n\nSo for both a gas engine car and an airplane, if full throttle is applied, unless the belt constantly and very rapidly accelerates, the vehicle will be able to move forward. And if the belt does accelerate, within seconds mechanical limits of either vehicle will be exceeded.\n\nElectric cars are a more interesting case, as their motor speed is inherently limited by battery voltage, and their top no-load RPM tends to be at much more reasonable speeds. You probably could keep something like a Nisan Leaf on a belt/dynamo with the driver pressing accelerator into the floor without anything breaking."},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-22T14:10:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A PID loop on position of the plane OR wheel speed will result in constraints I\u0027ve given within reasonable error.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You need to keep in mind that what you really have direct control over is torque applied to the belt\u0027s driving axles, not the speed.

They experience an almost constant friction regardless of speed, which a plane at full thrust should be able to overcome. They have a whole lot of other problems when used as landing gear for an airplane, but none of them are relevant to this particular question. So if we are talking a plane on skids on a conveyor belt, it\u0027s definitely impossible to keep it fixed in place by varying speed of the belt.

That\u0027s not how any of it works. Rolling resistance in landing gear is low enough that a human being can pull an airliner. Compare that with traction, which is roughly equal to airplane\u0027s weight. More importantly, rolling resistance doesn\u0027t really increase with speed by any significant amount. It just isn\u0027t a factor. We can take wheels to be frictionless, and it will be a fair approximation.\n\nThe only reason the belt can apply a significant force on the plane, is because wheels are not massless, and making them turn requires energy. That energy has to come from work done by plane, conveyor belt, or some linear combination (as usual, depending on your choice of coordinate system). Either way, it means that there is a force applied by the belt on the aircraft, and that force is directly proportional to acceleration, as previously derived in this thread.\n\nFor a car, you have added rotational inertia of the transmission and the engine. That can be rolled into the moment of inertia I, so that doesn\u0027t really change the physics, but does dramatically reduce acceleration of the belt required to keep the car put. In addition, there are viscous forces in the engine associated with air movement through manifolds. This is why a car is capable of engine-braking. As well as reduction in engine efficiency at high RPMs. This further makes it easier for the belt to keep the car in place at higher speeds, but the car on the belt easily exceeds maximum RPM for both the engine and the tires.\n\nSo we are still back to the situation where there is no qualitative difference between vehicles placed on the belt. The critical factor remains the amount of mass that has to be turning for the vehicle to roll forward. It\u0027s pretty small, but not insignificant, for an airplane, and much higher for a car.

However, the sort of rolling resistance which increases with respect to velocity (hysteresis and oscillation/vibration) will produce slippage, which will reduce traction, which will reduce the belt\u0027s ability to transfer energy to the wheels via rotation.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You keep making up arguments, but it sounds like you have not taken the time to draw force diagrams and consider refernce frames.\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027re the one advancing a reference frame under constant acceleration.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Accelerating belt can keep in place a plane at full throttle EVEN if wheels are frictionless.

But if the wheels are frictionless and the wheels and treadmill components have finite structural integrity, then the treadmill components will fail before the wheel components and the plane will take off. Remember that your model requires the belt to be under constant acceleration, so the airplane need only hold its engines at a constant thrust in order to force the belt to accelerate straight up to relativistic speeds.\n\nIf the wheels have ordinary friction, then yes, the acceleration rate of the treadmill can initially be lower than with frictionless wheels. However, if the wheels have friction, then second-order effects like vibration will rapidly reduce traction to the point that the treadmill will be unable to act on the wheels.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ...while there are always non-constant sources of friction, for landing gear, they just aren\u0027t significant enough to consider at speeds it can possibly reach before failing.\n\u003E \n\nBut this begs the question.\n\nYour construction requires the belt to accelerate continually while the engines need only maintain static thrust. The engines can maintain full thrust indefinitely. Thus, one of two things will happen:\n\nA) The belt will accelerate until the speeds involved exceed the structural limitations of its components. Assuming comparable structural integrity between the belt and the wheels, the belt will fail first. The plane will then proceed to a normal rolling takeoff.\n\nB) The belt will accelerate until second-order effects induce slippage and reduce traction.

Landing gear is going to remain firmly in the static friction regime. It\u0027s what it\u0027s designed to do. A slipping wheel cannot provide lateral forces allowing any sort of control. And while rudder does assist at all in early stages of landing or late stages of takeoff, you rely on wheels for much of steering during runup. If wheels began to even just noticeably slip during takeoff before you are ready to rotate, you would not be able to keep the plane on the runway. This I can tell you from first-hand experience.\n\nThe second piece of relevant information is that I\u0027m aware of no plane that has landing gear that will survive more than twice the takeoff speed. In other words, the wheels will be rolling at most twice the speed at which they are designed to operate routinely, before they fail. At these speeds you are not suddenly going to develop slipping, excessive friction, etc. The wheels will continue to operate as wheels, providing static friction with the ground, with minimal resistance to rolling, and almost no slipping, save for that necessary for deformation at contact point.\n\nWe have race cars that operate at higher speeds than landing gear failure point. Other than additional reinforcement, their physical properties are not that different. If what you were suggesting was remotely true, these cars would not be able to keep themselves on the race track.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the wheels are frictionless and both the wheels and the treadmill components have infinite structural integrity, then yes.

Remember that your model requires the belt to be under constant acceleration, so the airplane need only hold its engines at a constant thrust in order to force the belt to accelerate straight up to relativistic speeds.\n\u003E \n\nThe landing gear will fail within seconds. We don\u0027t need to be talking about relativistic speeds. We can deal with real materials and real vehicles here. And real airplanes have very real limitations. Their landing gear is not designed for very high speeds, because at these speeds the aircraft is not normally in contact with the ground.\n\nYour statement that belt has to fail first has zero ground. There are just two places where stress is necessary. Centrifugal stress on rollers themselves, which are likely to be solid metal and can far, far outlast landing gear tires, and the belt itself as it bends around at end-points. Belt has numerous advantages. It can be made from better materials than rubber. It can have more reinforcement. It does not experience the maximum stress in the same place as maximum curvature. And it does not experience heating. If that\u0027s not enough, I can always increase the diameter of the rollers, reducing curvature at end points, minimizing stress. None of these mitigating factors apply to the landing gear. I can easily design a treadmill that can survive transsonic speeds, but real landing gear fails at much lower speeds. And if I were to try and design better landing gear, I\u0027d still be unable to make one that\u0027s going to both perform its primary function sufficiently well and survive at higher speeds as the treadmill.\n\nHeck, even if we use the same metal for landing gear hubs as treadmill rollers, same rubber for main surface on both, and same cables for reinforcements on both, the treadmill is still going to be under far less stress and survive higher speeds. And at this point, we\u0027ve morphed landing gear into something monstrous, and the treadmill is still just a treadmill.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Your construction requires the belt to accelerate continually while the engines need only maintain static thrust.

Real landing gear will fail way earlier, and one that\u0027s specifically designed to last as long as possible, made from same materials, merely slightly earlier. In both cases, in matter of seconds or less, I might add.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E B) The belt will accelerate until second-order effects induce slippage and reduce traction. The belt will no longer be able to continue accelerating the wheels, and the plane will take off.\n\u003E \n\nAnd this one\u0027s a plain impossibility. We are talking about thrust of the plane times hundreds of meters per second for this scenario, which is enough power delivered to wheels to melt not just the rubber, but the metal hubs of the landing gear. Meanwhile, the belt remains cool, since that\u0027s not where energy is released, and there is quite a bit of it, allowing cooling along the entire surface. If somehow you came up with magical materials that allowed landing gear not to fail in scenario A), this is where it fails. You simply cannot have sufficient slippage for takeoff without generating all that heat."},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T13:17:18Z","Content":"Quick google search shows max rated belt speeds today to be around 100m/s - around 200 knots - so it seems for high speed airplanes (most large airliners today have rated max tire speeds around 230 knots) both the belt and the wheels would fail around the same time.\n\nThe belt would heat up just as much as the tires would due to the mechanical deformation of the material as it bends around the rollers."},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T13:35:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, mrfox said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quick google search shows max rated belt speeds today to be around 100m/s - around 200 knots - so it seems for high speed airplanes (most large airliners today have rated max tire speeds around 230 knots) both the belt and the wheels would fail around the same time.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The belt would heat up just as much as the tires would due to the mechanical deformation of the material as it bends around the rollers.\n\u003E \n\nWhat on Earth does one use a 200kt belt for?!"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T13:40:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll just bump and quote this again, in case some of you missed the significance of it. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This exhibit puts\uFEFF a plane.... on a treadmill..... and it flies...... \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not a simulation or a video.
