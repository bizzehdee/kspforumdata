The Combine begins integrating humans into their millitary and harvesting earth\u0027s resources. They conquered earth with sheer firepower, giving the people and choice between submission and annihilation. However they don\u0027t want to destroy humanity, we\u0027re useful to them. Instead they plan to hold on to earth with a combination of mass surveillance, strict pollicing and brutal terror (Ravenholm).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T01:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00229911MU51C\u0022 data-cite=\u00229911MU51C\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll I\u0027m saying is, you cannot shoot down a \u0022they might not have all troops there\u0022 with an arguement saying \u0022 I know all troops are there\u0022 for one simple reason\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe don\u0027t know\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying all troops are there.

The pulse cannons are directed at enemy ground troops, not enemy aircraft, and so they can be easily taken down by fighter jets. The helicopters are using weak rockets and bombs, not AIM-120 missles.
