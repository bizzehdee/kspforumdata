You beat me to the official post, I have a lot to rant about and open to discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst, a modeling rant...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking the Cirrus was very challenging and I feel that I really pushed the limits of what Blender, Unity and KSP can do for such an abstract shape. There were many compromises but I am overall very happy with it, though if I were to redo anything I would redo the shield. The shaders are beautiful and the file structure, when you get used to it, is much cleaner. I was also held up by the changes with the new update, but I feel it was overall a significant improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe animation of the \u0022core\u0022 and \u0022shield\u0022 effects were done using two separate armatures. Both were rooted in the \u0022base\u0022 with an inverse kinematic tie into respective empties, acting as the top of each. These began in the same location, allowing for the starting egg shape, but would move and spin to give the unraveling and stretching appearance. Unfortunately, I was limited by Blender to less than 180 degrees of spin, but I still think that looks pretty dramatic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was most unfortunate was how Unity imported the Solidify which gave the core and shield its depth. While Blender itself can make the stretch look right, with the walls getting thinner as it gets larger, that does not work with Solidify. Perhaps if I were able to apply the armature deform and then the solidify, but that would take away my ability to edit the stretching motion further. Also, Blender originally exported the armature animations separately. I had to edit how it was saving the animations to get them all as one animation that Unity could easily control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo create the transparency effect, it took not one but two double sided ovoid meshes! The first uses a semi-transparent alpha to create the foggy condensation effect. However, this does not work for the overlaying grid pattern because the grid in the back was appearing over the front. If it sounds strange, it looked even stranger. Thus I had to create a second mesh, tucked slightly under the first, which uses the KSP \u0022Cutoff\u0022 transparency. That does not allow for semi-transparent, but it is perfect for \u0022solid\u0022 and \u0022clear\u0022 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize in advance to anyone\u0027s computer who gets eaten by this monstrosity, but it should not be much worse than an equivalent number of Ray envelopes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs for new code,\u003C/strong\u003E I found the texture issue was due to a really old thing I had left in the .cfg files. I was telling it to look for a texture that did not exist. That did not matter before, but I guess the new 0.20 parser takes that seriously. Commenting it out fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there had to be a change in the airship plugin code. Previously, I believe the part origin (0,0,0 in the model) was the center of gravity. That was perfect also for setting the center of lift. However, that is now different... It seems that it is using the center of the render box or something. So you can imagine that as the Cirrus would grow its center of mass would move far away from the center of buoyancy. Thus, it would flip upside-down!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried using part.Renderer.bounds.center with no luck, my guess is that doesn\u0027t reference the real renderer being used. But part.worldCenterOfMass did work! So now it floats correctly again. This should also fix the occasional bug where Ray would flip upside down as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOk, physics!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I do not have time to hyperlink all this stuff now, but Google is your friend!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the Cirrus made out of? The stretchy envelope and shield is a sort of artificial muscle. The exterior and interior coating is at least one layer of atom-thick graphene, which is highly conductive, tense and heat resistant. In between the graphene \u0022sandwich\u0022 is an elastic substance. When a current is applied the graphene layers are drawn together by magnetic force. The elastic is squeezed together and it stretches like a tendon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECirrus itself is actually using a vacuum for buoyancy. This has been proposed for Martian airships. Using a vacuum removes the weight of whatever gas you would have inside, like hydrogen, though you need something extremely tough to keep it from rupturing. Thus, graphene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how much should the Cirrus weigh? Well, it is as big as an orange tank. Kerosene weighs ~0.8 g/cc, and steel ~1 g/cc. In comparison, graphene weighs only 0.1 g/cc! However, we could not expect to make this large object only a few atoms thick, and graphene must be doped with other materials to give it the properties to make this work. Also you have to consider the elastic as well as supporting electronics and compressors. So, while in theory the Cirrus could weigh as little as 0.4 tons, even less if the whole thing was only one atom thick, I thought 2 tons was a more realistic estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T14:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_polymer%E2%80%93metal_composite\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EElectro-active ionic polymer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153metal composites\u003C/a\u003E?

I think the volume of the balloon is about 3000 cubic meters. If it were a sphere, its radius would be 9 meters and surface area 1000 square meters. Pressure is force over area which at sea level on Kerbin (or Earth) is 101 kPa. Thus, the amount of force being exerted by the artificial muscle to remain at full size is F = p * A = 101 kN. The collapsed bubble has 1/8th the volume, a 4.5 meter radius and a 251 square meter surface area. The force of air is 101*251 = 25.3 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Cirrus is 6.4 meters tall undeployed then it is 19.2 meters tall deployed. Work is change in force times change in distance, so maybe the amount of work exerted by the artificial muscle is (101000-25351) * (19.2-6.4) = 75649 Newtons * 12.8 meters = 9,681,267 Joules or ~10 MJ.
