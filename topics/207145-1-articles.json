Vast, fragile radiators to carry away waste heat. An ideal black body would carry away something on the order of 2000W/m2 at the reactor exhaust temperatures. An RMBK 1500 has about 4.8MW thermal power and produces 1.5MW electrical power, so must reject 3.3MW. Double sided that would take ~850m2 of radiators (33mx25m).
