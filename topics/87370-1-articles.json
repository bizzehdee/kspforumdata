Let the games begin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway - we all know that a SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit) craft is pretty much impossible for Eve without cheating or exploiting loop holes so I was wondering whether it would be possible for a DSTO (Dual Stage To Orbit) craft to get from the surface to Eve orbit using no cheats. I posted in the forums asking if it was possible and a few ideas cropped up and then GoSlash27 suggested that a challenge should be posted and that got me thinking. So here it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) starting point is from 110km orbit above Eve. (Atmosphere starts at 96.7 so I figured 110 is as low as you can get).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) land your craft on Eve using whatever means you feel (rockets, \u0027chutes etc). Craft must carry at least a single Kerbal to the surface and back to orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) you can land at any elevation you like but extra kudos for deep atmosphere launches (there will be a leader-board)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) you are allowed a launch stage - which is basically a lander craft which you can leave behind - you must stage/undock this before lift-off - your height above sea-level is taken from after you stage so no point in building 2.2km tall launch stages! (ideally you want this to be your landing gear, \u0027chutes and any extra fuel tanks that were used to de-orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) At any point in your ascent you are allowed to drop a single stage - you can have multiple parts decoupling or undock the ship in half with multiple docks but it needs to be all completed within 2 seconds. For the love of god your kerbal needs to be onboard the stage that reaches orbit - no ditching kerbals as ballast! (can\u0027t believe that popped in to my head!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Remaining craft needs to reach an orbit of at least 110km ASL ready for an interplanetary transfer craft to rendezvous with the lander where it can either dock with the craft or your kerbal can eva to it. (transfer craft not required to complete this challenge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Craft must not use any physics cheats such as kraken drives etc. and must be stock. FAR/NEAR is allowed but please point out that you are using these and I will mark your entry as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) You will need to post a video of your attempt or screenshots of your orbit in map mode, your craft in orbit, its descent, it landed on the surface, its separation from the launch stage (to take your height above sea-level), before and after stage separation, back in orbit, the map screen view of your final orbit.

Still need 3k-ish dV in the booster stage, but that should be at least theoretically possible... and I think the booster would get it to the height the nuclear is getting better ISP than any conventional rocket (13km-ish on Eve if I\u0027m recalling correctly). Biggest problem is the TWR still being too low to get us out though, possibly some assist from some 48-7S\u0027s or an Aerospike to keep TWR high enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option I could possibly see is going really big, and using a KR-2L based upper stage... slightly lower ISP, but much better TWR than the aero-spike... but that would be a HUGE craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tsevion","CreatedById":66600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T12:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile going small usually is a good plan, in this case going big worked for me...
