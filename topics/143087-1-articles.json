So you end up trying to land on metal sticks instead of wheels. And when you jam the metal sticks into the ground at 50 m/s, you tumble\u00A0forwards. This is new functionality in KSP 1.1 that never existed before -- so yes, I\u0027ve seen quite a few people having exactly this same issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, overall, the answer is to minimize your use of wheel clipping. After testing a plane that has\u00A0no wheel clipping at all, you can add a little at a time and make sure the plane still works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yes, if at all possible, post a .craft file.
