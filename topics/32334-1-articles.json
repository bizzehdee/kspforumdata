Your ship will move a lot during that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: how do you executive such a maneuver effectively?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Should I split the burn 50/50 between the burn point, starting the burn five minutes early? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Or, should I perhaps execute multiple smaller burns over several orbits?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And should the ship point towards the maneuver node indicator on the navball the entire time, or is it better to point prograde during the entire burn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience the end result is never aligned with the planned trajectory, and it makes my flights a bit... troubling.

Also, if your periapsis rises significantly in the prograde burns, burn retrograde at apoapsis to lower your periapsis to get the most effect out of the Oberth Effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T19:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re at maximum fuel efficiency when you burn prograde at periapsis; I\u0027d suggest multiple smaller burns on multiple orbits, even though it\u0027s more tedious, because you can improve fuel economy that way, and have plenty of opportunities to correct your orbital inclination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb does a 50/50 burn split around a manuver node (Note: I don\u0027t use MJ myself, this is just what I\u0027ve heard here).

This means starting at burn \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-5:00 and ending at \u002B5:00. You should hit \u0022burn in 0:00\u0022 as you pass over the node. You will want to burn towards the horizon the whole time, but I\u0027m not sure. It probably won\u0027t kill you so don\u0027t worry about it. Also, be sure to make corrective burns while escaping Kerbin or in Kerbol orbit. Remember, your burns will have a greater effect the further you are from the encounter, so don\u0027t hesitate to make corrections, as you will have to use more fuel if you save for the last minute. Fiddling with the maneuver nodes will also guide you. Try Dying To Live posted a video with the \u0022hidden\u0022 KSP options, one of which lets you better see how you will encounter the target. This will help with precision insertion. I hope this helps, and feel free to contact me if you need further assistance. Good luck, fellow Kerbonaught! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: If push comes to shove, I would recommend making a smaller ship or adding more powerful engines, as this will cut your burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T22:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do a rough staging just to capture orbit then a second burn to catch atmosphere and make adjustments to allow an aerobrake.
