If a Jool 5 Mission is possible this should be easier due to the use of ISRU. It is a vessel that is on it\u0027s way to Duna, Ike or Dres (landing optional but gets you more points.) and refuel using an asteroid along the way there or back. If you decide to take on the challenge you can try and shoot for any of the three tiers of winning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 1: You drilled and refined fuel from an asteroid on the way to or from Duna or Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 2: You drilled and refined fuel from an asteroid on the way to or from Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 3: You use an asteroid to refuel your ship on your way to Duna or/then refueling your ship using an asteroid around Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThings to take into account: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- \u003C/strong\u003EDres has asteroids that spawn in an orbit of around it in stock KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- You can launch multiple vessels and dock them together in orbit but it must leave and return as one ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- You may ditch your lander after the landing as long as the kerbal or kerbals have made it back to the main ship (if you aren\u0027t doing a orbital rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAllowed Mods (Basic List) \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Give kerbals more living space habitats or centrifuges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Give you information about the craft- (kerbal Engineer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Alarm Clocks for transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Mods that change aerodynamics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Visual enhancement mods (clouds or new planet skins.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Mods that allow asteroids to spawn in random places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Timewarp enhancement mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EForbidden Mods \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022\u003E* Meckjeb or other autopilot mods, for meckjeb you can use it if you can prove that you didn\u0027t use autopilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Mods that add new parts or engines (Interstellar or KWRocketry)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Mods that teleport you.
