I also can\u0027t run any mod that requires Firespitter. It simply causes KSP to crash when it\u0027s loading up. It\u0027s not a conflict with other mods because it won\u0027t even work with a clean vanilla install. This has been going on since the first time I tried running Firespitter, maybe as far back as 0.22.

I remember an issue with a mod, I think it was KAX, where if you just installed the plugin and not one of the config files it would cause problems loading.
