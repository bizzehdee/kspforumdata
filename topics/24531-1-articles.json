The course is laid out over an area that is very small for normal plane speeds. You do not need or \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E a lot of speed. Any higher than ~35m/s in most cases and you\u0027ll have a really hard time trying not to overshoot the next goal.

Lots of sharp turns, small goals, and little time to line yourself up means that you can\u0027t afford to have your plane slipping around. I think you want a very high wing-to-mass ratio so that your direction of movement follows where your nose is pointing very tightly. Make sure all of your control surfaces and wings are symmetrical around the center of mass so that your yaw doesn\u0027t induce roll, your roll doesn\u0027t induce yaw, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Although you need a lot of wings, you also want your plane to be \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E.
