(i tested it doing a 75x75 orbit. it is desgined for low orbit.) when desired apoapsis is reached, press 1 to turn off rapiers and turbojets. the mainsail is way more than enough for space. ( and more efficient)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. circularize and release your payload!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. de orbit burn will take only a second or two, do this as you will. (in low kerbin orbit i put my periapsis at 20000m, seems to be enough to get spaceplanes down without cooking.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. quickly before you enter the atmosphere you need to balance the tanks. you must put equal amounts of remaining oxidiser in the two most far end tanks marked by blue , and any remaining liquidfuel must go in the two 1.25 m liquidfuel tanks marked by red. there is probably more liquidfuel than this, so divide it between the 2 tanks just behind the ones i just mentioned, this is marked by pink. as in the included diagram \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tSasM5o.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022tSasM5o.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. as soon as you get below 70000m, pitch up 30 degrees and open airbrakes. holding this pitch while above 30000m won\u0027t make you flat spin and will slow you down enough so you dont cook when you enter below 30000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. when you gett below 1000m/s speed close the airbrakes, cooking won\u0027t be a problem anymore. then make a shallow dive to your landing, use the airbreathers to assist the glide if you start going to sloww and falling. hope you picked a reentry over land! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun with it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe reason i posted this is to see what other people think of it, to see what can be improved/ optimised, and i also need to ask, why is it prone to flat spins and other stalling crazyness when it is nearly empty gliding back from reentry? i did help this by going into the SPH and tweaking the fuel values on it in the editor to see if the COL stayed behind the COM when it was empty and it did, but only just. this COL being too close to the COM when empty is maybe the cause? anyway to temporarily fix this the only thing to do is pump the fuel remaining as i said in my picture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell, thank you for reading, good luck with the MONSTER!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.CRAFT file: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230578-monster-ssto\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230578-monster-ssto\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T10:34:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Screeno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELol typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWHAT, you have 1.2.0?!?!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you mean 1.0.2. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwhip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwhip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWHAT, you have 1.2.0?!?!?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you mean 1.0.2. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s an undercover squad employee starwhip. i\u0027d bet it\u0027s kasper with another late April fools prank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to the real topic- it\u0027s a good looking plane but it is not a monster - i have 300 mT SSTOs for about the same payload (a tad more 45 mT) but you have WAY better payload fraction so good job mate!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T23:33:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EladDv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EladDv\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EladDv\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHe\u0027s an undercover squad employee undercover \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t that make him a normal Squad employee?
