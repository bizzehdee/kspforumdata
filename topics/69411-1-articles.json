So I have been having fun building probes and landers using nothing but RCS but the problem I am running into is I will have massive banks of RCS thrusters and if I want to tilt the ship a little while I am doing a burn instead of just using the reaction wheels it will try to use every thruster to turn causing the ship to spin violently. Its even worse with SAS enabled as it creates a tremor that just builds ups as it tries to correct itself, each time overshooting more, ending with the whole ship shaking back and forth. I need RCS for my forward thrust so I am wondering if there is some way either through the stock game or a mod that will make it so that when I rotate it only uses the reaction wheels installed on my craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T05:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you hit \u0027R\u0027 it will turn off your RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mlah","CreatedById":64670,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T05:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eif you hit \u0027R\u0027 it will turn off your RCS.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize this but I am not trying to turn RCS off.
