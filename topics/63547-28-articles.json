It makes VTOLs extremely dangerous if not pointless (unless you want a ton of intakes pointing in different directions), and is also unrealistic. A moderate tailwind would kill you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any airspeed above 10m/s, engines running off a backwards facing intake produce exactly zero thrust. Thrust goes from 90% at 0-9.99999m/s, to 0% at 10.000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered this to my dismay when trying to land my new VTOL and it started backing off slightly, and suddenly thrust went to zero. Of course this sent me careening into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this same thing happens for a 90 degree intake as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this happened in real life, the F-35 STOVL would be impossible, for instance. I initially tried to solve the problem by having one vertical and one horizontal intake, like the F-35 engine.
