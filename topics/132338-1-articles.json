When making a comment, the page behind the keyboard gets almost entirely blacked out and you can\u0027t interact with it at all. You can\u0027t minimize the keyboard without deleting what you\u0027re writing, so if you want to quote somebody, good luck. Want to copy/paste to get around it?

Each one of those you had to click, which brought up your inventory, which you then browsed for the ingredient you wanted to use. After finding your ingredient, you right-clicked it and chose to select it in the submenu that appeared. This closed the entire inventory and brought you back to the previous step, where you now had to click the next ingredient slot, which opened up the inventory all over again... and so on. After all of that, you were ready to craft one item in a little minigame. Completing this left you with all menus closed, so to craft another item (to perhaps, you know, level your skill up), you had to go through the entire process again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sufficiently disgusted yet? Good. Now further enrich your imagination with the fact that it was a \u003Cem\u003Eserver-side UI\u003C/em\u003E, meaning every single click and buttonpress you made was subject to your connection\u0027s latency and the server\u0027s load level. 1-2 seconds delay per action were common.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a crime against user experience with every fiber of its being.

It\u0027s just godawful, the worst browser released this decade that I ever had the misfortune to try and use.
