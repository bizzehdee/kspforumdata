I\u0027ve tried using adjustable rails attached to hinges but that causes the rails \u002B the ramp to hang over into my second bay which just won\u0027t work. Does anyone here have any ideas of how this might be done?

Nothing as complicated as having to write code, but more along the lines of what Rawbots does, where you have the parts with inputs and outputs, along with various mathematical algorithms and sensor data that you can connect together on a grid.
