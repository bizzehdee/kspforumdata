I will take the route with minimal liquid-crossings and go via an equatorial path. After some testing on my modded version of KSP, I have decided on a design and have landed on Eve in my stock version of the game. Obviously, the way to go was pure electrically, as stock KSP does not allow for easy traveling across liquids without jet engines. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8gvCRZ1-YpI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou must be curious about why I have so many SAS and ASAS modules on my rover. These provide enough torque to allow the rover to flip over in liquids, as seen in the testing video. This is how I will cross the small portions of water I encounter.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8Ub7s8SnKk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nLaunching it was relatively boring. Building the rocket was quite a challenge, however, as no fairings fit the size of my rover. This meant huge wings would be required to keep the center of lift below the center of mass.\n\n![4Nwp11X.png](http://i.imgur.com/4Nwp11X.png)\n\nNow that the transfer window was open, we were able to go to Eve without any plane changes.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JSMU8mxEDW0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWe, thankfully, survived atmospheric entry by using the last of my previous engine to slow the rover to a much less dangerous velocity (4 km/s to 2.5 km/s).\n\n![21DtPeM.png](http://i.imgur.com/21DtPeM.png)\n\nThe EESC has begun (and Jebediah is already dying of heat)!"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:03:09Z","Content":"Egad, this brings a whole new meaning to the word \u0022seasick\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).
