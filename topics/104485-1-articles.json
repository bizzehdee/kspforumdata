Understanding that some of the people involved were trying their best and I do not want to insult anyone who makes honest mistakes (that is why I love KSP- it is the many failures leading to that splendid awe after a single success). For the same reason I laugh at my own failures I enjoy this train wreck of a show.\n\nI was trying to seriously follow the show\u0027s story. However, after watching the first four episodes the hilarity of the show as seen through the eyes of MST3k fan had me busting out loud laughing. One thing is for sure; I plan on watching more.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ellison exercised his writer\u0027s standard contract clause and insisted they substitute the false name \u0022Cordwainer Bird\u0022 as author, to indicate that he was \u0027giving the bird\u0027 to the show.\n\nI laughed after reading that and thought why hide behind a false name.
