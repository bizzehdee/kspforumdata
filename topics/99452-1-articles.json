There is a man in the middle of a moving train car with a lighter. There are two men, one on each end of the train car equal distance from the man in the center. When he lights the lighter, the light from the train travels at the speed of light and hits both men simultaneously. It doesn\u0027t matter that the train is moving, whenever you measure the speed of light it is traveling exactly at C to the reference frame of you. Now the train is passing a platform, and there is someone else watching this happen, they see the lighter being lit, but because the train is moving forwards relative to them, the light hits the man in the back first, and then the man in the front. So two events happened simultaneously in one reference frame, and at different times in another. Now let\u0027s apply this to black holes, we can observe material passing through the event horizon, but for the material, time slows down as it approaches the event horizon, and it never makes it there because at the event horizon time has stopped. To travel through the event horizon, time would have to run backwards, which would mean that the action of entering the event horizon would be undone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
