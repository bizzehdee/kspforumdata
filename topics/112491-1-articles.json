I\u0027ve noticed some odd rover behavior in 1.0.x, but not quite as egregious as what you\u0027re describing-- in my case, it was a rover that just seemed to ignore its brakes completely, but only some of the time; and during its less-cooperative mood, I could press the \u0022drive backward\u0022 key to get it to start slowing down, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E the brakes would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, no idea what\u0027s causing your problem, but a few ideas for things that might be interesting to check:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is your \u0022brake\u0022 key even registering? i.e. if you hold down the \u0022B\u0022 key, do you see the little \u0022brakes\u0022 icon up on the top status display (next to your altitude indicator) light up white? That will at least tell you whether you\u0027re actually trying to brake-- if it doesn\u0027t light up when you press the B key, this could be some sort of key-mapping problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What if you turn on (and persistently set) the brakes by clicking on the brake icon, instead of holding down the B key? Any difference?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Open the rover in the VAB (or SPH), go to Action Groups, and check the \u0022Brake\u0022 action grouip (this assumes you\u0027ve upgraded at least to level 2). Are your wheels listed there? (By default, they ought to be.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Have you tried playing around with the brake torque on the wheels? (It\u0027s available on the right-click UI for the wheels.) Try sliding it up to max and then try the brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you deliberately flip the rover so its wheels are in the air, do they keep spinning even if the brakes are engaged?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is the rover draining power when it accelerates like that? What if you right-click on your battery (or batteries) and disable the electric supply-- does cutting off the juice kill the power to the wheels? (If it doesn\u0027t, that\u0027s a pretty obvious bug right there.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T20:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo you have a joystick? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejoystick throttle on rovers confused me at first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bug with the stock tweakables.
