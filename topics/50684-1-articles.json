Also this takes time. If you try to get to orbit in less than 10mins you probably won\u0027t. Gotta get really high as fast as possible, then just build speed and maintain altitude. Gain altitude without losing speed and until at your intake threshold (if it goes lower than say .13 you get flameouts) which is different depending on engines running. Then burn with your rockets and if you\u0027ve built up enough speed and have enough fuel you should make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.

I would increase the fuselage length by 1 more tank, and put a wing connector between the jet engines and the fuselage for more re-entry stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking above into consideration, you should find something that works best with your building style. Mixing too many styles in one craft adds more weaknesses than strengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should look at a problem: how to get to over 1000 m/s in mid atmo, and how to blast out an additional 1000 m/s to get me in orbit? and then try to fix that problem using your building style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T20:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDitch the radial intakes; they\u0027re nearly worthless and add too much drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important stat on an intake is not the mount of intake air that it holds but the area of the intake. Thus, even though the radials might seem like they\u0027re a good option, they\u0027re actually one of the worst.

You have basic jets which top out at 1 km/s, so that might be why you can\u0027t go as fast as you want. But we can\u0027t tell what altitude and speed you achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStochasty: radials aren\u0027t as bad as they used to be, because their mass fell in version 0.21. At low altitude (~10 km) and low to medium speed (\u0026lt;1 km/s) they\u0027re better than ram intakes: lower drag, equal or more air. But you\u0027ll want rams too for high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
