If Im wrong, please keep in mind that I am not perfect the way I mentally design craft, so they often don\u0027t turn out as originally concieved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind,\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI ONLY USE STOCK PARTS, AND THE ONLY MOD I USE CURRENTLY IS THE NAVBALL TEXTURE CHANGER MOD.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reusables","CreatedById":179182,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-02T02:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why you make the two propellers to counter-rotate to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-02T09:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179182-reusables/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022179182\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179182-reusables/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Reusables\u003C/a\u003E noted, if the two propellers rotate in opposite directions (top blades inward, toward the central fuselage, is the standard method, so torque partially\u00A0 offsets yaw in case of an engine out).\u00A0 It\u0027s for this reason that a lot of engines used in twin engin aircraft have reverse-rotation versions.\u00A0 With a flat-opposed engine like those used in modern light aircraft, all that\u0027s different is the camshaft (to open and close valves in reverse order), starter motor (wound for reversed rotation and Bendix cut with opposite helix), and magneto (retimed to fire sparks at the correct position with opposite rotation).\u00A0 Similar is the case for radials like the BF-110 used.\u00A0 If you\u0027re building stock engines, it\u0027s even easier -- just flip over the reaction wheels or jet engines that drive the shaft, and reverse the propeller pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
