Probably needs some minor improvements still, but that comes from getting other people\u0027s input. Features include minor storage for fuel types varying from the usual LF \u0026amp; OX, to mono and xenon, this little guy can fuel anything you need from glutton tugs, to frugal satellites. I\u0027m working on a larger design, designed to better supply high fuel requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/56c2Fkz.png\u0022 alt=\u002256c2Fkz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Droptank mark 3, contains 180 LF, 220 Oxides, 100 Mono, and no less than 700 units of Xenon. In it\u0027s small compact form, it\u0027s easy able to maneuver in and around large vessels, guiding itself to latch points. The early mark 1 model did not contain the Xenon, but I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s a worthy addition to have, especially if one decides to make a large satellite network. Every payload I launch now has at least 1 junior docking port somewhere to allow for inspace refuelling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy earlier mark 2, didn\u0027t have the xenon and also featured an inline reaction wheel. However, having the reaction wheel operational, and docked up, led to my spacestation going absolutely insane, and it took me hours of trying to stabilize it to figure out it was from the wheels, even with SAS turned off. So the newest droptank mark returned to the style of mark 1 and relying on rcs to rotate, but added in the xenon to create the latest iteration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow are others setting up their extended droptanks?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Himynameisjake","CreatedById":101602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T04:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could just always action group and toggle the reaction wheel, that way you have the control you want. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
