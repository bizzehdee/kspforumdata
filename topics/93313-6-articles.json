Force:Mass ratio does *NOT*\u00A0equal a 4x increase in exit-velocity for the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the payload accelerates through the Mass Driver it picks up velocity, and thus passes through each segment more quickly. \u00A0For instance a payload passes through a 40 meter length of Mass Driver coil in only 2x the time it takes to pass through a 10 meter length, and thus only receives half the velocity in keeping with E = 1/2*m*v^2. \u00A0You expend 4x the energy to impart 2x the exit velocity- which is the same reason why electric thrusters have such anemic Thrust despite having exit-velocities measured in the 10,000\u0027s\u00A0of meters/second...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I suppose it *WOULD* be possible to impart TweakScale compatibility (and in fact I was thinking of releasing a\u00A0series of re-sized parts with the mod using the \u0022rescaleFactor\u0022 line in the part configs- that works for creating scaled-up and scaled-down parts, right?), but I warn against scaling the Mass Drivers up and expecting the same performance... \u00A0Even setting aside mass concerns for a moment, the Force imparted by scaled-up Mass Driver coils per unit length should fall off as the Mass Drivers have a non-negligible thickness (I eyeballed the rate at which this happens, by the way, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s actually HIGHER than this. \u00A0Calculus is required to actually create a correct formula for this...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote also that I haven\u0027t bothered with messing at all with the ratio of length to coil-thickness in any of these calculations. \u00A0Coils with a better thickness:length ratio\u00A0require less electrical energy to impart the same Force to the payload, as they lose relatively less energy to wire resistance- but the Mass Driver parts we work with all assume the same\u00A0rate of energy-loss in the coils (a 100% efficient Mass Driver requires less electricity than a 90% effocient one, for instance- we don\u0027t mess with efficiency at all)\u00A0for mathematical simplicity\u0027s sake, with little regards to realism (also\u00A0as I don\u0027t actually KNOW exactly how efficient Mass Driver coils actually are at turning electricity into force in real life,\u00A0and everything in KSP is nonsensical when it comes to electricity-consumption

\u003C/strong\u003EAny serious discussion of energy-efficiency in KSP begs the question: WHAT IS A UNIT OF EC EQUAL TO? \u00A0If each Ec represents a kW, our Mass Drivers are only\u00A020% efficient (providing 1\u00A0kN over the length of 2\u00A0meters for 1\u00A0second for each 10 kW). \u00A0If it represents 200 Watts they are 100% efficient and need to be slightly nerfed. \u00A0 If it represents 100 Watts they are 200% efficient and need to have their Ec/kN ratio more than doubled... \u00A0Current figures for Ec consumption were selected for simplicity, but may be completely wrong

\u00A0Mass-efficiency probably isn\u0027t an issue of all that much concern for most players, who will only use the Mass Drivers on the ground on Kerbin. \u00A0And, if you\u0027re Scott Manley (and yes I know I\u0027m talking about you in the third person here Scott- most players probably don\u0027t realize that Illectro is your forum account) and decide to launch one of these things to the Mun, then you\u0027re probably just doing it for sheer awesomeness factor rather than because it\u0027s a particularly mass-efficient way to return payloads from the Mun to Kerbin (the MOST mass-efficient\u00A0way of doing this in KSP would be to build a long tube of Mass Drivers from locally mined\u00A0Ore on the Mun using ExtraPlanetary Launchpads. \u00A0Mass Driver coils\u00A0are one of the few things we could REALISTICALLY produce on Luna in real life, as they are basically just long electrified coils of Aluminum, and the Lunar regolith is literally MADE of Aluminum Oxides in many places... \u00A0The solar panels, electronics, and energy-storage devices required to operate such a device would not be trivial to produce via Lunar manufacturing though, and would most likely need to be imported from Earth and assembled onto the coils by skilled technicians...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

forget what I said before about the force falling off with increasing diameter of\u00A0the coils- due to the way the strength of the magnetic field lines actually INCREASE as you move towards the edges of the tube (at any diameter), this may not actually be the case. \u00A0I\u0027ve decided to just keep force:length ratio the same for all sizes as a simplifying assumption and to make the parts easier to test to ensure they are working properly (technically the force remains the same- the force DURATION for each part is what will change in accordance with size...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also decided to reduce the 0.625 meter version (yes there\u0027s a 0.625 meter mass driver coming out!) of the mass driver\u0027s force by 1/4th beyond the effects of merely scaling down its length, as the ability to accelerate a payload with 2x the density\u00A0of the StarTram\u0027s intended 40 ton, 13 meter long, 2.5 meter diameter\u00A0payload (interestingly this yields a density not much lower than that of RP-1, which means StarTram probably anticipated use of Kero/LOX or even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s for orbital circularization in order to reduce the volume of the spacecraft and this minimize atmospheric friction...) at 480 g\u0027s is not only a little overpowered- it\u0027s impractical in real life. \u00A0At those g-forces any payload would collapse like a tin can or rip itself apart due to the gradients in force between the center of the tube and its walls (not simulated in KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus I have enhanced both realism and balance by assuming a nearly\u00A01:16\u00A0reduction in coil thickness for the 0.625 meter driver vs. the reference 2.5 meter mass driver instead of a 1:4 reduction- and a proportionate 1:4 reduction in maximum\u00A0force at the center of the smaller coil\u00A0(realistically, this would be due to a proportional 1:16 decrease in current, and a resultant decrease in the strength of the magnetic field...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also made the smaller mass drivers slightly heavier than would be expected based on coil-thickness and size, and the larger ones slightly lighter. \u00A0This is as larger mass drivers would realistically require proportionally less insulation (due to the Square-Cube Law), electronics (which would increase in proportion to coil-length, but not thickness),\u00A0and structural reinforcement (larger coils produce far less force on the payload relative to their own mass,\u00A0and thus experience greatly reduced acceleration due to recoil) to operate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made this factor quite strong\u00A0(the 5 meter Mass Drivers are nearly 10% lighter than you would expect based on their 8x larger volume) though- and may have somewhat exceeded the degree of this effect in real life, as I don\u0027t know how important these effects would realistically be (the mass-savings on insulation due to Square-Cube Law are significant, as these would be\u00A0very high-current, heavily-insulated lines:\u00A0but the
