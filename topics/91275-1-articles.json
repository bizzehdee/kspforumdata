Im not insane because in her video I clearly see the target indicated by a yellow number in km (Skip to somewhere around 14 min in the video if you wish to see for yourself) as she approaches to dock. Well Ive spent the better part of this evening trying to figure out why its not showing up when I approach my space station. I certainly have set the space station as the target, yet there is no yellow number in km next to it like there used to be when I get in close range. In other words, when I make a final approach to dock to my space station, I get no readout of how many km away I am from the spacestation, although I can see the station but not the little yellow numbers that should be adjacent to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?
