Especially the slower ones, with a low wing load and low landing speed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBit some of them are bouncing off the runway and just won\u0027t stay on the ground. Or they turn over the wing on a ground run while braking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI must mention I prefer my planes to be flyable all the way without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy thoughts are I am probably locating my landing gear not quite correctly. Usually it\u0027s classical trike scheme, but the relative hight of main and nose wheels, placement of main gear relative to center of mass, something else I am doing wrong?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf someone could formulate a design principles and methods of landing that make a well behaved plane, that would be beneficial for lots of people, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HlhABTm.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HlhABTm.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T09:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi azgar! Yeah I think it\u0027s your landing gear. Here\u0027s some things to look at \u2013 this applies to tricycle landing gear like you have on your plane, it\u0027s a bit different for tail-draggers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe main gear should only be juuust aft of the center of mass \u2013 your plane rotates on it when taking off and you want it to be as delicately balanced as possible without tail-planting when it\u0027s parked.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll landing gear should be vertical relative to the ground on both axes. Not tilted.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your nose gear is taller than your main gear, the plane will take off easily but\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bounce on landing, as your wings are still generating lift when you touch down.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your nose gear is shorter than your main gear, it\u0027ll be harder to rotate for take-off, but your plane will want to stay on the ground on landing because your wings will be generating less lift with all the gear on the ground.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if your problem is that your plane wants to bounce on landing, then move the main gear aft or make the nose gear shorter/main gear taller. If you have the opposite problem \u2013 plane doesn\u0027t want to take off \u2013 then make the opposite corrections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helped and happy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T10:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big difference between KSP1 and KSP2 is that KSP1 had very strong reaction wheels from cockpit alone, giving you a lot of authority even at low speeds. With KSP2, you have to be more mindful of the aerodynamics. You also can\u0027t rely on stability assist as much, especially at low speeds and low engine thrust. So again, you have to make the plane more controllable with aerodynamics alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see too potential problems with this particular plane - though it\u0027s hard to be sure without looking at the overlays available in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Pay attention to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E in relation to your fuel tanks. If your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is not centered on fuel, as the fuel drains, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts. On this plane, I would guess the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts back, closer to the engine. If you start with CoP very close to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, it might end up forward of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, which will make the plane want to pitch up at low speeds, making landing hard. A good test is to enable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E overlay in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, note where it is, then set all the fuel tanks to hold zero fuel. If your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifted, that means it will shift in flight. If the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is shifting back, you need your fuel further back or move other parts to shift \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward. Once you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E fixed on the plane regardless of how much fuel is being used, place CoP just behind or just above \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and that will give you stable flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Pay attention to the control surfaces. This plane has a very shallow v-tail with almost no control surfaces, so your wings have to provide a lot of the pitch control. The control surfaces themselves are very close the center of mass due to the plane being fairly short. This means that at low speeds, you\u0027ll get very low authority. You can rectify it in two main ways. First, in the procedural wings setup you can increase both the width and the length of the control surface. That will give you more authority. Second option is to give it more leverage. You can replace your wings/stabilizers with control surfaces for the v-tail. These have more authority, generally. You can go with a more conventional tail, with a dedicated horizontal stabilizer that\u0027s taken out further back. Or you can also add a canard in the front that will help you with pitch control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetween these two, you can usually get something that\u0027s fairly good about gliding onto the runway. Once on the ground, another thing that\u0027s worth checking is making sure that your rear landing gear has no steering and front one has no braking. If you set the parking brake before touchdown with a configuration like that, you generally stay stable on the runway and have maximum braking immediately. You can play with adding a bit of braking power to the front to stop faster, but that might not be worth the sacrifice in stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sequence","CreatedById":42247,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T11:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224253824\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214626\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678185236\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003Eanother thing that\u0027s worth checking is making sure that your rear landing gear has no steering and front one has no braking\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis makes a big difference to the space planes I\u0027ve built.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else that helped my planes be less bouncy on landing is to adjust the suspension strength on the front gear, make it really stiff.
