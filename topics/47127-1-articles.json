So I got them printed on some nice poster paper/card stuff (\u003Cem\u003E350gsm Silk\u003C/em\u003E) and I\u0027m hosing a giveaway! I\u0027ve got 50 of these prints, and I\u0027ll be giving away four, two here, and two on Reddit - All you have to do is comment below and I\u0027ll use that \u0022Random.org\u0022 thing to work out who gets \u0027em!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also purchase the print \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/shuckledesigns\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E - some people were asking for discount codes, so if you use: \u0022WELCOMEBACK\u0022 (\u003Cem\u003Ewithout the quotation marks ofc\u003C/em\u003E) you\u0027ll get 10% off (\u003Cem\u003Ewow i\u0027m such a great guy\u003C/em\u003E) - in fact, if you email me: shucke.graphics[at]gmail.com with a short story about Jeb, you might even get a 20% discount code, Maybe, if you\u0027re lucky. Has to be an email though, so I know you\u0027re dedicated. I\u0027ll probably post the best ones here over the week anyway, if I get enough people interested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ll probably get in touch with the winners next week sometime, maybe even this saturday so you have something to brighten up you weekend - but it depends on how busy I am, no promises.
