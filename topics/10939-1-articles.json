For example, Minecraft doesn\\\u0027t mind piracy, Notch the creator of it welcomes it. He knows that a good product sells itself. Word of mouth and so on. And look how minecraft is thriving. A person that is going to play the game for a longer time will probably buy it. What the people on youtube are doing is the major selling point if you ask me, all the lets plays. Thats how i learned about KSP before i bought it.\n\nAlso i see no reason why this needs to be reported nor why anyone thinks they should play internet police about it. Nothing can be done about it. All you can do is better your product and show those that pirate it that its worth buying."},{"CreatedByName":"AlternNocturn","CreatedById":17872,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:11:54Z","Content":"Didn\\\u0027t we already have this discussion?"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:18:52Z","Content":"No. I just found out about this guy today."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:19:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Before you go apeshit, why don\\\u0027t you ask him why he torrented it, and if it\\\u0027s something like \u0027I don\\\u0027t have the money :\\\u0027(\u0027, then you know why.\n\u003E \n\u003E And if that is the case, then, he will probably buy it as soon as he has the money.\n\nHe did it just because he could.
