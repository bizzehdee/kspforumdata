It\u0027s kinda hard to be confident all the explanation still apply when you clearly see the tutorial is many version old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 1.1 about to be released, i\u0027m thinking i could maybe start helping by doing some up do date tutorials of my own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody know of a good open source software to do so? Video and Voice capture plus editing all in the same package would be really great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs ever, thanks in advance for your help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_Danger","CreatedById":159757,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T18:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have an Nvida card 600 series or higher(I think) you can use the on board Shadow Play. You enable it through the GeForce Experience program\u00A0you can download from Nvidia if you don\u0027t have it installed. I use that to capture video and audio.
