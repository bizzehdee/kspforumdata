Or doing a perfect gravity turn by unlocking yaw SAS and keeping pitch and roll stable. Or turning a shuttle without losing control by unlocking only roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlong with this, pressing a button to control a ship should only temporarily unlock SAS for that axis, rather than all of them like it does now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese abilities can unlock in career mode with the appropriate level pilot or by using the RGU probe cores and the flight assist nosecone (since the abilities are mainly for lift rockets and planes, with little use in space, it makes sense for these modules to have it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbonautInTraining","CreatedById":145373,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T14:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI especially like the idea of fixing SAS so it doesn\u0027t let go of all axis when a button is pressed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T14:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupported by the Spaceplane Freak\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T14:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0grown tired of having to fight the atmosphere instead of the SAS doing its job when I don\u0027t feel like letting gravity do the turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T17:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat ideas but it should be buried so new users are not intimidated by it. \u00A0In the same menu give us the ability to adjust the filter parameters so we can adjust SAS for bigger/smaller/over controlled/under controlled ships\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurning off SAS in one axis when 1 button is pressed is also a great suggestion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T17:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
