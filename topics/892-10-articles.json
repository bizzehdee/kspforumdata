I have deliberately avoided the sandbox, thus far (despite my 12-year old\u0027s preferences), and am playing \u0027through\u0027 in career mode - so I\u0027m being exposed to the new technology capacities as a true Kerbal! \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;hums the Brunnen-G Fight Song\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E I nearly always play through new games in career/storyline fashion, and was completely unaware that this modality was a new feature, when I purchased the game a few weeks ago. Career truly rocks, thus far!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I am currently exploring the limited potentials of what I now see is a purposefully phased set of gear, while executing a desperate crew-rescue mission. My first reliable, multi-stage orbiters ultimately stranded Jebediah in distant solar orbit after a near Mun-miss; and he now cavorts in a cold,dead can with - presumably - a gross of Kerbal Bars and some magical source of O\u0027s. I check in on him, occasionally, while my research (enabling his rescue van) continues - and he seems happy enough, still. Ecstatic, actually. Maybe it\u0027s not O\u0027s he\u0027s subsisting on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe similar tale of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50180-My-first-experience-with-KSP-Stranded-pilot-rescue-attempts-rescuing-the-rescuers%5Bu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E]tfabris\u003C/a\u003E has also been very enlightening - though I\u0027ve gone a somewhat different route, with my local program. I\u0027ll have many questions, I\u0027m sure - I have thousands now! - but I\u0027ve currently achieved Level III on everything, and Science to IV, because I needed the Lab(?!) to hasten the other lines of inquiry. Still can\u0027t figure out the batteries, the Comms unit, OR which way East is. Ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my craft are wacky - but they\u0027re perfectly \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esafe\u003C/span\u003E, I swear! That said: my current default orbital model reaches 10k atop four Rocko BACC solid boosters (\u002B four liquids, for steer) which throw up so much launch torque-spin I had to skew-mount 4 Sepratrons, placed at about 10:45, and firing in the initial stage, just to counter the crazy rotational forces. Weeeeee! This probably does explains why I\u0027m always mis-placing East, tho\u0027. And soon enough I will have \u003Cem\u003Egyros\u003C/em\u003E! \u003Cem\u003EAnd\u003C/em\u003E a better single-seater pod. For some reason. And if I had a build-tool wish-list req, it\u0027d be for a stage-specific center-of-mass/thrust indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut - wow - are multiple pods (for a rescue ship) even a possibility? How can I then land two? Orbit one, I\u0027d guess - but how to stage ship #2? Is it even possible to do an EVA ship switch? Should I be using other common abbrev\u0027s?
