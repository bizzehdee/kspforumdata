A complete no staged effort! Great, land with ONE lander to cut down on parts that could do any moon of Jool with no staging. Even Tylo! Yeah, that\u0027s the ticket!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I got the ship designed, but the mothership had to be split into two launches as on the ground the part count with the launcher was just extreme! Still, two mothership parts and one lander still worked out pretty good at a hair under 500 parts which my machine just was able to handle without too much slow down (probably five frames a second at a guess)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalf way through launching it I was a little worried about the dV of the mothership, so I boosted the fuel on the second part of the mothership, the booster section.

I figured I\u0027d get the worst fuel hog out of the way quickly, then Laythe, then Vall, and finally Bop and Pol. Once I got to Tylo orbit however and found fuel at low levels I re-arranged my schedule, deciding to go for Pol after Tylo, just to have a moon I could land on with minimal fuel before the refueling vessel arrived.

I\u0027m using a generic Planesciprobe (Planetary Science Probe) that docks with the lander for each moon, then will be de-orbited back and Kerbin separately. So, dock the probe, burn for de-orbit and... well, it worked... though I had a teeny bit of trouble on getting back to orbit. I got it right, except for right at the end of the orbit when I didn\u0027t pull down closer to the horizon soon enough and my orbit got too high and too ballistic.

OK, a lot of trouble! My record of very little quickloading? Completely out the window! I\u0027ve done Laythe a lot, but generally with specialized Laythe landers with built in parachutes and jet engines. Thus I never remembered what the dV for launching from Laythe\u0027s surface was.

I thought it was 3000 dV to launch from Laythe\u0027s surface, and the landing wasn\u0027t as efficient as I\u0027d hoped. I ended up with a little over 3200 dV on landing. Yeah, well, 200 dV spare? Yeah, that\u0027ll be fine. So I did my science, got things ready, then launched... and didn\u0027t get close. What was worse was I had quicksaved on the ground, just to be safe... and now I was stuck with too little fuel in my ship! When I rechecked fuel to reach Laythe orbit it was... yup, 3200. I had to make a PERFECT launch to reach orbit. Well, I didn\u0027t make it. I redid it and redid it, and eventually got a ballistic arc that was close enough for the MS to do yet another rescue, but with the added thrill of very little time to rendezvous outside the atmosphere.
