Mouse over the top center of the map screen and a row of icons will drop down. Those in white are currently being displayed, those in gray are not. Clicking on the icons turns them on and off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work, it\u0027s probably because you\u0027re about out of memory. I\u0027ve noticed this happen, too, and it\u0027s a warning sign the game is about to crash. Try exiting the game to desktop and reloading. If that doesn\u0027t work, then probably you\u0027ve got too many mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
