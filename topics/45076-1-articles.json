Start with small rockets. Build a single stage sub orbiter, launch it into space, and recover safely. Launch it again but this time do a gravity turn and see how far you can get it to go while still reaching space, 70,000\u002B meters. Add a second stage. Get it into orbit. Get it into orbit and return safely. Add a third stage, head for Mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was built in the demo. The two stage with boosters and a thruster pack will easily go into orbit and, if flown efficiently, reach Mun, go into orbit, and return to Kerban to a aerobraking reentry landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oFErrqg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oFErrqg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T05:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo some stuff. You shouldn\u0027t try a mun landing right away. You could actually start with Minmus - it\u0027s further away, but it\u0027s easier to land and return to kerbin.
