So\u00A0 Kerbal Cosntruction Time, which forces long lead times before you can actually launch a specific rocket and encourages a lot of pre-launch simulation, doesn\u0027t really add to my fun. I am also not aware of any other mods that play around with rocket launch cadence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something similar to KCT, but rather than queuing up a specific ship, is more like... available parts? Ie, every day you get say 3 more parts added to your buffer, up to some cap. More with upgraded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Then when you want to launch a rocket, it won\u0027t let you do it unless you have enough parts that go into the rocket in your buffer. If you do, it subtracts the number of parts in your buffer and lets you launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you still have to wait between launches, but what you actually launch is flexible, and allows for just reverting back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to tweak and try again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if not, is there something a like a flat \u0022you have to wait a day/week/whatever\u0022 between launches, but after that window you can launch whatever?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-12T22:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKCT has different \u0027profiles\u0027 that you can select.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne that I submitted/ designed was for your build time was only based on the number of parts on your craft.\u00A0 Faster build times with upgraded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
