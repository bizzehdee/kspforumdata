The base diameter helps with landing on slopes, but the re-entry heating goes on for an awkwardly long time. The heat-shield doesn\u0027t get hot enough to ablate but the hot-gas flow fried the parachutes. The braking effect would have been small, but the engines ran out of fuel just above the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this sort of OTT Kerbalism does burn a lot of fuel, but the overall mass-ratio is going to be crazy-high without staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(One of the spectacular ideas out in the real-world is the Russian use of rockets to augment the parachutes for heavy equipment. It lets them air-drop tank-like things.

I have based the figures for the new ISP curves on test flights with what I\u0027d consider reasonable payloads. I have not touched the thrust figures at all, but because ISP has a great impact on resultant thrust in the atmosphere, the effective payload you will be able to lift from the ground has decreased and so has the amount of delta-V at your overall disposal.\u003Cp\u003EThe changes will probably not make the die-hard realism fans happy. It may even make some of those who were enjoying the extra power a bit less enthusiastic about this mod. In my effort to balance the parts to be truly stock-alike, I hope I at least made everyone equally unhappy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder. Wouldn\u0027t that make single core rockets a lot harder to create? I honestly don\u0027t think stock is very well balanced in this regard. Even now stock favors using a bunch of 2.5m rockets to using a single 3.75m rocket, design/efficiency wise, and even more so ecnomically (aerodynamics hardly make a difference). KW Rocketry follows the stock formula, and their 5m engines perform even worse, being less costefficient in 90% of all cases. I did not test the behemoth engines for economics (lol), but i assume the will continue the trend of large rockets being worse and worse if they\u0027re balanced to stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind this is not just economically, but also design-wise: Large engines need to have huge thrust margins to be effective. Even heavy single core KWR rockets are often hard to create because of lacking thrust, and that\u0027s despite their largest engine creating 11kn of thrust. Beside being a lot more expensive, it\u0027s often just not enough thrust without a bunch of boosters, especially with the new ISP calculation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, that\u0027s ofc a stock thing too. Imo KSP just isn\u0027t very well balanced in regards to super-heavy rockets. The 3.75m rockets do not feel to me like a continual, well scaled development, but rather a late-game tech with additional difficulty. Especially with the one being a pure high atmo/space-engine, and the other not supporting staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I think it might be best to wait for 1.0.3.
