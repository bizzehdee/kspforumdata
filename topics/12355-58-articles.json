All of my collisions or near collisions have resulted from an extremely accurate Hohmann transfer followed by a match velocity, and I end up basically coming in with my engines pointed at the target, burning to match velocity instead of following the line straight \u003Cem\u003Ethrough \u003C/em\u003Ethe target and out the other side. The fact that the \u0022closest approach\u0022 match velocity option usually stops you a bit \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the closest approach makes this an entertainingly disastrous rendezvous. A bit before would be perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this is related to the way MechJeb executes nodes. A perfect orbit change node is an instantaneous change in velocity at the specified node. Since that\u0027s not possible, it\u0027s usually simulated by starting a burn half the length of the burn before the node is reached, thus a 10 second burn starts five seconds before the node and ends five seconds after. This has more or less the same effect as the instantaneous change would. The problem, I suspect, is that MechJeb doesn\u0027t quite do that. It starts the burn half the estimated burn length at full throttle before the node, which is perfectly correct if you\u0027re going to full burn the maneuver. But it doesn\u0027t do that, rather, as it gets close to the end, it throttles back and fine tunes. This extends the length of the burn on the plus side of the node to longer than the minus side. To compensate for the way it ends burns, I think it would need to start its burns a tiny bit earlier. But of course since it has no idea how much fine adjusting its going to do at the end, it really has no way to knowing exactly when to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr I could be completely wrong. I\u0027m not a rocket scientist. In any case, the end result is, collision course or not, for some reason, when you tell MechJeb to match velocities at closest approach, it usually only succeeds in matching velocities a bit \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E closest approach. On those cases where you got that perfect rendezvous, a bit \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E would be highly preferable (unless you *want* an entertainingly disastrous collision -- this is what we all play they game for anyway, right? xD) and a way to set, say, \u0022match velocities X meters before closest approach\u0022 would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T21:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy little problems with MJ (Running 2.0.7, worked a bit with 1.9.8):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Hohman transfer to a moon send me directly into it, so obviously i have to correct it, same with the fine-tuning manoeuvers, basically sends me to 0.0 m, little corrections are needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Some burns using manoeuver planner start late, some waaayyyy too early, sometimes sending my periapsis into the planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The loss of settings, i like my custom windows!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Seems the auto-landing needs to be given a spot the map using the \u0022targeting tool\u0022, then you can edit it without problems.
