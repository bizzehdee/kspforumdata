to (within some logical limitations) have the ability to add or remove parts in the field.\u00A0 For example, if i dock 2 vessels, and find them too flimsy, a strut or 2 could be added between one side and another to help fix the issue.\u00A0 Another thing, id love the ability to say take a structural panel and attach it to a ship to replace damaged components from a battle or whatever.\u00A0 i know this is not what most people do in KSP, but i do alot of stock combat, especially with capital ships, and id love the ability to (within limits) replace damaged panels on the craft.\u00A0 KAS is one mod that adds some of what i want, but id love a stock implementation of allowing some parts (say radial only, struts and fuel lines in particular) in the field by kerbal engineers.\u00A0 At the bare minimum we really need the ability to add struts after the fact when we realize the monstrosity we sent to jool broke a component off and is nolonger stable, so we need to strut it together.\u00A0 For now my solution is taking a small craft with 2 claws on each end and attaching one to one end, and the other to a structural panel (or even mating the front and rear of a ship together after it gets shot in two), but it is high on parts and rather unpractical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for parts, i would really like a larger rapier (or similar engine but 2.5m).\u00A0 The main reason i dont enjoy (or build) any mk3 sized SSTOs is because i cant justify using so many bloody parts which lag my game to death.\u00A0 If i could replace a stack of ~10 rapiers with 1-2 larger ones, itd go a long way towards killing both lag/part count, and well, giving those of us that actually like SSTOs or spaceplanes an engine that can really lift something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like larger structural panels (sometimes making vessels out of those 2x2 becomes a lagfest especially when the craft is truly massive such as a station or some battlecruiser.\u00A0 truiangular ones would also be nice, and would open up more options for aesthetic designs without adding much to part counts (a 1x1 sized triangle and a 2x2 sized triangle would do nicely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA light that is omnidirectional (intended for self-illumination) and has similar lighting range then the current wide angle one would be wonderful, as lights are somewhat laggy in large numbers, and you cant get a nice self-illumination effect from the stock ones without going to high number of lights (and thus slower gameplay).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0.6m SRB with a decent 50 or so kN thrust.\u00A0 What id do for the ability to replace those awful ibeam\u002B4-8 sepatron missiles with a ibeam\u002Bsingle SRB.\u00A0 Weapons aside, it would really be nice for a RATO booster on some heavy planes (RT-5/RT-10 is a little too bulky for plane assist boosters).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, while i know squad will NEVER implement this because they hate procedural anything, id love at the bare minimum procedural wings and procedural structural panels.\u00A0 This would allow us exponentially more options as to what we want to make and how we want it to appear.\u00A0 no more clipping every bloody thing together, no more excessive part count spam, just shape whatever you want in whatever way you want.\u00A0 Yes it destroys the \u0022lego\u0022 approach squad seems to love, but the options it would open up would in my opinuion more tne make up for this, and it would at least help everyone lower that all important part count, thus less lag, less crashing, less rage, and less desire to tear your eyes out when the FPS drops to 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T08:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

I think I can sort of see a foundation for them with the way you can specify how much a cargobay door will open/close\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation lights... well, we already have landing gear where you can specify the RGB composition of the lights... and thus have a green light on one side, a red light at the other... the problem is with the symetry system you can\u0027t change the color of one without changing the color of the mirror one - so you\u0027d have to add each part individually, which is tempting fate with something that likely won\u0027t be symetrical enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhich also bring up another point... the symetry system... I\u0027d love to be able to place something with 2 fold radial symetry on a part that was placed with 6 fold radial symetry... but I can\u0027t, it forces me to place with 6 fold symetry, or no symetry at all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteerable nose wheels for the larger landing gear sizes: definitely yes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelicopter parts? meh... I\u0027d still like propellor parts electric, LF using, and LFO using (or just electric using, and a beefy fuel cell that can supply the electricity so you can make them a LFO-electric hybrid rive)... but combine that with hinges/ oratating parts, and various sizes... and sure, you could make helicopters with them, tilt rotor aircraft...etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I don\u0027t really see such a need, the diference is mainly cosmetic between a big \u0022ducted fan\u0022 that looks ie a jet engine, or a propeller/rotor. We can already make VTOL craft... so... meh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoat parts? I think many of the structural and airplane parts work just fine for that... I want sub parts: ie ballast tanks/ballast generators, and electric drives (nulear reactor... like a giant RTG, with better EC/s/mass than an RTG) - the electric drives could be the same as the propulsion that you could also use for aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
