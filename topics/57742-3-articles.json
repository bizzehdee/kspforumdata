However, as noted in the known issues part, there\u0027s definitely something screwy with Jool as a whole, also present in the stock game... I managed to get into an orbit around Vall in the regular game without having any sort of orbital insertion. It seems that you sort of \u0022overshoot\u0022 the SOI entry, and by the time the game catches up, you\u0027ve moved a bit, so it puts you in with a slightly different position and velocity. The escape node at apoapsis is weird, though...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould the size of the SOI be affected by the other nearby bodies, which did change? The weird elliptical orbit with the exit node at the apoapsis was pretty strange. It should be easy to replicate by entering an orbit with periapsis at 55 km, and then raising the apoapsis to get an escape -- you should get the escape node before actually reaching escape velocity, and it will be very apparent in map view (the orbit looks a bit like a horseshoe with a small gap at the top). Perhaps spacing the moons out a little bit more would solve this issue. The original Jool system was far too tight anyway, and even the stock game had a number of SOI-related bugs because of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T22:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any real way to reliably reproduce the solar orbit bug?
