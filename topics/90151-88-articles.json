The fuel for most rockets is a liquid and under gravity it flows nicely into the engine. However without gravity it begins to float around and your engines have trouble getting fuel, result in air or \u0022vapor in fuel lines\u0022 and shut down to prevent damage. To solve this problem there are a couple of solutions. The first is hot staging where your second stage fires while your first one is burning. The next is ullage motors which are small engines that don\u0027t require ullage and provide acceleration to force your fuel down. The final is a pressurized bladder that you fill with helium or nitrogen and expand to keep your fuel in the bottom. I\u0027m not sure which methods the Saturn V uses, but I will post after I boot to my Linux partition and launch the Saturn V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The first stage engines shut down because you set your throttle to zero and when you raised your throttle the tried to start but couldn\u0027t due to only having one ignition. This involves two things, the first being that very few engines can throttle (SSME 69-109% and even less can deep throttle ( ex:RL10 8-104%) and secondly that engines have a limited number of ignitions. To solve the first problem, be sure to not set your throttle to zero after starting an engine and pay attention to what engines are throttable. The second problem is that he F-1 engines were never designed to be able to ignite after launch and other engines may have a limited number of restarts due to what ever allows ignition to occur being used up. However, some fuels are hypergolic the ignite on contact with each other and have unlimited restarts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T03:57:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Redjoker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T04:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027 not sure if this is intentional or a bug.

However, if you save the game when the first stage is depleted it doesn\u0027t matter that these engines are failing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can\u0027t get the second stage to work until I restart KSP and do a fresh launch without save games or reverts.

And since they work fine when I do the launch from scratch but fail to work everytime I use a save game or revert the launch, I\u0027m now pretty sure that this is no user failure but a mod failure. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pronoes","CreatedById":143585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tekener\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tekener\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m not changing the throttle for the first stage engines, not touching it at all.
