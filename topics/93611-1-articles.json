Likewise, the raw materials are relatively cheap. This is why nobody pulls the wreckage of spent rocket stages out of the ocean for recycling - some people in Kazakhstan apparently take apart debris from Russian launches for scrap metal, but the money they get off it is only significant for trying to feed a family, not for building another rocket - if it was enough to significantly offset the cost of a launch vehicle the Russian Government would scrap the stages themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vast majority of the cost of a rocket launch is technology and labor. Manufacturing a launch vehicle requires a lot of expensive machines, such as 3D printers that can print metals, friction-stir welders, and enormous milling machines that can make an isogrid pattern in a giant fuel tank. It also requires a lot of highly-skilled labor from the engineers and technicians responsible for building the thing. There\u0027s also launch-related infrastructure, such as the pad itself, the transporter that moves the rocket to the pad from the VAB, and the permanent fuel tanks that hold the fuel before it\u0027s loaded into the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with reusability you also get recovery and maintenance costs for the vehicle. SpaceX plans to keep the former low by boosting-back to land near the launch pad, and the latter is dependent on the vehicle design. Maintenance costs are also dependent on flight rate. IIRC one of the reason the Shuttle was so expensive was because its flight rate ended up much lower than anticipated. This was partly because the shuttle took forever to refurbish, but partly because they didn\u0027t have enough payloads since it turned out using a manned vehicle to launch satellites was economically moronic. With the Falcon 9, the question isn\u0027t whether people will want to launch satellites on it (they already do), it\u0027s whether the demand for satellite launches will increase enough when SpaceX lowers the price to make reusability economically viable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T01:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEach engine is test-fired for its full mission duration after it completes production.
