I think. Could be the other way around. Or you could do\n\n    SomeTransformInYouPart.transform.LookAt(FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel.mainBody.transform.position);\n\nto make an object point down. And by down, I mean the centre of gravity in the current SOI\n\nHTH?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravien","CreatedById":91920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:57:30Z","Content":"@lo-fi: Good idea, thanks for pointers"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T06:51:14Z","Content":"Good luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
