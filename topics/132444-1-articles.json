You can even add some realistic parts into it by needing some science experience done (i.e. on / around Eve) to have gravitional /atm data available for tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would ppl need to fly to eve with a probe, get some data, send them back and design the crafts aith that data. Adds more \u0022exploring\u0022 to the game and might be more satisfying if it works in \u0022real\u0022 after all those data grinding like it did in a virtual simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust imagine ppl playing \u0022ironman\u0022 (no reverts / quickloads). They want the real fun... and they should be able to use their gathered science for preparing best for Eve \u0026amp; else instead of needing to try dozens of times including the whole flight to the bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my call: kind of \u0022basic\u0022 2d sim (see all those mobile apps) ingame that can use grav/atm data of a body i already scanned to test my designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne can still make mistakesin the design/actula flight, but at least you can check if it MIGHT work the waay u thought about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T20:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222420613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132444\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455983071\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105344\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022juanml82\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, juanml82 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the kind of scenarios in which Squad\u0027s original idea of testing ships by flying them doesn\u0027t work, it\u0027s just too time consuming to do it without mods, and even with mods there are plenty of scenes changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually totally agree on the overly time-consuming nature of the current set up. I also think there\u0027s value in squad\u0027s vision of learning by experimentation and trial and error. Its a question of balance. Of course what you want is to launch your ship and know %100 that its going to work, but where\u0027s the tension in that? Why bother even flying the mission?\u00A0If there\u0027s no risk you lose the sense of reward.\u00A0You lose that white-knuckle feeling of \u0027oh\u00A0god\u00A0is\u00A0it\u00A0going\u00A0to\u00A0work\u00A0or\u00A0not?\u0027 and then \u0027eff yeah I did it!\u0027 If you\u0027re trying and failing over and over for minor reasons, I agree, that gets pretty tedious and\u00A0dispiriting, which is why I think there\u0027s a strong case for a\u00A0staged progression giving\u00A0timely, useful information to players like dV in the VAB before they go interplanetary. Players also aught to learn to send lower-cost probes early to test the waters and learn what they\u0027re up against on different planets before sending a mother ship. We should be learning the \u003Cem\u003Eprinciples\u003C/em\u003E of design, and then applying those principles to bigger, more ambitious missions. We should be encouraged to do text rigs, running a design through its paces before sending them to other worlds. Between double-checking staging and\u00A0looking at TWR and dV info in the VAB with a little bit of padding\u00A0a player should be able to gather a reasonable level of confidence that their lander will work without removing all risk and spoiling the excitement of the actual mission.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
