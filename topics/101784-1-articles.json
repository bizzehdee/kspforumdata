No need for the SAS or verniers to help if you do that. Also your ET goes way too far down, way too far, both in KSP and in real life the ET ends well above where you have yours ending. This greatly helps because you keep the CoM out far enough the engines don\u0027t need to gimble as much to track it. In your pic that top tank is going to drain fast and then the engines will not be able to track the CoM and it is all over folks. (The Klockheed Martin SSME mod also comes with ET parts that will look better and allow you more flexibility in how you make your ET.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55985-0-90-Space-Shuttle-Engines-%28Dec-27%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55985-0-90-Space-Shuttle-Engines-%28Dec-27%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"karamazovnew","CreatedById":63072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T07:08:42Z","Content":"Of course it does. As you can see from the Green arrow heading from the CoG, you need to readjust your engines. But that\u0027s not the whole story. The Shuttle is a very complex thing. At launch, engines start at the proper thrust so that the booster induced rotation is canceled. As you burn fuel from the center tank (and boosters), the COG slowly moves towards the shuttle, the boosters tend to push it more nose up, so the engines must be throttled up to stop that from happening. As the boosters loose thrust (not in KSP), there is a point where the booster influence on the shuttle\u0027s acceleration becomes zero. At that moment, the boosters are released and the Shuttle throttle is just perfect to keep it steady. As the fuel continues to burn, the engines are throttled back more and more to prevent a nose-dive. So here\u0027s how I did it in Kerbal:\n\n- First tweak the bottom 2 shuttle engines so that the shuttle is perfectly stable with center tank at about 1/4 full at full thrust. In orbit, only use these 2 engines at low thrust, so that the SAS can hold them in place. That means a veeery slight rotation on those 2 engines, much less than in your pictures. And no need for those 2 side engines. Low center of gravity is the key here, for example use fuel in the wings, and place them under your shuttle, not like you have them. \n\n- Then add the 3\u0027rd top engine and retweak everything for about 50% thrust on launch. \n\n- As you go higher and higher, you should reach full thrust on shuttle engines as the SRB\u0027s are about to cut out. \n\n- When they do cut out, stop engines or you\u0027ll spin out of control. Release boosters and restart engines slowly. Once you reach a happy attitude, leave throttle like that and just reduce the max thrust on the top engine. When tank is 1/4 full, you\u0027ll probably be at thrust zero on the top engine so shut it down. Continue to reduce throttle on the 2 remaining engines until tank dropoff. \n\nNot easy, action groups are the key to do this (for example, releasing srb and shutting down all engines with action group 1, instead of staging) ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Good luck.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T07:14:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 07:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T12:40:21Z","Content":"you should be able to control your pitch with your throttle level. More thrust will tip it forward, less to tip backwards.\n\nThe real problem comes when you release your SRBs, as you will no longer be able to control your thrust vector with the throttle and you will lose control as your COM changes. One way to remedy this is to constantly alter your thrust limiter on the central Mainsail, but it\u0027s a bit of a hassle.\n\nI think there is a mod that has shuttle engines with better gimbal ranges etc, but I haven\u0027t used it yet, so don\u0027t know how strongly to recommend it. Also can\u0027t remember what it\u0027s called \u00C3\u00B0\u00C5\u00B8\u00CB\u0153\u00C2.\n\nPersonally I found making a mk2 shuttle fairly challenging but doable, but I couldn\u0027t get a mk3 one to work, so maybe trying a mk2 one first would be a good idea."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T14:26:57Z","Content":"This might be stupid, but try putting it on launch clamps.

Given the direction of the green arrow, you are starting with very high AoA, meaning lot of lift. Since in this configuration your center of lift is very far from CoM, that lift causes a big momentum you should correct for.\n\nSidenote: you can also add some fins on the side opposite of the orbiter, to offset CoL to a better position. Because this is a replica, I guess you don\u0027t want those fins to be visible at all. If you like, you can clip them inside the ET or inside each SRB for a better look.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T14:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 02:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PlonioFludrasco**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gamer217","CreatedById":65835,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T22:53:14Z","Content":"Ok thanks for all the info, I\u0027m going to try the SSME mod since the mainsails don\u0027t have the gimbal range of the actual Shuttle SSMEs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T22:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gamer217**"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T22:56:14Z","Content":"Shuttles do that in KSP.
