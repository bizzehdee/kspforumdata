Having a low TWR and lots of Dv means you can\u0027t get away. Having a high TWR and low Dv means you can\u0027t get away. It takes about 4900 DV to get to orbit no matter what your TWR is (as long as it\u0027s above 1). If your TWR is 10,000 and you have 500 DV, you aren\u0027t going to space. If you have 99999999 DV and your TWR is .9, you aren\u0027t going to space. If your twr is 2.0 and you have 4900 Dv, you will get to space faster than if you had a twr of 1.4 and 4900 DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone else so eloquently explained a few months ago that finally turned on the lights for me, Dv is the currency you spend to get from point A to point B. TWR is how fast you spend it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you aim at prograde with positive acceleration, you will still move up even if prograde marker is showing down. That\u0027s why you do the gravity turn, so you \u0022fall off\u0022 the planet. It saves you a lot of fuel to make a good turn when you burn for circular orbit because you don\u0027t have to fight your upward movement. The best turn ends at like 70k, when you chop engines and drift to the apogee you want and begin your burn. You should already have a good bit of surface velocity, so that you ease into the burn. The prograde marker is usually right at or below the horizon, which is what you want because you have to kill some of that vertical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-07T18:15:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2014 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xcorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T18:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo will terminal velocity be the same in all cases?

Terminal Velocity is the speed at which an object\u0027s acceleration due to the force of gravity will be exactly countered by the object\u0027s deceleration due to the force of atmospheric drag, i.e. the maximum speed at which it can fall barring any additional outside forces. During a launch, it\u0027s the speed at which your delta-V losses to the combined force of each (gravity and drag) is minimized, and so you want to try to keep your ascent velocity close to terminal velocity as you can in order to get the most out of your booster\u0027s delta-V. In KER, this is also represented by a stat under the Surface tab called \u0022Atmospheric Efficiency\u0022 - you want to try to keep that value as close to 100% as you can manage during the ascent; below 100% and you\u0027re losing delta-V to gravity, above that and you\u0027re losing delta-V to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The gravity turn, yes. Your rocket gets a little bit of a boost in its velocity due to the rotational speed of the planet when you go to launch, velocity you get to keep if you launch in the direction of the planet\u0027s spin (eastward for all bodies in KSP). Your ship\u0027s heading needs to be at the 45 degree elevation mark and you need to hold it there until the prograde vector comes around to match, then follow the vector provided you\u0027re at least 35 seconds to apoapsis; if not, stay at 45 until you\u0027re 35 seconds to apopasis. Again this is a way of maximizing your booster\u0027s available delta-V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As a rule, you don\u0027t want your TWR on your launch stage to be any less than 1.2; below that you\u0027ll have horrific gravity losses. 1.6-1.7 is considered optimal. Above 2.2 you\u0027ll be hitting delta-V losses due to drag (provided you\u0027re launching from a body with atmosphere such as Kerbin); you\u0027ll also be putting stress on the parts and risking unplanned disassembly. The other part of your question there is mostly irrelevant, particularly once you get into space - deltaV only measures how often and how much you can make changes to your velocity, TWR measures how fast you can make those changes. You can go to any \u0022altitude\u0022 with any combination of the two, provided you have the fuel to get there in the first place. That said, as a rule delta-V is more important in most situations. TWR\u0027s main importance is during launch. 1.6 TWR and 4500 m/s of delta-V will get you to orbit. Hell....1.2 TWR and 4500 m/s of delta-V will get you to orbit, just not as fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You\u0027re going to have to equip enough chutes to handle a soft landing of the equipment, just like you would with a capsule or any other part of a ship you want to retreive intact.

If you\u0027re really keen on launching and landing with every bit still attached to your ship, you should try SSTO spaceplanes (for which there are several great guides available on these forums; ask and I can point you out to \u0027em).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T18:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022easy\u0022 (not efficient, but not particularly INefficient) guidelines are to turn to 45 degrees at 10km and then stop burning when your apoapsis is where you want it (I like 80km, but many prefer 100).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile lifting off, until you get to 5km keep it below 150m/s. Don\u0027t go over 200m/s until you\u0027re over 7km, and don\u0027t go over 260 until you\u0027ve passed 10km. Assuming you didn\u0027t have to throttle down for any of those, just keep going full throttle until you get your apoapsis up to the top. If you had to throttle down, keep your throttle where it was when you were at 10km for another 5km or so and then throttle up all the way. After 15km or so, it\u0027s very hard to get a ship on a decent ascent path (what I described above) over terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got good at all that, a better trajectory is to burn straight up for 5-10km, and then slowly tilt East, kind of dragging your prograde marker down to the horizon as you lift from about 10km to about 40km. It takes a lot of practice to get the timings right but once you\u0027ve got it, you\u0027ll almost be in orbit before you\u0027ve even left the atmosphere, and will use a bit less fuel to do so.

Terminal Velocity is the speed at which a gravity pulling down (acceleration) a falling object and air resistance (deceleration) are exactly equal. This same velocity can be used to determine how fast you should go during ascent.

To an extent, yes - more TWR means that you spend less time overcoming gravity, (which saves fuel). But too much TWR means you are either A. going too fast, wasting fuel pushing against atmospheric drag, or B. carrying extra useless weight (in the form of big heavy engines) wasting fuel hauling useless weight. The closer to terminal velocity, the better, as this is the most efficient speed to go (best balance between drag and gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. For any recoverable debris stuff, you have to \u0022fly\u0022 them each down. Otherwise the \u0022on-rails\u0022 simulation might not handle them right, in the atmosphere. Your fuel tanks and boosters need to come down at less than 8m/s to be retrieved without damage.

The turning does not only help, it is required part of going to orbit. The completely unrealistic, and not very efficient way, is to boost vertically up to 10 km. 300m/s at 10 km is good speed. If you are going for equatorial orbit, turn 45 degrees, full throttle until you reach desired apoaps. Wait until around apoaps, boost to raise your periaps. If they change the KSP aerodynamic model however, this won\u0027t be the best way to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key for going to equatorial orbit, is your orbital prograde. It starts at horizon at heading 90 as launchpad is on equator ( you can switch navball and see it at any time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically going to orbit consist of increasing your altitude \u002Bgravity turn. After the first several km (10 is good) where you are mostly occupied with drag and staging, you begin your turn. at 7-8 km switch your naval to orbit ad see where is your pro-grade - you want is somewhere around 45degree pitch on 90 heading. By throttling up if it\u0027s too low, turn slightly right if it\u0027s too high. Try to get it around therer. At 250-300 m/s at 10km should not be far. Start turning towards it. From now on boost orbital pro-grade. Now here depends on your TWR. (move to map, if you don\u0027t have a mod which shows you your orbital stats). If you have enough TWR, throttle up/down so your apoapsis keeps around 60-30 seconds from you. If you don\u0027t have enough twr you might need to pitch up a little. Pro grade will naturally move towards the horizon. Once your apoaps is high enough, stop engines wait for it and burn to fix the periapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther orbits are similar as well, but you\u0027ll need to overcome the planet rotation, so the gravity turn is a bit different, as you\u0027ll need to overcome the planet rotation, rather than utilize it.
