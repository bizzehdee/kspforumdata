In fact if I try to run KSP with EVE (not the low res one, that works fine) then the game crashes while loading, considering this makes use of EVE and more I somehow think my computer would struggle a bit yes, I\u0027ll just have to do what I\u0027m doing at the moment and pick and choose enough of bits from the pack that make the game look beautiful without taking so much that I end up with crashes or low framerates, until I upgrade my PC and can enjoy the full awesomeness of this beautiful pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, usually the reason for performance problems in KSP isn\u0027t the GPU, it\u0027s the CPU due to single-threaded physics calculations. All those pretty shaders and visual effects should not make your GPU scream at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM usage is a different beast, as of course all those fancy textures will take their toll, however a better computer won\u0027t help you there as long as you\u0027re limited to 32 bit on Windows.
