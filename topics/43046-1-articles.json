the internet much since about the end of the 90s when normal non-geek types started using it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim really starting to have an issue with kickstarter. flaky promises covering up what essentially is a giant money sink, only to bring products which are so expensive due to lack of mass production. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eindividual mod makers with donation buttons also annoy me. i do modding because its a hobby that almost never costs anything (unlike electronics, or rc choppers, or (the irony) my most expensive hobby, lego), now people want to be paid for doing their hobbies. sometimes i think the money goes to all the dope they are smoking. people almost never did this back in the quake modding world. modding communities are different though, since they need to pay for hosting and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother thing that pisses me off is online stores that do not tell you how much shipping will cost (or even what provider they use) before you give them all your information. i live in a rural area and prefer shipping through the post office, which is the like 4x cheaper than any other service, but you usually have to create an account just to figure how much shipping will cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonline video players that suck under low bandwidth conditions. a couple years ago i only had a 1 megabit connection. youtube worked fine, but any other video provider almost always had stuttering and buffering that doesn\u0027t buffer enough stuff to allow continuous play. i dont mind hitting play, then pause and wait for it to buffer a couple minutes before continuing, but then the thing only buffers like 10 seconds of video before stopping. im at 4megabit now so this is less of a problem. you think they would test these things under low bandwidth conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esocial networking. in my day (mid to late 90s) you wanted a website and didnt have any cash you would go to one of several ad supported systems that gave you a small bit of webspace. you could then throw up some html, insert some banner code (if you didnt they would do it for you and make your page look ugly). you could even run little scripts and stuff on some of those services, i had a little asteroids clone applet on mine. that was how we did personal websites back in the day. its also how you knew who your fellow geeks were. as crude an unfriendly as that system was it worked. needless to say someone introduced me to myspace, and found that while you were greatly restricted to a common interface, it was a way to sidestep the whole creation process one had to go through to get their face on the internet. for awhile i played along, you could still tweak the style sheets so you could do some customization, but it still sucked. it really doesnt do anything for your social life either, it just gives you the illusion that you have one. i stopped updating my profile and went to more bars, then i deleted it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edecline of instant messaging has bugged me for awhile. i keep pidgin running with 3 or 4 accounts. though i always question why. i never talk to anyone on there. you never meet people through it anymore. this was kind of the result of it turning into a spam channel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eemail is pretty much useless, but you have to keep accounts around to accomplish anything on the internet. well i guess you can log in with another account now, but you still encounter the form element tagged email. now all the email providers want me to have a cell phone for this 2 factor security. i dont like cell phones. the reason i got on the internet on the first place is because i dont like phones. now you have to have a cell phone to use the internet.

I think I might have watched a sum total of 40 hours of TV [not counting movies] since 1989, and 37 hours of that was when I was in a traveling on business and either did not have a laptop or did not have a game on a laptop that I wanted to play, so had no choice but to watch a hotel TV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are still a few enclaves of true Internet left: sites like this, Wikipedia, a small number of diffuse special-interest sites.

Since it has become accessible to the non geek public it has become more social. People treat it as a right to access it. A few months ago our city was upgraded to fiberglass internet.

Someone denied them the access to the internet! How dare they... Yet these people have absolutely no idea how the internet works(or what it is). That feels kind of weird to me.

But on the internet, where we do our communications, our agenda\u0027s and our financial management(!!) We do not give a damn abut how it works and what it is doing. A lot of people use the internet daily. On the job or at home. But I am sure that at least 80% of all the internet users never stand still and ask them self how internet work.

They either lived in your neighbourhood or where in your school class. You had no choice but to deal with it. Yet on the internet it is just a simple action. Close the web browser and do something else.
