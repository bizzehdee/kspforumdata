This is rather annoying, because I often need to compare the ship\u0027s mass and remaining fuel when I\u0027m doing \u2206v calculations, and the best way to do that is to open BOTH of those windows and pause the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the inability to have both windows visible at once the new intended behavior, or is something going wrong here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T02:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been unhappy with this change as well, but alas, I find it unlikely SQUAD didn\u0027t think about it when they changed the GUI, so I can only assume they wanted it that way and that we\u0027d need a mod to change it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
