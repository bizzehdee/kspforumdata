Double click on a window (not all windows, but most) and you\u0027ll kinda lean forward (nose against glass) so you can peer out a bit better (but then you can\u0027t see the nav-ball). double click again (i think) or press c to return to normal IVA view. mouse wheel gives you telescope-level zoom!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocBrown","CreatedById":115155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T22:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
