Did you know that it can be used to make a sub-critical reactor with laser bombardment? That is right. Theoretically, all of your energy needs until the end of time could be met with a half ton reactor in your garage that can be turned on and off with the flip of a switch. The real kicker is, we have known all of this since the 1960s and still advancement of this technology has been brushed aside for dangerous, wasteful, and inferior pressurized water cooled nuclear reactors. Why, you might ask? Because a thorium reactor cannot be used to enrich materials for nuclear weapons. In fact, it can be used to burn the waste fuel that we have been stock piling for the last 50\u002B years. There was once a project funded by the US for the testing of molten salt cooled reactors that would all but trivialize the safety of nuclear reactors of all types. The project, even though it was a resounding success, was shut down by politicians that had other agendas. I don\u0027t like to name names, but the major culprits name rhymes with Nixon. Combining that technology with thorium reactors would usher in a new age of energy abundance on this planet. We could have had this thirty years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why I laugh at all the money that has been spent on fusion reactor technology that is far more costly and complex. I believe nuclear fusion reactors are in our future. However, they are totally unnecessary when thorium could power our society for the next million or so years with a lot less effort and expenditure. Only now that other countries have begun projects based on this technology, is there a push for it\u0027s advancement here in the states.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T07:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TythosEternal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TythosEternal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m a big fan of Hg myself.
