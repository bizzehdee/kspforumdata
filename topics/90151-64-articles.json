Lots of engines use gas generator exhaust for roll control, seems like the closest way to simulate that. I\u0027ve been using a cloned LR-101 for that purpose on my rockets. Of course a vernier to control a fixed nozzle J-2T rocket would require a higher thrust, more like the verniers on Soyuz 2.1v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, it seems reasonable to imagine that had J-2T development continued a small vector range (maybe 1.5 or 2 degrees?) could have been developed.
