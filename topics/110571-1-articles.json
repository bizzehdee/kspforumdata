I decided to make a nice chart for myself of aerodynamic drag. I figured I could either dig up a formula to calculate the air pressure at each altitude, or I could do it the Jeb way, and launch a spacecraft with a barometer, and record measurements at different altitudes. Of course I had to do it Jeb\u0027s way. \n\nTo my great surprise, the values I measured were up to 300% off the published formulas of *pres = 2.718^((0-altitude)/5000)*.\n\n![muteexah.png](http://leancoder-share.s3.amazonaws.com/paste/muteexah.png)\n\nThis means there is actually a lot more drag loss over a launch than previous math would have shown. \n\nMethod:\n\nCreate any spacecraft. Add a barometer. Add a KOS computer from the KOS mod, with code below.

In addition, the USSA uses [geopotential height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopotential_height), h, rather than geometric height, z. Therefore, two conversions must be made. First, the geometric height used in KSP has to be multiplied by 1.25 to undo the 20% reduction, and then the result must be converted to geopotential height. This can be done in a single step using the following equation:\n\nh = 7963.75\\*z / (6371 \u002B 1.25\\*z)\n\nOnce h is calculated, the temperature, pressure, density, and speed of sound can be obtained using the equations in the table above.\n\nThe above method isn\u0027t exact but it will get you pretty close. The temperature equations are right on the money, but this is \u0022base\u0022 temperature. The actual ambient air temperature at any location on Kerbin varies based on latitude and time of day. The pressure equations are very accurate at low altitudes, however some error starts to appear at higher altitudes. This is because the floatCurves used in KSP are only an approximation of the USSA. Furthermore, above z = 63.2 km (h = 78 km) the pressure equation breaks down because Kerbin\u0027s atmospheric pressure is forced to converge to zero at z = 70 km.\n\nIf you find the equations in the post reference by Cybersol easier to use, then use those. I post the above mainly so you can see the origin of the numbers used in KSP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T05:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"acalculus","CreatedById":106612,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T02:31:42Z","Content":"Thanks guys (especially NathanKell, cybersol, and OhioBob)!\n\nI was looking for a way to be very accurate for flight simulation purposes. Since KSP 1.0 does not have a single simple formula for pressure, accurate numbers either need to come from field work or table of real world measurements. Again, following the what-would-Jeb-do philosophy, I\u0027ve built a table for every 100 meters of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere by recording the values of several points within a few meters of each 100 meter mark, then linearly interpolating the measurements to the now bracketed 100 meter marks. \n\nThis should be the most precise table around.
