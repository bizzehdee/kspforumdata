You could add up the mass of all individual parts; you can even look up your mass if you go to launch, switch to map, then click that info panel.

I understand why the devs aren\u0027t too forthcoming with that kind of data. Much of the fun in the early KSP experience stems from the \u0022let\u0027s see what happens\u0022 approach to rocket design. Though that wears off... as far as I know, pretty much every seasoned player uses some Delta-V tool or another, and for good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
