Seven (7) shot decoupler/sepratron cannon on the nose, two mount points on the nose, and 4 mount points for smart missiles on the underside. It is a \u0022figher\u0022 so there is plenty of RCS thrusters and RCS fuel to get you pointed in the right direction FAST! There are also two blocks of linear RCS thrusters on the nose (Toggled on/off with \u00220\u0022)...incase you\u0027re coming in a little too hot and need to get on the \u0022brakes.\u0022 Be sure to check out the \u0022Very Kerbal\u0022 ejection system; Stage 2 \u0026amp; 1.

It gets a bit tricky past 25km as it develops the spins. Ignore the spinning, she\u0027ll hold together. Just fight with WSAD to keep the gimble somewhere in the blue until you drop the second set of mainsails, and then it will be pretty easy to get back on course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the name does not only apply to the shape!
