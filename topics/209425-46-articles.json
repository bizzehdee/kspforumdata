Pretty much made up. They base those numbers on horrible B-quality PSU\u0027s that cannot provide their wattage rating for more than a few milliseconds. To make sure users with those kind of PSU\u0027s do not run into trouble, they grossly overestimate the needed power for a specific card. A futile effort, I would say, as a cheap PSU will get you into trouble sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny decent A-brand PSU can output its rated power for a sustained period of time with ease, and often much more. With such a PSU you can simply look up the real world power consumption for all the different parts and add them together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worst case scenario of the GTX 760 seems to be about 160 watt. Add an appropiate amount for your CPU (typically between 50 and 125 watts) and add, say, 10 watt for your motherboard and each HDD. That should give you a decent estimate of how much your system will do when fully loaded. I would be surprised if a system with a GTX 760 would pull more than 350 watt, let alone 500 watt. Most modern CPU\u0027s are more frugal than that, so it probably is even less than 350 watt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot stress enough how important it is to buy a decent PSU. A lot of people do not care much and pick the cheapest option, but they risk instability, random problems and even catastrophic failure with damage to pretty much every other part in your PC. You would not be the first that fries his 700 dollar gaming card with a cheap power supply. Buy a good one that is powerful enough to accomodate your current and reasonable future needs and leave it at that. No need for crazy 1000 watt power supplies - even 700 watt is only needed when running multiple cards and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T21:31:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudester28","CreatedById":61717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-29T21:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone.
