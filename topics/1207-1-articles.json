I get the title screen/menu up in 1-3 minutes. (Looking at the first loading screen with the awesome artwork) A bit long, but not too unreasonable considering I just make minimum specs to run. Clicking \u0027Start Game\u0027 gives me another wait of between 1-3 minutes, then clicking the V.A.B. gives me another short wait. Loading the launchpad gives the longest wait of nearly 10 minutes in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify: \u0027The first time\u0027 means the fist time I navigate to those sections of the game after starting the game. If I quit the game and relaunch immediately without doing anything else on my computer, load times are substantially reduced (assets still in memory?) After visiting each section (V.A.B./Launchpad) once, they load with not unreasonable times of about 10 seconds thereafter until I quit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game window appears to hang while it does it\u0027s thing, not graphicaly updating (holding ghost images of windows that were above it) and if it\u0027s in fullscreen mode at this time, I can\u0027t alt\u002Benter or otherwise interact with my computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt definitely did load faster with only the default parts, but it was the same behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
