Can\u0027t write numbers nor special signs such a \u00E9 \u00E8 \u00E0 etc. Capital \u0022A\u0022 doesn\u0027t work either: Using Shift\u002B\u0022a\u0022 writes \u0022aAaAaA\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Keybindings reset every time I launch the game. There is a keybinding for entering Map view, but not for exiting it. Keybindings are always in QWERTY: it prompts me to use W for pitch for example, but the key that\u0027s working is Z (which is at the same place as W for an AZERTY keyboard).\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Ladders are not working near the 3 seats command pod (blocked) and the larger one disappears if close to a fuselage when the camera is zoomed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-When launching a rocket, it happened to me that the rocket launched inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Doing anything when in its state just shows you the inside of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it\u0027s not interactive. (Going into tutorials, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, tracktation etc is just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002B HUD of tutos, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or trackstation in top of it). Quitting the game doesn\u0027t fix it, I had to reload an older save file, make my craft file multiples subassemblies and reassemble them in a new craft file to be able to make the game work again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Struts tubes fairings are not working. Attached to a decoupler, the tube sometimes jettisons it\u0027s fairings and sometimes not. I just launched the same rocket again and again, and the fairings jettisons ~10% of the time when activating the decoupler. Also, there is no staging to jettison the tube\u0027s fairing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E icon is missing in staging.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Decouplers objects are not working. Sometimes they no clip through everything when activated, sometimes they get stuck inside the rocket which destroys it or give it unwanted speed and spin. Happens every time on some decouplers whereas other works ok every time, the only way to get around it is to delete the part and reconstruct the craft. Sometimes when activated the decoupler no clip through the craft and the two parts that were attached to it are now glued together. Happens very often.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Attached parts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E sometimes are attached to another parts when the rocket is launched. When it happens, reloading does nothing, the only way to get around it is to delete the part and reconstruct the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Fairings don\u0027t have any colliders and can\u0027t close into a part to hold it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Offsetting objects make them act like a magnet with the part they\u0027re attached to. Offsetting up gives a part a force that pushes against the top of the craft, and offsetting them inside another parts sometimes make them want to shoot through, destroying parts and giving the craft unwanted speed and spin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Wings or boosters (not sure which one) sometime make the craft explodes when launched, the only way to get around it is to delete the part and reconstruct the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Maneuver nodes are not working. Creating a maneuver node, exiting and reentering map view change the maneuver.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Painting solid boosters looks bad. Its give the primary color to the engine nozzle, which looks very bad.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Clamps randomly flashing to the base of the rocket when asending. Happens ~5% of the time, and relaunching seems to fix it. Doesn\u0027t seem to collide with the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-In \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E when moving subassemblies that have symmetry modes attached parts, it sometimes changes the orientation of some of the symmetry attached parts. Moved my LEM from my bay and 2 of 4 parts were in the wrong direction whereas the other 2 were ok.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-When lauching a vehicule, the pitch of the orientable light parts is reseted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-My craft was destroyed once for no reason while reentering Kerbin. I was time warping x4.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The 3 seats apollo pod is bugged I think. While trying my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with the abort function (igniting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002B decoupling under the heat sheild attached to the pod) sometimes it would behave strangely and my heatshield was missing, then when landing,\u00A0 parts of the pods were clipping though the ground as if the collision box of the command pod was a little sphere. EVA with a kerbal would make them clip though the ground too and land on the ground under the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Not sure if it\u0027s a command pob problem or a problem with parts in gerenal, I noticed that when the craft is in any way bugged, some parts will behave like their collinsion box are a sphere. Easily noticeable when I try to make ground tests and I see detached parts rolling on the ground not matter the shape/ size/ material.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-In graphics options, Windowed, Borderless and Fullscreen options are bugged. Visually, Fullscreen AND Windowed are both always selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMinor missing features: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-There is no way to lock a resource from being used. It\u0027s bad for example when I want to be sure my pod or CSM have full monoprop tanks when needed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-No way to know how much fuel I have left in individual tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-No Kerbnet. I\u0027m sure the game is full of cool easter eggs and POIs, but how can I go see them without a way to point a location on a surface via satellite ?\u003Cbr\u003E\n-No flashlights in kerbals EVA suits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Using filters in the tracking stations doesn\u0027t hide icons in the map view. Could be really annoying with enough debris.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-No \u0022remove from symetry\u0022 option\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESomething I think is bad:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The little attitude indicator which shows a little shuttle inside axes of motions symbols (Prograde etc) is bad when in atmosphere. When in atmosphere, before launch and when ascending the shuttle icon shows prograde but my prograde and the Up direction are the same... not mentioning launching a rocket from the north pole. I think this feature is useless since it doesn\u0027t give any information on my attitude and is even bad for people not familiar with planes/ rockets since in atmosphere this icon is useless but when in orbit it\u0027s working as intended and there is no way to not be confused if you\u0027re a newcomer i think.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also sent (some of [since it\u0027s edited]) the above with the feedback feature in the Private Division launcher.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EClosing thoughts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a 2060\u002B i5 12400f\u002B 16go DDR4 Ram and I\u0027m using a SSD. I\u0027m running the game is 1080p in High settings without Vsync and I have 40-20 fps with basic crafts and 1-5 fps with more complex crafts (an apollo style rocket, nothing super fancy) so performance and bugs wise, the game is currently unplayable for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever the game is very promising and looks like excellent foundations for the future. Magnetic boots for EVA suits, Up/Down, North/South directions when in atmosphere, the new Navball and HUD are the kind of things that will make people not want to go back to the original imo. There is a lot of very good stuff in the game right now. Moreover almost everything thats bad in this day-one EA of KSP 2 is the fact that the game is not running. I\u0027m personally very disappointed to not be able to play KSP 2, which I waited for all this time and bought day-one but when it\u0027s going to run properly it\u0027s going to be amazing ! And then thinking that at some point there is going to be colonies and interstellar blows my mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T00:17:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kaerbanogue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
