Lets remove maneuver nodes because those are complete BS and unrealistic. You should have to calculate your trajectories manually. Also add in an ultra realistic atmosphere with real solar system sizes, and N-body physics. Basically to play the game you would have to have to literally be a rocket scientist. Lets make the game a real simulation and after about 10 years of post graduate education and experience you might actually get something into orbit... providing you are willing to collaborate with large teams of other scientists who also have an extensive education. Don\u0027t kid yourself, Kerbal Space Program is never going to even begin to approach reality even with all the \u0022ultra\u0022 realism mods. There is a level of realism that even the most hard core among this community would finally say \u0022Ain\u0027t nobody got time fo dat.\u0022 Then no one would be playing the game, because almost everyone who could play the game would actually be helping to launch .... into space IRL.\n\nSo what I\u0027m trying to say is that there is a sweet spot for everyone in regard to realism. And no two people are ever going to agree on exactly where that spot is. The real goal is to make a game that educates as well as entertains. And if you cross the psychological boundary of \u0022ain\u0027t nobody got time for dat\u0022, you are going to lose most of your players. Typically ultra realism, even in simulators has been left to modding communities. I don\u0027t know where that line is, but it\u0027s important to stay on the right side of it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T04:07:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jikahn**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:23:36Z","Content":"I would be happy for a less memory wasting stock game.\n\nSome of the Krakens from service bays and stuff being killed would be great, too.\n\nAnd maybe in the next five hours? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) :D ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T10:14:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.0.2 100% reentry heat.
