Lets remove maneuver nodes because those are complete BS and unrealistic. You should have to calculate your trajectories manually. Also add in an ultra realistic atmosphere with real solar system sizes, and N-body physics. Basically to play the game you would have to have to literally be a rocket scientist. Lets make the game a real simulation and after about 10 years of post graduate education and experience you might actually get something into orbit... providing you are willing to collaborate with large teams of other scientists who also have an extensive education. Don\u0027t kid yourself, Kerbal Space Program is never going to even begin to approach reality even with all the \u0022ultra\u0022 realism mods. There is a level of realism that even the most hard core among this community would finally say \u0022Ain\u0027t nobody got time fo dat.\u0022 Then no one would be playing the game, because almost everyone who could play the game would actually be helping to launch .... into space IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m trying to say is that there is a sweet spot for everyone in regard to realism.
