I know the Kerbol System is scaled down in size, while using high density to have the analogue planets have similar gravities to their real life counterparts. So do the counterpart engines have any sort of scaling down in terms of their numbers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, taking this page \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_rocket_engines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, and the numbers it gives, which ones can we actually use as direct translations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems as though the ISP rating are roughly similar to Kerbals equivalents, such as the Falcon 9 (From SpaceX) get\u0027s a rating of 310 in a vacuum, very similar to the Rockomax Mainsail\u0027s rating of 330. The part I have difficulty with is the overall engine power each engine is capable of putting out. I\u0027m guessing in terms of the above page, the column I\u0027m looking for is the Vacuum thrust. Though it seems KSP does not measure their thrust in Newtons (720,000n max engine power, would likely turn your Kerbalnauts into a fine green paste). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo back to my main question, how do I take a thrust rating in Newtons, and translate that into a Max Engine output for my engine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Or am I looking at the wrong number and barking up the wrong tree entirely?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T02:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe that KSP engines used kilo-Newtons for thrust, though I may be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd consider that many parts in KSP are also balanced for gameplay purposes, and may not have any real correlation with a real-world example.
