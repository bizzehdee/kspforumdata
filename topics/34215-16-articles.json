A fuel tug will be very useful, but so is having a dedicated transport between the ground base and station. Maybe try to combine the ideas? A shiny, bigger shuttle with maybe a small tug attached to it, so you can still do a fair bit of fuel transfer. That way you can leave the tug at the station while the shuttle heads down to Minmus.

As it was designed the shuttle didn\u0027t have a lateral docking port but i\u0027ll add one anyway. The depot has two lateral ports, a jr. one and a normal one, mounted on LT-1 landing struts. You should be able to dock to the shuttle via the depot while its still attached to the shuttle if the rover is smaller, and to the lateral port i\u0027ll add afterwards. I don\u0027t know how high the rover\u0027s ports will be off the ground, so i dont know how to fit the ports to the shuttle.

I noticed from Destroyer\u0027s save that the orbit had been bumped up a few kilometers and the station wasn\u0027t directly on top of the base anymore. Probably after some time passed when Destroyer\u0027s module was heading to Minmus. So instead of fixing it (because I didn\u0027t realize there was a probe on the Mass Relay), I simply edited the save to place the station where it had been previously. So yea, the inclination is back to being slightly off, but I\u0027ll fix it once Spyrit\u0027s module goes up. I just wanted to get the file ready for him before that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is right now, we only have one rover that needs fuel, so we probably won\u0027t need a whole lot of extra.

Nor have I even played KSP in about a month. this is gonna be fun.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t come up with a solid idea, I\u0027d recommend doing something like a hab module for the station. Keep in mind you can use up to 60 parts and have multiple modules (as long as the total part count is 60 or less), so you can mess around with a few different things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve finally got a bit of time off tomorrow, I\u0027ll take a look at the persistance then and fix up the station\u0027s orbit. So I\u0027ll have an updated save file for you tomorrow, leax.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T19:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVideo coming this weekend - biiit of trouble with the voiceover.
