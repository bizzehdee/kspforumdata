Even then, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d be willing to accept that a robot that could do even one of these things was \u0022intelligent.\u0022 Functionally competent in a narrow spectrum of tasks? Even to some extent creative or improvisational? Resourceful? Efficient? Problem-focused? Sure, I\u00A0can believe all that will be doable and maybe even in the next generation or two. But I would not consider that alone to be intelligence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen computers can do things like: create the next Minecraft, or become the next Warren Buffet, or get itself elected President, then we will be SURE that they have created \u0022artifical intelligence\u0022 but short of those sorts of lofty thresholds of human accomplishments, and moreover, the whole suite of attached characteristics (Warren Buffet is after all, not merely a dude who got rich on the stock market, he is also a father, a grandfather, a role model, a community member, a commentator, a writer, a leader, a WHOLE PERSON . . .)
