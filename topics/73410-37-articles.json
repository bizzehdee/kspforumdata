You generally need to use hypergolics to get more than one ignition. Stuff like J-2 or Merlin 1D clones get exemptions because in RL they\u0026#39;re actually designed to relight with non-hypergolic fuels. But those tend to be the exception. They are also tied to the individual mixture configs, which means that on the parts screen you only see the default mixtures ignitions. If they\u0026#39;ve been set as such, an engine could have 12 ignitions when you use UDMH/NTO but it defaults to kerolox which only has 1, and therefore you can only see the default ignitions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd there are always murky decisions made here. Or ones I made for reasons I can\u0026#39;t remember. Most engines don\u0026#39;t say \u0022This is for upper stages\u0022 in the description, and even then that description could mean L\u002B, U, U\u002B, or O. So sometimes I flip a coin, or just set the engine to how I like to use it. But yeah, I agree the Maverick probably should be a launch engine, since it\u0026#39;s pretty high thrust for that size compared to stock. :huh: Not sure how that\u0026#39;s been missed for this long, but hey.
