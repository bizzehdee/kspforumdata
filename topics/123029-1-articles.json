Well, all the SpaceX fans at least.... The ASDS!!!! SpaceX has publicly show off it\u0027s unique recovery platform since November 2014, and has attempted 2 landings on it so far (CRS-5 and CRS-6)... should be 4 attempts, but 1 attempt was aborted due to bad weather at sea (DSCOVR), and the other never got a chance since the rocket exploded (CRS-7).. Anyway, it\u0027s about time we had an ASDS in KSP... So I made one. This is my first mod, so this has been a great learning opportunity for me. I hope you all enjoy this mod, and may your landings be successful..... or not, I gave the ASDS a high crash tolerance, so don\u0027t worry about crashing into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spacedock.info/mod/625/SpaceX%20ASDS?ga=%3CGame\u002B3102\u002B%27Kerbal\u002BSpace\u002BProgram%27%3E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceDock\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHighly Recommended:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI highly recommend you add \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124336-PART-1-0-4-ON-HOLD-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-5-3-(July-6th)\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E MechJeb 2.0\u003C/a\u003E. While the mod will still function without Mechjeb, it is very difficult to land on ASDS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to use:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout MechJeb: When landing your rocket on the ASDS, land as close to dead-center as possible. Any off-center force will cause the ASDS to roll, and drop your rocket in the water. The default S.A.S does a poor job of counteraction this motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith MechJeb: With the ASDS in water, use the Smart A.S.S. function, and activate Surface\u0026gt;Up. This keeps the ASDS in a stable landing configuration. Otherwise the ASDS will roll as mentioned above. When landing on the ASDS, switch to the ASDS and reactivate Surface\u0026gt;Up. This will refresh MechJeb and remind it to keep the \u0022Up\u0022 attitude. If you forget to refresh MechJeb, it will default to off and the ASDS will roll over on landing. After refreshing MechJeb, simply land your rocket. Simple as that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my first mod, so I would not be surprised if there are any bugs. If you find any, please let me know.

So instead I\u0027ll just explain it... The only reason I wanted to make a video is because it would be more fun. Anyway, all I do is add a few rocket engines to the underside. You may have noticed there are a few attachment nodes. There are 4 placed in the corners that I use to attach the engines to. Don\u0027t worry about fuel tanks, I just use infinite fuel to get it to the water. Also, you don\u0027t even need to worry about decouples. Just fly straight into the water. I few into the water at 800m/s and all the parts were destroyed except the ASDS itself.... pretty convenient cleanup!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pricom","CreatedById":81661,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T06:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think combining this with the Maritime pack,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125063-1-0-3-Maritime-Pack-Beta-0-0-13-RoRo-ReReased\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125063-1-0-3-Maritime-Pack-Beta-0-0-13-RoRo-ReReased\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be a match made in heaven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was actually thinking of using the CVE as a landing pad actually!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T11:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know Elon musk joked about adding Merlins to the ASDS, just use those.

Probably impossible. F9 is already really hard to control, I actually use vernier engines instead of RCS to add more control. Anyway, because of F9\u0027s size and shape I\u0027d expect that landing ASDS on top would cause a completely loss of control. However, landing a F9 on an ASDS, while ASDS is in a stable hover.... That might be possible. I\u0027ll test both and report back... Although that may have to wait till tomorrow. Work today and school assignments tonight, classic Kerbal-killjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
