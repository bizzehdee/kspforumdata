The stock science lab essentially allows you to multiply this science gained from experiments by a factor of 6. The lack of stock life support makes it especially easy to deploy some science labs and time warp until the tech tree is unlocked. Some people like the system as is and others started to completely ignore the lab and call it OP. To make the science labs comply with my personal playstyle I decided to make some rather substantial changes to the respective config files and I happily share those with you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**General Intentions**\n\n- Science labs allow you to double the science gained by experiments (factor 2 instead of 6)\n- Science labs are supposed to do some background processing while running other missions  \n\n    - There should be no need to babysit science labs all day long\n\n    [\\*]Science labs combine the knowledge gathered from single experiments and produce further science\n\n    - A lot of data should be necessary to do that efficiently\n\n    [\\*]Science labs produce science based on given data independent of their current location\n\n    - It should not make a difference where you process your data\n\n    [\\*]Science lab is a mid to late game utility\n\n    - You need a lot of data input for reasonable science output\n    - You need skilled scientists for reasonable output\n\n    [\\*]Balancing is done with respect to typical travel times to other planets\n\n **Practical Implementation**\n\n- Data and science storage has been heavily increased  \n\n    - BEFORE: 500\n    - NOW: 1000 to 8000\n\n    [\\*]Science multiplier has been decreased\n\n    - BEFORE: 5\n    - NOW: 1\n\n    [\\*]Surface and context bonuses have been removed \n\n    [\\*]Necessary research time has been increased\n\n**Features**\n\n- All labs with the same number of crew are equally fast  \n\n    - Independent of the maximum storage capacity\n\n    [\\*]The more scientists a lab supports the lower is the efficiency\n\n    - For example a lab with 2 crew has the maximum speed of 1.92 crew\n    - A lab with 12 crew has the maximum speed of 6.72 crew only\n    - 1 scientist produces 5.0 science per day\n    - 2 scientists produce 1.92 \\* 5.0 = 9.6 science per day\n    - ...\n\n    [\\*]EC is calculated based on storage and maximum crew\n\n    - 1 EC per 1000 storage\n    - 1.5 EC per scientist workplace\n\n    [\\*]Labs only work efficiently when their capacities are maxed out\n\n    - A 4000 storage lab with only 2000 data works on 50% speed\n    - A 4 crew lab with only 2 crew also works at 50% speed\n    - Always choose a lab that perfectly matches your mission!\n\n**Supported Labs**\n\n**Mobile Processing Lab** MPL-DSD-1\n\n(Included)\n\n- Small orbital data collector/processor\n- Data/Science storage: 2000\n- Min. | Max. crew: 1 | 1\n- Cost (Entry Cost): 4000 (10000)\n- Mass: 3.5t\n- EC per second: 3.5\n- Max. performance: 5.0 sci/day (1 x 5 star scientist;
