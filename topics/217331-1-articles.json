I need to ask the question to someone else and only then do I find the solution myself,.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had originally placed the KSP folder in the Applications folder. I noticed that several people in the forums recommended to place the KSP folder directly in the (username) folder for whatever reasons. I did and KSP now works. I just copied the entire previous folder to macinstoch HD/users/(myusername), I have not even deleted the previous folder, and all went well when I started the program from this new folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all is well now (so far), and thank you for those who proposed this solution into subdiscussions here and there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
