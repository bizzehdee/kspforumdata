Like many, I wanted to buy/build a decent gaming PC during the lockdowns. I built mine last September, before the newer stuff came out, although I was aware of it. I never intended it to be a high-end system but at the same time didn\u0027t want to buy something outdated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally I eyed up the Ryzen 3300X but its basically a paper product, its very sparsely available - so went for the 3600X out of necessity. For graphics, I always knew about the 3000 series but in the interim, went for a cheap(ish) secondhand 2060. I have yet to find a game yet, where the system struggles to cope. On the most demanding, a hardware monitor shows the GPU gets 100% utilised and reaches its 179W power limit, but I\u0027ve not seen poor frame rates in.....anything. Anything except.....KSP! If you construct a space station then add bits and add bits so it has loads of parts, that\u0027s the only thing it struggles with (but I think that\u0027s a KSP issue or rather a me-making-a-silly-too-big-space-station-in-KSP issue). I even owned MSFS2020 for a short while - no problems with performance there either (on decent settings too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, on the internet the Ryzen 5xxx\u00A0and NVidia 3xxx\u00A0are great, but in reality the previous generation are still able to keep up with the vast majority of games (at least in my limited experience). Maybe there\u0027s something in the future coming out which will push the performance boundaries again (MSFS2020 does this on older PCs....). Or you want to run everything in 4K at 120\u002Bfps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Popestar","CreatedById":192906,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-16T21:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223909903\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187327\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610798630\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002263317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elthy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Elthy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least in germany both are available, Nvidia GPUs and AMDs 12/16 core at very high prices (\u002B30%) while AMDs 6/8core are close to UVP.

Also the maximum stated clockspeed isnt used all the time, only when thermals and power usage allow. Here Zen2 is more efficient than Skylake, allowing it to sustain its speed for longer, while its still possible that the Intel CPU is faster for short bursts (a few seconds long) due to its way higher maximum clockspeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are right that the corecount doesnt matter much for KSP so its important to focus on the single thread speed.
