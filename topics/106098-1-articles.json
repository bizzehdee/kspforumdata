I am designing transport rovers that move the fuel from the refinery to VTOL craft that take it to a station in orbit. It seems its very hard to get docking ports from the rover to the refinery to aline. In general I think its very hard to use docking ports on the surface of planets, Squad should implement fuel lines that Kerbals can hold and attach to fuel reciprocals that attach to the sides of ships and such. It would make the logistics of a mining colony less frustrating, and would make a great addition to the game.(IMO)\n\nWhat do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:30:55Z","Content":"What you\u0027ve described is basically the fuel pipes of Kerbal Attachment System:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"ImperialistPigDog","CreatedById":60825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:50:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What you\u0027ve described is basically the fuel pipes of Kerbal Attachment System:\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29)\n\nRight, but this would be stock and just for pumping fuel.
