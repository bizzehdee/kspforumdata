Reentry was fine with 1.0. You could deploy the chutes way down. No problem. Planes going overly fast and large planes not having enough aerodynamic control, that was not cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Shuttles floating at 25m/s are also not cool. I experienced that myself. It just feels stupid. This is simply broken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0.0 aero was balanced ok. Drag was a little low, but you could land planes reasonable speeds just fine if you deployed flaps on the main wings. That is how it is supposed to be! Drag chutes on shuttles made sense, aswell!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople claiming that SSTOs are broken are just wrong. Build different designs. Old SSTOs usually exploited the heavily overpowered TurboJets. That was basicly cheating. If those designs were sensible, there would be lots of SSTOs in real life. Ther aren\u0027t. I just built a quick Skylon type thingy yesterday that got into high kerbin orbit with payload and fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy criticism is that they did this massive change to the values that were well tweaked and balanced by the QA and Experimentals. I think they did it because of all the threads raging about SSTO reentry beeing impossible ... which is not true aswell. I think they overreacted and hope they find a middleground in the next patch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roflcopterkklol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roflcopterkklol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr they could.. you know... not ruin the game by making the drag over the top.. it is the main thing that has frustrated so many people.. \u003Cp\u003EEven rockets are a struggle to keep under control now with the soup, gravity turns can not be started until 15km or so.. they had it fairly good in 1.0 why ruin it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no struggle at all...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMerged with existing thread, this topic is already causing a lot of contention and it\u0027s best if it all stays in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the 1.0.0 aerodynamics more, so i stick with 1.0.0\u002BClaw\u0027s bug fixes = success! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit... there is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118633-1-0-Aerodynamics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecfg\u003C/a\u003E that downgrades aerodynamics to 1.0.0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T10:57:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StainX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Norpo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Norpo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe main complaint I\u0027ve seen is about the modified aero, which is more soupy than 1.0\u0027s.\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a gif showing a shuttle with small wings landing.. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gfycat.com/AbsoluteFrequentCanine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eat 25 m/s.\u003C/a\u003E It looks like it\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E floating.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo me it looks like that shuttle is falling about right, just that the game is lagging a bit.

Simply waving away these concerns with a \u0027git gud scrub\u0027 does very little good. The adjusted model in the hotfix has made flying feel less realistic than the 1.0 model for a lot of people, and I think that the drag buff was just overdone in reaction to a community backlash. Personally, I felt that 1.0 was fine, so I would push for veering back towards that, but I understand the desire for a little more atmosoup to avoid putting off newer players with catastrophic reentry heating.
