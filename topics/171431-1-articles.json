As far as I know the engine heat gen is hard coded to be proportional to the\u00A0throttle so if you want the opposite then you will need to set the engine\u00A0heatProduction to 0 and have an other module generate the heat related to the throttle.\u00A0\u00A0I can\u0027t think of a module that already does that, but someone else may have an idea\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XrayLima","CreatedById":88466,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T17:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I had begun to think the same. \u00A0Getting more complicated...... :-(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
