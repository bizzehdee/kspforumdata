Using Ubuntu 14.10, I followed the great installation guide posted by Sal Vager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnmodded, the game ran fine using both open source and proprietary AMD drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter installing mods using CKAN, I start the game (everything loads up very quickly), go into VAB, and usually, as soon as I get the first part out (for example MK1 cockpit), the game freezes. Music still playing, no keyboard control, and sometimes mouse still usable, but I cannot go back to the desktop environment to kill the KSP process - so I\u0027m forced to reset the computer. Uninstalling the part heavy mods doesn\u0027t seem to change anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried uninstalling mods thinking it was a memory problem (I have 8GB). System Monitor crashes as soon as KSP starts, so I used the TOP command to track memory. Right up until the point KSP freezes, only ~3.1GB RAM used by KSP, and CPU is running at 101.4% somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am including the KSP.log fileand player.log file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4gbbRcUMvBacDdFZ1RGOGdpdEk/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4gbbRcUMvBacDdFZ1RGOGdpdEk/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4gbbRcUMvBaVU43dEc4Q0hrSm8/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4gbbRcUMvBaVU43dEc4Q0hrSm8/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize if someone has already answered this - I looked everywhere on the forums without luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for your help everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T23:48:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 11:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AirComrade\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded player.log file link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T17:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis won\u0027t help your problem but if you press ctrl \u002B alt \u002B F1 it will put you on a command line where you can login and type \u0022killall KSP.x86_64\u0022 without quotes to end KSP and then press ctrl \u002B alt\u002B F7 to get back to your desktop\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AirComrade","CreatedById":110371,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T00:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ectrl\u002Balt\u002BF1 doesn\u0027t seem to work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T10:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have an AMD card, but going by various similar issues reported it\u0027s I\u0027d say it\u0027s probably GPU driver related.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106425-Problems-with-KSP-and-Ubuntu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESome have had better luck\u003C/a\u003E after upgrading the AMD driver, what version are you running?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T13:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry for bothering, but if, as i understood, the game runs unmodded but fails with \u0022more mods\u0022 then please let me suggest to first exclude possible problems with mods. How about installing the mods one by one, using a new savefile for each try and see wether you can identify a single mod responsible for the problems. Maybe you can find the solution then in that addons thread ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the long term you will probably want to use the proprietary drivers as proposed (stability, performance) ... pls, read the installation guide provided ba amd on the website ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you get it solved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
