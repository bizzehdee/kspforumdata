In KSP terms, the atmospheric height is probably somewhere around 24km, maybe 23km. Once the higher-thrust mode kicks in the craft rises quickly, gaining some ten km in about a minute. In KSP terms, that puts you at about 30km or so, well into the third atmosphere band where atmospheric heating is much less. Furthermore, you should actually be doing that transition much faster since launches in KSP are so much faster to begin with.\u003Cp\u003EWhen Skylon switches over to closed-cycle mode it still has some 7~8km/s of burn left before orbit. KSP, in constrast, using the flight profile you have outlined with an expected speed of 1500m/s at 24km, only requires you to expend another 1500m/s or so. That\u0027s only half of your delta-V as rocket fuel. If you were following Skylon\u0027s flight profile scaled properly, you\u0027d instead be flying at about 500m/s (give or take) at 24km altitude before igniting your closed-cycle engines and rapidly climbing out of the atmosphere that is heating your craft. in other words, if you want to use a fictional* spaceplane as your reference, use that reference correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: It\u0027s worth pointing out that KSP\u0027s atmospheric heating is scaled to actually matter. That is, if you modeled it directly off of Earth\u0027s atmospheric model you literally wouldn\u0027t care about heating at all because of the slow speeds the craft move at. Seriously, the fictional Skylon moving at its fastest air-breathing mode is about 68% of LKO orbital velocity (about 2.2km/s), as opposed to 19% of LEO orbital velocity (7.8km/s).

I\u0027ve found that staying in the lower atmosphere (10k - 15k) whilst trying to build up speed results in overheating and big explosions. Trying to build up speed much above 18k or so means the engines are running out of oomph and you can actually start slowing down. My successful flights to orbit so far have built up most of the speed on jets between 15k and 18k. I\u0027ve also found that the Rapier engine, if left in auto switching mode, tends to switch to closed cycle a little early.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally managed to design a spaceplane i like.
