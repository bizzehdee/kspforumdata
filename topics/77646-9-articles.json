What about infrastructure? C\u0026amp;C? How are you going to send commands and receive your pictures from space? What\u0027s the transmission rate you can hope for? What will be your comms window? Doppler effect?\u003Cp\u003EYou really need to know such things, as even basic ground station is easily over 10k euro, and even then I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027d be able to do anything more fancy than sending some very basic commands - and you want to transfer an entire photographs from space. You have no idea how much of a challenge is that - and it becomes much, much more expensive once you think about anything further away than LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a magnetotorquer costs 600 Euro from the same people, yes. An S-band dish can be recycled from an old satellite dish for free. All you need is an actual generator and a receiver. Hell, I could build a microwave cavity for an S-band if need be, so only a transmitter really. And that\u0027s basically a microwave\u0027s magnetron that you can modulate. (Amateur S-band is actually at the same frequency as consumer microwave oven. You seriously can just turn a microwave oven into an S-band transmitter, but that\u0027s more of a fallback if we can\u0027t get funds for something better. FCC might not like us for using microwave. It\u0027s \u0027noisy\u0027.) It might be a bit crude, but for sending something that\u0027s going to be a few hundred km away passing by, it will be good enough. Lets not forget that we don\u0027t need space-worthy for a ground station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, I\u0027m hoping for some support from existing CubeSat users. We do need to have at least one ground station, but it\u0027d be nice if we could rely on other people to be able to receive tracking and image data from all over the world, so we can do data pulls more frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to take a closer look at available cubesat receiver/transmitter hardware before settling on protocol, but tentatively, I\u0027d organize all of the important communications into packets of 2-byte symbols. I would chose a prime under 2^16 as a base, and have everything done in Z\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E of that prime. That lets me use some theorems on polynomials over fields that can be used for error correction. I could organize the packets so that at 50% random data loss, the data is not corrupt. Missing important instructions because of noise isn\u0027t nice. Of course, the only thing worse than not receiving instruction is receiving a wrong one, so each packet will come with a CRC as well, in case signal quality causes degradation that error correction can\u0027t handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how paranoid we need to be about security, whether encryption should be used. We\u0027ll probably have to share a key with enough people to make it kind of irrelevant if we wish to get help form other users. And then it\u0027d be just a waste of processing power. But we can talk about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike all other data that goes up and down, image downstream does not need to be as reliable, but it needs to be both compressed and error insensitive. JPEG, for example, would be a very bad call. An error early on would junk the whole data. But sending raw images is wasteful and slow as well. I\u0027m leaning towards something JPEG based, but using something other than Huffman codes, so that decoding can resume after a loss. Maybe just run each tile in its own packet of Huffman codes, though. That\u0027d make it super easy for an amateur user to build a JPEG out of it. And losing a tile isn\u0027t as bad as losing the whole image. Anyways, we can work on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else is fairly routine stuff. The Doppler factor for an LEO sat is whopping... 1.000025. I don\u0027t think we can afford a receiver/transmitter that wouldn\u0027t have a bigger window. Not even if we waste 10k Euro on a \u0022professional\u0022 ground station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a reason why I\u0027m starting with a cubesat hardware specs first. I can work out navs and logic once I have these specs. It\u0027s not that hard. Right now, I\u0027m going through specific hardware for LEO mission, so I can put together an \u0022official\u0022 shopping list and a price tag for the basic mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Guys, deorbit is not feasible for the base mission.
