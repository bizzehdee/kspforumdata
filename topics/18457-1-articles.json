Or not, I guess it is after all up to the developers. The thing with games like this, though, is that they don\u0027t have a set list of things they want in the game -- it changes all the time, meaning they\u0027re always adding new things and planning even more for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T22:20:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only crashed a couple of times for me, less than several \u0027fully-complete\u0027 games have, so it\u0027s stable enough by my reckoning.
