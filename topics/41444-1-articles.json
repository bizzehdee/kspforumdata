In the finest tradition of Kerbish rocket science, everything has been an \u0022all up test\u0022 along the way. Amazingly, no one has been killed yet. Not wanting to revert or save/load, I wanted to try to save some of my creations from my own mistakes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal engineers quickly mastered getting objects into space and have probes circling both Mun and Minmus. They figured the next logical step was a multi-part space station around Kerbin, to practice both heavy lifting and docking before moving on to interplanetary landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the first part of the space station with a single pilot on orbit with just a cupola and habitat module. Once reaching orbit, poor Jeb realized that the so-called rocket scientists forgot to install RCS thrusters or an emergency return spacecraft, so he was there for the long haul. He oriented the station to a compass heading for future docking, and with his job now done, moved from the cupola into the habitat to wait for his buddies in solitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWanting to help him out, I modified the design of the station for module 2, now with RCS included. This time, it launched with four intrepid Kerbonauts ready to dock and rescue their buddy- blissfully unaware that they still had no way to get home. On top of that, they only had one docking port so once attached to the first module, there would be no other way to expand the station or dock a supply ship short of abandoning half of the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce reaching orbit and achieving a clean rendezvous, the Kerbonauts transmitted a string of curses to mission control that I will not repeat here- at what would have been a perfect docking, nothing would clamp. One Kerbonaut went EVA to shine lights on and inspect both spacecraft, and quickly realized the engineers installed both docking ports backwards. Not only was there no way to make the station larger, there was no way for a rescue ship to dock and bring them home. Jeb went EVA from SpaceHab 1 to SpaceHab 2 to join his alleged \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crescuers,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 both filling the second station to capacity and putting all their eggs into one basket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have to build a rescue ship for 5 Kerbonauts, and plan for 5 EVAs to transfer crew, but at least I know I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to include any docking ports...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T19:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol! I did the same thing with the Clamp-O-tron Sr. Placed it on my spacestation backwards and couldn\u0027t figure out why the magnets wouldn\u0027t engage. DOH! As far as your other problem of rescuing your kerbalnauts. Just park your rescue ship close to the space station with it\u0027s relative velocity as close to 0 as possible. Then you can EVA each kerbalnaut over to the other ship and bring them home. Hopefully you have a probe body mounted on your spacestation so you can control it without having a pilot onboard. Then you can deorbit and launch another station. If you don\u0027t have a probe body you can just abort mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild your rescue ship with a 2 or 3 man capsule and 1 hitchhiker module. Before launch remove one crew member so you can put 1 rescued kerbal in the capsule and the other 4 in the hitchhiker module.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T21:04:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Landge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T20:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, no probe body!

Or maybe something with an engine and a big claw framework on the front to capture (without docking to) the habitats and fire a deorbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBig claw!
