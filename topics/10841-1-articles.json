It\\\u0027s what I meant with air buoyancy. As the atmosphere gets thinner, my spaceplane starts to loose flight stability.\n\nIs the only possibility to just add more boosters/engines or is there a design trick that could work?"},{"CreatedByName":"TerranCmdr","CreatedById":23552,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T23:12:46Z","Content":"Longer wings maybe?

I know this one.\n\nThe difference between my early *Harrier* aircarrier, which was supposed to put a spaceplane into near-orbit, and the current *Harrier*, is that I used the same wing configuration as one of my early triumphs, the *Ibis* Munar space plane. Let me get this straight - these are BIG craft. So at first, I used the biggest wings I could on the *Harrier*. You know, the really long ones. It just flips, goes crazy, and falls out of the sky.\n\nWith *Ibis* configuration - having the wings close to the spaceplane, covering as much of the length of the spaceplane as possible - you get the same, if not more lift, and it makes it a lot more controllable.\n\nSo do this:\n\n P\n\n C F C\n\n WFW\n\n WFW\n\n WFW\n\nWWFWW\n\nRather than this:\n\n P\n\n C F C\n\nWWWFWWW\n\nWWWFWWW\n\n C F C\n\nP - Pod\n\nC - Canard\n\nW- Wing\n\nF - Fuselage\n\nThe second thing. In the upper atmosphere, your control surfaces will lose their effectiveness. At that altitude, you need RCS to keep you stable."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:18:40Z","Content":"It is time for a new meme around here. *More boosters* is no longer the only answer.
