I have a perfect Miller\u0027s Planet, as stated last update. I expect this to get a alpha release in the next few weeks after 1.0. Maybe sooner.

I\u0027m not stopping everything, as I still need to find a Mann\u0027s Planet, so I\u0027m not giving up. The reason for me waiting is bugs. If I release this thing when 1.0 still has the major bugs, It might break too, and I\u0027m not taking any chances. THIS. WILL. GET. A. RELEASE. SOON.
