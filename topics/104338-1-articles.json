All oceans, no ice caps! Working on the config now! I don\u0027t know if you can export black hole textures, as I found one, and I\u0027m sure you can, but I\u0027m still\n\nnot sure. Experiment time!\n\nUpdate 2: For those still [checking!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) this, Space Engine is messing around with me. I can\u0027t find an ice planet that matches Dr. Mann\u0027s planet perfectly. Also, it\u0027s glitching a little. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not giving up. I have found 3 Edmund candidates. I have a perfect Miller\u0027s Planet, as stated last update. I expect this to get a alpha release in the next few weeks after 1.0. Maybe sooner. I\u0027ll see what happens ;D.\n\nUpdate 3: I\u0027m working on the Gargantua config as of now. I will lose a few hours of time, but I expect to finish Gargantua tomorrow, and move on to Miller. You guys want it, so I\u0027m working as fast as possible. I\u0027m not giving up at all. Thanks for all your wonderful support. I promise this will get released.\n\nUpdate 4: Forgot to save the Gargantua config last night. This is a small setback. I\u0027m also taking a break for a few days, I plan to resume on Friday or Saturday. Don\u0027t worry, Just a small hiccup. I\u0027m still keeping my promise.\n\nUpdate 5: I found the Gargantua config deep into my computer, so no lost progress! I\u0027m waiting to work on this until 1.0 releases. I\u0027m not stopping everything, as I still need to find a Mann\u0027s Planet, so I\u0027m not giving up. The reason for me waiting is bugs. If I release this thing when 1.0 still has the major bugs, It might break too, and I\u0027m not taking any chances. THIS. WILL. GET. A. RELEASE. SOON. Don\u0027t worry!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T20:01:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HoloYolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T21:09:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E but no idiot to blow an airlock and make an intense scene.\n\nI know you\u0027re just being rhetorical, but wouldn\u0027t Jeb or any of the stupider kerbals count?"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T21:20:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I know you\u0027re just being rhetorical, but wouldn\u0027t Jeb or any of the stupider kerbals count?\n\nJeb is so not an idiot, how do you think he\u0027s still loved by many.
