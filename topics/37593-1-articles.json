I\u0027ve mostly been testing some new Dragon and Mir designs, as well as testing some mods. My goal for .21 is to have a \u0027modular\u0027 space program with Ioncross life support. The idea of resupply missions is exciting, especially with purpose built craft and stations. Need some ideas for naming my space agency though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wait is agonizing but I know it\u0027ll be worth it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T18:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
