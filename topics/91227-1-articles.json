I\u0027ve never (yet) bothered with redirection or capture, although I have picked out a nice big one for a future mission. Anyway, I\u0027ve just finished a uni module topic about Near Earth Objects and impact probabilities, and it got me wondering...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens to the asteroids that occasionally hit Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking about the ones that you crash on purpose or deliberately watch all the way in, but more about the ones that happen to crash to Kearth when nobody\u0027s looking.

What happens if they do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever having watched an asteroid do anything, except float along a trajectory line in the tracking station, I would guess that the on-rails physics either passes them straight through the planet (very boring indeed...) or that they pop out of existence when they encounter the atmosphere due to not being inside the physics bubble of an active craft. Well, ok, I thought, but what about asteroids that collide with Mun or Minmus (which must happen sometimes...)? There\u0027s no physics bubble on bodies without an atmosphere, so surely these asteroid must hit the surface?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn which case... are there asteroids, right now, lying around, maybe on Kerbin (under the sea?), more likely on Mun or Minmus, that represent my utter failure to protect Kerbalkind from the dangers of deep space?

The Asteroid Redirect Mission is not and was never about intercepting asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth.

(And in reality it\u0027s a contrived prestige project for the Obama administration and an excuse for congress to force NASA to build the SLS, thereby funneling most of NASA\u0027s budget into the industry of certain states).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cooperation between NASA and KSP is one of advertising. Squad can advertise the game with the NASA logo, and NASA gets free publicity for their next big human spaceflight mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order for KSP to simulate asteroid strikes, a complete rewrite of the entire physics engine would be required, something that\u0027s way out of scope for any single patch. Also, keep in mind that asteroid strikes are very common. About one in 20 will directly collide with Kerbin - I\u0027ve even started fresh saves with an asteroid already inside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and five days out from divebombing the planet. It would take the player constant effort to keep these pesky rocks away. And finally: none of the asteroids in KSP are actually of significant enough size to realistically cause heavy damage. Even the E-class rocks are slightly smaller than the Chelyabinsk meteor, which - despite causing a shockwave that made a large number of people injure themselves with broken window glass - didn\u0027t even manage to reach the ground before burning up because it just wasn\u0027t large enough.

Asteroid redirection is very much a part of NASAs ongoing mandate, not only for the Earth\u0027s protection but for the scientific data that having their hands on a whole asteroid for study could provide. The last 15 years has been spent cataloguing near Earth objects and working out if there are any (albeit over a certain size) that are likely to hit the Earth within 100 years - a mission that is now expanding to cover more and more objects. KSP might seem like a rather silly sort of \u0027game\u0027, but in fact its a very detailed simulator of (somewhat simplified) orbital mechanics. I have no doubt that it\u0027s extremely popular over in Washington at NASA Headquarters - after all, the ARMA series and Full Spectrum Warrior games began life as military training software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re taking a very cynical view of NASA\u0027s relationship with KSP. Personally, I could have enjoyed the game as much without it, but that doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s an arrangement that doesn\u0027t make sense or enrich the game experience, or have non-commercial benefits for both organisations and players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe frequency of strikes could be adjusted in the appropriate config file. If it doesn\u0027t currently exist, Squad could certainly add it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of ways that asteroid strikes could be implemented that would not require any physics overhaul. The game has a trigger to remove an object from the simulator on a collision, so why shouldn\u0027t this trigger be coded to produce other effects?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Chelyabinsk meteor was travelling relatively slowly and didn\u0027t hit the ground (in any harmful sense), having burned through a much deeper atmosphere than Kerbin\u0027s. Secondly, Kerbin\u0027s radius is less than 1/10th the size of Earth\u0027s, so it would stand to reason that \u0027dangerous\u0027 objects would also only be 1/10th of RL radius. Therefore a RL scaled E-class asteroid would be 300m across - that\u0027s a seriously dangerous asteroid. The Barringer Crater in Arizona (the place where Thor found Mjolnir) was created by an object around 100m across, and created devastation over tens of kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not asking out of a pursuit for realism, but a pursuit of \u0022awesome\u0022 - although I admit I\u0027d find asteroids a lot more interesting if I thought they actually were dangerous. I certainly don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way this can be accused of being a \u0027not fun\u0027 idea. If an alarm went off on rare occasions summoning you straight to the tracking station because an impactor had been identified, even that would give me a reason to bother going off to tug the hunk of rock around, or at least tuck a few folded parachutes under it\u0027s arm.
