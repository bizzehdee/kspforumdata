I\u0027ve been playing KSP and reading these forums for about 3 months now, but only just got around to making a forum account so I can post this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found a need for a compendium of resonant orbits of the different bodies in the Kerbolverse. I checked \u0027The Drawing Board\u0027 as well as doing a few Google searches for \u0022Kerbal resonant orbits\u0022, and didn\u0027t find anything that met my needs, so I made one myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to the Google Sheets, so you can view on either mobile or desktop: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uwapdg0oNEIiX0R0fUwqQvl5PhtOZ87KO-9Or6MIvGM/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uwapdg0oNEIiX0R0fUwqQvl5PhtOZ87KO-9Or6MIvGM/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst sheet is a table of common resonant orbits for all bodies in the Kerbol system, from 1:7 to 7:1 resonances. Orbits are displayed by orbital period (in seconds, and in Kerbin-time y-d-h-m-s, which is MechJeb\u0027s format) and semi-major axis. \u0027Smaller resonances\u0027 means your orbit is quicker and smaller than the parent, whereas \u0027larger resonances\u0027 means your orbit is longer than the parent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, there are an infinite number of orbital resonances, but resonances beyond 7 (like 9:13) start to get unwieldy. Who wants to time-accelerate for 13 Eeloo orbits of 17 years each? If there is demand, I can easily extend the spreadsheet to cover more resonances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond sheet is an orbital calculator that converts your 1) apoapsis and periapsis to semi-major axis and orbital period, or 2) orbital period to semi-major axis. Also included are the gravitational parameters and radii for the planets. All data is taken from the KSP Wiki as of December 2014 (presumably, KSP v. 0.25). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mostly use the orbital resonances to string multiple planetary flybys for gravity-assist purposes. Often, one gravity assist is not enough to raise your orbit from Kerbin to Jool, for example. But TWO or more gravity assists will usually get you there. By knowing the resonant orbits, you can adjust the resultant trajectory of your first gravity assist so that you can perform a second flyby gravity-assist down the road. There are plenty of other uses for orbital resonances, especially if you use ISA MapSat, Kethane, or RemoteTech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on converting this into a stand-alone tool for a website. My JavaScript is a little rusty, but I\u0027ll get around to it eventually.
