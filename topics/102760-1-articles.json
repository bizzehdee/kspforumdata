We can now hide the default jetpack and its thrusters, so that we could substitute it with a backpack of my own design.\n\nHowever, I\u0027d like to request a plugin that works for a general case - substituting *any* meshes used in *any* of the *built-in* game assets with ones made by third-party add-on authors, in the same manner TextureReplacer allows users to reskin Kerbal suit textures.\n\nPotential applications include:\n\n - Kerbal EVA and IVA suit variants that aren\u0027t just reskins of the existing models (e.g. different helmets, armored Kerbal suits, blue shirt-sleeve jumpsuits for space station IVAs) - animation rigged for different Kerbalnaut body meshes might be an issue, though\n\n - \u0022Human\u0022 astronaut models\n\n - Replacing some or all of the KSC buildings exteriors/interiors"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:08:32Z","Content":"Sounds interesting.
