(one per should be enough, put it someplace that seems like it\u0027ll help keep the tank from wiggling about).\n\nNote: It helps if you put all of these orange tanks at the same \u0022height\u0022, so that all the engines under them sit flat on the launch pad together.\n\nPut your camera inside one of the radial orange tanks and alt-click the radial decoupler. This makes a copy of the decoupler and everything attached to it. Zoom out and attach this (copied) pair of \u0022booster stacks\u0022 so they\u0027re offset 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 radially around your central orange tank from the first pair. (and at the same height as the first pair). The radial orange tanks should be nearly edge-to-edge but not intersecting.\n\nMake another copy of the stack by alt-clicking the radial decoupler. Attach the third pair of boosters to your central tank, again offset by 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. We\u0027ve made a ring of boosters (three pairs) around our central orange tank. All of the tanks in the ring should be nearly (but not quite) touching one another, and at about the same height on the central stack, and attached to it via radial decouplers and struts.\n\nRun a Fuel Line (still in 2x symmetry) from the first pair of boosters to the second (tank to tank). Then run another fuel line from the second pair to the third. Finally, add a fuel line from the third pair of boosters to the central tank.\n\nNow we need to adjust the staging. First make sure all of the skippers light at the same time (drag all the engines to the bottom of your staging list on the right).\n\nThen the next thing should be ONE pair of radial decouplers, the ones holding on the \u0022first\u0022 pair of boosters. (The ones with fuel lines coming FROM them only). If you mouse over the decouplers in the 3D view, it\u0027ll highlight them in the staging list. You\u0027ll need to create a new (empty) stage, and drag the correct pair of decouplers into it.\n\nThen the next stage is the second pair of decouplers, holding on the second pair of boosters, and the next stage is the final pair of decouplers.\n\nAt which point, you\u0027re left with the (full of fuel) central orange tank and skipper, pushing your payload. Hopefully high above Kerbin.\n\nI don\u0027t have the game open so I can\u0027t test the TWR or \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of this arrangement, but the general concept should be capable of moving that payload off Kerbin. If you have a low TWR on the launch pad, some SRBs might be useful. Generally I don\u0027t care for them, but a ring of them around this design might help get it moving off the pad. (The skipper\u0027s ASL thrust is a bit low for lifting much payload).\n\nIdeally the \u0022boosters\u0022 get you up high and moving fast, and the central \u0022core\u0022 stage is for circularizing, plane change, and burning to intercept Minmus. However, the core might be a bit low on thrust if you\u0027re not yet near apoapsis when you get to it. I suspect one skipper lifting a full orange tank plus your payload is going to have a TWR \u003C1 on Kerbin. If you find that it\u0027s not enough thrust, maybe use a gray tank for the central stage instead of an orange tank.\n\nConversely, if you find you have plenty of thrust at every stage but not enough \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for the mission, you can experiment with adding more fuel at various stages.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T17:59:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave**"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:37:23Z","Content":"I would personally go with a Poodle over the Skipper on your lander stage, wrapped with Terriers on the outside tanks, in an Asparagus setup.

If there\u0027s any fuel left in your lander at all, it\u0027s worth a shot at returning. From Minmus orbit, a Kerbal can possibly even do it alone with just his jetpack. Without parachutes or a command pod, a lone Kerbal can survive atmospheric reentry and splashdown.\n\nOr, use it as motivation to send a rescue mission.

That should set you safely down on Minmus from LKO. Launching that mass up there would probably need a Skipper, and an asparagus setup of Reliants or Swivels to boot.\n\nI\u0027m not following you here. His lander stage is pictured, and seems to be using a perfectly reasonable set of radial tanks and \u0022spark\u0022 (48-7S) engines, which should be plenty to land that on Minmus. If anything I personally might replace the 4 Sparks with 2 Terriers so I\u0027d have a higher TWR (and slightly better ISP) on my landing stage; but even one Terrier masses more than those 4 sparks, so if the sparks provide enough thrust for safe landings, they\u0027re fine.\n\nA poodle would be overkill for landing his 12t payload on Minmus, and it masses considerably more (17.5 sparks!) I can\u0027t imagine a scenario where the Skipper would ever be a good choice for landing on Minmus, and I don\u0027t think anyone here suggested doing so?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nCongrats mrklaw, it sounds like you\u0027re well on your way! F1 us some screenshots!\n\nA very similar design can put a similar payload on [Duna](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_L0f2d6IFX6SxFZn8gsp6v3VTo4u0i2CNNDwBLrzxSY\u0026authuser=0), or a more substantial payload on Mun or Minmus. (Or a lander or rover to Eve, but it won\u0027t be returning).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBy the way, what we did there with the fancy fuel lines and staging is called \u0022Asparagus Staging\u0022 and it\u0027s a great combination of practical and efficient in KSP. The first pair of tanks feed all of your launch engines (in this case, seven of them). You burn up the mass of the fuel in the first two tanks, and discard the engines that were lifting that mass at the same time you discard the tanks.\n\nThis means you keep more full tanks for longer, discard the \u0022empty fraction\u0022 of your used tanks more frequently, and discard engines as their thrust is no longer needed. It lengthens your total burn time considerably, and reduces thrust as you reduce your craft\u0027s mass (keeping your TWR more constant).\n\nCompare this to the simple 6x radial onion design. In the simplest form, we have exactly the same parts (except the fuel lines). If we light all 7 engines at once, we have the same initial mass, thrust, and obviously TWR. But all of the engines will burn for the whole duration of the flight, and all burn out at the same time. The total burn time will be much shorter, and half way through the flight we\u0027ll be lifting seven half-empty fuel tanks, as well as still lifting the mass of all seven engines. By the end of the flight, our TWR will be ridiculously high, because we\u0027re still using all 7 engines to lift a small fraction of the original mass, so we\u0027re paying (in fuel) to lift useless engine mass.\n\nAnyway, this is why discarding empty fuel tanks as soon as you can is a good idea, and discarding engines as soon as they\u0027re no longer necessary. An imaginary \u0022ideal\u0022 rocket would lift only full tanks and only enough engine power to maintain a perfect TWR at 100% throttle (somewhere near 1.3 for main ascent) from second to second. \n\nAsparagus is a relatively simple way to approximate this behavior.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T19:20:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:16:53Z","Content":"thanks, it was a huge amount of fun just watching my shadow getting closer and closer.

I think you are all completely overbuilding your rocktets. 11,8t is not extremely heavy for a payload.\n\nHere is a fairly simple design that will put it into orbit and still have fuel to spare:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Nb4BjI5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Nb4BjI5.jpg)\n\nI made a dummy payload. The tank is for adjusting the weight. \n\nIt uses a Poodle engine for the high altitude and orbital stage and a quarter size 2.5m tank. One single skipper engine and an orange tank form the atmospheric stage. Three Thumper SRBs help with TWR on the pad, igniting together with the Skipper.\n\nThe Thumpers help reach 270m/s pretty fast. After decoupling them, the rocket has a TWR of little above 1. That way the rocket reaches a velocity just below the transsonic regime fast and then stays at that velocity until it passes 10km. TWR of the main staige is rising as ISP rises and the rocket gets lighter. at around 30km the poodle takes over, slowly pushing the rocket further into orbit. At this altitude can use all the efficient engines designed for vacuum.\n\nI got this into orbit with 600m/s of delta v left in FAR.\n\nRemember that you do not need extremely high Thrust to weight ratios. 1.4-1.6 is enough! I\u0027ve gone with more here, becaus I timed the booster burnout with reaching a desired speed at a lower TWR for the rest of the rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T11:05:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 11:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaos\\_Klaus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T11:17:10Z","Content":"Would this do you?\n\n![fiKXEvV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fiKXEvV.jpg)\n\nThe main stage is enough to get to an 80km orbit.

For the the one with 9 engines, atttach them to the sides instead; it looks a bit like SpaceX\u0027s Falcon 9. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif) I think it was Temstar that discovered clustering way back in the day.\n\nIf you add a probe core, a tiny battery, and four radial parachutes, the Swivel alone is enough to (sometimes) soft land the thing for refunds. This was inspired by Brotoro, who has several fun to read mission reports that involve \u0027reusable\u0027 launchers."}]}
