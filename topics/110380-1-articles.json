If you have a low TWR on the launch pad, some SRBs might be useful. Generally I don\u0027t care for them, but a ring of them around this design might help get it moving off the pad. (The skipper\u0027s ASL thrust is a bit low for lifting much payload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally the \u0022boosters\u0022 get you up high and moving fast, and the central \u0022core\u0022 stage is for circularizing, plane change, and burning to intercept Minmus. However, the core might be a bit low on thrust if you\u0027re not yet near apoapsis when you get to it. I suspect one skipper lifting a full orange tank plus your payload is going to have a TWR \u0026lt;1 on Kerbin.

The first pair of tanks feed all of your launch engines (in this case, seven of them). You burn up the mass of the fuel in the first two tanks, and discard the engines that were lifting that mass at the same time you discard the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means you keep more full tanks for longer, discard the \u0022empty fraction\u0022 of your used tanks more frequently, and discard engines as their thrust is no longer needed. It lengthens your total burn time considerably, and reduces thrust as you reduce your craft\u0027s mass (keeping your TWR more constant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare this to the simple 6x radial onion design. In the simplest form, we have exactly the same parts (except the fuel lines). If we light all 7 engines at once, we have the same initial mass, thrust, and obviously TWR. But all of the engines will burn for the whole duration of the flight, and all burn out at the same time. The total burn time will be much shorter, and half way through the flight we\u0027ll be lifting seven half-empty fuel tanks, as well as still lifting the mass of all seven engines. By the end of the flight, our TWR will be ridiculously high, because we\u0027re still using all 7 engines to lift a small fraction of the original mass, so we\u0027re paying (in fuel) to lift useless engine mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is why discarding empty fuel tanks as soon as you can is a good idea, and discarding engines as soon as they\u0027re no longer necessary. An imaginary \u0022ideal\u0022 rocket would lift only full tanks and only enough engine power to maintain a perfect TWR at 100% throttle (somewhere near 1.3 for main ascent) from second to second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus is a relatively simple way to approximate this behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T19:20:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks, it was a huge amount of fun just watching my shadow getting closer and closer.

The tank is for adjusting the weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses a Poodle engine for the high altitude and orbital stage and a quarter size 2.5m tank. One single skipper engine and an orange tank form the atmospheric stage. Three Thumper SRBs help with TWR on the pad, igniting together with the Skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Thumpers help reach 270m/s pretty fast. After decoupling them, the rocket has a TWR of little above 1. That way the rocket reaches a velocity just below the transsonic regime fast and then stays at that velocity until it passes 10km. TWR of the main staige is rising as ISP rises and the rocket gets lighter. at around 30km the poodle takes over, slowly pushing the rocket further into orbit. At this altitude can use all the efficient engines designed for vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got this into orbit with 600m/s of delta v left in FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that you do not need extremely high Thrust to weight ratios. 1.4-1.6 is enough!
