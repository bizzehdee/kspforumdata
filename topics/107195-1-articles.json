This issue has existed off and on for many months now, and most recently occurred today.\n\nOn various threads, particularly [***my thread about HyperEdit***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756), I find that occasionally the setting for notifications has somehow been changed from \u0022Instant\u0022 to \u0022None\u0022, so that I\u0027m no longer sent emails about new posts. I am able to set it back to \u0022Instant\u0022 and then it works for a while, but at some seemingly random point in time, it gets set back to \u0022None\u0022 without my input. I\u0027m certain that I\u0027ve never made such changes, so I\u0027m confused as to why it\u0027s happening.\n\nI\u0027ve reported this before in IRC - initially months ago - and was told it\u0027s being worked on, but it seems to be back again, or just very hard to kill. I\u0027ve started this thread to track the issue and see if anyone else is having the problem. I\u0027m somewhat familiar with the vBulletin software used here, and I cannot imagine why or how this is happening, so I wish you luck. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T14:54:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ezriilc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:15:34Z","Content":"So...

Last week, I didn\u0027t get some notifications of new posts to a thread, but it never did get reset to \u0022none\u0022 - rather, I got the email notices days later. I keep mine on \u0022instant by email\u0022 so that I can keep current on support issues and whatnot - this problem makes that very difficult.\n\nI was told that there were plans to switch forum software, and that that was why these problems are not being addressed. However, it\u0027s been so long now, that I\u0027m losing confidence that these issues are even on the radar. I feel like the forum is slowly going the way of the Space Port.\n\nIs there ANY hope of getting these problems corrected?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T15:14:09Z","Content":"Ezriilc there were some issues with subscription emails not going out after some forum maintenance last week, should be resolved now.

It will likely take me years and years to get there - but maybe some day...\n\nEDIT: I now remember seeing the \u0022none\u0022 reset issue more recently than my last post about it, but that was at least a month ago.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T15:23:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ezriilc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T16:34:28Z","Content":"This problem remains.

All I can think of is that sometimes I use the \u0022**Go Advanced**\u0022 option when posting to do more fancy stuff, and in that view there are some \u0022Subscription\u0022 options, but I\u0027ve never changed anything there and it\u0027s set properly by default, so...

It only happens sometimes and I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s any link between it and my using \u0022Go Advanded\u0022 - I just threw that in just in case.\n\nI could change emails, sure, but this would be the very first time in over 5 years that I\u0027ve ever had any issue with my provider. Besides, I can\u0027t see how the email address or system might be affecting my settings in this forum, unless the unsubscribe links are somehow being hit - certainly not by me.
