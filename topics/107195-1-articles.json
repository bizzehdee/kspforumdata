I am able to set it back to \u0022Instant\u0022 and then it works for a while, but at some seemingly random point in time, it gets set back to \u0022None\u0022 without my input. I\u0027m certain that I\u0027ve never made such changes, so I\u0027m confused as to why it\u0027s happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve reported this before in IRC - initially months ago - and was told it\u0027s being worked on, but it seems to be back again, or just very hard to kill. I\u0027ve started this thread to track the issue and see if anyone else is having the problem. I\u0027m somewhat familiar with the vBulletin software used here, and I cannot imagine why or how this is happening, so I wish you luck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T14:54:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ezriilc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo...
