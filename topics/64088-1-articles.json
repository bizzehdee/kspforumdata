Thanks in advance.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is with all the small parts between the top orange tank in the launcher core and the orange tank in payload. With a large number of joints close to each other, that part of the rocket is quite flexible, and even the struts can\u0027t hold it together. The connection between the docking ports is the worst, as it\u0027s not even supposed to be rigid. Replace the bottom docking port with a decoupler, and the rocket should hold together much better. Moving the RCS tank to the top should also improve things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general construction principle, use large parts at the bottom of the rocket, where the forces affecting the joints are strongest, and put small parts as high as possible. Engines should be connected to large fuel tanks, while smaller fuel tanks should be placed on the top of large fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour launcher is also a bit underpowered, with TWR barely above 1 at the start of each stage.

If you still want that much RCS available for your mission, replace it with four RCS Cylinders instead, that way you still have the same amount of Monoprop available but it won\u0027t have as much of a bearing on the structural stability or your stack. Or follow the excellent advice that you\u0027ve already received up to this point. You might also try throttling back as you get further into the atmosphere; definitely consider this if your gee meter is climbing out of the green zone, as structural failures have an increased risk of occurring once the gees get to be a bit much.
