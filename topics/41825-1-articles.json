I\u0027ve read a couple of written tutorials. I understand the concept of leveling the inclination planes, getting an encounter as close as possible, and just slowly creeping in. Whenever I try in real-time though, I always fail miserably. For instance, last time I managed to get within 100m of target with some assistance from MechJeb(yeah...). It was going okay, I was using RCS and translation keys to edge in with the assistance of LazorDocking. For some reason, even though my ship was aimed on the docking port, it was still wobbling around off course. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s just the physics of space or me being horrible. I eventually touch my target but I missed and everything just went bad. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to get the module back to the station and after an hour of attempting, I just gave up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering, am I just horribly bad at docking or is docking the most difficult thing to do in this game?
