I just searched and found nothing.\n\nAnyways, what if we could name kerbals? Perhaps not changing the last name (because removing \u0022Kerman\u0022 would just remove the feeling a little bit, wouldn\u0027t it)\n\nPerhaps at the Astronaut Complex, when we look at the list of available crew members, we can double click them and change their names? It would be fun to name everyone \u0022Jebidiah the Second, Third, Fourth and so on.\n\nSo what do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T16:13:43Z","Content":"You can actually rename them on EVA - but this can also change their career stuff, so caution is advised.\n\n(for whatever silly reason, Squad uses the name to determine career, instead of a dedicated \u0027career\u0027 field in the save)"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T18:21:01Z","Content":"So they have the same name when they re-enter the ship?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:02:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can actually rename them on EVA\n\nI don\u0027t recall being able to do when I played last.\n\nWhile I agree that career from name is silly, there\u0027s a little more to it than that. \n\nA kerbal\u0027s name appears in several parts of the persistent and quicksave files, so it would be necessary to make sure that every instance of a kerbal\u0027s name was changed to void errors which can happen when there are mistakes in the file.
