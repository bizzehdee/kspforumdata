Martian terraforming has not yet been completed either, The CO2 atmosphere has been thickened, With nitrogen added in,\u00A0Just enough for plants to survive, Martian citizens use a throat implant that filters the air, Allowing O2 through and disposing of the carbon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T01:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would imagine colonies on Enceladus to be located near the equator. This way, the cryovolcanoes are well out of harms way, but the scientists are still near them to do observations. The habitats on an Enceladus colony would be wide domes held onto the ice by multiple poles stuck deep into the moon\u0027s crust. Metal tiles would have to be put over the ice inside the habitats and buildings to prevent contamination of the ice by SCIENCE! or other \u0022threats\u0022. There will probably be more of these tiles making wide and long pathways around the colony site. Those tiles would be used to keep the vehicles and colonists firmly planted down on the moon, since their boots and wheels will have magnets inside them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SCIENCE! modules would have experiments relating to the chemicals in the ice or any life forms that have been captured. Habitat modules will have to be shared by up to 10 colonists at a time. Their beds will come with internal heaters to prevent hypothermia and external straps to keep the colonists from floating off. The straps will be less restricting than those on the ISS because there is actually gravity on Enceladus. The habitation modules will have many more heaters, along with a generator that takes ice from the moon\u0027s crust and turns it into liquid water, oxygen, and energy. Most of the living appliances, such as tables, storage units, ovens, and more will be located near here so that the generator can help power them. With things like couches, they will also be near the \u0022Habitat Hub\u0022 for warmth and easy access to food, water, and oxygen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 85% of the colony will be scientists and researchers, while the remaining 15% will be specially chosen people to have a human presence on Enceladus. Scientist or not, everyone will have to help keeping the colony alive. There will be 5 different jobs for colonists: hardware/habitat repair, supply managing, transmissions with Mission Control, resource \u0022hunting\u0022, and crew checks. The background and/or skills of the colonists will determine which jobs they will be assigned. For example, if a colonist had past experiences as a psychologist or doctor, then s/he will do crew checks to make sure the colonists are well enough to continue living on Enceladus. Each occupation will have a different schedule that will adjust to their other schedules, if they are scientists or researchers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLife on an Enceladan colony will have similar functions as colonies on other planets, but the structure of the colony will have to fit the conditions on this tiny moon. The types of occupations and research done here will also be different than on a world like Mars, Luna, or Ceres. A colony on Enceladus will be very similar to a Europan colony, with some slight modifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(Also, 555 posts!)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T04:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222649112\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466991796\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153551\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ProtoJeb21\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, ProtoJeb21 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA colony on Enceladus will be very similar to a Europan colony, with some slight modifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite major modifications actually.
