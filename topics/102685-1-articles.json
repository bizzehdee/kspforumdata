I clicked it by accident, the numbers looked great and I didn\u0027t realize what I was up to. So I sent in my first little ship, just to realize this asteroid was huge and I didn\u0027t bring enough power or fuel or anything to handle it. I didn\u0027t have any problems capturing it. It\u0027s fiddling with the manouver nodes, which is tricky, because there are a few bugs (I can\u0027t click more than 5 times on the \u0022do on the next orbit\u0022 button until it resets. So time warping and trying).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did I learn? When handling big stuff, bring heavy tools. The mission got me around 3 million credits and I spent 2 million for the ship. It uses 28 LV-Ns, weighs 718 tons and has over 12000 dV, which was a bit too much 10000 would\u0027ve done. With it\u0027s launcher the start weight was 5000t. I bet there are more efficent ways to get this beast up, but I haven\u0027t found them yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost important things: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPull, don\u0027t push.

Works much better.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBring enough RCS with you, put many RCS thrusters at the end (or at the top, depends on where you\u0027re pointing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) to stabilize, because if you don\u0027t hit the center of gravity very very precise it will wobble. And I never made a very precise grab. In fact I tried several times and I always slipped away. Unlocking the grabber so it can tilt didn\u0027t do the trick. Luckily I had plenty of RCS with me and let SAS do the rest.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt took me around an hour after grabbing the asteroid to get it out of the system.

Also consider \u0022control sections\u0022, little probes with a claw, reaction wheels, and maybe RCS that you dot about the asteroid.

In an ideal world you can ping-pong off Eve and Kerbin until you get your apoapsis out to Jool which will easily fling you into interstellar space. However with a large and heavy asteroid tug getting the precision for gravity assists may be hard. A single powered flyby of Kerbin will take around 1000 m/s of delta-V to get a Jool encounter, vs 1800 m/s for a direct boot out of the system, and may be more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T13:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mat2ch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mat2ch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost important things: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt took me around an hour after grabbing the asteroid to get it out of the system.
