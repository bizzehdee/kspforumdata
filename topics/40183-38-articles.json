You sort of tick the conditions that you wish to do (sort of like gambling - \u0022In this mission, I can do this, that, this and I\u0027ll do that!\u0022). I didn\u0027t mean someone should go straight to Duna on the first mission; but some of the missions on the plugin\u0027s list can be restrictive. They say, go to the Mun with THESE parts at THESE orbital specifications and come back and whatnot. What if I\u0027d prefer to just go to the Mun, land, pick up some science, get back and recover? I\u0027m looking for more flexibility and almost automation in the missions; in a sense almost procedural. This way you can have people do what they still want to do and lower the chance of grinding (and by grinding I simply mean doing even just a single mission you don\u0027t really want to do because you want to fund another mission that won\u0027t even be rewarded).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - was just an example. I didn\u0027t mean to go STRAIGHT to Duna. Let\u0027s also keep in mind that MC does have loan capabilities. With this sort of concept you CAN go straight to Duna if you wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut say you wanted to (somewhat early-midgame) go to Duna, but the only mission available is just to simply get to Duna? What if I wanted to land, a considerably more challenging aspect, pick up some science, go up, dock, return to Kerbin, recover? What if I want to stop by Minmus, or the Mun? This, as I said, can be fixed by writing your own mission, but then it\u0027s a whole lot of going back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo why not add an in-game contracts program like they would do in the future?

Since I know the game treats a rover as just another kind of vessel, and the rover bounces as it moves so it\u0027s not always \u0022Landed\u0022, it would be impossible to implement this by saying the rover must maintain \u0027landed\u0022 status the whole time. But I figure it could work like this: You create a mission goal block with the condition that AGL altitude (not sea-level altitude) may not rise above a very low height, like 100 meters, during the duration of the block. Then you also add the condition \u0022DistanceFromTouchdown\u0022 to the block, saying that you must get more than that many meters away from the point at which the first touchdown on the body happened. So a block that says, DistanceFromTouchdown is 10,000 and max AGLaltitude is 100 means you have to drive 10km from the point of the landing without rising about 100m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T17:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat exactly is wrong with the Boostrap mission pack?

New Contract System. The contract system gives you random missions. At this moment there is only 4 Base Missions, 3 Sat Deliveries and a repair mission. The base missions are just that. What makes the contracts different is that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeach contract is funded by a company. And every company has a different view on what it pays you. In the case of this release we are only worried about 2. Payments and Science. At this moment there is only 5 Companies. But each one is different and pays different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Repair Goal is completely rewritten. It now requires a resource called repair parts. You still need the RepairStation to actually be able to complete the missions. The basic jist of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. You launch satellites into orbit with repairStations and your choice of docking ports. (contract missions). Every once in awhile you get a contract to repair a vessel. You construct a repair vessel. Make sure it has docking ability. Get into space and capture the target vessel (dock, or whatever you use to grab and dock). You then need to transfer the repair parts from you Repair Canisters to the RepairStation Located on the Satellite. After transfer is complete (takes 1 repair part) you go EVA and get near the RepairStation and select Repair in the right click context menu. Mission Complete. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Yes mission controller at this time can and will find vessels with the repairStation on them. The sad news is that Im having issues getting this random part of the system working correct. So it only selects the First Vessel in the list (usually the last one you launched) I will fix this at a later date. But for now you don\u0027t really have to worry about what vessel you repair.. Its not tracked. (you still see the vessel listed in contract though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

For career players the contracts are meant for mid game use. When the system is complete it will infact be another research item for MCE research tree. But for now it is open. But you do need Unmanned ability to actually take advantage of contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Contracts payout a pretty good amount money. Eventually this will have a draw back. Because contracts come with Binding terms. If fail pay full price contract \u002B company %. (not yet implemented)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Lots of new regular missions added.

I reckon that some troubles are caused, e.g., when different mods use the same ID for one object (like a window or a button), but beyond avoiding the ID range used by Squad, you developers can\u0027t ensure that your choice is unique.
