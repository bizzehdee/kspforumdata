In 90% of games that have a pause time ability, space bar is the pause time button. So I have killed many many missions by trying to unpause the game by hitting space, only to realize I\u0027ve just cut my craft in half...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think this is a problem with the keys, space is and always has been the best button for staging, however, as a potential solution, I would request that stages not be triggered by the space bar while time is stopped? Players could still be allowed to click the stage button, but the space bar wouldn\u0027t trigger a stage. In this way it would be very difficult to accidently stage while paused, but the player could still easily do so by choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
