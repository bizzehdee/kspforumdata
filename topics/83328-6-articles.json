Mechjeb is one of those mods that is helpful to those who are mostly sure of what they are doing, but not fully. My rendevous attempts were aways inefficient (which is why I originally got Mechjeb) so I used mechjeb to learn how to do it properly. Now that I am proficient in all forms of Kerbal based technologies I can do better than mechjeb with landings (It never did understand the concept of slopes) and it could never handle aircraft in FAR. So I reverted to manual control and I am pleased that I did, I like the challenge of getting a blatantly unstable ship into space by wrestling the atmosphere with my RCS, mechjeb always overdid the compensation a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T20:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EForsooth, is this a knave I see before me?
