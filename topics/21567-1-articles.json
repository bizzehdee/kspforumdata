What you gotta do is to get down as straigth as possible. For Mun and Minmus, around 2000m, you should have the navball centered perfectly. If not, move your rocket and burn retrograde to slow you down and get your rocket centered. Then at this time, you burn so slow you down; depending on if you still have a stage to spend or your lander stage, burn before to slow down.\u003Cp\u003EAt around 1000 meters, slow down under 50m/s, and keep the gas very low. If you still have a rocket stage, jettison it and watch the distance it\u0027ll explode, in case you\u0027re over a large mountain or something high. I can\u0027t remember if the altimeter count from ground distance or sea level, so especially on Mun, watch the terrain carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, slow down by either keeping your engine on the lowest burn possible (the ideal would be to get a speed of 5 to 9m/S and keep it stable) or doing little blasts of gas, whatever you fel more comfotable with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have RCS gas, turn it on and turn on your ASAS system as well.
