Provided of course that I set my render quality to fastest and disable vsync and anti-aliasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblematically, you don\u0027t get any craft shadows at all unless you set the render quality to at least simple, and setting the quality to above fast sends me to about 15 to 20fps\u00A0 in atmosphere with a ~50 part craft.\u00A0 But as far as I can tell, simple and fastest look essentially the same apart from the craft shadows, which leads me to assume the big performance penalty comes from rendering the shadow\u0027s shape as a function of the craft\u0027s shape and attitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a programmer, so I\u0027m here to ask: Is this correct? Because if it is, it seems as though making the shadow a much less detailed shape\u00A0 would save a lot of fps. What if instead of generating the shadow shape\u00A0 on the fly, a mod simply generated elliptic shadows based on solely the craft\u0027s size and aspect ratio in whatever initial attitude\u00A0 it is in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u00A0 Most landers are essentially circular anyway, so not much is lost in those cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very curious if this is a plausible workaround to the performance intensive stock shadows because craft shadows are not just an aesthetics concern. Without shadows, it is very hard to accurately gauge your altitude while landing, so it\u0027s very unfortunate they aren\u0027t very usable on lower end systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-12T16:57:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2023 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by cosekantphi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
