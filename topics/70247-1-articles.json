I\u0027m enjoying the serious challenges of space missions and loving the insanity of creating truly ridiculous rockets! I\u0027ve already landed on the mun leading to me being sufficiently distracted to not notice that Jebidiah\u0027s ship was skipping the atmosphere and about to come down, leading to a last minute rescue mission at 60000m requiring an EVA to rescue him in the dark \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now trying to get a 25 minute burn to Jool to work...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T16:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi and welcome among us.

I can\u0027t really remember. I know I was struggling to get a rocket into orbit back then (probably my own incompentence, but maybe the controls were more difficult, I dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, after deciding it would likely be worth the money from all the good reviews around the internets, I bought the game. I just started on the career mode this week and good god I\u0027m having a blast (pun intended).Took me 3 tries to get a ship into orbit, but I managed to get a fair amount of science done around Kerbal during those 3 attempts. My fifth ship was a sputnik probe which I sent in orbit around the moon, and after that I sent a Kerbal and my science skyrocketed from the EVAs. I can\u0027t wait to continue in my attempts to achieve some of the results I\u0027ve seen on these forums. Next up I will try to land on the moon and send some probes to other planets, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood grief, this game is just too awesome. Must play more!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T23:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T23:22:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m so glad that the comic inspired you to pick back up on KSP, play and join us all here in the community.
