I really need to have a robust mission planner.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Second is a bit more personal but tied to the first, in that if KSPTOT can\u0027t include decay, my [Flight Tracker](http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Tracker/craft.asp?db=meeny) can\u0027t handle it either since it\u0027s based of KSPTOT orbital calculations and therefore the assumption that there is no decay in KSP\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The mod is doing a great job now of modeling decay, and Whitecat106 wants to make it even more realistic with n-body perturbation, so I highly doubt he\u0027d want to go backwards as well and work out a very simple and mainly static model that approximates decay. But hey, never hurts to ask.\n\u003E \n\nHello there,\n\nThose are some really interesting points that you raise, I will open up an issue in github and have a look at KSPTOT and see what I think. I could possibly make a branch release with a reduced version of orbital decay that would act as an extension to KSPTOT, simply altering some numerical values before KSP sets these into vessel orbits. Working backwards at the moment seems to be a good idea, especially since I want to rebuild the code for the next version of orbital decay anyway; I\u0027m sure I could look into this! Up to this point I had not realized this incompatibility! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n[@sidfu](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/70409-sidfu/), thanks for this! Since 1.2 new vessel types have been added so I will have to add a check for these in the UI. Added to the Github as[#87](https://github.com/Whitecat106/OrbitalDecay/issues/87).\n\nAs for a note on progress, I have been thinking a lot and a rebuild of the code is in order for 1.6.0:\n\n- starting by trying to remove as many clunky \u0027foreach\u0027 loops as I can, generally try and reduce system strain, especially with large games.\n\n- I shall then work checking Mascon functions are working and accurate - this will include making Mascon maps for each planet in the stock and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems - Maybe a scansat add on displaying such maps would be cool? Any ideas?\n\n- I will then fix and finalize some of the features I had planned for 1.6.0, including fixing the SCS plugin issues (resetting solar cycles randomly), fixing the in development \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E menu, better vessel sorting (by name, active, search).\n\n- If possible I will try and produce some compatibility with persistent rotation, (basically background Yarkovsky effect) - It would be nice to have to make sure you rotated in an axis perpendicular to a heat source to minimize decay!\n\nIn the mean time, for 1.5.3 I would like to address any issues with the dropbox version I uploaded on Saturday, so please do let me know if everything is going good/bad and what I need to tweak! Of course time is still an issue, so any code submissions/pull requests would be greatly appreciated especially in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E editor utilities menu area.\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-06T22:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2017 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Whitecat106**"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T01:30:15Z","Content":"encounttred a bug but couldnt pinpoint the cause. when i clicked the enabled station keeping on a ship manulay(in the right click menu) that was around 320km above kerbin everything disappeared and i was taking to exactly 0 heigt and the world textures where gone even on the space center(building still there thou). there was no error thou( i have critical error like that set to show on screen). funny thing is even going back to title the world textures where gone. havent booted up again to see if does again or if was random kracken hit.\n\nupdate.\n\nok the black planet and 0alt seems to happen if u enabled sation keeping while on a suborbital path. doesnt seem to do it every time thou. probaly a check to prevent station keeping enable till they in alt greather than 1 to prevent.\n\nyeah right now cant enable station keeping on some except when u select them as the lists need update to include all the stock game categories\n\non update why not make the llist by planet dropdown then slit into types. would be much more neater.\n\nfor example\n\nkerbin\n\n        sat relay\n\n              sat 1\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-07T03:31:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2017 03:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by sidfu**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T03:52:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Whitecat106 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Those are some really interesting points that you raise, I will open up an issue in github and have a look at KSPTOT and see what I think.

First off, I want to make sure I\u0027m looking at the right code, that is being used by the KSP 1.2.2 version that was shared via DropBox. Is this it?  \n[https://github.com/Whitecat106/OrbitalDecay/blob/master/Source/DecayManager.cs#L665](https://github.com/Whitecat106/OrbitalDecay/blob/master/Source/DecayManager.cs#L665)\n\nI found that a craft with an orbit of 190 km by 10760 km was not decaying at all. I believe that is because the SMA of this orbit is 11845 km, which is greater than the \u0027MaxInfluence\u0027 for Earth of 6371 km \\* 1.5 = 9557 km. So, I bumped the orbit to 171.5 km by 5984 km so that the SMA was below 9557 km, and the eccentricity here is 0.308 for reference. This gave me an \u0027Equivalent Altitude of 615 km (calculated by the equation for Eccentricity \u003E 0.085). The thing I currently find the most disturbing is that eccentricity appears to stay constant, which will be particularly untrue for eccentric orbits.\n\nAnyway, most of this is to make sure I\u0027m on the right page. In checking my basic mental logic, I saw this page: [http://www.lizard-tail.com/isana/lab/orbital_decay/](http://www.lizard-tail.com/isana/lab/orbital_decay/) which links to a paper that uses similar equations to yours, and also notes at the end that (for eccentric orbits) \u0022The apogee height is decreased whilst the perigee height is little affected until the orbit becomes close to circular.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T16:01:01Z","Content":"Hey,\n\nFirst, I want to add my thanks to everyone else\u0027s.

I\u0027d think I could last a decent while up here with such a little ship, but the estimated time until decay is only 16 days!  My decay rate is more than 900  m/day.\n\nIs this realistic?
