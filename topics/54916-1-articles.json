I\u0027m not talking about measuring Delta-v, weight and what not while building your vessel. There\u0027s the engineer mod for things like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m talking about, is adding more variation to real time construction and how it relates to you. For example, adding the option to get relative digit values for information like center of weight, lift, and thrust respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could end up being invaluable to more specific construction, where keeping things in line go beyond counter balance and node usage in typical construction. What if you want to build a balanced VTOL spaceplane? Wouldn\u0027t you want to know where the center of weight is specifically to match it? Even better, wouldn\u0027t you like to know the miniscule difference in position your current held object is from these points?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be hard, I could even see a button that lines your held object respectively to one of the nodes being fairly simple to install into the game, and how amazing would that be for RCS construction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the little things that can make kerbal construction less of a guessing game for all of us (including us with lower level hardware, so nodes always appear blurry and inaccurate currently) and more of a space program that could respect a real program\u0027s precision of constructing that flying tea kettle around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
