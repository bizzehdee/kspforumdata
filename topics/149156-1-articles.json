The Kopernicus part works out nicely, and the planet\u00A0shows up in-game with the right texture. however i cant seem to get the kittopia part to work. My planet\u0027s terrain is spiky, and does not follow the texture. i have defined the heightmap in the kittopia config and reduced the bumpyness, but it does not work. I have searched everywhere and tried\u00A0everything I could think of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is as if it does not apply the kittopia config.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKittopia and my planet works in-game except that the surface is spiky. there is almost no documentation on the in-game kittopia UI, so i couldn\u0027t save the settings properly to my planet. I don\u0027t know if in-game kittopia is the way to though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
