Audio sounds almost like a split second of the rocket engine firing sound. Happens throughout the game, when landed, when in flight, on EVA. Less when timewarping but still present. Doesn\u0027t occur during loading screens, on map view, at the KSC screen or in the VAB. Redownloaded KSP and the issue persists. Occurs on both saves, career and sandbox. Tends to occur slightly less frequently when engine is firing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput Log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/aj7c1syrdhkohte/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/aj7c1syrdhkohte/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7 x64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel i5 2410M 2.3GHz Quad Core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENvidia GT525M 1GB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealtek ALC269 Sound Card\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
