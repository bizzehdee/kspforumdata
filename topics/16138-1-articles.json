The Reaper series is a collection of 1 \u0026amp; 2 stage orbiter/lander craft. Take one good look at the Mk1 prototype and guess how it derived its name. It comes in two basic functionality; return and non-return landers. All are basically the same but with slight differences. The pack contains primarily just the landers themselves; you will have to install your own first stage rocket items to reach orbit or anywhere else you want to go, however there is one lander with a fully functional first stage setup that will get you into orbit, escape velocity, etc. Tweak around with it as much as you like. It\u0027s really nothing too special, but I like it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: The extra amount of braces actually seem to make for a very stable flight during liftoff. I think it has to do with the drag physics. There certainly doesn\u0027t seem to be any detrimental effects to having soo many braces (especially since once you\u0027re out of the atmosphere drag means nothing). plus you could definitely put some heavy loads on them no problem, and they can take catastrophic spinning gforces like no other when the load is heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-05T21:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2012 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPwner","CreatedById":23671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T20:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re a subforum too high \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you really like struts, don\u0027t you?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft looks cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T20:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWrong forum section, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trekkie_","CreatedById":36130,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T20:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy bad yeah \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I do tend to overshoot hehe.
