In that sense, we\u0027re already a fandom, though a small and weak one... a \u0022proto-fandom\u0022 as you say.

While the majority of those fandoms\u0027 populations are happy enough watching the episodes at home and maybe commenting on forums every once in a while, there are a few people who take every possible opportunity to mash their beliefs in peoples\u0027 faces. These people are the ones that are most known in the fandom, for obvious reasons, and they generate a lot of bad press. I don\u0027t want KSP going in that direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T22:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022super\u0022 data-cite=\u0022super\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebornies or ferrys?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this intentionally written like this or are those new groups I was unaware of?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic, I doubt a fandom can be created.
