Due to the new tweaks to landing gear in KSP 0.22, any pre-existing ships in an older save, when loaded in 0.22 for the first time, will randomly have their gear raised!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means, when you select a ship landed on another planet in an older save for the first time, there is a HUGE chance, it will just fall over on game load as you don\u0027t have time to lower the legs or any quick way to keep your ship upright...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if there\u0027s a way anybody can tell me to edit my persistence file to return the landing legs on my ships to the lowered position before I load them in 0.22 for the first time...? Is there a simple attribute I can adjust, like \u0022lowered=true\u0022 or some such...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T22:35:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by darkstrike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
