Relativistic antimatter weapons are a waste (this includes antiparticle beams). TBH, so are most relativistic weapons. The energy requirements to accelerate a massive object to 0.99c is \u003Cem\u003Egigantic\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Forget having a ship fire it, if you want a relativistic weapons, you\u0027re building a \u003Cstrong\u003Efully functional sublight starship\u003C/strong\u003E and throwing it at the enemy. Dodging is impossible (unless the target is \u003Cem\u003Ealways \u003C/em\u003Edodging, which is a valid tactic), but so is aiming, and acceleration takes so long you\u0027ll be firing from an adjacent star system. Oh, and you better have a very good guidance algorithm, because making meaningful course corrections at 0.99c is \u003Cstrong\u003Ehard\u003C/strong\u003E. Given this, the only thing such a weapon has a chance of hitting is a planet. It could possibly work as a planet killer, but by the point you can afford that kind of thing, your civilization hits Kardashev Type 2, and in this case, there are two possible scenarios: you\u0027re fighting a non-Type 2\u00A0enemy, in which case they\u0027re screwed anyway and there are better ways of dealing with them (unless you want to make a point), or you\u0027re fighting another Type 2 or 3\u00A0civ, which can preemptively\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emove planets\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto account for this threat, if they think you might shoot a relativistic weapon at them.
