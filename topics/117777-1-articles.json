I have made the skeleton out of structural girders and am currently making the skin out of lifting surfaces. The carrier is supposed to be used in battle, so should I put some structural plates on top of the hull? Also, will this construction support the planes that will land there? Do I need docking ports or will the planes be fixed enough if engaging brakes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you will need this mod \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094-1-0-4-Better-Buoyancy-v1-4-Simple-Water-Fixes-7-29-15\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094-1-0-4-Better-Buoyancy-v1-4-Simple-Water-Fixes-7-29-15\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t help more, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:16:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t really much experience in that domain, but from what I know things behave quite badly when put in water in stock KSP.
