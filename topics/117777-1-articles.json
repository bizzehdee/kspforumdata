I have made the skeleton out of structural girders and am currently making the skin out of lifting surfaces. The carrier is supposed to be used in battle, so should I put some structural plates on top of the hull? Also, will this construction support the planes that will land there? Do I need docking ports or will the planes be fixed enough if engaging brakes?"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:10:28Z","Content":"I think you will need this mod \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094-1-0-4-Better-Buoyancy-v1-4-Simple-Water-Fixes-7-29-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094-1-0-4-Better-Buoyancy-v1-4-Simple-Water-Fixes-7-29-15)\n\nI can\u0027t help more, sorry."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:16:09Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t really much experience in that domain, but from what I know things behave quite badly when put in water in stock KSP. If you want to build something as large as an aircraft career, I\u0027d suggest installing a few mods made for the purpose (ship parts, water physics...)."},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:29:48Z","Content":"I confirm that I have successfully completed the building of the carrier.
