So the fact that the suit and the kerbal heads can never be changed (at least not as easily as adding in new\u00A0textures) is kindof a bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also certain that it wouldn\u0027t be too drastic a change to make it possible for the game to use a different model, and make the bone and joint system of the kerbals available to modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Choctofliatrio2.0","CreatedById":154657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-12T17:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm...
