I have made a small Lander Engine that explodes on the pad every time. I have checked the collider and It\\\u0027s dead on. I have even changed it around some but nothing works. All my other engines are fine but, this one goes boom every time. It\\\u0027s strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have included the blend file with it.
