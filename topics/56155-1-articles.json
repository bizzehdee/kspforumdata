I am getting pretty decent at getting my rockets in to orbit. I can more or less hit the orbit I want every time now, with my light and heavy launch vehicles, My ascent profile is pretty straightforward:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch, burn out first stage boosters and liquid engines, stage them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Around 8km to 10km, depending on payload, pitch over to 45 degree gravity turn on launch azimuth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Hold that attitude until second stage burnout, then move to track prograde marker as soon as Navball switches to orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Follow prograde burn until apoapsis is just about 1-2km above target and kill engines, if that stage isn\u0027t enough for insertion burn (almost always the case), ditch it while it\u0027s still suborbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Wait until coast brings me high enough that apoapsis stops dropping, usually settles right on my target, jump to map view and plan a maneuver node for my final orbit (circular, intercept phasing, etc, whatever the mission needs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Coast to apoapsis and fire insertion burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, on recent launches I\u0027ve been experimenting with modulating the throttle to keep atmospheric efficiency (as measured by Kerbal Engineer) near 100%, until I\u0027m high enough that I saturate at full thrust then I stop fiddling with it. It doesn\u0027t seem to be helping my dV budget that much, though it does make early launch a bit less tedious \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is working pretty well, but it makes me wonder, is the coast really necessary? Do real spacecraft do that? I was always under the impression that most craft burned solid from launch to parking orbit. I realize many craft will restart the engines later \u003Cem\u003Efrom their parking orbit\u003C/em\u003E for target orbits, and other operations, but is there usually a coast between liftoff and parking? If not, why is it that way in KSP? Is it just easier?

But you aptly note that most rocket motors can be throttled, for good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as coasting to Apoapsis being most efficient? Absolutely, yes. Simply put, in orbital mechanics - the most efficient way to affect your Periapsis is to do so at your Apoapsis and vice versa. This really has to do with conservation of energy, actually - Given a starting vector that passes close to a point, the further you are from that point, the less energy it takes to affect your course relative to that point. This is why people will do mid-course corrections for an encounter when they are reasonably far away, often times having not yet reached the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, changing your Periapsis is best done at the most distance you can - which happens to be the Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, the most efficient flight profiles tend to be ones where the circularization burn and ascent burn appear to be a single long burn - but the Dv savings you get from doing so might not be noticeable in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI promised a video - this one is about Ascent Profiles, and why certain maneuvers are done at certain places...

In many cases it may be more efficient than a direct injection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, from about 40km up, terminal velocity is well-above orbital velocity. The gist of this is that it is possible to insert into a 40x\u0026lt;apoapsis\u0026gt; orbit from here without massive drag losses at periapsis. Let us assume for a moment that the drag losses are actually nonexistent at this point. Then the most efficient way to get into a higher orbit is via a Hohmann transfer. This means that you should pick up as much speed at your current 40km orbit as desired to get to your target altitude (plus a little spare to deal with the small drag losses). Then, at apoapsis you should circularize. Of course, this is half an orbit later because you just left periapsis. This is a \u0027coast phase\u0027 and is part of the most efficient way to get from 40km into stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, it is reasonable and efficient to use a coast phase to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T22:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor everyone of my launches I burn until almost circular.
