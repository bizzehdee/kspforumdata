Like Mach 2.5 on ground level and only melting at Mach 3. FAR will stay the was to go for realistic aerodynamics, and the new devbuild is apparently very promising.\n\nThat said, i\u0027m looking forward to the new stock aero. Especially the new chase cam looked sooooooo fun. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI didn\u0027t see the overlay yet.
