My plane does great for somethings but fails horribly at other things. Ever time I try move my small refuel truck over it ends up exploding inside of the craft. I would build a helo or vtol to carry some of my larger things but I cant make one that gets off the ground more less carry a 30 tanker. I have tried using cargo nets, docking via KAS, a docking port, a big docking port and all is does is fall apart. I had an easier time moving an orange tank in this than a little truck lmao\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T17:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrafts won\u0027t collide with themselves. Docking ports aren\u0027t what you want unless you use a bunch of quantum struts. Separate ships will collide so use KAS winches and cargo nets. You will probably need anywhere from 3 to 8 winches. Use the removable plugs and mount them on teh truck EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fcdrifter13","CreatedById":79366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T18:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have three on it right now, undocked just tring to keep it from shifting, as soon as I hit 100 or so mps it just all goes wrong. Although I did make a pretty need dropship for bombs and such and was going to use it as a module trandport but I dont know of a way to delay chutes from opening after they are seperated from the plane but that is for another time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
