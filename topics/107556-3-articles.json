They will try to cheat us out of stuff as long as they can, but once we put up resistant they will just go elsewhere for resources. Finding resources in space is easy, it is just collecting them and make use of them is the problem. As they can simply go to those resources location and live there without much problems instead of having to haul those things back to earth like us, they have it much easier than us. So why fight when you risk having your units destroyed, instead of just grabbing resources else where? \n\nAnd again, time is in their advantage.

Taking short cut, getting the most work for the least amount of energy expended, etc, allow it to spend remaining energy on more things, thus more future freedom of action. In a way, you could say it will try to stay alive as long as possible with the least energy expended as possible, as that means it gets the most freedom of action out of its energy expenditure. Which also means it will always try to maximizing its energy profit - will spending the energy to do this will give it more energy than what is spent? How can it maximize the energy it get back?\n\nThis is why an intelligence will try to take the path of least resistance to its objective, so that it doesn\u0027t spend any more than it have to. Most of the time, it will likely try to cooperate if possible with other intelligences, since that ensure long term return of its energy expenditure - it can get more things done by off load its work to other intelligences without spending more energy of its own. It is only when it find itself having severely limited choice that it would result in confrontation and fight over limited resources to ensure its own survival. Going back to the robots, as they are in no way as limited as human in their resource gathering capability - they can simply settle down on the moon or Mars and start mining, or any other body with resources - they are not that limited in option that would make them try to fight us in our humid planet riddled with all kind of life forms and competitions and humans that can shoot back.\n\nBut of course, this is assuming we are able to create a perfect logical intelligence, and that is very unlikely.
