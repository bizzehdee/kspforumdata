The Spacecraft started to wiggle. \u0022FIRE THE SRBs!\u0022 Jeb yelled. \u0022Did we hit it?\u0022 Bob asked. \u0022Well, we hit Minmus.\u0022 Bill answered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship started to tumble more and more in the ensuing kraken attack, as it raced around Kerbol, the kraken\u0027s swaying getting more and more pronounced.All of a sudden the Kraken really hit them. The lander stage was blown off at 20 light years per hour. \u0022Damn it, Jeb, you just HAD to go and attack the kraken, you just HAD TO BREAK PHYSICS, DIDN\u0027T YOU?!\u0022 Bill yelled. it wasn\u0027t very long until they exited the system. The Kraken forcibly crashed into Bop causing it to fall into orbit around Jool. \u0022Well, we\u0027re not coming back any time soon, are we?\u0022 Bob said. \u0022We might as well just hit timewarp and see what happens.\u0022 Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might have been months. It might have been years. Hell, it may have even been billions of years. But Jeb, Bill, and Bob came across something on their voyage. They hadn\u0027t any idea what it was, but it slowed them down to a manageable speed. All they did know was that is was big and black, and appeared perfectly flat. A few days later, it seemed, at least, due to timewarp, the ship seemed to be wobbling and unexplicitly accelerating. They were entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere! Jeb looked out of the window, and saw the heatsheild heat up. \u0022How\u0027d we get back home?\u0022 Bob asked. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/t348e24vDyA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.\u0022 Bill said in astonishment. After they landed, Jeb got out of the capsule. He took off his helmet, smelled the air, and took a deap breath. \u0022Wait. This doesn\u0027t smell like Kerbin! He looked at the grass, and saw some flowers. \u0022Those don\u0027t look like any flowers I\u0027ve ever seen.\u0022 Bill looked. \u0022This... Isn\u0027t Kerbin, is it?\u0022 Bob asked. \u0022No, we\u0027re not ion Kerbin anymore.\u0022\u003Cp\u003EAfter deploying the use of survival training, the crew had created a relativley good shelter. They lived there for a few days, in the mountainous region on this unexplored, extrakerbestrial body. They had sent a few expeditions, but the lower amount of oxygen meant they couldn\u0027t go out past about 4 or so kilometers or so. But using equipment on their spacecraft, they did manage to find a good source of parts, with which they could use to create rockets with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne day, as Jeb was scouting out the terrain, he saw something he never noticed before. It seemed to be an old town of some sort, a settlement near the water. He got Bill and Bob to come see it. As the years went on they never interfered with the settlement, not wanting to contaminate this alien world with their own ideas, or maybe even get killed by angry and confused inhabitants. they decided to get home again. They figured that the Kerbonium command pod should summon this star system\u0027s Kraken, and Bob had manufactured a Krakenlure device to specify the proper direction of the interstellar transfer. They built a launch tower out of a tree, and launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnbeknownst to them, the people of the settlement saw the large tree near the peak of the mountain. Everyone watched it, especially when fire came out of it. \u0022\u00C3\u00A5\u00C2\u00AE\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00A7\u00C5\u201C\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u00C3\u00A8\u00C2\u00B5\u00C2\u00B7\u00C3\u00A4\u00C2\u00BE\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u00C3\u00A5\u00C6\u2019\u00C2\u00C3\u00A6\u00C5\u00B8\u00C2\u00C3\u00A7\u00C2\u00A8\u00C2\u00AE...\u00C3\u00A7\u00C2\u00C2\u00AB\u00C3\u00A7\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u00A7\u00C2\u00AE\u00C2\u00AD\u0022 That idea of a fire arrow was brilliant. One person in the settlment was inspired by the design. He eventually realized the capabilities of the fire arrow as a weapon. centuries later, the very same species launched another tiny moon into orbit oround their own planet. This was called Sputnik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a few artifacts of Humankind\u0027s first contact with Kerbals.
