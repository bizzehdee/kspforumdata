The way I imagine them working is when you are opposite the sunlight is coming at you the chutes will open and slow you down in a non atmospher, so you can slow down on the mun and not have to use fuel to land, plus it\u0027d be useful for getting into orbit.

It would be kind of neat to have them introduced to KSP at some point. I think it would be difficult to model them realistically, since the biggest ships in KSP are typically on the order of maybe 50-70m. However, that doesn\u0027t mean KSP can\u0027t cheap have something like a 100m diameter unfurled solar sail and just ramp up the thrust by a factor of 10 or something. KSP has some realism, but not a boat ton (I am looking at you Ion engine). So maybe it provides 1/10th of the thrust of an ion engine, at the same weight, but unlimited fuel, but can only thrust away from Kerbol up to perpendicular to kerbol, with reducing thrust the more you are angled toward perpendicular (this is already modeled with solar cells. As the point closer to perpendicular their power production drops towards zero).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a cool future addition to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T14:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if you did implement this with enough thrust to even slightly influence a descent.
