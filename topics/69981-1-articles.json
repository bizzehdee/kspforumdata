This is understandably something to reduce lag, but it is also a major problem for the current project I am working on. I am attempting to air-drop kerbals in seats out a moving plane and then having them parachute down safely. However, I would have to circle around the area where i dropped them in a turning circle with a radius of under 5 km in order for the seats to stay parachuting without despawning, a feat which my unwieldy delivery plane is incapable of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could of sworn that Romfarer\u0027s excellent Lazor mod fixed this problem for me in the past, but it seems I was mistaken, as the problem persists even with the mod. Does anyone know of any mods that extend this distance, or remove it entirely?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DArkB0mb3rz22","CreatedById":14737,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T22:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know what? I probably should of read the thread, literally the third one down, that was asking the exact same question. I will be using TT NeverUnload, as that seems it will fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
