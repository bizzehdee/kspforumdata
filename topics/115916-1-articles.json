The numbers are assigned to the seat positions in the flight deck, not ranking.\n\nOriginally, NASA astronauts were all top-level test pilots with huge egos, so when it came to giving callsigns to the seats on Gemini, they refused to have a \u0022pilot\u0022 and \u0022co-pilot\u0022 position, because the term \u0022co-pilot\u0022 is typically used for rookie pilots. So NASA had to go with the Commander (CDR) and Pilot (PLT) callsigns. \n\nWhen Apollo arrived, they needed a new callsign for the third crew member, who had to be a pilot. NASA wanted to use Commander, Senior Pilot, and Pilot. Again, the Astronaut refused, which is why they used Commander (CDR), CM Pilot (CMP), and LM Pilot (LMP), even though many of the Apollo missions didn\u0027t carry a LM.\n\nOn Skylab, the LM Pilot callsign was replaced by the term Science Pilot (SPT). And on ASTP, the third astronaut was Docking Module Pilot (DMP) although there was no \u0022piloting\u0022 involved in the docking module.\n\nWith the STS program, NASA kept the the Commander (CDR) and Pilot (PLT) call signs, but because you couldn\u0027t reasonably have 6 or 7 \u0022pilots\u0022, all the other crew members became either Mission Specialists (MS1-5) or Payload Specialists (PS1-2). Mission specialists were typically NASA astronauts, whereas Payload Specialists were non-NASA crew members (civilians, foreign nationals, scientists, industry employees, etc...). The Payload Specialist position was eliminated after Columbia.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T19:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"}]}
