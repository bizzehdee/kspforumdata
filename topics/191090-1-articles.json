I\u0027ve made more progress in the past three days than I did in the entire duration of time I spent working on this modpack previously due to the extent to which these two mods have allowed me to accelerate the process of adding nodes and parts to the tech tree. I\u0027m currently working on configuring a custom Kerbalism profile.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EOverview\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the name implies, the purpose of this\u00A0project is to overhaul the game\u0027s progression. I am aiming to create a coherent modpack with sensible progression, and a level of difficulty somewhere in between the stock game and Realism Overhaul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially what inspired me to do this was the fact that, when playing with large collections of mods, the tech tree quickly ceases to make sense (and even with some good tech tree overhauls like CTT, unsupported mods can easily shift progression away from the realm of logic). This would\u0027ve end up being just another tech tree rework (and the first stage of development will be just that), but I want to make a few more changes beyond the scope of yet another tech tree mod, and this number of planned changes has increased to include a few major overhauls. Additionally, there are often empty nodes in the tree when using any mod that expands its structure, and I\u0027d like to avoid that issue while leaving my tech tree intact - the obvious way of doing this is by making some mods \u003Cem\u003Erequired\u003C/em\u003E, hence the need to make a modpack. I\u0027d also like to balance this to be well-suited for use with the JNSQ planet pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tech tree as it currently stands in version 0.2.1 is balanced around Bluedog Design Bureau as a core mod. Almost everything in BDB is fully integrated into the tech tree, though as of writing this (2022/11/28) it\u0027s not yet playtestable in a career game. The focus on US technology is simply because it is by far the most comprehensive option available in mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, while any planet pack can \u003Cem\u003Ehypothetically\u003C/em\u003E be used, everything is \u003Cem\u003Etested\u003C/em\u003E using JNSQ. All historical parts will be (once I finish the Kerbalism config) balanced so that they can accomplish the closest JNSQ equivalent to their historical purpose - no more having to clip life support containers into the Apollo capsule just to do a Mun mission. All parts based on concepts (like Constellation, or the fictional Eyes Turned Skyward) will be similarly balanced according to their conceptual purpose, and whatever remains will be balanced so that it fits in as well as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ERoadmap\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCustom Kerbalism science \u003Cstrong\u003E(current stage)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nComplete balance patches for current core mods (BDB, CNAR, modified Taerobee)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTech node cost allocation\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPart failure mod integration (which part failure mod to use is currently undecided)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShuttle-era to modern era tech tree expansion \u0026amp; balance patches\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProper aircraft balance\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nContract overhaul\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear-future and beyond tech tree expansion \u0026amp; balance patches\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDifficulty enhancements (engine throttle \u0026amp; ignition limitations, reaction wheel nerf, possibly other things)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdditional mod support beyond core requirements\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTech node icons \u0026amp; descriptions (I\u0027m not sure when this will be done, but it is currently low priority)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E for maintaining many of the vital mods which make things like this practical\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/211485-610yesnolovely/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022211485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/211485-610yesnolovely/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@610yesnolovely\u003C/a\u003E for allowing me to use (a modified version of) their CNAR-Taerobee configs\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-28T13:16:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2022 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by septemberWaves\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eslight roadmap change\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redleg1","CreatedById":156723,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-19T20:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, this sounds really similar to ideas I have been kicking around in my head forever but just don\u0027t have the time to really knuckle down and figure out.\u00A0 I have a feeling that there are a lot of people that would enjoy a techtree/contract pack mod that are specifically tailored to both BDB and NF mods and of course JNSQ.

The reason for the uncertainty is that the complexity of the tech tree increases at later tiers (because there are more different kinds of technology available), but I am unsure to what extent the complexity will increase further as planning and development goes on. Additionally, I have done next to no planning of the aviation section of the tech tree (aside from some aerodynamics-related nodes that are important for rocket-building), as I have much less experience with planes than with rockets and will need to do a lot more testing before I feel confidently able to balance aircraft parts properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the tech tree, most of the main mods planned for inclusion are decided upon, and my current playtesting, as mentioned in my previous post in this thread, is being done for the purpose of solidifying the play style I would like to balance the modpack around, and finding the changes that need to be made via Module Manager to suit that play style. I have a good overall understanding of my direction for this project; the playtesting is for finding specifics. Both playtesting and modpack development are currently on KSP version 1.9.1; updating to 1.10 (and any future versions) will only be done once all necessary mods (most importantly, JNSQ) are updated (or at the very least are \u003Cem\u003Efunctional\u003C/em\u003E) on the game version in question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the topic of the playtesting: should I continue to make stream announcements here (because it is playtesting for the modpack and an opportunity to discuss plans, progress, and ideas), or should I make a separate thread in Mission Reports (because playtesting \u003Cem\u003Ecurrently\u003C/em\u003E consists of gameplay without my custom tech tree and other changes, since they are incomplete)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA final note: the reason there have been no updates from January until now is not because it has taken me all this time to make this amount of progress; it is because I became somewhat burned out with regards to the game and this project. That issue seems to be resolved as of right now (and I am hopeful that a side effect of playtesting will be maintaining my ability to focus on the game and enjoy it), but my ability to focus on any particular task for very long is inconsistent so I can make no predictions as to a timeline for my development of this modpack. What \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E be expected is that development will progress reasonably fast when I am able to focus on it, but I have no way of knowing exactly how consistent that ability to focus will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-11T14:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NkkUIOr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NkkUIOr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tech tree as it currently stands looks like this. Much of the general structure of the branches is likely to remain consistent to where it is right now. Likely subject to the most changes will be the science branch (since I am not fully satisfied with the solution of putting all science parts in a single branch of the tech tree, but I have yet to decide upon an alternative that I prefer), and the aircraft branches (since I am not yet confident in my abilities to properly balance aircraft parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany nodes that are parallel in this version of the tech tree will likely not be parallel in the final version. The current state of the tech tree layout is designed to allow me to determine which technological developments should follow from other technological developments, but in a later version (when all nodes are in place and I have a clearer understanding of science costs) I will spread out nodes in the horizontal direction to better reflect somewhat-realistic development timelines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn additional major change to the tech tree structure that can be expected in future is the amount of vertical connection between branches. Currently there is very limited vertical connection except for at the start of each tech tree branch, but later there will be more connections as similar technologies are tied together with logical prerequisites. In particular, the satellites branch and the various technologies associated with crewed spacecraft are likely to have the most cross-branch prerequisites, as these parts are more conceptually complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may not have escaped some people\u0027s attention that there are two nodes with non-default icons that I have not labelled and that are not properly connected to the rest of the tech tree. These are vestiges of the stock tech tree; the way I have hidden the stock tech tree is by setting hideEmpty to True for all stock nodes, and then moving every part that exists in the game into the default node (which costs one million science points and is not intended to do anything other than assist with my development by showing me which parts are unassigned). The two nodes left over have a part in them because Kerbalism unlocks certain configurable modules in these nodes, and I have yet to make a temporary patch to Kerbalism to change this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else I would like to point out is that in the gap where I mention space station parts will be, there is also going to be a branch for crewed lander pods. Additionally, the separate Tantares and BDB spacecraft branches will merge into a single crewed spacecraft branch once past the point where the crewed spacecraft parts from both mods are exhausted. The reason there are two branches is because development progresses at different rates for each and the science costs will not be the same for each node, although the total science cost of each branch will be identical. It will not be necessary to complete both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing I would like to update you all on is my preliminary playtesting. Thus far, what I have found and noted that I need to do specific testing/modifying of is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTest and potentially modify parameters of both Kosmos rockets so that they will work properly with MechJeb\u0027s primer vector guidance both with and without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Currently, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, both Kosmos rockets flip uncontrollably after first stage separation when carrying a payload to a 90km parking orbit with what should be sufficient delta-v. I have yet to test them without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Additionally, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters on the Kosmos 2I upper stage engine do not appear to function, so I need to find the cause of that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReduce payload capacity of Soyuz rocket (likely by reducing specific impulse of the engines). Currently it is overpowered for JNSQ, and this needs to be changed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReduce payload capacity of Zenit rocket. Compared to where I would like the Soyuz rocket to be in terms of payload, Zenit is overpowered as well. However, this has the caveat that I will also need to ensure that Energia has the right capacity after modifications made to Zenit (I have yet to test Energia at all).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSlightly increase payload capacity of Proton rocket. Similar case with the others except this time the rocket is underpowered. It can reasonably transport only about a tonne more than Zenit into low Kerbin orbit as things currently stand. Obviously rebalancing Zenit will contribute to increasing the divide between the two, but Proton alone still feels somewhat underpowered.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBased upon the aforementioned points, I get the impression that I will also need to adjust the balance of the N1 (specifically, balancing it around the typical N1-L3 stack) and Energia. Both of these also need to be notably more capable than Proton.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNeed to test \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel cell capabilities extensively. Desired balance is so that two of them can properly power the Soyuz 7K-LOK, and no more than four can power the standard Apollo spacecraft, in both cases for the duration of a Munar mission. However, I may have to adjust my parameters for these conditions as I have yet to do testing on the power consumption of the standard Apollo spacecraft so I still do not know how it compares to Soyuz 7K-LOK.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd Kerbalism space station experiments to space station parts which do not have access to them already. This will be part of the science rebalancing when I adjust the positions of experiment unlocks in the tech tree. I have noticed in my testing with Tantares that none of the Kerbalism experiments exist by default in Tantares space station modules, which is something that needs to be changed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smotheredrun","CreatedById":165894,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-13T04:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-septemberwaves/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022160814\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-septemberwaves/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@septemberWaves\u003C/a\u003EVery cool.\u00A0 Interested to see where this goes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Misguided Kerbal","CreatedById":203209,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-20T22:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks really cool!

Science nodes will likely have a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of prerequisite nodes across the tech tree (including other science nodes of a similar tier) and be very costly, to prevent players from simply researching every available science node first and then having all science experiments available from the start.
