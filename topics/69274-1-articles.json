So in the movie gravity (i don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve seen it, but in most videos about space maneuvers) they use 2 joysticks for orbital maneuvers with RCS. Now i have a gamepad and it has 2 joysticks. In case anyone\u0027s wondering, i\u0027m using motioninjoy to help ksp recognize all the buttons and it works pretty damn good. I wanted to mimic the orbital rotations and translations with those joysticks as in real life. However, here\u0027s what boggles me. For full rotation controls one needs 3 axis. For full translation controls one needs another 3 axis. That\u0027s a total of 6 axis. Yet 2 joysticks only allow for 4 axis, so how do they do it in actual spacecraft? Do they have pedals? Do the joysticks move up and down too? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really about the buttons, i have free buttons to spare if i count in the keyboard and the gamepad. I just wanted to get a realistic experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T19:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of joysticks twist around their vertical axis, giving 3 axis per stick \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zidane","CreatedById":49246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T19:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was fast.
