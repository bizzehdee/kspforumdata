I didn\u0027t see this in the already suggested box so here it goes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith 0.26 we will be introduced to new mk 3 parts. These are supposed to approximate the Shuttle. the shuttle, and many space planes that I have seen, use radially mounted fuel tanks, often asymmetrically mounted (such as on the bottom.) because of the offset in center of mass, and the large shift in CoM as the tank empties, it is incredibly difficult to correctly mount engines such that they do not create moments on the craft. To combat this I suggest that a series of engines, at least two, are added that trade weight (the\u0027re heavier than normal) for the ability to gimbal at least 15 degrees. This would simplify construction and piloting of space planes as the engine could better compensate for the shifting and offset center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
