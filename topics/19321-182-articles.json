I\u0027ve tried adding 3x the number of wings (no effect), a lot more thrust, a lot more control surfaces, etc. and nothing changes: it seems to just stick to the runway. However, when it finally goes off the \u003Cem\u003Eend\u003C/em\u003E of the runway, losing contact with the ground, it CAN fly, maneuver, and climb, and at far lower speeds than it was traveling while apparently glued to the runway\u0027s surface.

I mean, I followed the ideas in that guide (if not any one particular design) almost exactly, and it DOES fly (awkwardly, a bit, but it flies) so long as it is somehow removed from ground contact. It can maintain steady, level flight at something like 60m/s, but rocking out at 180m/s on the ground it can\u0027t lift off. The nose can pitch up, visually, but it seems stuck to the pavement, for lack of a better descriptor. Gear placement more toward the CoM changes visually how much it appears to tip up (slightly greater angle), but doesn\u0027t allow liftoff.
