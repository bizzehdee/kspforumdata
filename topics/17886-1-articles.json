All 2m engines have thrust vectoring. On the small engines, I used for initial stage a tricoupled stack of tanks with the -30 thrust vectoring. On those, I mounted another set of the same with a radial decoupler. Crossfeed the -30s outside to the inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also mount to each of the tri coupled two stacks of the -45 non thrust vectoring engines. Initial launch has the outer engines firing. Fuel lines crossfeed from the -45 engines to the -30 booster stack. Use solid boosters as well depending on your satellite weight.
