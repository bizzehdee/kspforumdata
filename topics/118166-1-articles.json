{"TopicId":118166,"ForumId":69,"TopicTitle":"Game Fails to Launch or Loads","CreatedByName":"Stir_Fry_Beans","CreatedById":76364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:14:42Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Stir_Fry_Beans","CreatedById":76364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:14:42Z","Content":"Hello all, I am using the latest KSP on an early 2011 MacBook Pro with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8 jiggabytes of RAM. It is running OS X 10.7.5 Lion. Like I said this is 1.0.4 KSP however I am getting the same issue with .90 Beta. When I try and run the launcher all I get is the launcher window completely blacked out and the mouse starts to pinwheel. I can launch the program directly and access settings and even start a game, but as soon as I select start game or resume game the loading screen makes about a half of a revolution and then freezes and the computer begins to pinwheel. By forcing the screen to refresh by dragging the window around I can get a glitchy view of KSC to load but I can\u0027t click on any of the buildings. The worst part of this is, the game stops outputting to the log after I select start game, so I can\u0027t see whats going on. Since the game doesn\u0027t actually crash (just refuses to load) there is no crash log that I can read or upload for you guys to look at. I have tried with fresh installs and like mentioned before KSP .90 Beta and the issue still persists. I also deleted the old plist files and the game save states. I have reason to believe that it is an out of RAM error that is being sneaky. By viewing the activity monitor I can see that KSP is using upwards of 1.5 GB or even above 2 GB in some cases when it freezes. The issue persists even when I turned down graphics settings and I even tried using Active Texture Management! No luck.\n\nHere is a link to imgur gallery of screenshots...sorry for PNG\u0027s and lack of banana for scale.

Got rid of some excess font libraries and performed fontrestore. Worked like a charm.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T05:36:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stir\\_Fry\\_Beans**\n  \nAdded my KSP.log file to the post.
