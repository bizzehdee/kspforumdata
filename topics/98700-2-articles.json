Because of this, the flight characteristics are rather poor--it has very little power. If you want more power, you can add a fin to each engine blade, or use wider blades, and it will fly MUCH better. Also, there are a large number of control surfaces (to replicate the look of the original stuka\u0027s dive brakes, etc), so there may be *some* infiniglide effects going on, but the prop provides the majority of the thrust. The purists may cry a tear or three. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther things of note:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) After flying Stuka, when you revert to launch, spaceplane hanger, or go to the space center, the game can crash. This is a bug in Kerbal, and I\u0027ve reported it to the devs. This appears due to the engine--using Tsevion\u0027s engine I never had any crashes. However, it was too heavy to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I strengthened Azimech\u0027s engine by adding a couple wheels, specifically on the top. This is because the load on the engine is not uniform, as the engine is horizontal. Other than that, it\u0027s his stock engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At full throttle, due to the small blades, there is a small chance that you can overspeed the RCS tanks in Azimech\u0027s engine, causing them to explode. If this happens, the prop will jam and stop operating. I recommend using 90% throttle, unless you want to live on the edge. Consider 100% war emergency--the engine may self-destruct. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Because of minimal thrust, I needed to reduce weight and removed most fuel. This puts the CG far forward, so I added reaction wheels to allow you to lower the tail. Without these (in the cargohold), you will not be able to lift off the ground. If you make a much larger prop, you can fill all of the fuel tanks, and you can remove the RCS wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to try to design my own engine, particularly to reduce weight and fix the overspeed explosions. I have a few ideas on how I might achieve that.

Overspeeding means the construction just jams, until power is dropped. Unfortunately, the increased drag means you lose quite some power, the construction is heavier and you obviously need more parts. But, if done correctly, you could build a tank with this.

Glad I could help with the advancement of the engine technology!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour new engine sounds exciting! I am certainly looking forward to trying it out. One thing I discovered was the \u0022Better Time Warp\u0022 mod that lets you run the game in slow motion, (I think down to x0.05), which I am hoping will allow me to see where my latest design of engine is going wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it looks like you do what I do. But 2 different engines / prop setups on one plane and whichever way the plane torques tells you which is more powerful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lothsahn","CreatedById":75815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a new turbine without the high speed problems of the bearings using tanks or other structural parts. With these, the landing gears are mounted on the shaft and rotate, running inside a shell of steel plates. Reliability goes up dramatically! They can even withstand some battle damage (untested). Overspeeding means the construction just jams, until power is dropped. Unfortunately, the increased drag means you lose quite some power, the construction is heavier and you obviously need more parts. But, if done correctly, you could build a tank with this. This one ran reliably on first try, but had only 50% of the power of my best engine.

It\u0027s roughly twice as powerful as your Screaming Turtle engine, without any added jets! I\u0027m not sure how it compares to your strongest engine--please test and let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the event of overspeed, the engine will start randomly tugging on the airframe, which lets you know to throttle down. If you continue to overspeed, the engine will stop spinning until power is reduced, with no part breakage. \u003Cstrong\u003EWith at least a 3 bladed prop attached, I\u0027ve been unable to break the engine at any speed, altitude, or throttle setting unless I use physics warp.\u003C/strong\u003E With 8 blades (as shown in the Stuka V4), it will not overspeed at any altitude that the Stuka is flyable at.

Some power is sacrificed to keep the profile smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine weight: 8.7T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis engine is capable of pushing the Stuka to a maximum speed of 50.4 m/s @ 5700m altitude. The limiting factor actually becomes the loss of tail authority, as there is not a second prop to counter-balance the forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign Details (for future modders):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotating parts in kerbal tend to expand as they rotate faster. You can see this in the propellers as they spin. This happens to the turbine blades too. By designing the engine to have high strength parts (1x1 panels \u0026amp; ibeams) be the collision points, you can cause the engine to jam without part loss. The bearing in the engine are modeled after the yelling gazelle, but using higher strength angled parts. These bearings mean that unless the shaft completely leaves the wheels, it will automatically reset itself when the engine is powered down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maximum RPM of this engine is directly dependent on the gap between the turbine blades and the i-beams. To keep the profile smaller, I had to rotate the turbine blades. This means they are not perpendicular with the jets, which (I think) is causing a small power loss. With a larger case, I believe the engine could provide even more power if it had perpendicular blades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/screenshot49.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot49.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/Juno211D-Bench.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJuno 211D\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I noticed with the turbine blades, at least on my design, was that if they spun too quickly centrifugal force pulls them away from the shaft and they end up hitting the engine frame causing a jam.

Brilliant design! I didn\u0027t think of using NCS adapters in the bearings. They seem a lot tougher and have less friction than the FLA10 adaptors. 2 things I noticed though. 1) you are using 8 octagonal struts to hold the jets to the frame. You only need one. You attach the jet engine to it and then use the new offset ability to move the engine up and down and left and right to get it in the right orientation. It would save you at least 28 parts. 2) the turbine blades do pull away from the shaft.

I\u0027ll look at this. Be careful though--the engine MUST be above the frame, or you\u0027ll have RUD when the turbine blades crash into the engine. The whole point of the engine is that the lowest point is the i-beam, NOT the jets. Also, it would save parts, but those parts are physicsless, so I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll affect performance that much... I guess if you\u0027re solely looking at parts count it\u0027ll make it look better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I\u0027ll try adding struts.
