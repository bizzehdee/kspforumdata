That range represents what\u0027s referred to as the \u0022physics bubble\u0022, and that\u0027s only really important in atmosphere, where aerodynamic lift and drag need to be modelled.. otherwise craft can just be thought of as a point mass \u0022on rails\u0022, ie in a fixed orbit.\n\nMaybe when they upgrade to a newer engine and can handle multithreading they can increase it more, but at the moment they\u0027re a little limited in just how many physics calcs the system can process."}]}
