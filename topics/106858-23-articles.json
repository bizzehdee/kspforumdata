Lots and lots of new places to visit, with a nice amount of variety. I have, however, encountered 2 bugs that make the planet pack rather unusable:\n\n1. All atmospheres lack a pressure curve, and are thus sea level density, even high up. E.a. I entered Pergas\u0027 atmosphere with a spaceplane, and as soon as I entered, the pressure-bar on top of the screen rose to sea-level and my plane collided into the thick air and burned up. Tried the same with other atmospheric planets and moons and the exact same happens, no atmosphere curves.\n\n2. I used HyperEdit to orbit another spaceplane around Pergas and safely de-orbit, and landed it in one of the craters. The plane interacted with the ground correctly, but when sending a kerbal on EVA, it acted as if there was no ground and stayed in the \u0027falling\u0027 position, despite laying there still on the ground. Doing a EVA report revealed that the game seemed to think the kerbal (and the plane) were flying, while they had in fact landed and were standing still.\n\nJust a head\u0027s up I guess, I haven\u0027t heard from anyone with this problem yet.
