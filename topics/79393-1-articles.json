That takes away from the game itself. It makes fund-gathering too easy (one of the most important gameplay feature from the carrier mode), plus it is just click mission building - click trancking station - select probe - wait for loading - find the temperature item, click on it - send data - go back to space center.

This would automatically scale the reward with the distance of the target body, and give diminishing returns when repeating on the same body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownside: when transmitting multiple results, you would need a new contract for each one.
