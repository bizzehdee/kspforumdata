Seriously, what gives?\n\nI think it\u0027s a symptom of a broader transition in the movie industry in general. In earlier generations of cinema, the director wanted to give the audience the feeling that the audience was *really there*. Modern directors (at least some modern directors) instead want to give the audience the feeling that the director\u0027s home video camera was *really there*.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI gotta admit, though, those light-spikes *do* look pretty badass."}]}
