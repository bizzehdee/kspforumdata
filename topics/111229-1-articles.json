So the only the only mods i am using are the recently updated Mechjeb and Kerbal Alarm Clock also updated to match the current build of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two problems that keep cropping up, i have listed them below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Whenever i set a maneuver node for a burn regardless where in time it is, Mechjeb will turn to face the target node but will fail to warp there. If i warp there manually it will then fail to fire the crafts engines and merrily sail the craft on by. It doesn\u0027t always happen but mostly it does. I have used Mechjeb since forever and so find this weird, i do know how many variables could cause this as KSP is a complex game. Wanted to know if anyone had the same problem or had even fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. One of the things that led me to first validate KSP was the above mentioned issue, and to my surprise Steam said \u00221 file failed to validate and will be reaquired\u0022. Everything was fine with Mechjeb until i next played the game. So again validated KSP and again the same thing \u00221 file failed to validate and will be reacquired\u0022. Now i checked the KSP installed games library on Steam and tbh Steam wasn\u0027t reacquireing any files for KSP. Is this a dodgy install? am i going to have to install KSP again which tbh will now be the 6th time i have had to do this (getting annoying). Worth noting that i just now validated KSP and again it said the same thing. Anyone had this problem and fixed it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Modded - Mechjeb \u0026amp; Kerbal Alarm Clock only current versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESenario, sending a probe to Duna. I set a maneuver node with Mechjeb. Mechjeb turns to face the node, but will not warp to it nor will it start the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever it will launch and put the rocket in orbit around kerbin and start the burn out of kerbin. Anything after that it wont do. Theres plenty of power and Mechjebs the right way up. Although steam keeps finding 1 file that fails validating, on closer inspection steam seems to be reacquireing a 26kb file everytime it finds the said failed file. maybe theres an issue with that install?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out i had a problem with the Steam installer the issues i believe are now resolved.

I have the exact same issue and it only seems to happen on one of my ships, the rest all seem to work fine. I even rebuilt the ship and kept launching it step by step mechjeb working fine until. I added a science lab and a probe into a MK 3 bay. Now mechjeb is broken and behaves exactly as you described. Removing the parts that broke it don\u0027t fix the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
