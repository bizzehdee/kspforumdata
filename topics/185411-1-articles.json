I built a station around Kerbin for a contract but it never gets completed. I\u0027m 100% sure that all requirements are satisfied but the contract\u00A0list shows only the special parameters checked while the general parameter (must have an antenna, a docking port and generate power) remains unchecked. I have all these in the station, built with stock parts (to rule out mod issues), but they were assembled in different missions. Could that be the issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would ask if I could complete it\u00A0by editing the save file, but just learned from another post that we can solve it with the debug menu (Alt \u002B F12). I guess that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do but would still like\u00A0to know if there are restrictions to how we build a station to fulfill a contract\u0027s requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarconi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-12T20:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni do it regularly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut the first part cannot leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003Esph\u003C/abbr\u003E until after the contract is accepted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-13T02:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can certainly build stations out of pieces, however, there is one trick that you have to be very careful of.

I\u0027m always carefull to build the stations after the contracts are\u00A0accepted, but I never considered tugs or other spacecrafts interacting with them. Not sure if this is the case for this station but it could well be, since I\u00A0used quite a few tugs\u00A0in its construction. This kind of denies the purpose of the tugs that I keep in space for builds and maintenance, so I think I\u0027ll be using the Alt \u002B F12 solution quite often.\u00A0 ;-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot for the heads up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dan Kerman","CreatedById":193616,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-14T18:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this exact problem...\u00A0 built a station to go into Minmus orbit.. one parameter was 6,000 units of fuel.
