On one side I am happy Mike that you are doing something with the current shuttle but on the other hand I am a little bit pissed cause you are putting the things from my gifs which will be in the new shuttle, to the old one. So I think there will be no need to have two same shuttles with the same things. No offense and as I said I am happy that you are doing something with the current shuttle. I just think there should be a better communication flow about this. do not take it as offense just my 2 cents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK first off I LOVE your work and I am happy to see it released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond, you never replied to my help requests and as I said before I am doing this work just until you release yours, and maybe see what can be added and what works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI DID say this was unofficial so no need to be pissed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if you follow the post I am simply adding requests.
