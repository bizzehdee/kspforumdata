However, using a fairing system like the KW Rocketry fairings allows me to strut the cargo to the fairing, as the craft was stable enough once I was in orbit to finish deployment of whatever I\u0027m hauling; however, this isn\u0027t an option because 1.0 broke that style of fairing. While each system has it\u0027s strengths and it\u0027s weaknesses (assuming they both work in KPS), it\u0027s really a decision that should be left to the player, as the player knows best with what will (and won\u0027t) work for a particular design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that leads me to some of the stuff I\u0027ve read about the 1.0.5 changes, specifically: Will the 1.0.5 changes allow the non-procedural fairings to work as they did in 0.90?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T22:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not entirely sure what you\u0027re asking here.

However, an option is to install FAR, which does reenable the capability for these fairings to protect their payloads. While flying in FAR sounds scary, if you\u0027re used to post 1.0 aerodynamics, FAR won\u0027t be that bad of a leap you\u0027ll just have to fine tune how you fly a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T23:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETopic: I doubt it.
