If you\u0027re not Roleplaying we have three possible motivators Funds,Rep and Science. Funds and Rep could get attention in this case if they implement more complex Contracts e.g. Launching Sattelites, Setup Bases, Timed stays like 50 days on surface, and so on. But the real Motivator has to be Science! Why we\u0027re doing mission in Real Life? Money for bringing things for a customer from A to B OR Exploration and Research of the unknown. And i think the contracts are mainly providing the funding of your Exploration Missions.

Maybe something like a Particle-Accelerator. So you\u0027d have a slight curved Part, but if you\u0027 dock like 20 of them together it\u0027d form a Ring with 1km Radius. Then you can ran the Experiment in that Enviroment (not biome specific), but you\u0027d have to launch several missions first and assemble it somewhere to do so and it makes a nice objective for a big base or station. (It could actually be some kind of a substitude for Ressources, if actually no ressources will be implemented, and it\u0027d be only one new part and some Coding to add a deeper space-building purpose)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiomes shouldn\u0027t yield the same Science, the first you land in should give you 100%, the second 50% , 3rd 40% , 4th 30%... That would encourage to explore new planets but not punish to stay.

After Apollo Missions no one got there again, because right know there is no reason to do so.

Maybe don\u0027t even new Parts, just that every EVA-Suit has two new things, a Ground structure and a Pipe. Infinite, like the infinite Flags in the suit. And apply them in the way KAS does it. Maybe also a strut. so you can build structures and maybe even repair crashed ships. Image the situation you crashed on landing and something important (engine) got off but didn\u0027t explode? you could strut and pipe it back onto the ship and try to fly this weirdly shaped ship somehow back instead of reload or send rescue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(But this is not as important as the Science Overhaul)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*\u003C/strong\u003E make one or two of the suggested Experiments in Science system overhaul require to be set up and activated by a Kerbal on EVA, maybe the Life behavior Exp. , would be another addition for Station and Base To-Do-Things.

But there is much more Science so i have a really simple suggestion: Add Endgame Nodes in the TechTree after you\u0027ve got all the Parts: Really expensive and they don\u0027t unlock new Parts, but maybe some small new objects (planets as soon as new ones are implemented) like maybe Comets (really small and weird orbit and hard to reach) that got discovered with the invested science. E.g. if KSP gets 3 Comets, there could be 3 EndGame Nodes to unlock them and give the Science a purpose. And after that One FINAL Node which requires so much Science, that you have to get 90 % of all the Science to get there and unlock it. It would unlock Nothing. Just maybe a long Kerbal-ish-written Text about new Discoveries in the rest of the space. But nothing gameplay-wise, since you Explored everything at that point. Would give the Tech Tree an actual final End where the hole Kerbol system was fully understood by the Kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*\u003C/strong\u003EAnother thing to unlock through tech tree could be the ability to track asteroids.
