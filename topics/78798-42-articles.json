TAC, in that sense, can \u0027use\u0027 ORS because its Water is named the same as ORS\u0027s Water. Since ORS was made originally for KSPI, all of KSPI\u0027s resources use the same names as ORS\u0027s resources.\u003Cp\u003ENear Future is very close, but ORS\u0027s resource is named \u0027Argon\u0027 while Near Future\u0027s is named \u0027ArgonGas\u0027, for example, so you\u0027d have to either modify/extend ORS to have \u0027ArgonGas\u0027 resource definitions, or Near Future would need to be modified to use the ORS resource names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince ORS doesn\u0027t actually create any KSP resources, it\u0027s up to mod authors to create resources and, if they want them to work with ORS, give them the correct names (or create ORS definitions with names that the author wants to use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of that MIGHT be wrong.
