If, however, power drain is supposed to be a part of it then scaling power drain with speed is a good answer. However, to keep the power from draining when moving slowly over the ground, I would set the minimum speed for power drain to start only when a certain speed is attained, whatever that speed is which allows the wings to start generating lift. Otherwise, a plane on the taxiway making it\u0027s way from the hangar to the runway will be draining power because it\u0027s moving.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good thought, I\u0027ll set the minimum speed for power drain at 50 m/s. But I probably shouldn\u0027t get too ahead of myself here with KSP 1.0 coming out tomorrow to wreck the current aerodynamic system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barfing_skull","CreatedById":126825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T20:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool. 50m/s seems like a good threshold. Also, can we stop them from exploding? I was kinda sad when I ran out of juice and my big cargo plane no longer had the 4 ionized wings I had attached. Sure, it got off the ground with what it had, but promptly did an inescapable nosedive at about 4000m. Although then, unless you added a way to drastically reduce the lift when it did run out of juice, I suppose that would defeat that part of the plan. The ideal way to do things would be to have it not suck any electricity until 50m/s, but either below that speed, or when it runs out of electricity above that speed, to reduce the lift to something like 2, which is about in line with non-ionized wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, looking back at the problems with TweakScale and NaN, I can usually get around that by trashing the part in question when it happens, and re-adding it. Perhaps repeating more than once. It seems to happen almost always for me with engines.
