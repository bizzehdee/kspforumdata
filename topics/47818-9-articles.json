If it\u0027s stalling in thin air, then you need more speed or more wing area. Or both. Though it\u0027s a tricky balance. Intake area slows you down. Wings are draggy and heavy. So what\u0027s the craft\u0027s purpose? If it\u0027s high altitude research, maybe slow is the way to go. Then you design something like the U-2.
