It\u0027s a bit dry but it does cover the basics of shuttle construction. I would suggest getting RCS Build Aid if you don\u0027t already have it; it does make the prospect of constructing a successful shuttle design a good deal easier. Basically you just add the boosters and external tanks with standard radial decouplers while you\u0027re still in the SPH and tilt it upright, running fuel ducts from the external tank to the orbiter to run the main engines. If you want to launch the shuttle from the launchpad, use one of methods Alshain and LethalDose have mentioned; the guy in the tutorial just launches the thing upright from the Runway, which is a completely valid way of doing it.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T18:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod will help you with porting assemblies in-game between VAB and SPH (basically by allowing you to switch build-modes within one or the other -- \u0022technically\u0022 you\u0027re not shipping anything, you\u0027re just using one or the other at all times with the flexibility of both editor-modes within the same instance.)
