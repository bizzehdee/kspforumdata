I can\u0027t see any obstacles, so it makes no sense to me. Sometimes the rover gets jammed even when it\u0027s upright and has unbroken wheels. Kerbals suffer from an unusual walking issue, sometimes unable to run at speed, only able to move sideways(especially if I\u0027m trying to run at x3 or x4 gamespeed). There is a landed capsule and flag 13km away from the rover when I encounter the issue. Everywhere I\u0027ve driven on Eve this issue occurs. I\u0027ve only tested this one rover, since it\u0027s small, and testing something else would mean landing a bigger one(which would take me hours to figure out).
