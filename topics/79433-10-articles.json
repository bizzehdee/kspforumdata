The biggest problem is that small, insignificant details get as much texture space as large ones, and that UV space isn\u0027t reused for things that look the same/have the same color. A lot of it is simply wasted, filled with nothing but black. Luna 3 and 2 also have way more textures than they should. What is especially peculiar is that the most egregious cases are the probes with the plainest textures, being reflective metal all over (Luna 3 has solar panels and some color, Sputnik 2 has Laika, but that\u0027s it).
