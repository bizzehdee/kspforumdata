They will talk with us and take community input into consideration. Most games aren\u0027t like this and we have been extremely lucky in that regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill the community continue to be important in KSP 2, and will the new devs be as open as they have been in KSP? It would be a shame to lose such a great thing about the development of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VaPaL","CreatedById":150974,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-24T18:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that in the interview with IGN they said that the community aspect is very important and they want to keep it that way. I think they will be as open, if not more, to the community as the KSP 1 Dev Team... At least I hope so\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-24T22:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the devs actually ARE the players of the first one as we know, so I wouldn\u0027t be worried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
