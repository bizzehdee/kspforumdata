It\u0027s useful in space, because any velocity change you make is permanently kept, so you can count velocity changes. However, in an atmosphere, even as you thrust to increase velocity, drag makes you constantly lose velocity. How much you lose depends on your current velocity, on your flight altitude, on the shape of your plane, on the temperature and makeup of the atmosphere, even on your current orientation on the navball...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027m afraid that you shouldn\u0027t put much value in that absurdly high number. It only makes sense in space. For your plane, you\u0027re better served finding your maximum range, which is a result of finding the cruising altitude at which you can maintain the highest level airspeed while having your throttle the lowest and keeping Isp up as much as possible.
