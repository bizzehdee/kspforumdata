It\u0027s useful in space, because any velocity change you make is permanently kept, so you can count velocity changes. However, in an atmosphere, even as you thrust to increase velocity, drag makes you constantly lose velocity. How much you lose depends on your current velocity, on your flight altitude, on the shape of your plane, on the temperature and makeup of the atmosphere, even on your current orientation on the navball...\n\nSo yeah, I\u0027m afraid that you shouldn\u0027t put much value in that absurdly high number. It only makes sense in space. For your plane, you\u0027re better served finding your maximum range, which is a result of finding the cruising altitude at which you can maintain the highest level airspeed while having your throttle the lowest and keeping Isp up as much as possible. It\u0027s a complicated problem, unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T14:57:16Z","Content":"From patch notes:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* With lowered drag for sharply-tapered cubes, wing lift and wing drag lowered to match.\n\u003E \n\u003E (...)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Drag curves modified to lower transonic hump.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Wing curves modified to lower change in drag based on deflection.\n\u003E \n\u003E (...)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Jet thrusts rebalanced for new drag (thrusts lowered, BJE curves altered).

So according to this, air-drag is drastically decreased, thus the trust of jet engines got halved. I see that it means an extreme atmo-dV, but who cares about that? I\u0027m more interested in how turbojet SSTOs react to the patch.\n\nGuess I won\u0027t update yet so I can check it myself.

The burn times for air-breathing engines are out by the ratio of intake air to fuel (can\u0027t remember the exact figures but a quick test will demonstrate this, just create a vessel with a jet and intake and a small amount of fuel, see what KER says for the burn time and then test it on the pad)."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:36:33Z","Content":"Don\u0027t pay too much attention to KER aerobic dV.\n\nThe best use for it is a relative range.
