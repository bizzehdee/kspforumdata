To power all that equipment, I\u0027ll need a lot of power. I\u0027ve decided against using a ton of RTGs, but I want to keep it powered through the night. Are there Peaks of Eternal Light on the mun? If so, where?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T04:33:09Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure you can get constant or near constant light at the poles, I\u0027ve had bases land there that seemed to always have sun access even if they looked like they were in darkness. The downside is, of course, that they\u0027re at the poles.\n\nBut it may be a simpler problem than you think. It won\u0027t empty out the power stores at night if you simply go do something else (as in go pilot another ship, go to VAB, etc, but get out of physics range of the mining base). Alternately if you need night power while you\u0027re playing the ship, bring fuel cell arrays. In fact you can drop the solar panels and do just fuel cells and it will be fine, just bring maybe one panel or an RTG as a safety measure (to prevent lockup if you drain batteries and empty tanks)."}]}
