What they have with KSP (even as of now) is probably the best ever little space and flight almost-simulator. The engineering, the flying, the space flight, space exploration, and other activities already far surpass everything that Orbiter has ever been, other than in the \u0027realism\u0027 department.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s next step after 1.0 in my opinion should be an official realism expansion/DLC. Their best bet might be to work with the big contributors to the realism overhaul mod, as they have already laid out a good blueprint for it already, but even if that isn\u0027t possible they should still consider the idea. The real solar system, humans, n-body physics, replica parts of real rockets, real chemistry, and, the most important: brutal real life difficulty with disregard to casual \u0027fun\u0027. I believe that KSP (and the Unity engine itself) is capable of completely surpassing Orbiter in every way, and I believe a true space simulator has a good size market but no products to fill the market demand. The DLC would sell to a large portion of the install base, and at a decent price point it could be like Squad hitting gold a second time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Squad for some reason is unable or unwilling to go the realism DLC route, then my next wish (after KSP is \u0027complete\u0027 in the traditional sense of the word) would be for a sort-of Kerbal Kart Racing type add-on/game. A quirky F-zero type racing game with real physics where players build their own vehicles and race on tracks across all of the Kerbol system.
