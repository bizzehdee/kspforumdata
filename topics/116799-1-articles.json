I decided to challenge myself and try to use one core vessel for the entire mission. The one core vessel I chose is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TstErIY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TstErIY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is a revival of a shuttle of mine that broke in 1.0. On dry runs it can reach LKO. The only celestials I believe will present a significant challenge are Tylo and Eve. For Tylo I\u0027m sure I can cook up some assistance package (whether external or internal has yet to be decided) that can get it safely on and off of Tylo. Eve on the other hand is a good deal different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt clocks in at a whopping 152 tons, with dimensions of 10.2x28.9x39.9m. It bears 8 SCIMITAR engines from the Mk IV pack, as well as 3 Badgers from Vens stock Revamp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(which are angled as they are intended for when it launches as a shuttle). It also shielded docking ports on its nose and on its belly, as well as a Sr. port in the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My question is this: Without modifying the core craft itself, can anyone conceive a possible method of getting this safely on and off of Eve? I\u0027m not quite looking for an extremely detailed or surefire means of accomplishing this task, as I don\u0027t even know if its actually possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you require more information/images on this vessel, or wish for a download so you can test things yourself, I will provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be possible thou the amount of parts needed, weight and general insanity is too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time I have gotten to Eve I pretty much used a probe/ultralight lander to do the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think however, you must use some kind of staged rocket else the weight will simply be way too massive, huge drag, thick as syrup atmosphere, gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T07:37:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TimePeriod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes and Eve... it was impossible back to version .90.
