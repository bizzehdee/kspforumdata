I decided to challenge myself and try to use one core vessel for the entire mission. The one core vessel I chose is this:\n\n![TstErIY.png](http://i.imgur.com/TstErIY.png)\n\n It is a revival of a shuttle of mine that broke in 1.0. On dry runs it can reach LKO. The only celestials I believe will present a significant challenge are Tylo and Eve. For Tylo I\u0027m sure I can cook up some assistance package (whether external or internal has yet to be decided) that can get it safely on and off of Tylo. Eve on the other hand is a good deal different.\n\nIt clocks in at a whopping 152 tons, with dimensions of 10.2x28.9x39.9m. It bears 8 SCIMITAR engines from the Mk IV pack, as well as 3 Badgers from Vens stock Revamp\n\n(which are angled as they are intended for when it launches as a shuttle). It also shielded docking ports on its nose and on its belly, as well as a Sr. port in the bay.\n\n My question is this: Without modifying the core craft itself, can anyone conceive a possible method of getting this safely on and off of Eve? I\u0027m not quite looking for an extremely detailed or surefire means of accomplishing this task, as I don\u0027t even know if its actually possible.\n\nIf you require more information/images on this vessel, or wish for a download so you can test things yourself, I will provide."},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:30:09Z","Content":"I think it *might* be possible thou the amount of parts needed, weight and general insanity is too much.\n\nEvery time I have gotten to Eve I pretty much used a probe/ultralight lander to do the science.\n\nI do think however, you must use some kind of staged rocket else the weight will simply be way too massive, huge drag, thick as syrup atmosphere, gravity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T07:37:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TimePeriod**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:36:30Z","Content":"Spaceplanes and Eve... it was impossible back to version .90. It may be possible for a highly optimized system now (delta V requirements have been reduced), but honestly... the one i see here: no. You would still need to pack 8 - 9.000 m/s of delta V into a purely rocket powered plane.\n\nAnd going to Tylo by spaceplane? Very inefficient because the weight of the totally useless wings alone will increase your fuel usage immensely.\n\nIn stock KSP i sense an early mission abort here..."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:56:44Z","Content":"I\u0027m not familiar with those modded engines or how OP\u0027d they are.\n\nAssuming they aren\u0027t too OP\u0027d...\n\nYou would need to have lots of external boosters on this thing....\n\nI can\u0027t imagine \\*why\\* you want to bring that thing down to Eve though...\n\nI suppose you could mod an air augmented ram-rocket type engine, and then make it as an SSTO if you made the engines OP\u0027d enough"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalShade","CreatedById":139111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:58:15Z","Content":"152 tons ?

Between ISRU and the new aero, it has become possible to lift a lot of heavy gear from Eve using the tried-and-true MOAR BOOSTERS method. Still, expect this plane to at least triple in size, and you probably won\u0027t land it as a plane but as a tailsitter."}]}
