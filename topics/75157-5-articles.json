I\u0027ve now switched to SpacedInvader\u0027s RSS planet pack, which illiminates the issues with PF for good(although it is also a wip config). I have since been able to resume work on the planets. I should hopefully be able to get 0.2 out in the next few days which should include rudimentary configs for all planets in the system as well as several flavours for Earth so you guys can mix and match the look you wan\u0027t. There\u0027s be the standard 0.2A in all it\u0027s dev\u0027y glitchyness, and then two other configs [b\u0026amp;C] for differing Earths. These won\u0027t use the WIP terrain shader and consequentially city lights, but the trade off is the smoother looking (and functioning) stock terrain that includes several features like the terrain haze effect and bump maps for 3D look from orbit. B is more realistic as contains colour map for land, but the down side is it will appear shiny in certain situations, and C will be just a colour map for oceans, so normal matte look of land but brighter less realistic (but more pretty.. shhhhhh) look for Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I\u0027ve said already I really appreciate your patience, getting the stock game to work with multiple mods is hard enough, but getting a fundamentally modded stock game (RSS) to function with multiple mods (that are in dev themselves [Overhaul Series]) is a whole nother thing, hence why this is taking longer than many other visual packs out there for EVE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a start, but a start at least right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3g4jD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Also now I\u0027ve figured out how to get this inverse fade distance thing/global haze, I can make planets look allot nicer with fewer layers. In addition to THAT I\u0027ve switched back to 32bit ksp for compatability purposes, and can really see the need for some optimisation, which I\u0027ve done, meaning much less bugs now. All in all I\u0027m very happy with the way things are going \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E 0.2 should be up soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T17:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can wait. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I need to update/reinstall RSS/RO anyhow, and now is the perfect time since my moon rocket test last night was a disaster.
