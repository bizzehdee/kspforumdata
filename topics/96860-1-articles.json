I think realism is what makes games fun. Like some also pointed the fun of learning something hard plays also an important role. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as much as I love and respect squad (which I do), I think that aerodynamics are only \u0022hard\u0022 because of the design decision (which I respect) of having the game be more about trial and error then well planed construction. This is their decision and I have to respect this as it seems to stem waaaay before I even heard about KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in my very humble opinion this is what makes the KSP less \u0022fun\u0022 and more grindy. This is also what makes having a better aerodynamic model feel like a choice between these two apparent extremes. If the player had a more informative UI he/she would be able to more easily make better planes while also coping with a more realistic aerodynamic model. Giving the user only the CoM, CoT and CoL might be more then enough to build rockets but I find it very lacking to build a plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also makes me think that while making a rocket is super intuitive (pointy thing at the top and fiery thing at the bottom) making a plane is much harder and there is little information in the game that is designed to make better planes. This, in my opinion, is why it FEELS that fun and realism are two extreme options. If you give the player more information to build a better plane it will become as easy as you want it to be. But, obviously, not too much information or the player will be overwhelmed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then comes that day where you want to build random stuff and have it blow up in funny ways. While I think that would still be possible had these issues been addressed probably not every crazy thing would be able to fly. Well... Since we were forced for so long to toggle part-clipping in the debug menu why not have an \u0022legacy aerodynamics\u0022 option? It definitely shouldn\u0027t be an option on the difficulty settings for reasons a lot of people regarded in other threads, but having it on the debug menu would make the player think of it as activating a \u0022cheat\u0022 and using it when he/she wanted to have some crazy stupid fun like the \u0022good old days\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably wrong in all of this but it\u0027s just my opinion.

I run stock aero, but I\u0027m not doing it because I think it\u0027s better than FAR or NEAR. I keep it because it\u0027s a part of the game and I just don\u0027t like very invasive or extensive mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the reasons for that? I\u0027m not actually sure. Mods require maintenance and I\u0027m lazy, for one. I also have this irrational idea that getting FAR would actually make it too easy to achieve orbit with stuff (your rockets require less delta-V) which would be equal to cheating in my book. Especially on Eve return missions.
