I mean, hell, a Cessna 152 only has something like 110HP in it, and my Ninja 250 has 35HP, and it\u0027s a very small bike. That\u0027s already enough power to fly an ultralight. An engine from a modern 600cc bike is enough to push a 152. And there are even larger bikes, with engines big enough to get a 172 off the ground. So in principle, you can easily take a motorcycle engine and fly with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem, however, is that vehicle engines aren\u0027t designed to operate at full power, or anywhere near it, for very long. Sport motorcycle engine will probably be better than a car engine in that regard, but you still aren\u0027t going to be able to fly on one for long without running into problems. An airplane is going to run at 70%-80% power most of the time, 100% during takeoff and climb, and only go bellow these settings for landing. A typical motorcycle engine will call it quits pretty soon under these conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T22:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I wish to achieve in my life is to build my own plane and fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, I was inspired by Peter Madsen and his team, incredible people!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can\u0027t just by an aaircraft piston engine and even if you could it would probably be expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T23:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard of people doing this.
