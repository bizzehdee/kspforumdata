{"TopicId":10167,"ForumId":18,"TopicTitle":"My views on language usage","CreatedByName":"willitstimothy","CreatedById":17395,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T22:03:23Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"willitstimothy","CreatedById":17395,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T22:03:23Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve put this here in off topic to explain to those who may have seen previous posts by my person, and who wish to understand better my own position so that they can then better understand what I say.\n\nI was born and raised in southern California, and I was educated in a very sheltered manner (home-schooled). I am very conservative and very passionate about many topics. Additionally I am very interested in politics, and am willing to take (and I do take) very politically \u0027incorrect\u0027 stances on many issues.\n\nI grew up in a region of the US where the supposed majority is actually the minority, and is stigmatized, as if they were the majority, by everyone else, where the language and customs of America are often abused or forgotten, and where people like me are very very rare. The friends I had while growing up were apathetic and liberal, but I was never either. \n\nThus, it bugs me (and mildly angers me) when I am driving around in SoCal and I see a billboard or a street sign that is written in Spanish, when I see ballots written in Spanish, or when I ask an employee at a major store a question and they cannot answer me in English. I live in the United States, not Spain, not Ecuador, not Mexico - the United States. By default, the language of America is English, nothing else (America was the territory of Great Britain for over a third of it\\\u0027s existence (currently)), and to me it does not seem unreasonable to expect English to be spoken in America.\n\nNow I am not unreasonable, I recognize that other nations and cultures have their own languages as well. Russia speaks Russian, Ukraine speaks Ukrainian, Mexicans speak Spanish, and Brazilians speak Portuguese, and I would not expect to see anything normally being written in English in those nations, and I would not expect the residents to speak English either. It simply isn\\\u0027t their language. It is discourteous to them to expect them to cater to the linguistic needs of someone who did not bother to learn their language, unless of course it is their job or profession to do so.\n\nHence:\n\nI tend to be a Nationalist of sorts, though not in the sense that I think that my country (by merit of race) is greater than any other. Simply I see America as being America and not Russia. America\\\u0027s language is its own, and its original citizens should not have to learn any other language to to survive, socially and physically, within it. America\\\u0027s customs are its own, and it is disrespectful for anyone within America to ignore those customs and instead practice the rites of another culture.\n\nI am a conservative.\n\nI am not of the \u0027there is no absolute truth\u0027 crowd, or the \u0027everything you say doesn\\\u0027t really matter because its just your opinion\u0027 crowd.\n\nI am by choice politically \u0027incorrect\u0027 quite often.\n\nThese things are some of the reasons why I enjoy going to school in eastern Washington state.\n\nI am in NO way a racist.\n\nSo what does this have to do with this forum and what I say here? After all, Squad is a Mexican company, and thus by all rights this forum should be primarily in Spanish, with English being stuck in a corner of the forum, right?\n\nThe game is made in English, which I suspect is probably because whoever studied this project proposal decided that the game would probably do better, sales-wise, if it catered to English speaking customers, and furthermore the forums rules specify that posts and comments everywhere on the forum must be in English, except in the non-English section which is dedicated to the rest of the languages on earth.\n\nI appreciate this highly because first of all I recognize that Squad doesn\\\u0027t really have an obligation, based on where it is from, to write anything in English (I do actually know enough Spanish to where I can understand, somewhat, things written in Spanish though). Also, most forums that I have been on do not have such rules, and it is annoying to see a bunch of posts being written in another language, which to me is simply blah blah and more blah, **especially when those people use bad grammar and spelling to the degree that google translate can\\\u0027t translate what they are saying**. I try my best to write what I say with proper spelling and grammar for partially this very reason (so that it can be translated properly for those who do not understand English).\n\nI am not intolerant, per se, of anyone, or their character, culture, and language, and as a member of American society, being both descended from recently (about 100 years ago) immigrated and hated (for being immigrants, Romanians, and originally non-English speakers) Americans and from Americans who who lived and died while being British citizens on this continent, I feel that it is not intolerant for me to expect people here in my country to speak my country\\\u0027s language. Likewise I don\\\u0027t believe that it is intolerant for me to feel that it is rude for members of a forum, wherein it is specified that posts contained therein must be written in English, to use another language.\n\nPlease recognize that that which I am saying here is meant to be an explanation, not an insult. If it is considered a strike against me, please recognize at least that much."},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T22:54:57Z","Content":"Do try.

Who pays the emergency room bills for those who cannot get, either because of ineligibility or because of a lack of legal citizenship, insurance? Who pays for them to be in our prisons when they commit crimes? \n\nLA county alone spends as much as 4.4 billion dollars on just education for children of illegals who do not pay taxes ([http://www.the1789project.com/2011/02/illegal-imigrations-cost-education-of-anchor-babies/](http://www.the1789project.com/2011/02/illegal-imigrations-cost-education-of-anchor-babies/)).\n\nMore than 100 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to support illegal, improperly taxed, illegal immigrants.\n\nI have paid attention to this kind of stuff since I was seven years old, over 13 years ago.\n\nI don\\\u0027t expect other Americans or people who post on an English forum to speak English nearly as well as myself, but I do expect them to try to speak and utilize English predominantly in their lives, or in this forum to just attempt to use it by way of broken self constructed grammar or google translate, and teach their children to use and speak it.\n\nThose kinds of jobs are what they do because those are the kinds of jobs that those lazy apathetic hand-fed kids were meant to do and do not (I am not saying anything negative about the people who do these jobs, what I mean is is that those kids are slothful and useless **because** they don\\\u0027t do the jobs they should be doing). When my father was a young boy (a minor and a teenager) he worked in the fields picking and boxing fruit, he worked in canneries, he worked at gas stations pumping gas and washing windshields, and he did jobs which today are rarely ever done by young Americans anymore. I have done some of these jobs myself. You are very right about that one thing, yes this degradation of our society is our fault. We have taught our children, both through law and example, that they don\\\u0027t need to work or do anything. However this is not purely our fault, for some of the blame also falls upon those who flood those entry level job markets, making it next to impossible for significant numbers of young Americans to enter into those jobs. Minimum wages have also shot us in the foot, those jobs should be met by young people who are not fully responsible for their own support, but they aren\\\u0027t being filled by these young people and are being filled by those who do have to support themselves, thus wages \u0027have\u0027 to go higher, thereby increasing costs for consumers and decreasing available jobs as companies trim off positions to save money.\n\nLanguage is the most important part of any culture, without it one cannot ever really come to appreciate its facets fully. Thus when someone does not speak English in America, they don\\\u0027t really learn American culture either, nor do they interact with Americans particularly much. In many cases they simply gravitate to \u0027international\u0027 communities within America where everyone speaks their language and is party to their customs, and thus isolating themselves from the country they are in. America was not meant to be that at all, thus it is disrespectful to the founders of America, my ancestors, for them to be doing that. \n\nIt is a lot like a person going to a school, who was also accepted into the school with the help of one of its professors, with a free ride for which the rules are that they will attend all classes, earn a 3.0 or higher, and that they will be socially active, who then proceeds to miss most classes, fail on a regular basis, and live in their dorm away from all social interaction. Such actions are obviously disrespectful (right?) to the professor who helped them get there, to the institution that gave them a free ride, and to the rules that were laid down for them to follow.\n\nIt is true that I do have a tendency to say things that can be hurtful (you aren\\\u0027t the first person by any means to say that), and this is a problem that I have that is inexcusable and is also one of the main reasons I end up having to live my life away from most people (like that\\\u0027s obvious here). It is actually part of who I am, I won\\\u0027t explain that but it is true. In my defense, though, I must say that the policy or rule or whatever you want to call it (the first page of the forum seems to pretty clear concerning the nature of postings of non-English content in the description of the International forum) that we use English on the forums is the reason that I am even talking about any of this at all. My comments had nothing to do with where they were from (they did not mean to anyway).\n\nPlease take what I say with an un-healthfully large helping of sugar, it\\\u0027s meant to sound far sweeter than it apparently does when you read it.\n\n I have read and re-read all of the things I\\\u0027ve written, and with a few exceptions, I\\\u0027ve never really found what people find so upsetting in my writing. Sometimes people complain about my writing being too \u0027snooty\u0027 or proud, or whatever negative adjective that is most common today, because of my use of long and complicated words, phrases, and sentences. Personally, though, I believe that clarity is best served by the utilization of many words and phrases that are craftily arranged to paint the picture of one\\\u0027s thoughts. I also tend to write like this more when I am tired (I often wonder why I make my life harder when I am tired)... In any case, I apologize for my offenses, and as a Christian I hope you will be able to forgive me."},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T06:30:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I agree with you, i hate it when immigrants come not knowing english, or all they know sis panish and they coem here to work and make no effort to learn english.\n\nYeah...\n\n![national_language.jpg](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/national_language.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"socket7","CreatedById":3956,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T06:39:02Z","Content":"[mod]AAAAND we\u0027re done here.
