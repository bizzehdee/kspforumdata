Here are the three most produced versions, in KSP replica: T-34 1940, T-34 1942, and T-34-85.**\n\n**All Three come with rotating turret (just decouple from the body and switch to it). Make sure to use forward-facing docking ports to \u0022control from here\u0022, since the control pods are often the wrong way around. Automatically set to have the middle three wheels non-operationall to allow high-speed turning.
