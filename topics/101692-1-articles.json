I think for challenges the important thing is to read into the OP\u0027s intent as much as the \u0027letter of the law\u0027--this is KSP not Space Munchkin! For example if the challenge is \u0022make the highest flying air-breathing ship you can\u0022, there is a huge difference in capability between ships that attempt a realistic-looking air system and ones that stack 60 radial intakes on top of each other...inside a cargo bay...with a nuclear engine embedded in the center. Of course if the challenge seems aimed to encourage abuse/clipping, and that\u0027s what makes the challenge fun, then by all means go nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
