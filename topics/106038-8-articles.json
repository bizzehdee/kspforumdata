Bugs in any release are more or less inevitable, but when major gameplay-affecting bugs that show themselves within 10 minutes make it into the release (especially one as significant as 1.0), there\u0027s something wrong with the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad that Squad is dedicated to supporting this game and pushing out hotfixes, but as Aerindel said, they shouldn\u0027t have been necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Yemo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery much this as well.

If this had been just another early access release, there would still have been some complaints for the things the hotfixes addressed, but by and large it would have been a very positive update because the new aero and heating system especially really addressed some of the things missing from this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you take 1.0 to mean that the game is \u0022finished\u0022, then it is easy to see why so many people are frustrated.

What they need to do is keep the Experimentals and Q\u0026amp;A teams more or less as they are, but leverage the Beta option on Steam more effectively. After the Experimentals and Q\u0026amp;A teams have at the game, use the Betas tab in Steam to release a \u0022Pre-Release\u0022 build based on that smaller team\u0027s feedback. This build is open to the whole community, but doesn\u0027t force anyone, at least for the moment, to use it. Anyone who is interested opts in to the Beta, plays it, and provides feedback on a public Beta Builds forum that the devs watch closely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinecraft, Project Zomboid, StarMade, Subnautica and other games use a system just like this and their respective communities really appreciate it. Not sure why Squad doesn\u0027t--maybe it will \u0022delay\u0022 the process of updating? But Squad is independent. They make their own deadlines and like Blizzard can say to the community \u0022It\u0027s done when it\u0027s done, now test this sucker for as long as you can.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way there is an ever-increasing pool of testers from truly all segments of the KSP community critiquing the game. At least for me, things like the 1.0 release heatshield bug, while annoying and seemingly obvious, aren\u0027t the issue--it could have been an honest mistake toggling a flag that shouldn\u0027t have been toggled while addressing other Q\u0026amp;A feedback literally moments before pushing the update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is huge balance revisions that increase the drag for every part across the board that can or have the potential to render whole fleets of rockets useless across the entire player-base with no warning. The Steam Beta tab feature is a way to work around that while experimenting with the balancing of features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHot-fixes and bug fixes are good...across the board gameplay balances implemented with no discussion (even if they are marketed as \u0022fixes\u0022 or provide a \u0022better\u0022 game) are not so much, regardless of whether or not it takes the game in a favorable dimension. If Mojang for example wanted to \u0022fix\u0022 building in Minecraft by incorporating a physics based structural integrity simulation, while making people craft a \u0022cement\u0022 item to make placed blocks stick together if they don\u0027t have direct contact with the ground (i.e. no more floating houses in the sky), the game might be more fun because it involves management of another resource and also make the game more \u0022realistic\u0022. However, whole structures across the entire player-base would come tumbling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMojang, however, before they implemented such a game-changing feature would release it during their opt-in Pre-Release build phase the whole Minecraft community can take part in. For some reason Squad makes similar game changing, uh...changes, but does not involve the community in this manner, using instead a very small group of players relative to the ever-expanding player-base.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T17:11:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scourge013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI gotta say that all you devs and testers are amazing.
