This is awesome since it lets me start ditching spent launchers. Already well on the way to a decent Kessler Syndrome. (mainly capsules, some 20-odd of them, that were ditched after carrying passengers to LKO) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put another few vessels into parking orbit. First transfer window is Moho which im gonna skip for now, it\u0027s a serious voyage that I traditionally have 0 luck with. Duna and Jool are next up, only days apart, so i\u0027m building both flotillas at the same time. Station/Hab from the first shots is headed to Low Duna Orbit. It\u0027s accompanied by a manned sat-carrier with enough unmanned sats to build a complete coverage network round Duna, along with a kethane mapper to send to Ike. The relay sats are designed to sit a bit below synchronous orbit, but theres enough to daisy-chain the signal anyway, they carry dishes so this should let me link the Kerbin system to the Duna system. The pilot of the satellite carrier will join the habitants of the Hab once his job is complete. There is also now an extraplanetary launchpad in LKO, it\u0027s probably headed to Duna/Ike with the first waves of ships, to await in orbit there until resources have been identified and a colony-site selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approaching Jool window also offers a great opportunity to begin with our plans for Laythe. As the most emminantly suited to colonisation we have big plans for this world. Slated for this first departure window are a Hab (similar to the Duna one above, but with extra dV in the transfer stage), 2x Surface base components (mainly habitation and power) and a manned kethane scanner sat. The KSC boffins havent yet cracked a way to deliver a full RT2 network to Laythe as they plan to do with Duna, hence the manned satellite for Laythe, pilot will join the Hab population when his job is done. I\u0027m doing Laythe first since I feel happy delivering Kerbals there with minimal facilities. Since they have a breathable atmosphere I dont need to add loads of space to simulate life-support. They just need shelter and power. Surface bases elsewhere are going to hold fewer kerbals/physical \u0027seat\u0027 than this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile all is not quiet in the Kerbin system itself. We launched a large lko space-station to act as a departure point, this lets us dodge adding capsules to future launches to carry the Kerbonauts through the atmosphere, the craft instead launch with only their primary pilot or under drone control and fill up on refugees at the station. Several \u0027bus-class\u0027 ssto shuttles have been pressed into service ferrying kerbals up to the station as fast as we can push them through the astronaut training complex. It\u0027s spam-in-a-can on the station, with 75% of seats taken, but nobody is going to be there for more than a week, so they can deal with it for now. I also want all my emigrants to be in contact with KSC through the RT2 mod, cant abandon people to madness.
