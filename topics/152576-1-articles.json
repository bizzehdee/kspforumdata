I know to make them, but I find it very hard to make the thrust curves realistic, or apply them to real world solid rocket motors. My current process is to add a bunch of lines with random numbers, test in-game, change the numbers, restart KSP, change the numbers, repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurely there is a much better and time-saving way of doing this? The Realism Overhaul guys seems to have this down to a science, seeing as their thrustcurve numbers are scary specific. Is there a tool that can emulate and generate exact numbers? I am trying to make this curve into a realistic thrustcurve in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Mk3_S200_3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_1/India/LVM3/Gallery/Mk3_S200_3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is a way to somehow copy this curve with these values and have them generated into numbers that can be copy/pasted into a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E file, I would love to know how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T12:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/75187-unity-floatcurve-editor-10/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
