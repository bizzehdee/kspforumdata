I found a craft file on KerbalX for the Aurora from said game, so I decided to make my own version of the start of the game. Also, yes, the captain\u0027s name is Chara, because that\u0027s just what I named this specific kerbal in this save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022This is the Aurora to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. We\u0027re approaching Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.

We\u0027re coming in towards Kerbin too fast - an estimated 3600 meters per second according to my speedometer! I\u0027m going to eject myself out the back of the ship with my escape pod! Hold on tight!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe quickly gets\u00A0out of her cupola module inside the ship and runs\u00A0down the corridor to her personal escape pod. It was not much - merely a small lander pod attached to an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank with some thrusters. It only worked in zero G, but it\u0027d have to do. And the ship wasn\u0027t in the atmosphere yet - once it was, Chara could no longer use the escape pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Undocking in 3. 2. 1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pod undocks from the port inside the ship. Chara skillfully maneuvers the pod out of one of the holes in the back using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. She keeps herself within viewing distance of the Aurora in order to maintain radio contact, but stays far enough away to be safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iADvZ77.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iADvZ77.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022This is captain Dreemurr of the Aurora. We\u0027re coming in too hot. I have ejected myself from the ship in my escape pod. This will be a wild ride. Please, get a rescue team out there as soon as possible,\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E Chara shouts over the mic before all radio contact fizzles out, as the ships begin to enter the atmosphere.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Aurora... it\u0027s out of control!

Sorry, my writing is terrible, I\u0027m better at doing roleplays on Amino than I am at writing stories. The other day, I found that Aurora craft file on KerbalX, and chose to have fun recreating the Aurora\u0027s crash at the start of Subnautica. Many screenshots were taken, but these were just my favorites. I wrote the story around the screenshots. Again, I know the writing is terrible. But, it\u0027s 9 PM on a school night, and I just can\u0027t think right now. After all, the most important part of this is the screenshots!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, the craft file can be found here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Lockatello/Aurora-Beta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Lockatello/Aurora-Beta\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The escape pod and corridors (the metal plating seen in some shots) were my personal modifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-24T04:38:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2018 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by UnionPacific1983WP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-24T05:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSubnautica is one of my favorite youtube games.
