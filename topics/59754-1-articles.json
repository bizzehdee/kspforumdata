A larger impact could create a heatwave that would incinerate pretty much everything on the surface. The smoke and fallout would create a nuclear winter that would last for several years.

Bury as much as we can as deep as we can: nuclear plants, shelters, food supplies, biological specimens, communication and coordination centers, art and cultural stuff, and as much equipment as possible to get started when it\u0027s over.
