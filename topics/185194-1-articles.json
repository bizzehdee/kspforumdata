IMO, it should perform even better at \u0026gt;mach 1 than the panther in dry mode. A no bypass turbofan = a turbojet. The Juno already suffers from the poor fuel efficiency, it should at least get some better high speed performance. It could help the niche of tiny 0.625m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTo\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes. I\u0027m also finding myself using it more with BG, such as 4 of them on swivels as a faux harrier. Before I mostly overlooked its poor stats like I overlooked the flea\u0027s: its something for early career, but not much more.... but I don\u0027t think parts should be made like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we\u0027re at it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*** The skiff nerf was too hard... a 60% increase in mass? that\u0027s rough. I propose giving it a 15% increase in thrust to offset such a huge nerf (if it needed such a nerf, why was it released with those stats in the first place?). It seems like its intended as a launch vehicle 2nd stage, but its thrust/cross section ratio is pretty bad. I do sort of envision its role as competeing with the skipper, unfortunately (much like mainsail vs mastadon)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*** Wolfhound still needs nerfing.

This engine seems to fill a role similar to the poodle. I suggest nerfing its Isp down to 350, at most 355, lower gimbal to just 1 degree, remove the alternator, reduce impact tolerance to 5 m/s, and make it lower weight than the poodle with the same thrust - Make it a lightweight, barebones version of the poodle.

Certainly it seems more balancing. Besides tiny Eve stages (otherwise thrust is to low and vectors, mammoths and Twin boar\u0027s are of choice) aerospikes are usually spent on eve rocket space planes or Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTo\u003C/abbr\u003E Hybrid space planes so this tweak will allow aerospike configurations to allow more versatility in Eve and Kerbin rocket/spaceplanes and to my liking the current model leaves little trickery to make full use of the aerospike.

As you say these early rocket engines become obsolete, however they do function as proper 1.25m engines. Squad is to assume people would only use 1,875m, 2,5m and 3.75m engines on later techs or sandbox so they keep the 1.25m engines low tech (apart form the Vector which is \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

This certainly is a mistake. Without further adding parts a part upgrade function to upgrade early to mid tech parts to higher performance values seems gamey and understanding. Most of the early to mid tech engines fulfill a key role on 1.25m stacks and they are left to 3 choices mostly, the Terrier, Swivel and the Reliant. Only the Terrier seems to have proper performance \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E wise to be considered mid/high tech but only in vacuum so a part upgrade to boost it\u0027s Sea level \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E somewhat should be a gamey part upgrade if I say so. It would never ruin the entirety of the game as any later tech parts would still be better suited. A Terrier would then be better suited as a mid/high atmospheric 2nd stage engine with a little more weight perhaps of 0.65Ton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-08T22:01:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2019 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T20:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuno (20kN) is insanely powerful compared to the real engine it\u0027s based on which is Jumo 004 (about 8kN).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
