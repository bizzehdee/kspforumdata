I\u0027m thinking that could save some marginal design cases.\n\nAnd, with the extra TWR jets give (if only because they are lighter), you can push over 1km/s lower, so even if they give out earlier (I still have them usually lit with decent thrust until 20kms), you end up at pretty much the same speed when the rockets take over.

You need such a kick in the arse on airbreathers that you can get a decent time to apoapsis (and the apoapsis itself over the draggier parts of the atmosphere) before the jets give out. That means about 1,100-1,200m/s before 20kms, and an ascent so shallow you won\u0027t see the temperature overlays over the heat effects themselves. This puppy has TWR like 2.5 on turbojets...

Your closed-cycle design is easily one of the best, but I don\u0027t think a liquid-only SSTO is going anywhere.\n\nActually, you quoted me saying:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rapier-Nuclear hybrids are good, because you can go very heavy on the liquid fuel, without worrying about carrying a lot of useless mass in orbit.\n\nANd you said:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have yet to see a nuclear SSTO design that surpasses...\n\nThere was no mention of \u0022only\u0022 when calling it a nuclear design. In fact, I initially interpreted your statements as comparing SSTOs to conventional rockets... Ie the disintegrating totempoles.\n\nThat you were quoting me mentioning a nuclear-rapier design which implicitly used rapiers in closed cycle (\u0022very heavy on the liquid fuel\u0022 is not \u0022only liquid fuel\u0022, and implies that some oxidizer would be carried for the rapiers).\n\nSo I thought you were saying that LV-Ns were more weight than they are worth... which for payload purposes, I sort of agree with... because my design gets basically the same fraction to LKO with or without them... Obviously once in orbit though, its very nice to have LV-Ns and mk3 liquid fuel fusalages.\n\nRune: Yes, intake air also determines it... but if altitude is held constant, as you accelerate from a standstil to mach 1, the rapier\u0027s thrust generally stays steady at first, and then increases.\n\nSo it is incorrect to say that thrust decreases as you approach mach 1.\n\nThrust decreases as intake air runs out.\n\nThrus decreases as you move away from mach 3.75\n\nThrust decreases as the atmospheric pressure drops.\n\nThrust does not decrease when approching mach 1 from below mach 1."},{"CreatedByName":"Sattorin","CreatedById":119076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T13:32:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, you quoted me saying:\n\nYeah, I misinterpreted you there, sorry!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T13:51:17Z","Content":"It\u0027s actually not thrust, it\u0027s heat and altitude/ angle you have to face and work into your concept.\n\nI have a spaceplane SSTO (red tank lifting) with a 29% payload ratio, that stalls at 9k and 280 m/s, if I mess up.\n\nOn the other hand I\u0027m able to load the 10 Rapiers to 450 kN of thrust each, making me burn up in the atmo.\n\nWhen I do everything right, I get up to 350 kN thrust, 1275 m/s at 20k alt max and a nice 80 km orbit, with a full red tank in the cargo bay and enough fuel to land at KSC.\n\nIt\u0027s more technical and physical now, than it was in 0.9."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:23:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even to Moho?\n\nYou can top up at Gilly, that should leave you with 1,500m/s, plus about 1,500 more that you used to get to LKO, leaving you 3km/s to play with at a significantly lower orbit than Kerbin\u0027s. Then again, landing on Moho alone from escape velocity will eat around a km/s, so... maaaybe (if you are a god with transfers and nail Moho just in a node)? A flyby for sure, that should be peanuts.\n\nRune. Then again, with multiple gravity assists (which I can\u0027t plan for the life of me) everything is possible, you could use Moho to circularize at Moho\u0027s orbit, and yes I know that sounds wrong.
