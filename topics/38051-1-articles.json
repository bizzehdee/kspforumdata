No doubt there are a lot of introductions these days thanks to the Steam Sale (where I got my copy, too), so I\u0027ll keep it short - hoping to have a nice time here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do, however, want to thanks the developers. I\u0027ve been a gamer for decades - certainly not the oldest on this board, but well above average. Very few games these days make me forget time when playing, fewer still evoke this magical sense of wonder and exploration that gaming should be about in the first place. KSP is such a game. It\u0027s wonderful, and I hope it\u0027ll go places in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: Thanks to the devs, hello to the community, and sorry to all the Kerbonauts I\u0027ve already sacrificed for the greater good of Kerbalkind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orion314","CreatedById":75327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T04:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike you, got my Steam copy today, and I haven\u0027t had the hook in me in a very long time for games I love.
