What I also saw was that they\u0027re planning to install SuperDraco engines, which produce huge amounts of thrust. Now, what I can\u0027t work out from any articles is whether this is in addition to, or as a replacement for, the Draco thrusters?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the thrust is so high on the SuperDracos that it can be used as part of an LES, my thought was that there\u0027s no way these can be used for fine orbital control, but then it does mention that it has full throttle control and multiple reignition facilty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know one way or another, and have any sources for verification?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esources: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/04/04/draco-thrusters\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spacex.com/news/2013/04/04/draco-thrusters\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonRider\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonRider\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T13:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAddition to. SuperDracos are designed to produce axial thrust. That\u0027s all you need for landings, so long as you can throttle them individually, but it won\u0027t do for docking. Similarly, you aren\u0027t going to be able to throttle down 120,000lb engine to anything suitable for precise docking maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T13:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers, that\u0027s what I was thinking, I just couldn\u0027t be certain!
