That looks nice. A clamshell cargo bay looks better than I thought it would. Must be your design skills. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022) (I had been envisioning 4x petal doors for some reason.) Any possibility of one more that looks kinda like your hypersonic nose cone? (Basically having a long and short version. Also, for the sleekness ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022))\n\nThe ramp was just something I had to mention because of another thread. The MK2 profile doesn\u0027t lend itself all too well to a ramp due to the size. A cargo bay nose/tail cone would work better overall.\n\nAs for the fairing: LoL ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022) I find that animation amusing. Anyway, I figured there\u0027d be complications with the MK2 profile versus a circular one for fairing. Though to be honest, I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d actually attempt it. The main reason I asked for one was because of the changes made to the stock fairings allowing easy stacked fairing designs. I keep wanting to make MK2 stack designs using the Mk2 decoupler, but they never look right. (Though that\u0027s mainly due to the relative lack of MK2 profile engines that can be stacked.)\n\nWell, whether you decide to go through with it or not, your attempt is very much appreciated. At least I got a funny gif out of it, if nothing else.\n\nRegarding wings: That\u0027s a pity, though understandable. I just think wings could use some variety/expansion at the MK2 scale. Though I guess it\u0027s mostly because I dislike clipping wing segments together. (The flicking textures it what gets me.) Well, no matter. The cargo bay made my day."},{"CreatedByName":"Benji13","CreatedById":162932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T07:38:31Z","Content":"Does this pack include a mk2 Xenon tank?
