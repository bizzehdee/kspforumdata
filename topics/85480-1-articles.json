Have tried removing some mods but it can be intermittent so I dont really know if I have ever fixed it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how to reproduce it or what could be causing it... I\u0027ve tried totally reinstalling ksp and the mods about 3 times now and each time with slightly less mods, but nothing has helped\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem I get is that I start up everything is good build something doesn\u0027t matter which bay I use. then play the game can go to the map fine and stuff. then when I want to go back to the space centre all I get is a view of space it, it looks as if the camera has gotten stuck in space or something and I can\u0027t select any of the buildings and quitting to the main menu doesn\u0027t help as If I reload it just goes back to the same thing. I have to quit completely out and then restart ksp and everything is back to normal until I switch back to a flight or launch a new flight the problem happens again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it might have been the Lazor system or Protractor cause it seemed to happen 100% of the time after I used these modules for planetary interception and stuff, but I had it occur without those even installed so not sure what\u0027s going on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of what my KSC looks like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vBJds4C.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/vBJds4C.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the ksp log \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/lyxvo1nstzwvv2e/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lyxvo1nstzwvv2e/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
