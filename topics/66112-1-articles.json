ASL is altitude above sea level which has nothing to do with thrust. As for TWR it\u0027s a calculation based on the engine\u0027s thrust (kN), the rocket\u0027s total mass (t) and the planet or moon\u0027s gravity (m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou start out with the engines thrust or total thrust if you have several engines. If you are using a LV-T45 engine you\u0027ll have 200 kN of thrust under ideal conditions (this information is shown on the tooltip). You then divide that by the total mass of the rocket. If I attach the engine to one of those tall skinny T800 fuel tanks and then put one of the 3 man Mk1-2 pods on top the total weight of my rocket would be 10 tons, so 200 / 10 = 20. Then divide by the gravity of the planet or moon you are on. You can find the gravity by looking on the Wiki or using the GravMax instrument. Kerbin has a surface gravity of 9.81 m/s. 20 / 9.81 = 2.04. So my TWR is 2.04 which mean I will be able to lift off on Kerbin (if it was less then 1 then I would be putting out less force then the gravity pulling me down and gravity would win).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T03:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo simplify it, If your TWR was 1.5, You could overcome gravity from the surface Kerbin, which Scott Manley has stated, your TWR needs to be 1 or more to lift of from Kerbin.
