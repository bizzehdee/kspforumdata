But I will try to.\n\nThe idea with the rotation rates of asteroids defined in aa cfg is nice, but not very necessary. The rates are quite slow to still support docking. Also in reality, the rotation is indeed very slow, they just break apart because asteroids are not rock-solid but more like wet sand sticking together when it comes to stability. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:47:43Z","Content":"This mod is sooo awesome and works perfectly! thank you so much for that amazing piece of work!"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:04:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This mod is sooo awesome and works perfectly! thank you so much for that amazing piece of work!\n\nI am very happy to hear that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:18:42Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been watching this since you posted in the old thread about it.
