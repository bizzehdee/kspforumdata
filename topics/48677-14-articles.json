Think about this before you circularize your craft into a low orbit of a foreign body: enter SOI at a low periaps, only burn as much insertion as is needed to establish a steep elliptical orbit, then do your experiments both at low periaps and high apoaps. It helps tremendously to have a load of battery packs (or solar panels) at this point for data transfer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you can continue by either circularizing a low orbit / land at low fuel cost by burning at low velocity apoaps / escape orbit for your next stop by burning economically at your high velocity periaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took my lightweight unmanned probe on a tour around Mun, Minmus and then out of Kerbal SOI this way, raking in hundreds and hundreds of science points.

Which means a much heavier and costly launch assembly. You will have to do with communications, and those apply huge penalties to the number of Science Points you gather.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is no money or parts availability limit right now. I doubt you will start with enough Kerbucks to build a monster stack that can reach Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some things that make life a bit too easy are probably going to be fixed. Like directly transmitting data from the Farside of the Mun without using relay communication satellites (how does those radio waves get through the Mun ?!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The unlimited supply of Kerbonauts is not going to last forever. And I guess they will have to rest between missions, which will require a team if you want to launch missions continuously. Now you can do anything with Jeb only, but even that heroic guy has the right to sleep from time to time, not even speaking of vacations. Also, here again, they are kindly working for free now (and a few snacks), but this isn\u0027t going to last...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, really, work in progress, and the fact I already like what I see now makes me very optimistic for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brdavis","CreatedById":88788,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T13:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, first post... I\u0027ve not been playing long (like, about 2 weeks) and then 0.22 comes out. So, first... Wow. I\u0027m already using the Demo 0.21 version in teaching university-level physics. And loving it. Now if I just didn\u0027t need to sleep... can we add that to the research tree?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree things I\u0027ve noticed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The new SAS does seem to have some issues, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s the SAS or the way I\u0027ve been treating it previously (not enough experience). Having it auto-set the mode (so I don\u0027t have to keep tapping \u0022F\u0022 to unlock it and change position) seems to be a problem (overshoot/undershoot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The LV-909 doesn\u0027t produce power... Did I just completely miss that in my previous experience, only noticing it now when power (for transmission of data) is so critical?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I still have trouble with \u0022phantom throttle\u0022 - throttle off, hit \u0022esc\u0022 to pause, come back later, unease... and the engine throttles back to full. Hitting \u0022X\u0022 at this point cuts the engine, after which is mysteriously just ramps right back up to 100%. Throttling down to zero will shut it off again, but \u0022X\u0022 will not in this mode. Is this just me, or a known problem (had it on 0.21 as well). Running under OSX (with nothing else running)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thought on the science value transmitted vs. \u0022hard returned\u0022 (but not too hard)... yeah, it\u0027s a little odd. I *want* to radio data back, because the #1 rule is usually \u0022let the next guy know what killed you\u0022 - the actual sample is better, but as it stands there\u0027s not a lot of reason to \u0022back up\u0022 these things with transmission. Maybe have the transmission give you 70% (or higher... I agree things like thermometer records should be 100%), and you gain an additional 30% if (not when) you land?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESleep is for the weak, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrian Davis\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T13:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a structured path that Career mode offers is probably of more use to someone who is new to the game, and probably presents more of a challenge to an inexperienced player.

This is probably due to the fact that I am taking my time and relearning the game from scratch.

I\u0027m really enjoying having to learn how to design simple rockets again, and how to use the parts available in unorthidox ways to achieve desired results.
