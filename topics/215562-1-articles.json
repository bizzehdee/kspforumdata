Sorry for my English, I\u0027m using google translator. I hope he translates correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that optimization is extremely important for KSP 2, and that everyone really wants it, has long been known to everyone. But I want to touch on a more specific topic. Where exactly is the very border when optimization can be considered sufficient?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally think that optimization should be such that owners of not the most top-end computers can build orbital stations, planetary bases or interstellar motherships from 1500-2000 parts without a critical FPS drop. Someone will say that I\u0027ve lost my mind, but ... we really are all waiting for interplanetary flights and colonization, aren\u0027t we? And how do you imagine a starship of 50-200 parts? In my opinion it would be a rather dull sight. In the first part, with mods for interstellar flights, a decent interstellar ship cost me about 1200-1500 parts. And yes, I played with 3-5 fps. In CPS 2, with such crafts, there should be at least 25-30 fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many, many lovers of building complex, grandiose, large crafts. Yesterday I launched a rocket as close as possible to Saturn 5. With a lander and a command module. The craft consisted of 275 parts and I played with 7-11 fps. It\u0027s not bad. Before the release of the patch, it was even worse. But... it\u0027s only 275 parts. What happens if I want to build an orbital station with 1000 parts? As I liked to do in KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1200-1500 parts in crafting at 30 fps, I propose to make it the very bar to which we should strive to optimize the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother question is how to achieve this? I have a suggestion. But I suppose the developers may not like it, because. this will require a major overhaul of the game. Now all parts in crafting are physical. Those. each piece carries a rigid body component. I\u0027m right? It turns out that if a rocket consists of 300 parts, then during its flight the physics of 300 components is simultaneously calculated! And their interaction with each other! This is a performance disaster! And most importantly, this is absolutely not necessary for the game. It doesn\u0027t help the gameplay in any way. It just brings dangling, flexible rockets like sausages or jelly into the game. And he forces everyone to use uncomfortable struts that only irritate and spoil the appearance. Physics is not needed on every detail!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what is needed? We need one common rigidbody component for the whole craft! The rocket consists of 300 parts, but the rigidbody is one for everyone, common! If a stage separates from the rocket, it has its own rigidbody. Now we have two rigidbody on stage. Not 300, but only 2! If some part undocks, shoots back, falls off, gets damaged, overheats, it gets a rigidbody component and behaves like a separate physical body. But until the craft fell apart - it has only 1 rigidbody component for all its parts. Those who work in the Unity probably understand what I mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow should parts be attached to each other, if not with the help of physics? With the help of inheritance to each other! Everything is simple! As soon as the part should fall off from crafting, it ceases to be a child for crafting and the rigidbody is activated for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is it necessary? Productivity will increase not by percentages, but at times! Many times! It will be possible to create crafts from 1000-2000-5000 and even possibly 10,000 parts! And this is much more important for the game! Do you agree?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayers will be able to build epic interstellar ships, huge bases on planets, complex rockets with complex payloads, cool orbital stations!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moons","CreatedById":227067,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T22:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would defeat the whole purpose of even having\u00A0 advanced physics and things out of lots of parts? Honestly this would ruin the game - if your system cant handle things with lots of parts in KSP2 why not just play KSP1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what would even be the point of having 10.000 parts when none of them matter? With the same logic you could just build a rocket out of three parts and pretend it consists out of 10.000 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry but this would seriously reduce KSP1 to just another one of those spaceflight sims without any depth.
