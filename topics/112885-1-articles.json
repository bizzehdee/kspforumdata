Takes a while, and it\u0027s a heavily modded game with some big craft being constantly reverted for some fine tunings, but it\u0027s a third time since 18 hours ago. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it\u0027s contagious! xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a new issue, this has existed for ages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time you load or unload the VAB or SPH, memory usage increases. In heavily modded installs, this eventually causes a crash due to memory usage on Windows. This also occurs on other OS builds, but because they are lucky enough to have 64 bit builds, their memory usage is allowed to grow and does not cause crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bug has existed since at least version 0.21, I became very \u003Cem\u003Efond\u003C/em\u003E of it on my stream with KSPI, B9, and KW rocketry, Remote Tech, FAR, and Deadly Reentry with other various mods strewn about.

Yes, it once was a godsend, but now it doesn\u0027t help as much as you might think and there are other things you can try to get your system stable.
