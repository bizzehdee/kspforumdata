Specifically, I have polar orbiters doing gravity scans, which state 180 science value and a transmission value of 60%. I don\u0027t know if the numbers are wrong, or something else is at work, but I\u0027m getting 36, which is not 60% of 180. The second scan reads a value of 86.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is not that the specific numbers are either right or wrong, but that it\u0027s really important for them to make sense. Which they don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, a GPS minimap requiring a working satellite network would be awesome. More interlinked requirements result in more game in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T18:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a bug in the display of that specific science part\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
