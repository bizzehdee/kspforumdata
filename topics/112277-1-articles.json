I\u0027ve tried various lighting in Unity from diffuse to bumped specular (with a bumpmap) and I can\u0027t get my lighting right. This image is an early morning shot and you can see plainly where my parts connect. It\u0027s shaded in the rear and lit in the front. I\u0027m not so much worried about the \u0027wood\u0027 texture just yet, my question is, what am I doing wrong to get such uneven lighting.

I\u0027m still trying to get the hang of all this part modding stuff. All I can confirm now is that I have created parts before in Wings and the lighting worked fine. What seems to be happening is that when I connect the parts in the SPH, they\u0027re not getting joined into a single part for lighting purposes. I thot it might be my connection nodes but I\u0027ve gone over them and they look pretty good. I tried adding the \u0027rimFalloff\u0027 and that did nothing.
