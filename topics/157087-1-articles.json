After I was done, I wanted to go and look at what the total gains for the mission had been and see how much money, science, and rep I\u0027d gained. Unfortunately, the contracts archive only displays in alphabetical order, so I couldn\u0027t find the right ones. I\u0027d like to see some sorting tools added similar to those for the science archives (by celestial body and by type), as well as an option to display contracts in chronological order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-28T06:41:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2017 06:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Allocthonous\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-28T09:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, thank you.
