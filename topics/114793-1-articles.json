Don\u0027t forget to close it again afterwards, or you\u0027ll have it hanging open on the launch pad.\nYou can also right-click many other parts to adjust their stats - fuel in fuel tanks, engine thrust, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:57:36Z","Content":"A little suggestion. If you\u0027re planning to build a manned ship with just the capsule return, try to avoid o put scientific experiments inside. If you try to take the data from EVA, due to the bugged collision, you can lost your Kerbal in space or accidentally destroy your ship (solar panel most of times)."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T21:26:07Z","Content":"They\u0027re for getting things up to space and down from space in a drag-free heat-free manner.

By far my most common reason for using these things is that you have to go ridiculously far up the tech tree to get probe cores that are \u003E 0.625m.\n\n\u003Crant\u003EThat just seems silly... seems like there should be a budget version of the big cores that give only the benefits of the low-tech things but just happen to be larger.\u003C/rant\u003E\n\nAnyway, the service bay gives an easy way to put small probe cores inline in a big rocket.\n\nAnother handy use is for lighting. I like to give my landers a couple of downward-pointing lights so I can see the surface better when landing (especially if there\u0027s any chance I need to land at night). I like to mount a couple of lights inside a service bay, then go into the \u0022Action Groups\u0022 UI and tie the bay\u0027s \u0022toggle\u0022 action to Lights. It works like a charm: when I turn on the craft\u0027s lights, the bay swings open. When I turn them off, it swings shut again."},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:38:52Z","Content":"Also, don\u0027t put things too close to the bay, radially.
