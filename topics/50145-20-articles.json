No worries.\u003Cp\u003ESecond, a question regarding contracts on other celestial bodies? Is it necessary to build another whole station around mun and minmus (for instance) to complete contracts for those locations? Or can I just move my Kerbin station? Assuming that I have enough time on my contract term to complete the science requirements - and max the basic science available for low and high orbits - of course. I\u0027m hoping I can move it, since the science mode (part that does the experiment) is the required component that needs to be newly launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not necessary to build another station.
