They then go on to have a bit of epiphany about the notion that a young star system\u00A0 might be full of ringed planets, and that this is something that has never been explored in popular media. As the scene cut to black, I couldn\u0027t help but start thinking that one of the systems we will be able to travel too is going to be young. What\u0027s that going to mean? I grant that, fueled by my excitement for KSP2, I could be reading into these connections way too much. But by the same token, the idea that the \u003Cem\u003Eage of a system\u003C/em\u003E is something that could affect its composition is not something that had ever dawned on me, and now I can\u0027t help but start thinking of all the different effects this could have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of a sudden I\u0027m starting to wonder what other types of systems we could travel too...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T15:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope we see young systems, dead systems, and anomalous systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DVQuill","CreatedById":193797,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T16:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223960059\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201961\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221619279935\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206057\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PlutoISaPlanet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, PlutoISaPlanet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope we see young systems, dead systems, and anomalous systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about dead systems too.
