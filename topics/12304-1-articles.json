This is due to the aircraft extreme maneuverability, as well as its cruising altitude and speed, being 13,000 meters and 490 m/s, respectively. The aircraft is also extremely safe, and has a very long range for a vessel of such a role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a payload, it can fly with up to four droptanks, or twelve missiles, or ten missiles and two droptanks, or an empty load, or six bombs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of an unrecoverable stall, the aircraft can eject the cockpit with two parachutes for a safe landing, almost always ensuring crew safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum of the demo flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/TWCgP#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/TWCgP#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: NovaPunch (most recent), Modular Missiles Pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T00:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can fit in a lot more missiles unto something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook how much I fit on this old fighter I made:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/434/screenshot46h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot46h.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/112/screenshot33c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot33c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/6842/screenshot32yr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32yr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Wasteland","CreatedById":14093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T00:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the engines on those projectiles falling supposed to fall.
