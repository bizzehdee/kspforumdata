I appreciate all of the help that I\u0027ve gotten so far, but honestly this has been the most frustrating part of the whole process to try and figure out, and I am stuck xD. I have seen that others have added their spec layers as a mask? I tried this but with no visible changes in Unity. If someone could explicitly list how to go about adding the spec map that would be awesome. I feel as though it should be something really simple and I am just missing a detail somewhere..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my setup in gimp so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/KHIj0jf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KHIj0jf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-03T00:08:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T10:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECopy the group, collapse the group into a single layer, hide everything else and apply the mask.

If you did it right then your color map will be mostly transparent (it\u0027ll look really faded).
