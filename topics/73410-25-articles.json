I dunno if this works at all, I tossed it together really fast. But your early TL engines won\u0027t throttle, and your late engines will throttle down to around 10%. This only affects L, L\u002B, U, U\u002B, and O engines. If it works, let me know.

But now, RealPlume is a \u0022separate\u0022 mod. But, there are only configs for RO engines. Same idea as RF\u0027s engine configs. So, it\u0027d make perfect sense to come up with some Stockalike RealPlume configs. If anyone would be willing to help build them, I\u0027d appreciate it. At current count, I have 38 engines in my app which all could use a plume config. There are also a few dozen that are config-ed up by the community (thanks again all!) but I haven\u0027t ported into the app, or in some cases I can\u0027t like for SpaceY which has very special engines. So doing them all would be a very long process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this should be in Stockalike, or be a separate thing. Technically, RealPlume could be used in a straight stock environment since it\u0027s just a visual addition, and it\u0027s not even tied to Real Fuels specifically. So probably separate. But it would dovetail nicely with these engine configs.

Go contribute there, I say. No need to have competing sets. Thanks for the tip, Tellion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathanKell kindly put a switch in for ullage and ignitions, so those are switchable by default in RF. Throttle is dictated by the engine config, so not really sure there would be an easy switch. I can probably release a throttle config or something to add throttle constraints, or the reverse to remove them. Honestly the config to remove throttle would be much easier. Good idea on that one, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
