Stock parts are the somewhat-worn-out plain LEGOs that you\u0027re given: no really fancy bits, just the regular stuff. Mods bring in all manners of fancy LEGOs, but they cost more (they may cause problems with your install or slow the game down). If someone can create a masterpiece with the plain LEGOs, I don\u0027t think it detracts from all of the masterpieces made with the fancy bits, but it does take more work and patience and creativity to work with the plain LEGOs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally give \u002BRep to stock craft, mostly, but if it\u0027s obvious that a modded craft took a lot of work and creativity, I\u0027m happy to give it rep as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Upsilon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(P.S.
