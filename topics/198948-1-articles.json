This \u0027Add-On\u0027 forum section seems as busy as I\u0027ve ever seen it. Quite a feat of having such a robust community considering how long KSP has been around. There also seems to be a resurgence of modders of older mods coming back to tackle development once again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was away from the forums for most of 2019 and was wondering if mod development section ever got\u00A0quieter than \u0027normal\u0027?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u0027t ask me what normal is -\u00A0 I realise it\u0027s highly subjective \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly - just wanted to put out a general post to say thank-you to ALL the mod developers out there. This even includes those wont read this as they\u00A0haven\u0027t been on the forum in years. All that continuous development to add pieces/gameplay to KSP still inspires other people do further work to add to the game.\u00A0Shout-out to the Mod-father himself\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for keeping so many mods available.
