Always been preferring to revert. Now for the first time no looking back, no reverts and no recovery until all accepted contracts were challenged. Completing contracts without backing down so that even if something was not engineered quite correctly, mission requirements were to fulfill all listed contracts. Only problem is......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb DIES !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore science was required to begin contemplating a go for Mun landing. Another contract to complete was all that was in the way. The draft for the lander vehicle was completed and was to begin construction, but first another contract was to be done. Not enough struts and funky contract testing and Jeb\u0027s tenacity (he valiantly controlled the vehicle away from KSC VAB) but the abort sequence was faulty and staging was unresponsive, and Jeb crashed and died. Hearts were gloomy. Jeb only got to see the sonset twice. Needed to re-try, to restart anew (the new 0.24.1 patch came out so yah new start).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb dies again and again !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know exactly why I didn\u0027t see his grinning face as he must of stowed away under the command chair. Paying too close attention to contract completion during the initial flight could have been the cause. Jeb was discovered aboard a testing ship that was to be Probodobodyne controlled (to ensure safety). Only after getting to 40 km did the grinning and laughing Jeb got noticed. Managed to complete the contracts and returned back into the atmosphere, chutes opened and everything was looking great. Whew, problem averted, Jeb you made day four and the son was about to set. \u0027Lets do the Time warp x3 again\u0027. Altered physics snapped the lines and the chutes separated from the craft and smash went Jeb. Facepalm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb dies again and again and again !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter carefully completing contracts and step by step and millimetre by millimetre, finally the team was up for a testing of the Mun lander. The launch was a bit shaky but Bill and Bob were determined to get the ship to the Mun for its first test (again to ensure safety a Probodobodyne was to be implemented for the Mun landing). Meanwhile, Jeb was discussing with Gene about the party they had attended last week where all the girbals underthingies mysteriously floated, a new contract came up. Now Jeb was not impressed about the testing safety protocols (Jeb was temporarily out of rotation), and demanded to participate in this next contract. So after building the test bed for Jeb to gather some enviromentle ()\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E data. This straightforward setup was for Jeb to return to the capsule and let the Probodobodyne (to ensure safety) complete the rest of the contract. The runway and shores were overdue for testing and Jeb was successful with his data collection. Jeb safely back in his capsule ready for recovery and the Probodobodyne ready to complete another contract, the stage was staged, the vehicle separates, the engine fires up at 50% throttle and wait ... CUT ENGINES!! Jeb barbequed by LV-909 exhaust! Jeb. Capsule. Poof. FA$#hjsf%#%jhf%$;#sorryikilljeb%^66%#jklj@^\u0027;\u0027k%#!3gds56nj\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick. Click. Click. Click.

The Mun lander (2 kerbal landing Can can) has crashed a few times during testing. Since there is a short learning curve on the subject that the altimeter is not impact height the next vehicle will qualify. And then the Kerbed landing mission will be 1go or 0go. Jeb is still alive with multiple mission medals under his belt. Everyone is in active rotation (4 rescues). Space Station One is in 220 km orbit around Kerbin with science module support and has been receiving crew and supplies and transmitting data from probes returning from several landings on the Mun and Minimus. Jeb is excited. For this will be his Mun landing. Jeb has seen the Mun go full again and started the next path across the dark sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://vimeo.com/103042079\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe only man who makes no mistakes is the man who never does anything.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Theodore Roosevelt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe only kerbal that makes no mistakes is the kerbal who never has failurefun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Theodore Kermsevelt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-10T07:39:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2014 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
