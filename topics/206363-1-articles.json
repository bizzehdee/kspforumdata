Im sure by now this is all moot cause Intercept has its own plan but I find this fun so I tried to think through a way that habitation and life support could work in KSP2. LS especially is a bit of a controversial topic so Im going to do my best to convince people why it should be part of the game and how it could be implemented in a simplified, non-punishing fashion. First, a few principles:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Any habitation/LS system should have by default deathless, non-punishing consequences. As suggested by Nate if players screw up and don\u0027t manage things perfectly it shouldn\u0027t result in killing a whole crew or colony. Doing things right should give players bonuses to things like science and resource extraction rather than punishing players for less than efficient designs.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Habitation and LS should result in minimal fuss and management. After all, KSP is first and foremost a building and flying game, not a management sim. Systems should be as often as possible set-it-and-forget-it, and when moving vessels and supplies around players shouldn\u0027t be bogged down manually pumping a bunch of resources from place to place. The best way to do this is to limit the number of LS resources to begin with, ideally to 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Habitation and LS should have a consistent logic throughout the game, applicable both in vessels as well as colonies and stations. There will be differences of course because of access to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and relative changes in population, and there might be added bonuses that only larger stations and colonies can take advantage of, but the bedrock logic and functionality should remain the same. They should also be easy to assess at a glance with one value that could be displayed as a color coded flag in map mode or in a single-line per vessel list.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Habitation and LS should come with a built-in grace-period with zero consequences so that players early in the progression don\u0027t need to worry about it at all. It should only start to matter over longish periods in space, and then gradually, so that it becomes phased into more and more self-sufficient colonies and missions.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis begs the question though, why do we need habitation and LS to begin with? There are lots of reasons it could be important: it adds a sense of realism, it could balance other time-based mechanics, it makes players care about kerbals\u2019 well-being and makes them more central to the game, but those aren\u0027t the most important reason. The most important reason is that \u003Cem\u003Eall parts should have a function\u003C/em\u003E. Any part or module in a colony that doesn\u0027t have a direct value within the mechanics of the game is a waste of mass and resources and only exists for the purpose of role play. Now, role play is fun, most of us do it, and parts can have role play value too, but they shouldn\u0027t have role play value \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E. Every part of a vessel or colony should be an integrated component of a working machine with some function either structural, mechanical, or as a part of a resource chain. That same process of careful engineering that we apply on vessels in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to manage fuel and power and maneuverability and optimize \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E should\u003C/abbr\u003E feel similar to designing well-oiled colonies. Otherwise things like big hab domes and greenhouses are just empty window dressing. They\u0027ll be little more than non-vital, non-functional fluff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHappy Kerbals are productive Kerbals:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first goal I think is to boil both habitation and LS down to one manageable value: Happiness. If Kerbals have space and food and company they stay happy, and when they\u0027re happy they get a big bonus to science rewards and to resource harvesting and processing--lets say 2x.\u00A0 If they run out of food or are cooped up too long in tiny quarters their happiness begins to fall, eventually down to zero at which point they become \u0027miserable\u0027 and receive no bonus at all. This should probably come with an additional grace period of 10 days or so with no consequences so players don\u0027t have to worry about it at all on early journeys to the Mun and Minmus. Each active vessel would come with a Happiness value (100-0) and a timer for when it would begin to fall--when habitation or food would run out, whichever was less--and this value could easily be seen in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E so players could tweak up vessels and instantly see the resulting gains or reductions. To reset the vessel would need to dock with an adequately supplied colony or station.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHabitation Value:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first component to keeping kerbals happy for long periods of time would be adding habitation modules. Most of the modules we currently know--command modules, science labs, etc.--would have hab values less than 1 and sometimes 0. You\u0027d have to add special living quarters or rings to support larger numbers of kerbals. They should be combinable in any way you wish to give players flexibility so long as the Hab value exceeded the number of crew members. The same would be true on stations and colonies, so you always need enough space to keep your population happy and productive.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStaving off Loneliness:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut why would you bring more kerbals on longer missions? Because company keeps the blues away. If all your Kerbals have adequate habitation each additional kerbal doubles the length of time they\u0027ll remain happy. So 1 kerbal will be happy for 100 days, 2 for 200 days, 3 for 400 days, 4 for 800 days, 5 for 1600 days, etc. I think you can keep it loose like that, especially as you get into long journeys to Duna, Jool, and Eeloo. You\u0027ll also see that on a station or colony with 12\u002B Kerbals your hab would essentially be indefinite, in fact it might as well read \u0022infinite\u0022 after 10.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESnacks for the Journey:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith that taken care of there would be just one more variable: food. You could call it snacks or LS or whatever you wanted but there would be a single resource that ticks down over time based on the number of crew members, and when it runs out Kerabls enter their 10 day grace period and then start to become grumpy, angry, and finally miserable. They still function, you can still move them about and do EVAs, but they receive no bonuses and essentially perform half as well.\u00A0 I\u0027ve personally played a lot with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and I think its great. A lot of what I\u0027ve written here is similar. Honestly it\u0027s really easy to set up missions with plenty of supplies and I rarely worry about it. But it is \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E fussy, and though I love the mulch/fertilizer mechanic I think you could make it even easier. Any colony or vessel with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E could use greenhouses to convert a basic resource (ore, volatiles, whatever) into LS, which can then be pumped into tanks and loaded onto vessels in off-world VABs. The rate at which LS is consumed can be decreased with larger and heavier recyclers with more efficiency and greater capacity. There should even be some really heavy ones that are 100% efficient so you never really have to worry about depletion. They\u0027d be great for colonies and stations with big crews, but would be too heavy for most players to lug around on exploration missions where lighter recyclers would do the trick. This creates some interesting trade-offs and break-even points in design, but still gives players broad leeway in how they approach the problem of long-duration missions.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo thats my stab at it. Im sure there are issues and things I haven\u0027t thought of, but I think its a manageable, understandable, punishment-free way of handling this whole thing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-13T19:48:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2022 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-11T04:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI enjoy a\u00A0 light weight life support system for the extra gameplay, but in no way do I want to deal with Kerbal emotions and health.

I think making additional crew the central hab-time modifier does the job of encouraging larger crews more efficiently and effectively and you could actually remove skills and classes entirely. The thing is we\u0027re not just going to the Mun anymore, we might have hundreds of kerbals to deal with and the less we have to individually manage them the better. Either they\u0027re popping up randomly which leads to imbalances, or you have to individually assign them which could get old quick after the first 50 or so. Im kind of okay with all kerbals being Kerbonauts with the same set of skills that you can plug and play anywhere.

They wouldn\u0027t require additional LS or habitation right away, but as you increased capacity they\u0027d move into the general population and give players more personnel to work with. That way players wouldn\u0027t need to have a bunch of extra hab space in anticipation of Boom events, they could grow into it after the fact.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-12T01:54:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2022 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-13T06:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems to me this combination would make 2 simple but effective hooks for mods to extend without needing to reimplement that core game function.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupplies is a single resource you either have enough or not and things happen.
