Im trying to bring asteroids (yes hopefully plural) into orbit around the mun, but have been struggling to bring to get them to stay in orbit, they just keep shooting off into space. Even with kerbin i cant get them to stay, eventually they just end up escaping. I drag them from their orbit around the sun, into kerbin SOI then into Mun SOI and establish an orbit. Then I release them and after so long they just escape.........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a code/game related issue or am i doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Yay typos in title block.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Gotta love those ordbits......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the Mun has a somewhat unrealistic gravity model (SoI), then your or\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003Ed\u003C/span\u003Ebits shouldn\u0027t be spontaneously changing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the orbit comfortably above the highest point of the terrain?

That wouldn\u0027t be a stable orbit.

If so the rock may be geting cleaned up as debris. Leave a probe core attached to the rock via a claw and the cleanup routine should never touch the rock. Asside from that possibility there should never be a reason for the asteroids to just escape asumeing its truely a stable orbit. Particularly around mun as long as the PE has no chance of hiting the ground and the AP well withen the SOI it will stay there indefinitely. Around kerbin if your orbit is high enough to reach mun or minmus\u0027s SOI there is the chance of it geting kicked out of the system eventualy but otherwise a stable orbit for a ship will be a stable orbit for an asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T22:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you leave the klaw attached to the rocks they might glich out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T23:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould they still do that if you never revisit a rock till you want to make use of it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OopsThatNotWork","CreatedById":45740,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T23:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdk what i did differently, but finally got one to stay within Kerbin orbit and not vary orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I completely disconnected the capture craft, klaw and all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
