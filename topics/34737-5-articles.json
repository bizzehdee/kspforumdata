I\u0027m building an epic permanent base, based on the Hooligan Labs airships. It\u0027s destined for Eve (but will work on Laythe and, with minor modifications, Duna as well), have the capacity to house over 100 kerbal, will carry over a dozen rovers and airship based rovers (all usable manned or by remote, all electric, so fuel won\u0027t be an issue), the main base will be able to fly as an airship, but it can also drop off a ground base which can house around 30 kerbals. Some parts needs to be moveable and unloadable, that\u0027s why I need the sliders. Now, to get 300 tons or so in one piece to Eve, that\u0027s the challenge...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intidragon","CreatedById":67643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T08:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhm. . . sirkut. . . is this supposed to happen?

Really looking forward to this. Personally this is one part that I am looking forward to the most. Hoping to see 2-3 sizes of powered carriages with 6-8 lengths of gantry\u0027s or rails. Also would like to see these carriages in free floating form as well, Just like a free bearing or hinge. From their we can add more sizes from the cfg\u0027s our selves. I have an idea for a hydraulic ram based crane, with the ram at the bottom, and the sliding carriage on the top truss that will allow the ram to push the truss up and down while sliding on the rail. So if begging and pleading will work, let me know and I will do my best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx as always for your work and effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom Oregon....

Possibly make some sort of texture that explains visually how this would work. Think roller-coaster bearings, or that type of carriage. The rails should be slim and contain a small grove for the bearing carriage to ride in. The rails and carriage should be small in comparison to what its mounted to, and I am sure you will have different sizes. The length of the rails is the part we need the most, as 2 carriage sizes would work fine. I know.... I know.... I couldn\u0027t do that in Blender or any other type of creation software, but once the physics are finished, then you really should have something that highlights this type of part. It will become widely used I am sure, as the applications for this come on a very long list.
