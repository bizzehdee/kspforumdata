We had about 1.5 years between when comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring was discovered and its closest approach to Mars. For a brief period, it was thought that it would hit Mars. Why not imagine that a larger comet is discovered only 3 years before it would impact Earth? There\u0027s likely nothing we could do to stop something closing at 50 km/s with only three year\u0027s notice (Siding Spring was in a retrograde orbit, giving it a 50 km/s speed relative to Mars).

Next we would see governments across the world uniting, and space programs pooling their resources. In months launches would begin: rocket after rocket. Each carrying a nuke in front of the approaching comet - and detonating mere microseconds before the impact. Each ablating tons of rocks and ices, giving the comet a nudge and slowing her down - couple of milimeters per second each time. After two years of continuous bombing, change in velocity could be big enough to turn certain Doomsday into a breathstopping near miss. Finally, we would end with ecstatic humanity - united more than ever, convinced that Science and space exploration is a good thing.
