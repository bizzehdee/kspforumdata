I can\u0027t being to tell you how many missions I\u0027ve lost due to fallen Kerbals standing up under landers. And in 1.0\u002B, it\u0027s even worse with that \u0022clamber\u0022 mechanic. In the old days, you got in and out of capsules with F, but nowadays, that\u0027s on B and F is the \u0022clamber\u0022 thing. And the \u0022clamber\u0022 thing should really be named \u0022Hulk SMASH!!!!!\u0022 So if you\u0027re in the life-long habit of using F to get in and out of capsules, and you do that now instead of hitting B, your Kerbal can and often will rip your ship to pieces with his bare hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EIVA = Innocent Virtual Activity\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals safely inside pods can\u0027t cause any damage.
