I can\u0027t being to tell you how many missions I\u0027ve lost due to fallen Kerbals standing up under landers. And in 1.0\u002B, it\u0027s even worse with that \u0022clamber\u0022 mechanic. In the old days, you got in and out of capsules with F, but nowadays, that\u0027s on B and F is the \u0022clamber\u0022 thing. And the \u0022clamber\u0022 thing should really be named \u0022Hulk SMASH!!!!!\u0022 So if you\u0027re in the life-long habit of using F to get in and out of capsules, and you do that now instead of hitting B, your Kerbal can and often will rip your ship to pieces with his bare hands.\n\nIVA = Innocent Virtual Activity\n\nKerbals safely inside pods can\u0027t cause any damage. It\u0027s the best place to keep them ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:05:22Z","Content":"Google is your friend: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity)\n\nIVA is likely Intrenalvehicular Activity.
