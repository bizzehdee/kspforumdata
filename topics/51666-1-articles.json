The LV909 for example can not recharge batteries. Further up in the tech tree you will get solar cells which you will be able to use to recharge. As of now you just have to be careful not to drain out of power completely. Do some simple missions around the kerbin system until you get the solar panels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just stick them to your craft to use them.
