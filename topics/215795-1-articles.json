My interpretation was that it was a permanent modular ladder as it was in KSP1 but it seems I can only use a single 4 spoke latter at a time. This could be intended but I really hope it isn\u0027t.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvelynThe Dragon","CreatedById":227182,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-27T19:10:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, this is a problem, can\u0027t move from one ladder section to another, or even off of the built in handholds on a capsule to a ladder. At least, I haven\u0027t figured out how to do so. Makes building a large lander for say Duna a problem because the jetpack can\u0027t get you back to the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
