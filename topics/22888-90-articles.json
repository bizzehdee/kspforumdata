They are not complicated models (I could probably model them, and perhaps texture, but Unity rigging is beyond me), and they could share textures with the S-IVB APS. Realism bit aside, they\u0027d be both excellent looking (by virtue of being modeled by you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ), low profile separation motors.
