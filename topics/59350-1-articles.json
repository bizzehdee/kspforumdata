That was pretty easy compared to how I thought it was going to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to make it again but with curves, the right name, only 1 node in the right place, better texture and surface attach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T15:36:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devinci","CreatedById":71469,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T16:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to get started making parts for KSP but I\u0027m unable to find the \u0022write\u0022 button for the part tool component.
