Not only are there swathes of historic robotic missions going on, but the average consumer also has more calculative power in his pocket than the entire US and Soviet Moon programs combined. This can not only be put to good use viewing cat pictures, but also to improve and enhance the personal enjoyment of space related matters. This thread is intended to give a useful overview of the quality programs and applications out there.\n\nThe opening post will be updated with new programs and developments, the rest of the thread is intended for suggestions or discussion about the applications mentioned. I am hoping to crowd-source a very complete and high quality list. Please report broken or missing links. If you enjoy using a certain application, please consider donating money or buying the full version to support its development ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Currently I am not too sure how to categorize things. Just a long list is not very useful, but most application seem to cross over into different territories, making grouping a rather complex affair.
