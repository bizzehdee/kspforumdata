Basically, it fires a projectile at a significant fraction of the speed of light to get a huge amount of kinetic energy. I basically just spent the past two hours putting in different numbers into the equation and coming up with what I liked. Funny note, I started of with the Newtonian equation for kinetic energy (K=.5mv^2) not realizing it totally falls apart at high speeds. Anyways, I\u0027m not too concerned about accuracy as long as it is somewhat close, but here is what I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA cylindrical lithium shell 2.75m length x 1m radius with a total mass of 463kg is fired at 10% of the speed of light for a total kinetic energy of 2.092x10^17 joules, or 50,000 kilotons of TNT. This is the same amount of energy as the Tsar Bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease point out if I missed anything obvious, I wouldn\u0027t be very surprised if I did. Also, when this thing hits, say, a space ship, how would that play out? Would it cause a massive explosion, or would it pass straight through, or some combination? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, lets not let Jeb hear about this, shall we? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T12:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe energy looks about right.
