No idea on why this was not an issue for me before so maybe I am doing something simple terribly wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rockets tend to flip over uncontrollably after gaining some positive angle of attack at the very begging of the gravity turn. The only reason I can see is that the rocket is going to fast at the moment of initial pitch over when the prograde vector did not move from its vertical position yet. But also I have no idea of what is the best time and speed for that and what amount of input should be applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using mechjeb guidance and FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to limit the thing to terminal velocity and get correct atmospheric predictions with that combination?

I have to throttle down very aggressively and leave myself with not that much control torque from thrust gimballing, at least until I progress to much larger rockets and payloads through my space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really need a good way to forcibly limit rockets to a reasonable terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I suppose those rockets which have their center of lift higher than their center of mass and center of thrust are aerodynamically unstable and will tend to rapidly increase any angle of attack value other than zero. That is just the way physics work here. That could be the main explanation of my problem. So, most things capable of ballistic flying ranging from toy rockets to missiles have aerodynamic fins to counter that. But they are an extremely rare occasion on space launch vehicles. How do they counter this problem and achieve an acceptable level stability and controllability, while still in the dense atmosphere just as the matter of general safety? If the real rockets behave the same way they should without fins and the same way they do in the game, why can not a strong wind gust or a momentary unexpected wobble of some sort in the controls make the rocket flip upside down and destroy an expensive payload or even lead to casulties?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T10:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeleted...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-07T14:15:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2014 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallygator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAttempt to be helpful gone wrong.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T12:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kitspace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kitspace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry, what do you mean under setting the MechJeb for a certain amount of degrees to pitch over?

The more distance between the start and end altitudes, the less quickly the craft will pitch down (overall rate) throughout the whole turn.

Yes, MJ will automatically manage throttles for you with the \u0022Limit to terminal velocity\u0022 option in the ascent guidance. Alternatively, you can set up a custom window to display the current terminal velocity. HOWEVER, these options do not work with FAR installed, since FAR zeros out the drag. I\u0027m not sure if FAR has a way to display terminal velocity, but I would guess so. For MJ, you can also use options such as \u0022limit acceleration to...\u0022 or \u0022limit throttle to...\u0022. If you limit acceleration to 2Gs, that will approximate flight at terminal velocity for the initial portion of the flight. Once you have pitched over a good ways and are in thinner atmosphere, you can remove that limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, turning on MJ is just about an all or nothing proposition. If you want it to control the heading, it will also want to control the ascent angle. It will also max the throttle unless you give it some limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend that you play with the various MJ ascent settings to try and understand them. For ecample, you can open the ascent path editor and move the slider left/right while the rocket is in flight. This will cause the rocket to pitch up/down during flight and you can watch what it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ also has a lot of settings that are not on the default ascent guidance page. You can dig around in the window editor (another MJ tab) to find them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I almost forgot. You can move the center of lift around by placing fins and control surfaces near at the bottom of your craft. That will pull the CoL down and also make your rocket a bit more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T01:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMJ is what MJ is, if you want to be able to do all sorts of other \u0027autopilot\u0027 things you might want to look at KOS, Telemachus and/or one of the scripting-language add-ins (I still vote for Lua!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Claw - no worries, I know you\u0027re not the \u0027snotty\u0027 type and I didn\u0027t take it even as disagreement particularly - just \u0022yes, terminology is a problem, I\u0027m using it like this ...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T03:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kitspace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kitspace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs you started talking of what should be considered pitch and yaw in our case here.\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to make mechjeb perform a roll programme after liftoff as the real rockets do and pitchover at the axis which is structurally the pitch axis of the vessel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI can\u0027t answer this, but I do know it\u0027s possible to pick up the whole ship in the VAB and turn it 90 degrees, so that pitch down will push the nose east right from the launchpad.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T15:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI need that most not because of the equatorial orbits, but because of those that are not equatorial or polar...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Soyuz launch vehicles can not perform programmed rolls while airborne and their launch tables are capable of turning to the correct azimuth with the rocket installed, but most launch vehicles still perform a roll programme a few seconds after liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I also really need some way of firmly holding the rocket on the desired heading as if I do not use mechjeb or stock stabilizer the rocket tends to float away all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me calculating what would the natural path be and then make the mechjeb follow the very same trajectory still remains the best idea.
