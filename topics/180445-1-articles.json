The option to transfer KSP Store licenses to Steam is only available for those who bought KSP before it originally came out on Steam, March 20th 2013.\u00A0Note that if you do qualify for a transfer and choose to do it, the process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE. If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSP Store.\u00A0To move to Steam, log in to your KSP Store profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link. If you can\u2019t see the button in your profile it means you purchased the game after it was on Steam and you are not eligible, no exceptions, please don\u2019t insist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SYDWAD","CreatedById":165072,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-09T04:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nidk why they wouldn\u0027t let you do it today, it would be simple, on your account you can see the order ID of your game so just make a page that logs the order IDs and if you input your ID it disables downloads from the home page and emails a steam key to you, simple.
