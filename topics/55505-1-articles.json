For long term experiments, this will be fairly low (1~10e/s) and should challenge player to design their spacecraft to be able to supply the power needed for the experiment (or pay the weight in terms of lots of nuke generator).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientific Studies missions will generally have two rewards. One for transmitting the data, one for bringing back the instrument after successful completion of an experiment. Some mission will only have rewards for one of them (so, for example, some mission only needs you to transmit the result back to complete it and receive full rewards, some will require you to bring the part with the completed experiment back for full reward).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA. Two brothers seek to answer the age old question, do buttered toasts always land buttered side up on Mun? Perform this experiment while landed on Mun. \u003Cem\u003ETemperature Control\u003C/em\u003E required (to keep the buttered toasts from going stale). Transmit the result for full reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. The Kerbohydrate Culinary Society wishes to know if its possible to bake bread on Eve. Perform this experiment while landed on Eve and bring it back for full reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETourist\u003C/strong\u003E - Also similar to Payload Delivery. you\u0027ll also get a specialized parts (a luxury on-board hotel suite?). The parts will generally be fairly heavy, require a constant amount of electricity, and contains a Kerbal. Similar to Payload Delivery, you\u0027ll need to \u0022deliver\u0022 the part to various Celestial body. But instead of just one Celestial body, you\u0027re given an itinerary of a list of Celestial bodies to visit and what to do when you get there (for example, orbit at a certain altitude for a few days, land on it, etc). And unlike payload delivery, you\u0027ll have to bring the \u0022parts\u0022 back. Part of the challenge is to plan for a multiple encounter mission (and/or plan for refuel stations along the way) while having to haul around a fairly heavy part that has a constant electrical requirement. Some missions will allow you to only complete part of it and still get rewards (partial or full), with bonus reward for completing everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA. Justine Keebler wishes to visit the following locations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Two days around Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A flyby of Moho under 20,000 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

The object may be an asteroid (would require a way for player to \u0022dock\u0022 with it so they can effect its trajectory) or a strange spaceship part with one or more docking ports attached to it. The mission will request for player to capture the asteroid/UFO and return it to Kerbin (deorbit it into atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T00:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo hard is said \u0022I am agree with Angel but with these details?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
