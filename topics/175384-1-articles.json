After doing that, I had no clue what persistent file was for what. Whether this describes you or you have stray persistent files for some other reason, this script sort them back into fully functional saves faster than you\u0027d be able to do it manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.nz/#!oAhFVKrY!cjgKs3bIcN05lZgW10qPAUQfLg06ifioMsDdMPT0acc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.nz/#!oAhFVKrY!cjgKs3bIcN05lZgW10qPAUQfLg06ifioMsDdMPT0acc\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use this script, just download it, and double click on it to run it. Make sure you also have Python 3 installed. If you run into errors, try running the script from the command prompt to diagnose it. Let me know if you run into any problems with the script itself and I\u0027ll fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that this does not sort out scenario/training persistent files. Any that are found will be turned into career saves. Also, the directory that this script works in must ONLY have persistent files in it. The presence of folders and other files may cause issues. For unknown reasons, this bot seems unable to process a very small percentage (~1%)\u00A0of saves that I run through it. If this happens to you, you may need to put those specific ones into save folders manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDISCLAIMER: While this bot worked while I was testing and using it, I cannot guarantee that it\u0027ll work as expected\u00A0for everyone. As such, it is never a bad idea to create backups of your files beforehand. You\u0027ll be fine as long as you do this, and I\u0027m not responsible for any lost files that result from using this script.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bztzj0V.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bztzj0V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tOfU1aH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tOfU1aH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom in-game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MNYgTOI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MNYgTOI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-27T21:32:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2018 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
