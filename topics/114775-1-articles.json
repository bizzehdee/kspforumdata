I\u0027m just downloading the 1.0.4 zip file of the Linux version using Firefox 39.0 and the data rate fluctuates between 40 KB/s and 200 KB/s, while my DSL can achieve 1200 KB/s (and just did when downloading Linux upgrades, so I\u0027m pretty sure the problem isn\u0027t on my end of the pipe).\n\n**Edit:** Final balance: 51 minutes, average data rate 207 KB/s\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T13:30:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceNomad**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T13:00:50Z","Content":"That\u0027s weird.
