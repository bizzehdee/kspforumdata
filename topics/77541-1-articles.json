Have you ever noticed something odd or strange--such as a structure on Minmus, or an odd collision report, or any other potential Easter egg? If you posted a thread about it, it was probably brushed off as one of those pranks people do to get attention, or as a one-time glitch. But not here at the JSP Anomaly Investigation Committee! I take all claims of new Easter eggs very seriously, as the game is so big that no one can possibly see every square inch of the game world. I investigate all claims. Simply post your claim using the form at the bottom of this post, and I\u0027ll go investigate. Oh, and while you\u0027re at it, browse the reports I\u0027ve already written!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Anomaly Investigation Committee headquarters. As you can see, we are housed in a secret bunker at the South Pole, mostly cut off from the rest of Kerbin. However, we blew the budget on the bunker and did not have money to build a launch pad, so we have to launch from the Jedi Space Program launch center, which destroys our secrecy. But we still like to pretend we\u0027re all secret, so don\u0027t say that we aren\u0027t. Just pretend you have a Level One Million security clearance to everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a color code for the three possible outcomes to our investigations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ERed\u003C/span\u003E means the report was false--the anomaly does not exist, or was a bug. This is disappointing, but it happens in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFF00;\u0022\u003EYellow\u003C/span\u003E means something strange was definitely sighted, and we are awaiting confirmation from the government (Squad).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003EGreen\u003C/span\u003E means that the report is confirmed as an Easter egg, either by obviousness or by the government (again, Squad).
