Just about every time i load the ground is little different causing misalignment in my landed bases which sometimes leads to explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone notice this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne fix would be to save the ground polygons 1km away or whatever from the base so every single time you load the game it always loads the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyrunner27","CreatedById":64031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T20:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not randomly generated.

It is just you have your ground on a low setting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^^ this. On the lower settings, the ground is higher up than on the higher settings. sounds weird but that\u0027s just the way it is. so if u go and launch a base and land it while on high terrain settings, if you change the terrain setting to low, the base will then explode because it will be under the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToTheMun\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
