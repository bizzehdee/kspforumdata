No, keep reading.\n\nI MEAN Jool and back. Go to the surface, and fly back into orbit and maybe even home.\n\nNow by surface, I mean get close. Don\u0027t land, you get attacked by the Kraken (for those who don\u0027t know)\n\nExample to show it isn\u0027t impossible:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Z6BEg8iG5A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNow the judging\n\n\u0022Weightless\u0022(Lightest lander)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nI make it rain (Cheapest Lander)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nWe are the champions!

I will be able to check and score your attempts in Florida, so submit as much as possible."}]}
