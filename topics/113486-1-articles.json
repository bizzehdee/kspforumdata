This occurs when the ISRU converter is on, engines are on, and the uppermost fuel tank(s) the engine(s) are drawing from is out of fuel. Since the ISRU converter adds fuel to all tanks, it adds small amounts of fuel to the uppermost tank (the one the engine draws from first), and instead of using that fuel AND drawing from the next fuel tank, it ONLY uses the small amount of fuel that is being put in the uppermost tank, leading to thrust being reduced to only draw whatever amount of fuel is being put into the uppermost tank. This just caused each engine on my lander to go from 60Kn to 0.7Kn output and made me crash :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is to just turn off the ISRU converter while engines are running, but this is definitely a bug and shouldn\u0027t work like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T07:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is definitely a bug.
