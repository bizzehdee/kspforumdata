When I should have been working on converting it from php to javascript and cleaning up other oddities (don\u0027t hate, I just didn\u0027t want to deal with browser anything, just raw calculations), I was scattering innocent rockets across the surface of Kerbin, and I\u0027m too tired to get into it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the long version: Ok I got a bit overzealous on my calculations, I noticed an inconsistency between my #s and mechjebs, deciding mine were most likely at fault, I traced it back to the weight of my struts \u0026amp; decouplers \u002B a \u0022magic number\u0022 that appeared to increment on mechjeb\u0027s side one per every stage. Likely a result of one of us rounding differently than the other, but I adjusted for the parts I could explain and figure the rest... 1 dV at sea level, even by 3 stages (when it was cumulatively 6) isn\u0027t worth figuring out. Of course then in my first full test where I set out to figure out what would be needed to throw a full orange tank into low orbit, I realized how little even the struts mattered to the real world... as my rocket that should have thrown 1 full tank up, actually threw up 1.5 tanks, plus skipper engine (dV was calculated for sea level, which I knew was going to be below worst case, but wow was it a long ways below worst case). Then it was followed by a series of ignoble failures with the exact same rocket that may have been related to the program crash at the end of the testing run. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI admit, I\u0027d love to be able to scale the ISP for altitude between 1 atmosphere \u0026amp; vacuum, but well, then I\u0027d have to know how the throttles will be set the entire time to scale thrust, oh and does ISP at the same pressure stay the same for different throttle settings? That\u0027s about when my brain revolted, crawled out my nose and slapped me hard for even considering simulating a game to play a game that is a simulation to that degree. If you look purely at 1 atm dV even to orbit, you\u0027ll do better than you need, if you look at the vacuum... maybe that number should be ignored unless you have a stage you know will be for later maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T07:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022docfish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022docfish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eoh and does ISP at the same pressure stay the same for different throttle settings?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes it does.
