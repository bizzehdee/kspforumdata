Had it been below my projected maximums I wouldn\u0027t have considered a possible bug given I was expecting some sort of loss. I basically wanted to get the missions actually working on my end first then tweak the payouts so they give specific amounts even with the loss. That way if the mission is done correctly there is a small yet steady profit over the course of several missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your curious my initial idea was to have the Kerbals start with a 1000 Krone budget and go from there. Where if I use the default game prices without Mission Controller it is doable, but then I have to do all the math by hand. MC on the other hand lets me automate it and create an in character Email Client via how it is set up which is awesome. Still the expenses for a single mk1pod MC imposes required me to add a 0 to the starting budget and payouts, especially as I also have Ioncross Crew Support installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout you continuing this, it would be a frustrating nightmare trying to figure out all the fuel costs alone.
