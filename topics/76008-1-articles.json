Rules are required in any community (almost by definition of the word community) and none of the rules here stand out to me as being particularly bad. Sure, sometimes threads get locked or posts deleted for reasons that aren\u0027t well explained, but that happens in every forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFifth, though it really isn\u0027t the main reason for a lot of the rules, there are actually quite a lot of \u0022kids\u0022 here. Most of the rules concerning what you are and are not allowed to post are quite sensible. Bad language, insults, aggressive posts, deliberate trolling and lots of other things are unnecessary and do not add anything of value to any thread. A useful rule of thumb for forum (and any other online) behaviour is, if you wouldn\u0027t walk up to the other person in the street and say it, then don\u0027t type it either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESixth, there are some topics that have been discussed to death (usually unnecessarily aggressively and without reaching any obvious conclusions) in the past and trying to discuss them again will usually get the thread locked (or worse if you keep doing it) unless it is very obvious that you have a point that no-one has made before. This is sensible as, otherwise, there would be a new thread about such topics every few days and each one would degenerate into the same argument the previous one did. This would simply be a waste of forum space and moderator time so much better to simply lock such threads early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027ve been ninja\u0027d several times already but never mind... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cochonrambo31","CreatedById":104452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T14:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou lost me when you wrote USSR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELONG LIVE TO MOTHER RUSSIA COMRADE!

Some of the rules here are, imo, a bit overkill, but at the same time necessary. For example the \u0027do not discuss\u0027 rules. They are in place for Squads benefit, so that they don\u0027t have to weed through pages and pages of old discussion when looking for new/useful ideas.
