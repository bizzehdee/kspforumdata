Flying actual missions requires a variety of precise control inputs, I prefer FPS games on a computer because I find the imprecision of console controllers too frustrating. I\u0027m concerned that on an iPad I\u0027d find controlling KSP equally frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would greatly appreciate extending some of the KSP experience to on-the-go play. In particular I think an app implementing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and Spaceplane Hanger would be a huge benefit. Since vehicle construction is not time critical, the control situation should be manageable. As long as input is precise enough, having to toggle input modes shouldn\u0027t be an issue. I\u0027d love to be able to work out designs forlaunchers,\u00A0Duna\u00A0landers and rovers on the train and try them out when I get home, making maximum use of the limited time I do have to play at home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy concern is just how much of a market there would be for something like that.

Then in order to use it, enter a code you get from the game. Then it will sync the editor to the game. However, putting the game on Ipad / Android Tablets would be such a hassle. There are too many controls in KSP for it.
