Let\u0027s say the apoapsis is 80k and the periapsis is 75k. Now then, I can visualize my orbital plane with respect to Kerbin just fine. What I mean is, if you could place a stationary camera at, say, the ascending node, Kerbin would appear to rotate under the camera, right? Same for the apsis, too, right? So my question is, if I\u0027m right about that, then in what frame of reference, if any, are the ascending/descending nodes and apsis fixed? Would they be fixed relative to Kerbol\u0027s equatorial plane? Does any of this make sense?

The importance of your inclination in relation to plane change and interplanetary transfers.

Even moreso if you watched a yt tutorial. If you know what longitude means, and most layman do, longitude of ascending node shoud be self explanatory (not the exact meaning, but what it corresponds to). And by the time you wonder about the missing parameter to characterize an orbit, you should be able to infer what argument of periapsis is.
