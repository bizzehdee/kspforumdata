And we usually even intend to use them as refueling depots. But you know what also usually happens? We think that they don\u0027t look cool enough just being a bunch of tanks with a crew hab on top... and in the end we end up using dumb tankers just like that because our glorious stations are lag monsters, where time seems to stand still. But still, they look awesome right? And the second main problem would be, no matter how big or small you make your station, you are bound to make a ship the next week that is just big enough, so that the depot you just set up has not almost but not quite enough fuel capacity to fill it in one go. So, how to actually have a useful space station that looks good and is fun to play around? Well this is my answer to that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/s1VMK7W\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s1VMK7W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s1VMK7W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was clearly influenced by the classic \u0022wheel\u0022 space station designs of... well, pretty much \u003Cem\u003Eeverybody\u003C/em\u003E. You can\u0027t deny it looks pretty, and you also can\u0027t deny those are probably more crew spots than you will ever need. 101 kerbal seats! But still, the whole core (basically, everything above the top Big Red) is a puny 75 parts. That\u0027s right, 75, not 175. And it carries no fuel tanks itself, I know, but just because that way you can choose exactly how many Big Reds is enough for you. The guys that kind of follow my designs will recognize the fuel tanks as my standard Big Red assembly, which stack laterally as well as vertically, and that can be found in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96569-Modular-Propulsion-System-It-s-all-about-the-MPS!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModular Propulsion System\u003C/a\u003E. Also there you can find the Klaw Pods and Drive Pods that complete the picture, and it is heavily recommended to use these two craft files together: this kind of configuration has everything you might need, can self-deploy to anywhere with not-so-awful TWR, has two construction Klaw drones that together can move pretty much \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, and, best of all, is a mere 122 parts: probably less that the ships you want to dock to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what exactly comes in the file? Well, the nice core of course. Plus a dedicated launcher.

Might be a lonely NASA tank to have a fully functional fuel station under 80 parts, might be your favorite tanker design you already use, might be anywhere from one to dozens of my Big Red assemblies. Hint: if you dock my fuel tank assemblies in a 3x3 grid, they stiffen themselves thanks to the side connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd best of all... you get a very nice view!

Hope you learned stuff, and you know, you could always pick apart my file to see how I did it. Oh, and about your \u0022meager pilot skills\u0022. Probably that comment comes from not looking at your vertical velocity indicator. That little thing is crucial! So crucial, it\u0027s the main reason I use KER, having a more accurate one than in stock. The key to SSTOs is to manage vertical speed so you can: a) get near your maximum height in airbreathers, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E stay there until you have built up enough speed, and c) get to the flameout afterwards with plenty of vertical speed to minimize drag under rocket power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, for the Dao (or any other SSTO with the same intake/jet ratio) the numbers work something like this: Haul ass at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA until I get to 20kms, then lower vertical velocity so I go under 50m/s as I get to 25kms, then wait until I get about 1,400m/s (surface), and pitch up again to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or so to gain vertical speed (ideally, over 150m/s before flameout). Then comes the flameout, and the Dao\u0027s special trick: switch the RAPIERS to rocket mode keeping the jets on, and I can milk some airbreathing thrust all the way to 1,800m/s (surface) or so, with a more than healthy vertical component, so the second flameout is already in an almost-orbital trajectory where I have the time to close intakes and such. A burp or two with the RAPIERS will take the apoapsis to over 70kms, and the rest is a maneuver node job. But the Dao would be hard pressed to make a 200km orbit with the full payload anyway, so no surprises there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
