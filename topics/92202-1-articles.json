However, I\u0027ve noticed that several missions aren\u0027t registering as completed, most annoyingly the Munar mission. Despite completing all the requirements for it, none of them registered as accomplished, despite having planted a flag on the Mun and having science from the Munar surface and Munar orbit in the science archive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the mods I have installed(and as they were all installed in the past two or three days, they should be up to date):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/WaQE3rw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/WaQE3rw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything was working fine before adding the mods, so one(or more) of them has to be causing the issue, but I can\u0027t figure out which one it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rasip","CreatedById":127136,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T22:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to do the mission after accepting it. Every time you get the flag mission you have to plant another one. Same with the science from surface/space. On the other hand, you can leave the kerbal on the Mun and then plant another flag in the same place every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
