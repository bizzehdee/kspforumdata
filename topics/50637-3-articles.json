The escape speed at 250 km altitude is very close to the usually quoted 11 km/s. After launch, MOM\u0027s perigee speed was 9.9 km/s, so it needed an extra about 1.1 km/s at perigee to reach Earth escape speed. After the orbit raising burns, its current perigee velocity is now 10.8 km/s. It now just needs a small kick of around 180 m/s to escape Earth\u0027s gravity. Of course, it\u0027ll need to apply more in order to leave on a Mars interception course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that we\u0027re achieving escape speed from perigee. Now consider this. As I said, escape velocity at 250 km/s is about 11 km/s. At the initial apogee altitude of 23,563 km, escape velocity is about 5.2 km/s -- considerably lower. Isn\u0027t it easier to escape at apogee? Why don\u0027t we burn at apogee instead?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is that while escape velocity is indeed lower at apogee, the spacecraft\u0027s velocity is \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E considerably smaller. It turns out that the \u003Cem\u003Edifference\u003C/em\u003E between the escape speed and the craft\u0027s orbital speed is in fact greater at apogee than at perigee. Let me show it with numbers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeparting from initial 250 km x 23,563 km orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape speed at perigee: 11.0 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital speed at perigee: 9.9 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v to escape at perigee: 1.1 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape speed at apogee: 5.2 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital speed at apogee: 2.2 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v to escape at apogee: 3.0 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe required delta-v for escape is almost \u003Cem\u003Ethree times larger\u003C/em\u003E at apogee! So it\u0027s much more efficient to burn for escape at perigee, where we\u0027re moving fast. And what does that remind us of? Yup, our friend the good ol\u0027 \u003Cstrong\u003EOberth effect\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mechanical energy of the spacecraft is the same at any point of its orbit, and the energy for escape is also a unique value (namely, zero). That means that escaping Earth from a given initial orbit requires a fixed amount of extra energy, regardless of where we do the burn. But the Oberth effect says that we get more kinetic energy out of every kg of spent fuel when we\u0027re moving faster. So we don\u0027t need to spend as much fuel to gain that extra energy if we burn at perigee. And that\u0027s equivalent to a lower delta-v requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T05:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow, I am way out of my depth here with Math !
