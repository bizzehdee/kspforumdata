Yeah, the Camera glitch is unfortunately unavoidable due to how it works. As I don\u0027t really know how to \u0022Spawn\u0022 a Kerbal into the world with the right characteristics to be on the seat and in command, the easiest way is to more or less force built in functions to occur, which is what it does. The camera jumping around is the vessels quickly switching between vessel, kerbal, vessel, kerbal, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals not being able to leave the seat is 50/50 - doesn\u0027t always happen but yes, sometimes does. I\u0027ve got an idea what causes it, I need to investigate it. In the meantime there is a solution - the fault does not occur in persistant saves. So if you want to get the kerbal back out, switch to space center, then back to the vessel, and the kerbal will be free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure I get whats happened with the revert there. Shunting airlock is a bit of a redundant feature from before i messed with kerbal collisions. The KAS problem sounds a bit alarming, though.

I\u0027m suprised you\u0027re not using any intermediate settings on those engines though.
