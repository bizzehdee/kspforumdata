You attach them together and typically you want to \u0022clip\u0022 the grey areas of the wings into one another. Likewise control surfaces are going to clip over the wings grey area leaving only the front edge grey area visible. You can make them as large or small as you like. You do not need part clipping turned on to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you attach them, do it from the base of the plane outward in rows, then add struts in inconspicuous locations from front to back because parts can only attach in one spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you want to download examples, click the second link in my signature.
