It seems to be something with FireSpitter. Could you try uninstalling Firespitter and see if it works properly without it to narrow down the problem?\n\nEDIT: After more testing and some help from the awesome NathanKell it seems that CKAN doesn\u0027t install a rather important part of Firespitter.\n\nA workaround for now is to go into your KSP directory, open the /CKAN/downloads folder and finding the .zip named \u003Cnumbersandletters\u003E-Firespitter-6.3.5.zip. From what file you need to extract Firespitter.cfg which is in the folder Firespitter/Resources inside the .zip file to /GameData/Firespitters/Resources/ in your KSP directory.\u003C/numbersandletters\u003E\n\nThis fix made my version start up normally. I\u0027ll send a pullrequest to have this fixed to the CKAN repositories asap.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T20:46:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dazpoet**"},{"CreatedByName":"amigo240480","CreatedById":139835,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:14:03Z","Content":"hah its funny you should say that I took off all mods and gradually tried to get it working , back from gym just now and it works the only mod i forgot to put back on was firespitter. \n\n(I don,t even know what firespitter is so no loss , \n\nI seem to have( fire spitter core) on there although I have no idea what that is either. \n\nSadly all my saved ships have gone with out a trace, there is not even a message about missing files , they have just been wiped totally ..not sure why , but anyway \n\nI now have a working version of KSP with an obsurd amount to play with so I shall not mess it around for few weeks !\n\nThanks for help , as it seems it would have been the correct diagnosis"},{"CreatedByName":"Dazpoet","CreatedById":132380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:38:15Z","Content":"FirespitterCore is a .dll file which is a dependency for a lot of mods while Firespitter is a partmod adding airplaneparts for e.g. propellerplanes and helicopters."}]}
