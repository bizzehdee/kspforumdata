Here\u0027s some of mine below:\n\nSo before each mission or build session I would ensure: -\n\n- All household chores are secured, or delegated \u0027base personnel\u0027 to respective tasks\n- All work related communications on whatsapp/email/etc are silenced *for good*\n- The next meal is cooked / purchased and properly stowed, preferably something heavy in carbs like pasta or rice.

The first flight in a session includes a preflight checklist that tests all axes, toggles and buttons. I even go so far as to insert a dummy stage to test the stage button.

I used to be that way when I took flight sims seriously in my younger days. I also liked to have a bunch of mates in close contact before (virtual) squadron competitions, both to ensure I knew who are the guys that would watch each others\u0027 backs in a dogfight, and to get them in the right mood for spending the next few hours / most of the day running virtual campaigns. \n\nThese days I mostly just play KSP exclusively, so I would read up on articles on space exploration similar to what I\u0027m flying for the day just to get in the mood."},{"CreatedByName":"SubSonicRocket","CreatedById":141754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T13:03:36Z","Content":"I think one big check I do is see if I have enough struts on my rocket/ship.

M. Nav Ball. Resource Pane. M-T-Z-[space]. Swear again because I forgot to fix my staging. [space] to light engines. Fix staging. Begin gravity turn. Sigh in relief as boosters separate cleanly this time. M to map view, click on Ap to get it to display the numbers. Stage runs out. M to regular view, [space] to dump spent stage and light the next one (good thing I sorted staging out). M. Get annoyed that Ap numbers are gone, click around to get them back. Bring Ap to 86 km and engines off. Out of map view. As we pass 60 km, realise I forgot to put solar panels on an action group, and grope around trying to deploy them all. Get annoyed about the one I can\u0027t quite see because it\u0027s on the shade side of the ship. Back to map view and set a manoeuvre node for circularisation. Fiddle for ages to get the projected orbit exactly circular to within 0.1%. Bring ship round to blue marker for circularisation burn, and make a ham handed effort, end up with Ap out at 102 km while Pe is 84 km.\n\nRight, Twitter tells me 1.0 is out, I\u0027m off to get downloading."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:34:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Adjust trim for perfect gravity turn, Z, T (yeah), fix staging then space, reset trim in space.\n\nJust curious, I heard engaging the SAS immediately nullifies the trim setting.
