I don\u0027t see the point of mixing the two. If you want to do research in a lab you need the samples (raw science) - so you have to physically move it from one place to another. This (transporting samples) can also be done if you want to send it to another vessel for better transmission. But what is the point of uploading / downloading the science data (mits) between vessels? You can just send it home through relays and get the science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-20T09:15:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2022 09:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demcrew","CreatedById":186749,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-25T23:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience is another portion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunication starts to be involved for Remote Control and monitoring.
