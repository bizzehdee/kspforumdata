Got to work on the close out of the shuttle program and ORION. Good stuff, and KSP has given me a whole new understanding of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast week I put myself into my first career-mode game that didn\u0027t have maxed starting funds, science, etc. It went really well till I made my 2nd trip to Duna. I launched two rockets - first one was the lander and ascent stage, which would dock with the 2nd for the return trip home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t really look at where Duna was relative to Kerbin, just launched into a high orbit of Kerbin and then warped ahead till Duna was correctly aligned. When I came out of warp and then went to take control of the first rocket, I had issues. It didn\u0027t show the rocket, the navball was completely black with nothing in it, and Escape key wouldn\u0027t work so it was effectively locked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027d I do wrong? Is there an amount of time I can\u0027t warp at once?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDustin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like the work of the NaNo virus. As far as I know, there\u0027s not limit to how much you can time warp at once. Were you actively changing your orbital parameters at the time of the warp [rotating, oscillating, ect]? If so, that would explain far too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DLrocket89","CreatedById":115028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T00:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.
