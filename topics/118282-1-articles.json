It has to do with the default symmetry that gets stamped on parts internally. There was another user who posted a similar problem with a complex shuttle setup. I believe in his case, the trigger was from starting the craft as the first thing, saving, then coming back later. The pure stock way to avoid this is to start a new craft and place any part. Switch symmetry mode to mirror, then start new or load your ship. In this particular case, the internals of your ship are already stamped incorrectly, but you can use the above steps to avoid problems with future vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to fix the vessel, make a copy of the original .craft, open it in notepad and search for all the symmetry methods and change \u0022Radial\u0022 to \u0022Mirror\u0022. That should fix your craft. Be careful if you Find/Replace all Radial with Mirror, because some of the parts have radial in their name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t fix it up, I\u0027d be interested in seeing your .craft file to verify this.

I\u0026#39;ve had the same issue on several builds I\u0026#39;ve done. It makes building the craft take longer. In my case, it was tied to the part I\u0026#39;m trying to attach too being rotated . for some reason the axis of symmetry is turned as well. The biggest culprit is if you rotate the base part, it rotates the symmetry of all part attached to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example. I built a small rover for grinding science around ksc. I had the craft mostly built, but decided I needed to turn the cockpit(base part) 90 degrees so the hatch was on the side and accessible when I go eva. The cockpit I used was the mk1 capsule for cost reasons. After turning that part, I rotated the rest of the parts back to normal angle. When I tried attaching anything too the fuselage using mirror, it would mirror the parts to the top and bottom of the fuselage instead of the sides. This made it hard to get it mirrored correctly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fix I used, was to rotate the capsule and fuselage back to the way they were when I placed them. Then I could attach the other parts mirrored just fine. I then rotated the capsule and fuselage again to where I wanted them and everything was fine. Odd bug that never used to be a problem before. Not sure when this started happening though... Was sometime after 1.0\n"}]}
