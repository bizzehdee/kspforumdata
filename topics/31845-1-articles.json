That is how they have Element-139 and still have planets and such. Since when it collapsed, it did another \u0022neutron nova\u0022, the element was scattered throughout the system, and as an result, all the planets have a surplus of it in their cores. Later, a large rogue planet is flung into the Kerbol system. It flings into Duna Orbit, and parts smash into the planet, forming the lowlands. The impacts being Debris into orbit, later forming Ike. Also, Duna, which used to be the third planet, it flung out past Kerbin as a result of the impact and the rogue planets gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe object splits in two, and one aerobrake into or it near Kerbin. It later receives an assist and is put into high-orbit, becoming Minmus. The other impacts Eve, wiping the planet of life and causing its toxicity today. Gilly was not formed by this, and was formed fifteen million years later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals breathe both oxygen and monoxide. However, when they breathe monoxide, they breathe out oxygen. When they breathe oxygen, they breathe out monoxide, allowing for near-infinite air supply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals became interested in space travel after an human interstellar probe crashed onto the surface of Kerbin. Inside, the Kerbals (Who were still in the equivalent of 1920\u0027s technology), found dozens of charts and diagrams of the universe, a map of Earth and its location, and most importantly, a book that would forever change their history. The \u003Cem\u003E Encyclopedia Technologicia\u003C/em\u003E. Inside where technical charts and diagrams of humanities technology leading up to the 22nd Century and descriptions of more wonders in the 26th Century (Humans where already a Type II at 2651), and more....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the discovery of the crashed starship, the Kerbals began to reverse engineer. First, the reverse engineered the boosters. Then the engines. Then the fuel tanks. Soon, came decoupler and such. Parachutes. Landing legs. A whole plethora of information flooded in, as the Kerbals set themselves to the ultimate goal. Reach Earth (By now, Humans where considered \u0022gods\u0022 in Kerbal society. Like the forerunners and the Coveant.). They wanted to see their creators, the very race that brought them to the space age...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, they started leaving Kerbin. Leaving for the Mun. But then, a SRB with nuclear engines exploded over KSC, and many employees died from Radiation. The Goverment quickly banned anyone from living within 100KM from the center. And it resumed......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your thoughts on my background views?

The planet near the chart represents the location of Duna. The orange blot near the bottom represents the color of the planet, and the three planets represent the size of the rogue planet, in Duna terms, meaning the Dunaian Astronomers saw the planet as the size of three Duna\u0027s. The sole pyramid represents the transmitter used to display the message, and the line going up represents the spherical geostationary station that was destroyed by the impact. The Duna\u0027ns used lasers to communicate, and the red color symbolizes the lives lost onboard the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chart symbolizes the path if the rogue planet, in order to warn other races of it.
