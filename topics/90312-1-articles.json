Snow and haze blocked off the last glimmer of light from a setting sun. Jebediah was dragging the terrified Bill by the ear across the jagged taxi-way and dispersal area not far from the Space Plane Hanger. He let go of his hand leaving Bill limp and shivering on the slippery tarmac, and proceeded to clamber up a ladder laid down by a relatively small storage unit. Jeb angrily threw open a pair of roof-borne doors and reached down into the unit and brought out a very heavy looking case, nearly as big as Jeb himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe slung the strap of the bag over his shoulder and slowly walked towards Bill. Bill has clutched by the neck and was stood up. His teeth clattered around like a gyrating bear-trap. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I told you Bill, if you ever even TRY to fly out MY Aeris, you would pay.\u0022 Jeb said rather calmly, too calmly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But it w-was m-mine! You were told by Ge-en-ne multiple times t-that we were r-r-receiving the new Aer-ris 3A-B. I chose the same basic paint-scheme as you did w-when we got our 3As!\u0022 Bill cried\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hah! Don\u0027t give me that rubbish, I think I\u0027d be able to remember such a conversation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb y-you\u0027ve had at l-l-least 47.4 concussions since 0.7.3!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure and my name is...- Um... What even IS the difference with the new Aeris anyway?\u0022 Jeb asked, slightly nauseated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A new turbojet engine with an axial compressor, replacing the primitive centrifugal one.\u0022 Bill replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, now starting to get cold, headed towards that new Admin Building beckoning Bill to follow. Jeb smashed open the doors and cautiously stepped down the stairs to the basement with Bill hesitantly following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sit down.\u0022 Jeb said with a menacing look in his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a marble table with two wooden chairs. Bill sat in one while Jeb slammed the heavy case down on the table. He unzipped the case and opened the flap on which was written \u003Cem\u003EA.D.E.N 30mm - For Ravenspear Mk V Fighter. \u003C/em\u003EBill knew that something was up, and then he remembered the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce opened the weapon was revealed. It was an A.D.E.N 30mm *Revolver Cannon, the one found on the real life Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin. A cry of shock and fear escaped from Bill\u0027s throat. The long silver barrel was a big a his arm and the immense weight gave it a sense of quality, like it was just eager to kill him. The firing chamber was much like that of a revolver firearm, with may shell chambers in a revolving cylinder that spins at the smack of a hand. Jeb reached into a small pocket and grabbed a 30mm shell. It was placed in front of Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is something I like to call, \u003Cstrong\u003EEXTREME \u003C/strong\u003ERussian Roulette. I place the shell into the firing chamber, spin it a couple times, press that little button there, and see what happens. We keep taking turns until one of us is killed.\u0022 Jeb said with a slightly manic grin, staring with cold, dead eyes into Bill\u0027s very soul.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe placed the shell into the chamber and gave it a few spins. With all of his strength he lifted the gun out of its case and faced the barrel towards Bill\u0027s chest. Bill\u0027s eyes closed and Jeb depressed the switch for a second. A slight whirring sound occurred as the cylinder spun yet no shell fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lucky.\u0022 Jeb whispered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your turn!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill wiped his sweaty palms on his trousers and spun the gun round and aimed it at Jebediah. He fired. The whirring sound appeared and again, no shell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Phew, I could hear the angels for a second..\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022God-damned luck, sometimes I don\u0027t know why I bother.\u0022 Bill complained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022 Tell you what,\u0022 Jeb said as he reached for some more shells, \u0022..there are, say, 30 or 40 so firing chambers in the cylinder, so how \u0027bout I slot in another couple in the gun, it might end this quicker?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whatever you want, it was your bloody idea anyway...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb did just that. He turned it around again and pointed it at Bill... *Click*, nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wow, you must be made of luck, aye?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Probably...\u0022 Bill sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill took hold of the gun and aimed at Jeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Here goes...\u0022 Bill said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*RATATATATATATATA*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe explosive power of the five shells shook the small concrete basement and dust and rubble fell from the ceiling. Jeb\u0027s torn, mutilated body lay crashed on the floor, pieces of ribs, organ and gut spilled all over the place. Bill stared with blind shock and horror at the bloody corpse strewn over the floor...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, somehow, Jeb appeared behind Bill laughing his mental head off saying\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Heh, you didn\u0027t forget that we are part of The Original Three...right? We can\u0027t die! We just get re-spawned over and over and bloody over again. Those guys building our rockets have some sympathy....maybe.\u0022 He said with a happy, forgiving smile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd that was the story of how Bill got into a bit of bother, Jeb was killed yet wasn\u0027t (as normal) and how writer MightyDarkStar got inspired after reading that story \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Last Spin \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eby Evan Hunter...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EPlease don\u0027t let me write a sequel....\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-15T09:32:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2014 09:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MightyDarkStar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar Fix\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MightyDarkStar","CreatedById":115126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T09:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, how bad is it?
