There\u0027s also a problem, that happens for a few moments (less than a second) just upon entering any time warp level, in which the ship will start losing a specific amount of electric charge, even when there are enough solar panels to supply all EC demands. The amount increases with higher time warps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happens in stock game (tested only in KSP 1.12.5).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo we know why this happen, and a way to fix it without completely disabling heat and electric charge in the cheats menu?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
