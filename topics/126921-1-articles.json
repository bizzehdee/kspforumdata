As more stuff gets added to the base game it uses more of that 4gb. More than a handful of serious mods (some are big enough to chew the rest of that up alone) will chew up the rest of that and give you out of memory errors. Take me for example. I\u0027ve effectively quit playing until the 1.1 update is out because with the mods I want to use I can\u0027t stay under 4gb and still play without crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n64bit means you don\u0027t have the 4gb limit.

On your system you\u0027re likely running the graphics on the motherboard; that means that the graphics are chewing up that 4gb limit as well (it\u0027s a bit more complex than that but that\u0027s close enough) where as someone with an independent graphics card may be running 2-4gb of graphics content offloaded to their video card.

They can collide, they convay torque, they can convey force. This is all done on *one* core only, because it\u0027s hard to program for multiple cores. Unity 5 uses a new PhysX version, which a) performs better in general and b ) can use multiple cores in some situations. That should bring *some* alleviation, but you can\u0027t get rid of the principal problem of the many interactions of 200 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the game and I will keep playing it, of course, but I got to say those crashes to desktop spoil the fun for me sometimes, it just breaks the immersion.

I hope they fix it as well. But I know some software development, and I know these things are hard, because:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- You can\u0027t consider mods, because then you would have to deal with code you don\u0027t have control over that\u0027s often not well written or very different from your style. Since most memory problems get worse only with mods, the devs probably don\u0027t even SEE the crashes, because on their systems, in stock, it works fine most of the time. Bugs where the program works \u0022most of the time\u0022 are the absolute worst, because it\u0027s often super hard to reproduce them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- KSP is written in C#, which is a \u0022managed\u0022 language, that means that all Objects that you allocate get Garbage Collected. *IN THEORY*. In practice, the previous sentence is not much more than a marketing gag, and what it actually does is make your memory management really really hard to debug, because you might end up with dangling references left and right. That\u0027s why debugging memory problems is really, really hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- People care about content. Eventually, they get pissed if the game crashes, but if they can keep playing most of the time they are happy. The devs know that, so they prioritize new Content (more or less linear development, with little surprises) over heavy bugfixing (very hard, time consuming and might even turn out to be impossible in some cases).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, they have known that they will revamp some parts of the game (like the UI, the orbit lines...) for quite some time. It makes no sense to put in efforts into something that might \u0022fix itself\u0022 in a few months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that should not be an excuse.

Having 100s of GB of disk space is huge too. But having all these resources available makes game engine designers\u00A0and game\u00A0programmers lazy. Instead of optimizing their code like we used to do when there was 1MB of memory available on a PC, they just ignore resource limitations, pull everything into memory and optimize nothing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113764\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0022\u003E@Foxster\u003C/a\u003EActually KSP is very well optimized for the base game.

For example, you build you ship (cursing texture-loading lag all the time) and as you add parts, you eat the memory again (plus memory for low-lod models) until editor wont let you add any more. So\u00A0you design ship\u00A0carefully\u00A0to keep texture memory down, launch it it, all is fine. Then you design another, add some parts, remove others to keep memory down. What will happen when those two ships meet?\u00A0OOM kaboom. \u00A0You\u0027d be limited not only by your current design, but by parts on all ships in game. \u00A0So, you end with a game that lets you add many mods, but wont let you actually use them anyway - not that much different from what we have now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s that easy to dismiss. First of all there\u0027s a solid chunk of textures in use for the planets. Now obviously there\u0027s only one body you can orbit at the same time (yes, it could be a moon and you\u0027d need a texture for the planet of that moon, but that can be a microtexture again) so that\u0027d leave out a good chunk of textures, especially when people replace the stock textures with their own hi-res ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, yes, theoretically that scenario would arise, but only if you\u0027re using practically every part available between the two ships.\u00A0The memory problems arise because people are using \u003Cem\u003Edozens\u003C/em\u003E of part mods, each with textures that eat up precious memory. I doubt you\u0027d be using practically every part from every mod. Proper texture management would mitigate \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of these cases though. Not sure if you would build ships that would cause these problems that often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current approach is great when you\u0027re only using stock parts (I am, thus I have little problems), as there is no stuttering in the game due to loading textures. And it\u0027s understandable as the underlying architecture was probably designed when this wasn\u0027t an issue. But it is now, for a lot of players, and Squad needs to address it at one point. 64 bit is only a temporary solution as people will now invariably load \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E of mods and simply run out of real memory (not just addressable memory).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T18:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222306394\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126921\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449162552\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002284077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022radonek\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, radonek said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is most basic LOD work and wont do.
