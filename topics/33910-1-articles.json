The model loaded fine but at launch it did not fill with electrical charge a right click show that it had 0.00 electrical charge even though it was supposed to have 5. The light at the bottom remained purple so I ended the flight. I added the launch stabilizers thinking that they would charge it up. This time at launch it still had no power and the light remained purple for about 20 seconds, at this point in time the game crashed and provided me with the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbvjbfuhanpih4t/2013-06-20_001828.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jbvjbfuhanpih4t/2013-06-20_001828.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper big fancy computer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: Yes, mine so probably buggy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the issue lies in having too many part modules on one part. . . maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T06:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d probably do better to check with other modders in the appropriate forum sections, and include the actual part.cfg so they can see if you missed something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T14:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027d probably do better to check with other modders in the appropriate forum sections, and include the actual part.cfg so they can see if you missed something.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part is fixed.
