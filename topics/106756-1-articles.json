However as a member of this community for quite sometime this is a problem I have noticed and I feel it needs to be addressed. Wouldn\u0027t errors and mistakes such as the ones found in 1.0 be avoided by releasing a test releases to a wide range of the community. KSP is a game that is obviously a game that can be and is heavily modded. Mods are an important part of the appeal to the game and I would say that 9 out 10 players use at least one mod. So releasing an update for any modder who has over say 5,000 downloads, Squad should give them an early release of the game. This is effective in two ways. It allows more people to test the updates before release. Two, and most importantly wouldn\u0027t it make sense that the people who make the game better for so many people have early access to the game? So they in turn can have their updates ready to go for the next update. I mean how many people waited for their favorite mods to be updated before they played 1.0. And now that 1.01 and 1.02 updates have been released many mods that were updated are now broken again. This isn\u0027t just frustrating for the people who play and consume mods but for the people who make and maintain mods, it must be excruciatingly frustrating. Modders don\u0027t get paid they release things out because they want to share with the community. Squad should recognize that yes they have made a wonderful game but if it wasn\u0027t for the modders and the mods many people would have stopped playing after their first 10 runs to the Mun and back. So they should show respect to the modders of this community and that would be allowing them early access so that they can update their mods accordingly. Now these updates are supposed to come few and far between now. So I think for the future the popular modders....nay the essential modders should and need early releases of updates so that they can ensure that the game doesn\u0027t break their mods, and they have time to update instead of cobbling together fixes themselves. I feel that this would truly benefit Squad and the KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think most popular modders have early access already.

If the update is ready, but not the mods for it, then the people who don\u0027t use mods are waiting for nothing. 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 were small patches meant to fix the bugs missed in 1.0 and should take priority over mods because every user could experience them. In fact, mod makers would have to deal with different internal versions like these patches if they were given an early incomplete copy.
