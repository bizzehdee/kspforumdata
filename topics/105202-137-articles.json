It may be that you are running into a restriction in the game\u0027s catch-up mechanic. It calculates what resources should have been generated, converted, and used retroactively, then applies those calculations in \u0022chunks\u0022. If you hit a storage bottleneck in any resource, it can screw up the rest of the catch up calculations. If I recall correctly, you need about 6 hours of storage for each resource. So, if your vessel needs, say, 60 000 EC to last 6 hours, you have a reactor that generates more than that (say 100 000 every 6 hours) but you only have 5000 EC storage, the catch-up mechanic will try to put 100 000 EC into your batteries, fill them to their maximum 5000 EC, then your vessel will try to pull 60 000 EC from your batteries, and not have enough available. This isn\u0027t to say you haven\u0027t also stumbled on a bug, but it might be worth isolating this.\n\nTL;DR: try putting enough EC storage on your vessel so that it could last for more than 6 hours on just battery power, and see if that makes a difference or not."},{"CreatedByName":"tsaven","CreatedById":138869,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T10:42:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Wyzard said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hab time calculation still seems to be broken in 0.5.11: in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it says the hab time for a Hitchhiker with 4 kerbals is 165 days, but on the launchpad it shows 7.5 days.

As an experiment, start with your vessel with 100% EC, then turn on any parts that you usually have consuming power (such as those listed above) and turn OFF any power generators you have (such as reactors).

Granted, you still need some storage, but generally not six hours worth.  And yes the LS window just reflects battery storage, it does not reflect any other stuff you have going that either adds to or reduces your EC draw.  In the interest of better troubleshooting, will be adding in a note as to \\*why\\* bad things happened to the Kerbals so we can sort if people are having EC, supply, or Hab issues.\n\u003E \n\nI had no idea that the catch-up mechanics scale EC. Thanks for the correction! How does it work, roughly? Does it just look at the production-to-output ratio and break it into chunks from there?\n\nAlso, any thoughts on this post of mine from a couple of days ago?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On \u200E2016\u200E-\u200E11\u200E-\u200E28 at 6:13 AM, Merkov said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m seeing an odd little bug that I didn\u0027t see posted already. If I missed it, please disregard this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I noticed when using CTT in my career playthrough that the Nom O Matic 5000, 25000, and 25000-I all seem to be visible in the default tech tree node (survivability) AND their CTT node, hydroponics. These seem to be the only three parts that are affected this way. I tried starting with a fresh install of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and its bundled dependencies and CTT. I started a new career and went straight to the R\u0026D facility, and the tech tree still showed the Nom O Matics in both tech tree nodes.

Only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and CTT are needed. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Slightly off-topic, but while I was looking into this (my version of looking into most programming-related things is PRETTY basic) I noticed that the new, larger recycler, the RT-5000, doesn\u0027t have a CTT config entry, so it just shows up in survivability, far sooner than the littler RT-500, which shows up in recycling. Is this its intended placement, or simply an oversight? Would you like a pull request (I can try to figure those things out!) with an updated CTT.cfg? If so, would you like it in the recycling node, or somewhere else? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for everything!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I just re-posted this in the CTT thread, since in hindsight it might be more of an issue on that mod\u0027s end.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"dboi88","CreatedById":150676,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T15:45:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Wyzard said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ahh, no, I didn\u0027t realize that, thanks.
