If I vist 4 biomes of a planet/moon, I should have learned enough about it to not really have a reaon to come back unless I have new experiments or want to be really thorough. As a starting point, I\u0027d say about 75% of the available sciene from each body (per experiment) should be accessible from the first four biomes. \n\nReasoning: Currently, there is no real incencitive to ever visit other planets from a science/funds balancing standpoint. I can unlock the entire tech-tree without leaving Kerbins SOI with repetetive missions to the many biomes of Mun and Minmus. If the science rewards would start to drop significantly after maybe 3-4 biomes, the player would be encouraged to actualy explore other bodies, while keeping rovers/suborbital hops/landings at biome border-type mssions attractive. Bonus effect: This prevents the boring science gains from the KSC building biomes.\n\nNotes:\n\n - I know that this is not enough to fix the entire balancing problem of career mode. This is just a step into what is i feel is the right direction. Please don\u0027t discuss science labs, the repeating \u0022free money/science\u0022 contracts \u0022Science data from XYZ\u0022 etc. here.\n\n - I am not suggesting increasing the value of the first experiments because I want to drain science from the system.\n\n - Increasing endgame tech science costs does not prevent the problems described. Instead, it actually drives the player towards repeating missions to be able to purchase these techs.\n\n - The biomes on Kerbin might be a problem for a seperate discussion. I want to be encouraged to visit the poles/deserts/mountains, but the \u0022walk around KSC for science\u0022 situation is ridiculous. Let\u0027s focus this discussion on all the other non-Kerbin celestials.\n\n - This is about surface-based science. Polar orbit satellites should still be more valuable than equatorial ones."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:21:14Z","Content":"The second biome can already give fewer science. Let us say for example that each biome gives 15% fewer science than the biome before. This will not be that much less in the first few, and very few when doing a lot of biomes but has no hard turnnig point at which the reduction starts.\n\nAnyway, very good idea."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:52:11Z","Content":"I see what you\u0027re saying but I think the biomes are OK at the moment. New players can grind out the science within Kerbin\u0027s SOE, perhaps doing a trip to Duna as a grand finale before going their own way with a fully unlocked tech tree. More experienced players can mix it up a bit and go interplanetary earlier. Just because you *can* complete the tech tree at the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn / Minmus, there\u0027s nothing that says you *have* to. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAs an example, my current Science mode game had a couple of self-imposed restrictions: 1) Build a space station in LKO before sending landing missions to the muns\\*. 2)No solo landings on other celestial bodies. It\u0027s been an interesting change of pace science-wise, I\u0027m going to want a second trip to Minmus to unlock all the instrument goodies for my first Duna probes but I expect to get quite a lot of science there and at the other planets as launch windows open. Then it\u0027s going to be a full on infrastructure push to explore the Mun in style!\n\nJust as an aside, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d agree with \u0022If I vist 4 biomes of a planet/moon, I should have learned enough about it to not really have a reaon to come back\u0022 either. The Apollo missions only scratched the surface of things we could learn about the Moon - if the funds and the political will for more missions had been there, I\u0027m betting the geologists would have been all over those too.\n\n\\*I had hoped to get the station in place before doing anything outside of LKO but that turned out to be a restriction too far - couldn\u0027t unlock the required techs without at least going to Munar orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T18:55:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"}]}
