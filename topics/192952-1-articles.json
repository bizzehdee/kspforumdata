Assuming ideal gas law stays correct (which it does not, not even with\u00A0helium) 1.05 m of helium at 200 atm and 90 K would be needed to store 113 kg of helium, or a sphere 1.26 m wide.

Pressure-fed rockets are hella simple. Helium at super-high pressure pushes against fuel in a tank at lower (but still very high) pressure, which is thus pushed into a combustion chamber at lower pressure. The pressure in the tank must be greater than the pressure in the combustion chamber in order to maintain positive flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, this means the tanks must be very strong -- stronger (in an absolute sense, not for their size) than the combustion chamber itself!

For low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E burns (or for stuff where inefficiency is okay, like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E), this extra weight is not too big a problem, but when you need to squeeze out lots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, it hurts you.

So if the weight of a turbopump is less than 90% of your tank weight, you should switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn to the maths (or at least back of the envelope maths) for \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162109-cunjo-carl/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162109\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162109-cunjo-carl/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cunjo Carl\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s idea. My suspicion is that the available work-energy in the pressurized helium is going to be the same regardless of whether it is used to run a turbopump or is used to pressurize the entire tank. There might be some inefficiencies on either side that I\u0027m not thinking of, but it\u0027s probably going to be roughly the same amount of work-energy at the end of the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut localizing the high-pressure region to the turbopump can still have major benefits. If you can reduce the head pressure in the tanks (let\u0027s say to halfway between a typical pressure-fed cycle and a typical pump-fed cycle) by putting the helium through a simple turbopump first, you can cut the weight of the tanks to around 55% what they would otherwise be. And since your turbopump has no combustor and is operating on inert helium, it doesn\u0027t have to be extraordinarily heavy and it doesn\u0027t need to be made of ridiculous corrosion-proof metals. So you should probably come out on top.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-24T03:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo good news for me, I have no idea for how long but my hands cleared up a bit, and the place I consult for is temporarily closed so I got to use some time to brush up on thermo and figure this out instead!

But at the bottom line the pressure boost numbers wind up looking tantalizingly usable, and the engine would would need only the simplest conceivable turbopump from an engineering perspective (for 20 reasons), which is why I find it interesting. In all cases this cycle would use significantly lighter tanks and less Helium than an equivalent pressure fed, but it has to carry the turbopump.
