When I launch the rocket, everything seems to run smoothly for the first part of the flight. But shortly after SRB sep, at around 10km, the rocket flips over. I can sometimes resolve it if I make sure the fuel pulls from the lowest part of the rocket first by manually transfering fuel between the three tanks that make up the first stage, but I don\u0027t really want to do that. My Acent profile is set to start my gravity turn at 100m/s, turn end at 90km, 0 final angle and 40% turn shape. I\u0027ve even checked the center of mass in the VAB with various amounts of fuel and the indicator is always well below the center of the rocket. Any ideas what the issue might be?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
