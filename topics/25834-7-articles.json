With the technology available to the Kerbals in the stock game, there is essentially no difference between implementing more star systems and leaving them as an unattainable infinite painted bubble. There\u0027s plenty more that can be added to the Kerbol system to make the game better. Clouds, wind, resources, terrain details, structures, asteroids. Leave interstellar travel for another game. I\u0027d support making stars and planets be a pluggable thing, as long as everyone understood that interstellar space is full of krakens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T19:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI smell necrotics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skyace65","CreatedById":71431,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T19:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to have it obviously after the current system and gameplay is fleshed out. even if it\u0027s just one other star system it would be a nice feature to have and an advanced goal. plus assuming R and D gets implemented into the game an extremely powerful ship drive could be endgame content. maybe make it you have to do X number of missions and gather X number of resources from specific planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T19:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Goddamit guys you can\u0027t just necro a thread this way)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocLangy","CreatedById":57459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T19:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally the end. Ok:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. wormhole would be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Antimatter-the possible fuel of a warp drive exists. We\u0027ve already created it in particle accelerators. The issue is its not economical. If you took the entire global economy and devoted all the particle accelerators in the world to this you would only end up with a some fraction of a gram. Not even close to the theoretical hundreds of pounds or more of the stuff you would need. Then there is storage because its destroyed by any regular matter so now we are talking about large electromagnetic fields, what will power those. My point is this stuff does exist, physics allows it it CAN happen and I think it will, one day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I don\u0027t think the argument that a hypothetical second solar system/expanded galaxy will ruin the home system has any legs. This is all way down the line, I don\u0027t think anyone is really seriously asking for something like an expanded galaxy for right now or even when KSP officially releases 1.0. If the entire solar system is fleshed out comets/colonization/ 45 extra planets and moons/asteroids/resources/tech research/missions, and the developers release a poll saying \u0022the Kerbal system is done the game has shipped, we are considering adding an additional solar system would you be interested?\u0022 The community would rise up with a resounding \u0022yes squad! we would love another\u0022. The point is no one is asking if Squad should take resources away and start on something like that now.
