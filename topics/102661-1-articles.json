No window showed up. I figured maybe my saved ships had somehow gotten corrupted, and it was no big deal, I remade the probe, launched, matched orbit, did a test-in-flight contract, then selected another satellite contract. I made a new satellite and fought with perspective again, trying to line up KSC with an orbit line in the shadow of the planet and 14,000 km out, and used the rest of my time up. I launched the game again, and again hit load, and.....nothing happened. I checked the space plane hangar and load still lets me load aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat has happened, and how do I fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaddendum.
