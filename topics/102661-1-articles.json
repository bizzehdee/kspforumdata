No window showed up. I figured maybe my saved ships had somehow gotten corrupted, and it was no big deal, I remade the probe, launched, matched orbit, did a test-in-flight contract, then selected another satellite contract. I made a new satellite and fought with perspective again, trying to line up KSC with an orbit line in the shadow of the planet and 14,000 km out, and used the rest of my time up. I launched the game again, and again hit load, and.....nothing happened. I checked the space plane hangar and load still lets me load aircraft. \n\nWhat has happened, and how do I fix it?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\naddendum.

I\u0027d try a couple of things to troubleshoot if it were me:\n\n--copy/paste a VAB craft to the SPH and see if it loads\n\n--start a new save, paste the VAB craft into there, see what happens\n\n--look in persistent.sfs, search for text \u0027VAB\u0027 and confirm that the file doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s destroyed or you can\u0027t enter it etc.\n\nIf all else fails, and other saves don\u0027t seem to be corrupted like this, you could try copying/pasting the Goddard save into a clean folder by hand including using a text editor to make a (hopefully) clean copy of persistent.sfs.\n\nI honestly have no idea if any of this would work, but those are the steps I\u0027d take to troubleshoot.
