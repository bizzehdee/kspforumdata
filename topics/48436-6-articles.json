I can\u0027t seem to find any good 1m engines as OMS engines for my shuttle now. They\u0027re either 0.5m or only burn LH2 and LOX. Is this intentional? Also the 2m Griffon 8D still has a ridiculously high thrust for its size.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathan has said that he\u0027s only designated most engines as having limited fuel options because he doesn\u0027t think it should be that easy to switch fuels. If I can offer my opinion on that subject (as if I\u0027ve ever asked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) we should instead look on reconfiguring engines as total re-designs. (hint-hint-hint)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at engines.cfg it does seem as though a lot of engines are completely re-scaled to smaller sizes.... so I\u0027m guessing that is deliberate to give KW options to the smallest tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I suggest as an alternative however (@Nathan), defining new parts that use those models scaled down? You can do that even in the same engines.cfg file. Look at my config file and you\u0027ll see I do that to add new tanks. There\u0027s like 6 PART{} nodes defined in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T20:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs promised, here is a build of MechJeb that shows Sea Level TWR (and has its figures corrected for all other regimes too).
