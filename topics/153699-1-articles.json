I\u0027ve been using SVE, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Scatterer, Terrain Replacer,\u00A0and all combinations of them, along with using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to enable them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I still have a problem. See here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VO3ICR7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VO3ICR7.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all due respect to whoever made this texture, I personally think it looks weird. Especially because I can still see Eve\u0027s surface, which is dumb considering how thick its atmosphere is. Is it really suposed to look like this with SVE? I remember having Eve with the thick non-see-through atmo before with these mods awhile ago. Something is conflicting in my mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I want it to\u00A0look similar to\u00A0(and what it \u003Cstrong\u003Eshould\u003C/strong\u003E look like in my opinion):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hLriYcQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hLriYcQ.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not that picky. I would like it if it\u00A0looked one pale flat color, like in Matt Lowne videos. Can\u0027t find a pic, but you know what I\u0027m talking about probably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not just talking about Eve here, I also have other issues, such as not having the haze along the line between the day and night sides. Should look like this, as shown on the SVE page:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220TBgsTU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0TBgsTU.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am always able to see Kerbin\u0027s terrain as if it were lighted somewhat, even on the night side, unlike above picture shown...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried the manual approach, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it always turns out the same as in first pic...
