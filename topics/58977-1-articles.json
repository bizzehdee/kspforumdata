I would still stick with Nuclear for your interplanetary burns. If you need a lot of in-atmosphere oomph for a lander, the aerospike might be a better choice, as it has the same thrust as Rapier, but better ISP vac\u0026amp;atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, my duna lander used four LV T45s and carried the three-man capsule to and from the surface with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T23:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhilst deciding on which engine to use for my duna interplanetary ship, I found that the RAPIER engine rocket mode has both higher thrust and ISP than the LV-N rocket motor.
