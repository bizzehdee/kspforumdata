With all of my favorite mods up to date with 1.2, i just started a new career game, but i\u0027ve run into a small glitch. My maneuver node doesn\u0027t appear on my map screen. The little dot doesn\u0027t show up over my trajectory path. Everything else works. I\u00A0flew by the mun and landed on minmus, but if i plan to have any more complicated missions, i\u0027m going to need that lovely little node. Does anyone have any ideas how i might solve this issue? \u00A0The only mods that i have installed are all the Near Future Tech mods, Extraplanetary Launch Pads, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E,Planetary Bases,\u00A0TAC Life Support, and Module Manager. To my knowledge\u00A0I\u0027ve installed them all correctly, however, my knowledge base on this is only enough to get me into more problems than anything else. Jeb has tried hitting the console with a wrench, but all that did was change the units from Metric to Imperial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jim1240","CreatedById":170701,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T16:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a stupid answer but, did you upgrade your tracking station and your mission control buildings to level 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
