I need to create explosion effects, but don\u0027t know where to start. The explosion will be used for air detonating shells, and the models included in BDAc aren\u0027t suitable for what I\u0027m trying to acomplish, so I need to make my own explosions. Any help would greatly be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
