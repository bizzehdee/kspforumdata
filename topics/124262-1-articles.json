Tyler, I\u0027m not sure why what\u0027s happening to you is happening, but it strongly sounds like something is either deleting files on the KSP install, or perhaps the files are being marked Administrator instead of for anybody. I don\u0027t have KSP on Steam so can\u0027t help with any specifics, that\u0027s just what it sounds like. If you can get the game installed on another drive (lots of computers these days have a D: drive. See if you can install it there. Or at least move it to c:\\ksp\\ or something) and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T12:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn case it\u0027s a Steam issue, you could also try to copy the whole KSP folder to a different location after verifying the downloaded files and play the game from there.
