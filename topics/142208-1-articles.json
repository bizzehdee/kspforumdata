My guess is the only reason Squad has a contract with steam is to spread popularity among the gaming community, and as a consequence more income. But it definitely is a major issue for steam users that run into this problem. To the TS, in the future you can copy and paste your steam KSP data folder to a seperate location or turn updates off.
