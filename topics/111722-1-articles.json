Of course, they are behind in the times, as the KSP community has already had this fantastic technology for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in any case, would it be possible to do rudimentary asparagus staging - and if so, would it be better than simply having onion staging? Take for example, a hypothetic Falcon 10, with one central booster and four outside boosters, and it does a simple asparagus stage, where 2 boosters fall off after having exhausted their fuel supply, leaving the 2 boosters on the side feeding into the central tank. Would this be practical, or am I just crazy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T11:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically you could do an asparagus staging, with 4 boosters and drop two and two. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would require more advanced piping, it would also not be done like KSP piping, but rather having core draw unevenly from the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost realistic would be to run crossfeed from first booster set until dry, then switch and draw from second booster set. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feed booster two from booster one it would be an separate pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll booster has two pipes, booster set 1 has pipe to core and pipe to booster 2, booster set 2 has pipe inn from 1 and out to core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat launch set 1 feeds core and booster set 2, they are dropped and set 2 now feed core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP fuel lines is symbolic.

Whether it can be made practical and reliable is another matter, and it\u0027s a bit of a case of diminishing returns crossfeeding past the first pair of boosters. Plus every staging event is a potential failure point, so fewer stages has some benefits in reliability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T11:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Falcon Heavy already has 28 Merlin engines. Your \u0022Falcon 10\u0022 would have 46. As said above, more parts means more failure points and more cost. There is a point at which it makes sense to simply build a bigger rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you were doing KSP-style asparagus staging, your first pair of boosters would empty really quickly. On a nominal flight the Falcon 9 core stage burns for 180 secs. To feed 45 engines, the first pair of boosters would be empty after only 72 seconds. I\u0027m not sure how fast the rocket will be going after only 72 secs, but it\u0027s probably not worth the extra complexity and risk and the boosters might not be recoverable from such a low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T11:47:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 11:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t asparagus staging cause severe spinning from fuel transfer that would break it apart?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022clivman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022clivman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWouldn\u0027t asparagus staging cause severe spinning from fuel transfer that would break it apart?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, the net rotational torque is near zero.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding from things Musk has said is that they investigated the possibility of asparagus staging as KSP knows it and decided that it just wasn\u0027t feasible yet to pump fuel in the way we know and love.
