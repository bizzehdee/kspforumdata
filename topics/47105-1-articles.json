I remember one time several years back, right after I got the mirror refigured (meaning, they improved the quality of the mirror) on my old 18\u0022 scope, I wanted to see how MUCH they had improved it. Normally, I wouldn\u0027t use a telescope in the backyard owing to the light pollution, but Saturn was visible and would serve as a good test of the mirror\u0027s (hopefully) improved figure. So, I set my scope up in the backyard, connected a big box fan to blow across the back of it (it helps thermally stabilize the mirror, setting up a smooth boundary layer), and then left it for three hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came back out with Saturn high overhead. Now, the highest power eyepiece I had was a 5mm eyepiece giving myself about 410X. In all my years observing the sky, I had never seen that not be enough magnification- normally, the image would break down well below 410X. But that night... it looked like I was looking out a porthole in a spaceship orbiting Saturn. Even at 410X, the image was razor sharp. I would have even seen the Encke Gap if I had simply had a high enough power eyepiece. Titan was a nice, well defined, orange orb, and the cloud bands and their colors were easy and obvious. Now, I can\u0027t say if I remember whether the cloud bands showed any blue, but I can tell you, the above image is at least very close to real color. I\u0027ve observed Saturn many times before and since that one wonderful night, but I\u0027ve never seen it anywhere near to that good again. I actually sold that 18\u0022 scope (quality telescopes have great resale value) for a bigger scope that was better at observing deep space objects, but the bigger scope has a much more temperamental mirror and support structure that keeps it from performing to its best potential most of the time. Some day, I gotta get it fixed... but I\u0027m not much of a planetary observer anyway, I spend 99% of the time observing galaxies and nebulae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the experience prompted me into buying a relatively cheap ($60), 3.5mm planetary eyepiece that has not been used at all yet.

Where I live (in a town) light pollution is quite high, so the further planets are not easily visible, and irritatingly almost all of the other planets were hiding in the glare of the Sun the majority of the first half of this year. I\u0027m currently in university term time, but in theory when I return home to my telescope in December I should be able to employ the same technique on Mars. Next stop would be to find/write a good implementation of motion blur deconvolution so that I can photograph Messier objects cheaply (i.e. without a motorised mount). This does seem to be possible with the right conditions (e.g. most features must have comparable brightness and the motion is simple) according to academic papers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sceptical that a normal 12-inch would be able to resolve exoplanets with any processing technique - surely there\u0027s a reason that only large observatories and space telescopes detect them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I get the time I might upload one or two of the raw frames I captured as well as the processed result sans-level-correction so that you can judge exactly how good this technique is. As a general idea, the best of my initial frames were a bit blurrier and noisier than vetrox\u0027s photo, though with practically no chromatic aberration due to the lack of lenses involved. The worst were funny shapes due to air currents and exhibiting motion blur due to my less than ideal mount. The great thing about AviStack is that it selectively chooses the best parts of each frame (and may well skip several frames) at the same time as figuring out how the frames relate to each other and finding the offset between them (which was quite large as Jupiter tracked across the sky and I kept having to adjust the view to keep it in the small field of view). The settings did require some tweaking on my part before I got good results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T16:00:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ZRM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T16:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JebidiahsBigSister\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JebidiahsBigSister\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, really - that\u0027s quite a nice shot! What size scope did you use and what kind of camera?\u003Cp\u003EAlso to ZRM: Same comments - Wow! Same questions if you don\u0027t mind - very curious.

As jupiter is back in the night sky now I\u0027m going to try and take some more pics of it. Also on a side note. The moon is a great object to look at with a small telescope, there is so much detail and i still get amazed at the size of some of those craters!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
