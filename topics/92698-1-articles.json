As we all know what may work for one may not work for all. Anyhow, on to my revelation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have been trying to optimize and get D3D9 working at a stable level as I prefer to have shadows and a steady simulation rate. After hours upon hours of tinkering and swapping and trying different approaches something dawned on me....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play a modded version of the sim Falcon4, now this came out in 1998 and has been upgraded and improved into one of the best flight sims around for those who know about it. Anyhow I digress. Back in the early days of the heavy modding we were having the exact same problems with memory usage and getting out of memory errors with all the new content. Now those gurus figured out that you could \u0022cheat\u0022 by simply adjusting your virtual memory settings in windows to use a set amount rather than have windows allocate it on its own. It has something to do with how the program sees the swapfile when windows isn\u0027t managing the size, I\u0027m not sure the mechanics of it but it did allow us to continue modding the sim and was a major breakthrough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow tonight I was almost ready to give up and just deal without shadows and a laggy OpenGL mode when I figured I would try this simple trick. Perhaps windows is no better now at managing a swapfile now than it was in the windows xp days? (Windows has always been horrible at this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I set my virtual memory amount on my non system disk to twice my system memory. I figured I would re-cache all the textures so I did \u0022The Dance\u0022 as we used to call it and noticed that while ATM was doing its thing my system memory did not have the extreme spikes and crashes while compressing the textures like it did before. In addition, when it was done with the texture it would not increase memory usage by the amounts it did before when loading large textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you ask, what about in game?

Only the operating system has direct access to the physical RAM addressing scheme, programs never see it. Instead, the memory manager assigns each process an entire memory address range (32-bit or 64-bit, as determined by the program), this space is called virtual memory. The Windows memory manager does the job of translating those virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses. As different programs make different demands for physical memory, the memory manager creates \u0022pages\u0022 of each program\u0027s data, each of which can be removed from physical memory and covered by what is called a \u0022backing store\u0022. A backing store can take two forms: For items that were changed or created after loading from disk, the page is written to disk in a special file called the pagefile, while items that haven\u0027t changed since loading from disk are backed by the original file. This is important, because it means that \u003Cem\u003Edisabling the pagefile doesn\u0027t prevent paging\u003C/em\u003E, it just forces the OS to only page items that are backed by original files. Windows\u0027 memory manager is pretty sophisticated, and its algorithms for determining what to page and in what order are very good but are compromised if the pagefile is unavailable. So never disable the pagefile. Confusingly, Windows overloads the term \u0022virtual memory\u0022 by calling the pagefile by the same term in the control panel, which has resulted in a lot of confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, individual programs have no idea of what is paged and what is not, all they know about is their virtual memory space which as far as they are concerned is all RAM. The OS handles all the assignments to physical RAM and backing stores behind the scenes at a lower level than the programs can \u0022see\u0022. The memory limit for an individual program is determined by the size of its virtual memory address space, it won\u0027t complain about running out of memory until that is exhausted, whether portions have been sent to a backing store or not. Changes to the pagefile size have no effect on the amount of virtual memory available to a program; the size of the pagefile only affects the memory manager\u0027s ability to do its job properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, while I appreciate the OP\u0027s determination to find a workaround for 32-bit\u0027s memory issues, I can\u0027t see how this tweak can possibly help with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theersink","CreatedById":130163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T05:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I can say is it has and does improve performance in some applications.
