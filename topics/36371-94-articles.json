That\u0027s not quite the same error I saw before. So I went and loaded the game, found a part that was all white and checked the log to see what its error was. I can\u0027t find that error now and the part is logged as having compiled properly and its texture loaded properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did however find several of those errors for SDHI chutes. However, the log says earlier before the error that the texture loaded properly and the chute looks the way it should in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(fyi they\u0027re png not tga so I\u0027m no closer to confirming or discarding my tga theory)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
