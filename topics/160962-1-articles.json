(It\u0026#039;s a bug)","CreatedByName":"Aiden.J","CreatedById":177410,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T21:50:40Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Aiden.J","CreatedById":177410,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T21:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have recently discovered a bug, in which, you can clear ALL of your missions, without penalties! All you have to do is get a ton of mods (like me) that lag up a crappy computer (like me) to achieve this! Meaning to go to the Mission Control Center, instead \u0022accidentally\u0022 click on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Then, in the top right corner (where the \u0022leave\u0022 button is), spam your mouse till\u0027 your finger falls off (make sure it is still loading while your spamming). Then, it will load again (without the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E innards appearing), and when you go back to the view of the Space Center, click on the Mission Control Center. Then go to \u0022Active\u0022, and bask in the glory of FREE MONEY!! You get money for accepting contracts, then with this, you get out of them free of penalty. You can always get them back, because they appear in the \u0022Available\u0022\u00A0tab after your leave then come back in (after completing the glitch). WARNING: It also clears your archived missions as well, so if you like bragging about your first launch or building a orbital base around Kerbin, don\u0027t do this glitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut seriously, i was going to go into the MCC, but accidentally clicked on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E (or somewhere in the middle). As explained above, i spammed my mouse to leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E while it was loading, and when i came out, i went into the MCC and all of my missions were cancelled, but i still had my money from accepting them. I also looked at my archives, and they are cleared as well. If you know why this happened, or want to try it yourself, please reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T21:50:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aiden.J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T22:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan it be reproduced?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you add it to the KSP bug tracker with logs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you can do this far more easily with just the debug menu, so it\u0027s an exploit very few would use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aiden.J","CreatedById":177410,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T10:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223065604\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160962\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495579189\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022122674\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Starman4308 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan it be reproduced?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you add it to the KSP bug tracker with logs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you can do this far more easily with just the debug menu, so it\u0027s an exploit very few would use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tried to reproduce it, but i will do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what the KSP Bug Tracker is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know about the debug menu,\u00A0that was just a way to introduce the bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-24T10:26:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2017 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aiden.J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
