So I built a Starfury. If any species was to build spaceships they\u0027d seen in old TV signals, it\u0027d have to be the Kerbals. (Thermians who?) There\u0027s a picture of my original Starfury in the \u0022What did you do today?\u0022 thread from yesterday, if you\u0027re interested. But that \u0022older\u0022 build wasn\u0027t up to my usual standards, so I started over. This is the result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Kerbal SA-23E Mitchell-Hyundyne Starfury (Mk2)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20130706_ksp1354_starfury.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220130706_ksp1354_starfury.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy SA-23E Starfury is intended for use as a short-range tug and/or space intercepter. With limited fuel and monopropellant capacity, the Kerbal Starfury is best kept near its base of operations. In its default package the Starfury has barely enough delta-V for a free-return flight from Kerbin orbit to the Mun. (Just don\u0027t expect to stop back at Kerbin.) Like its counterpart from the Babylon 5 universe it features four radial engine pods, a central core to keep the pilot near the center of rotation, hardpoints for six tools or \u0022weapons,\u0022 an ejectable \u0022lifepod\u0022 cockpit (not currently ejectable), a rear-facing hatch for entering the craft from an airlock, and a towing hitch along the bottom of the ship\u0027s core. The Starfury is NOT rated for atmospheric operations. Snacks are not included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of mass is aligned with the center of thrust, making for a highly maneuverable craft. Center of mass is also aligned with the rear docking port to assist with stability on launch. (Though launches do drift a bit... may be a few grams too heavy on the bottom.) Total vehicular mass is 28.02 metric tonnes, so it\u0027s well within the capabilities of the average heavy-lift launch vehicles. There is a probe core mounted directly in front of the rear docking port. It\u0027s highly advised to \u0022control from here\u0022 using the probe core, as the cockpit is aligned 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA off-angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft handling is aided by a series of Action Groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 1: Toggle \u0022primary\u0022 (rearward-facing) thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 2: Toggle port (left) thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 3: Toggles upper thrusters, (allows for quick flips).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 4: Toggle starboard (right) thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 5: Toggle retro (forward-facing) thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 7: Toggle all RCS pods except those used for translation (aligned with the center of mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup 10: Toggle solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample of a quick lateral spin: With group 1 (primary) active, hit 2, burn, hit 1 and 5, burn to stop rotation, hit 2 to clear the rotation program (after this the retros will be active). Using the action groups takes some practice, but the advertised 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA turn in 1 second is quite possible once you\u0027ve got it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/20130706_ksp1376_starfury.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220130706_ksp1376_starfury.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest downside of this craft is the extreme number of parts I used in its construction. My earlier designs were well over 300 parts, which made it nearly impossible to fly. This version is a hefty 265-parts, though I do have a \u0022mini\u0022 version in the works (if I can get it to cooperate). The mass is also a bit of an issue, as it\u0027s heavier than any of the individual components of my space station were at launch. Refueling can be a bit of a chore, as there are MANY RCS tanks scattered about. I made a point to leave them accessible, but there was only room for one of the larger tanks. And I needed to use the toroidal bipropellant tanks to keep the center of mass where I wanted it, making refueling even more of a chore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: beware of lag. This beast of a ship brings my 2.9GHz MacBookPro to its knees sometimes. (Especially when I\u0027m flying in Mun\u0027s SOI.) Once I\u0027ve finished the \u0022lite\u0022 version of the craft I\u0027ll share it here too. (Because I really want to use it, but the 265 part version is more for looks and demos than actual use.) You may find some benefit from running this craft through the part-reducing/welding mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft is 100% stock KSP. Were I to seek out or make mod parts for it, I\u0027d probably only do so for the cabin, thruster blisters (lateral/vertical thrusters... and maybe the retro thrusters), and the \u0022tail\u0022 bits that go on the end of the thruster pods. The rest looks good to my eyes with stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple more images on my website: (Link temporarily removed) Kerbal SA-23E Starfury\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://0div0.org/files/SA-23E_Starfury.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESA-23E_Starfury.craft\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I built this in the Space Plane Hanger.

This could be stripped down by 10 more parts if you remove the forward RCS pods and the two winglets on top of the central core, even more if you cut back on some of the struts. I had to sacrifice some detail to achieve this small of a ship, but it produced something I can fly (in formation even), so I\u0027m sticking with it for now. Action Groups are identical to those of the full-size Starfury, and it handles just as well. Perhaps a bit better due to the lighter weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne added benefit: The Starfury Mini has a TWR greater than 1, so you can use it in and around the KSC or elsewhere on Kerbin should you so desire.
