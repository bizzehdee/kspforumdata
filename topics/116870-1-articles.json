I\u0027m working my way through a science mode game which has its own challenge, but I figure it\u0027s time to do a large project in sandbox mode, just to see if it can be done. I like the engineering challenge of coming up with equipment that works. Been looking forward to resource mining for some time so would be good to get that operational.\n\nPre-1.0, I\u0027ve been to Duna a couple of times, Jool and Eve (one-way). Never been to Dres, Moho or Eeloo as they don\u0027t seem too interesting (no moons or anything)\n\nHere\u0027s some options I\u0027ve considered so far:\n\n- Exploration of Jool\u0027s moons. Bit of a ripoff of Brotoro\u0027s Long Term Laythe, but should be able to make it mostly self-sufficient with a good mining operation.\n\n- Colonise Eve: Would have to be a colony as realistically they\u0027re not coming back. An orbital outpost running missions to Gilly is also a possibility.\n\n- A surface base on Ike, with excursions to Duna to do some exploring there.\n\n- Asteroid Nomads: Assemble a large mothership that goes cruising between asteroids, with a couple of attached \u0027landers\u0027 that can pillage them for ore. Hope the Kerbals like zero-g.\n\n- Something else?"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:25:23Z","Content":"I say try to develop rovers that can jump the canyon on Dres ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T15:11:36Z","Content":"I like the asteroid cruising idea - I\u0027ve never even seen that done before.\n\nDon\u0027t colonize Eve, [take it from me](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129260-KSP-Wasn-t-Designed-For-This), you don\u0027t want to do that.\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T15:12:39Z","Content":"Tylo-Single-Stage-to-Landing-and-reorbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T16:40:40Z","Content":"Orbital city around Kerbin... yes I mean city not station.

It turned out to be fairly simple to get this main section into orbit.\n\n![vB7LdBJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/vB7LdBJ.png)\n\nFrom front to back: Mk3 cockpit, passenger module, science lab (in cargo bay) ore storage and processing (in cargo bay) liquid fuel tank, LFO tank/adapter, nuke engine (x4) The dual docking ports on each side will allow addition of Mk2-sized side pods containing smaller cargo bays, some more tank space, a couple more engines and docking ports for the mining shuttles (yet to be designed). Then it\u0027s off to colonise space!\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/lasOr](http://imgur.com/a/lasOr)"},{"CreatedByName":"PanzerAce","CreatedById":142172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T22:06:47Z","Content":"I\u0027m building a sort of \u0027Grand Tour\u0027 ship. Running the Atomic age and Near future mods, the idea is to build a giant ship to go to every planet, with the ability to refine ore on the ship, parasite ships to mine the moons it vists, landers for Kerbals to visit surfaces, etc. The current design I\u0027m running for the thruster section alone is ~400 tons when fully fueled. Still trying to decide if I\u0027m going to run LH2 VASIMR engines or an LF nuclear lightbulb for primary thrust....\n\nSince I\u0027m also changing my mind a ton on the design, I went ahead and named the ship \u0022Theseus\u0022...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T19:14:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PanzerAce**"}]}
