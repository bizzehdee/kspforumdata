I don\u0027t know exactly how much fuel needs to be reserved for landing, but Elon said that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/688845689023901696\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elanding on a barge allows staging at 2.5 km/s\u003C/a\u003E. Assuming first-stage gravity losses are on the order of 0.5 km/s, and the\u00A0typical launch mass is\u00A0541.3 tonnes with specific impulse of\u00A0282 s, the rocket equation says that total mass at staging will be 183 tonnes, for a fuel consumption of 358 tonnes. This suggests 37.7\u00A0tonnes of fuel\u00A0must be reserved for landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if three of these are launched together without any upper stage and full crossfeed (not exactly right, but good enough for an estimate), the launch mass is (395.7t \u002B 25.6t)*3 or 1263.9 tonnes. Staging takes place after 716 tonnes of fuel have been consumed, corresponding to a dV of 2.3\u00A0km/s. Since there are three Falcon 9 cores firing simultaneously, gravity drag will be lower -- about 0.2 km/s -- so the true dV is 2.1 km/s, leaving 5.7 km/s of dV to get up to a parking orbit. At this point, gravity drag and aerodynamic drag will be negligible, and the higher vacuum Isp of 311 s can be used, so you\u0027ll need to burn...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...356.4 tonnes of propellant to get to LEO. Leaving you with less than 40 tonnes of propellant. That\u0027s WAY less than I expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s disappointing. Looks like you were right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if the upper stage is launched into LEO without payload using a 2/3-reusable Falcon Heavy? The upper stage has an inert mass of 3.9 tonnes and carries 92.7 tonnes of fuel, for a total mass of 96.6 tonnes. Launch mass will be 1361 tonnes; the same math as before gives a booster separation at 1.7 km/s (allowing 0.3 km/s of gravity/aero drag losses). At this point, the vehicle has a mass of\u00A0518 tonnes and 395.7 tonnes of fuel in the core stage, with a vacuum Isp of 311 s, for a core-stage dV of 4.4 km/s. At core MECO, the craft will be traveling at 6.1 km/s, so the upper stage will need to burn 36.7 tonnes of propellant for final orbital insertion, leaving it with 56 tonnes of propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s an improvement, I suppose, but not much of one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222385197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454095692\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257690\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, sgt_flyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou won\u0027t be able to perform a brachistochrone transfer\u00A0with kerolox to mars - the\u00A0ISP is simply not high enough by severals orders of magnitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsomeone has tried to create a table (a bit difficult to read, and the value includes the takeoff from earth) but you\u0027re still looking at 370000 m/s of delta-v for a 0,01g brachistochrone transfer...

Oops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, this means that if SpaceX were to launch Falcon 9 LEO payloads (10-13 tonnes) using the Falcon Heavy instead, it would cost them around $30 million extra per launch, and leave them with 40\u002B tonnes of fuel in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe brachistrochrone is far more advantageous on the return trip than it is on an outgoing trip.\u00A0Dragon V2\u0027s integrated ballast sled allows for precision attitude and lift control on re-entry, which (if I understand correctly)\u00A0gives it unprecedented aerobraking capabilities; it would be able to execute multiple passes through the atmosphere to bleed off a high transfer speed. Thus, the cost of a return brachistrochrone is only 50-60% the cost of an outgoing brachistrochrone. Plus, while the outgoing trip requires a Mars Ascent vehicle, the return trip does not, allowing the same amount of delta-V to be achieved with far less fuel. The Dragon V2 has a manned persistence of something like two weeks, IIRC....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned above, I think the cheapest manned Martian landing would involve two separate descents: first the\u00A0unmanned ascent vehicle with a propulsive landing, followed by the manned Dragon V2 on an aerobraking trajectory once the ascent vehicle had made a confirmed landing. With the Apollo missions, it didn\u0027t make sense to do two separate landings because there was no way to aerobrake and the ascent delta-V is modest. But splitting them up for a Martian landing would be a significant delta-V savings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ascent vehicle would carry the Earth-return Dragon V2, but it would only need enough dv to get up to Low Mars Orbit. At liftoff, the manned Dragon V2 would mass 8,898 kg, plus a standard Falcon-9 upperstage dry mass of 3.9 tonnes, meaning about 30 tonnes of fuel is needed to reach LMO. By this time, propulsive Falcon-9 stage 1 landings will likely have been mastered, so an upper stage retrofit with landings legs and grid fins should be able to make the descent with the remaining 719 m/s of dV.

Its better to get all your transfer velocity at minimal earth perigee. In fact the horizons space craft did its escape burn before achieve a stable earth orbit. This is because most craft kill engines to mount the apogee before circularizing, but if the apogee trajectory is in line with the desired escape orbit you do not have to waste as much gravity versus time (hoovering, very minute at this point in the flight) losses simply burn an escape vector along the prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy are we seriously discussing these high g-force accel and decel from orbit, we don\u0027 have the energy, we have nothing even close to the energy.

They are light weight spacecraft. We are talking here about manned space station like objects so the mass is a to two magnitude higher, and then talking about direct dV a couple of times what these craft had.
