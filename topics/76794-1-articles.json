Also probably better with real fuels, and TAC and stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to do another interstellar setup. I get too bogged down in trying to use all the different reactors and relays and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither option I can add in stuff like remote tech and EVE/BA as well, I think. But If I try both options, I don\u0027t know if I can have enough memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ll think about it for a few days, also looking for some suggestions or successful combinations of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
