Put it on top of an S1 SRB-KD25k (the biggest stock SRB), using a TR-2V decoupler. Tweak the SRB\u0027s thrust down to 60%, then launch straight up (hit T, hit Space, hands off the controls). The resultant flight will have the SRB burn to about 46 kilometres altitude, with an apoapsis just above 450 kilometres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where\u0027s the phantom force, you ask? Well, if you let it stay in normal 1x time, while clear of the atmosphere, the apoapsis of our unpropelled satellite (and its discarded booster) will tick down by about 1 metre every four to five seconds. Switching to 5x time acceleration freezes the apoapsis, but reverting to 1x time causes it to resume shrinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis behaviour was seen on v0.90.0.705 Beta, via Steam. Yes, this doesn\u0027t sound like much, but when you use the satellite\u0027s own engine to further increase altitude (e.g. to the Mun), it interferes with the high precision needed by such a bare-bones launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T11:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue here is that you shouldn\u0027t be \u003Cem\u003Eable\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 to use 5x warp before you\u0027re at 70km altitude.
