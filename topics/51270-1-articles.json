I\u0027m trying to get a Rockomax Jumbo-64 tank in a stable orbit with *most* of it\u0027s fuel available but able to feed a detachable engine on back. Below it I have a Clamp-O-Tron Sr. Docking Port and then a TR-18D stack separator in front of my poodle engine. I modified my last ship so it had the separator so I could actually dock stuff on the back, before it just wiped out the docking connection. (dunno why)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo describe it in more detail, I\u0027m trying to make a cube, each \u0022leg\u0022 has a 4-point docking ring at one end, engines on the back but dump the engines and keep another sr. ring in place, so 12 of these will make a cube. I saw a video similar to this but they used RCS tanks on 4 of the \u0022sections\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is once I introduced the sr docking clamp ahead of the separator just fore of the engine, now the engine never fires, saying it\u0027s starved for fuel. Do I need a transfer pipe/hose to power it when I need it? Or did I do something really unintended in the design?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought is 2-4 tank squares tied together with 4 verticals and everything using sr docking clamps if I had to move it, or put it farther out in orbit, the doubled-up docking clamps would keep it more intact, considering it\u0027s theoretically 12 full jumbo fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I design the back end of each segment with the sr docking clamp and the separator, it doesn\u0027t get fuel from the big tank to establish a stable Kerbal orbit. (I need it, at least with this design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T04:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStack separator will cut the fuel line.
