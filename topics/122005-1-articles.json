His included rover is great, but not much space for KIS containers on the bed of that rover. I wanted to make a towable trailer to land at the base and use with it. I cannot get it to play nice with a KAS connection, docked or undocked plug-in, though. It just bumps the towing vehicle all over the place, or flips over. Its just a mess. The trailer doesn\u0027t slow down at the same rate as the towing vehicle. And I can\u0027t think of any other way to connect the two and still allow for manoeuvrability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas to make a trailer that will actually allow me to drive sanely and safely.

SAS will be horribly confused by the setup and is not your friend here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Jr ports provide more flex than standard ports. This can be good or bad depending on vehicle size, terrain, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s a bit of immersion breaking when you jack-knife your trailer, since everything is technically one docked ship and won\u0027t collide with itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A landing leg is needed on the trailer hitch to lift it up enough to get the rover hitch under it. You also need a command seat or probe core or something on the trailer to operate the leg.

I used to use couplings like this for the mid generation trains I was driving.. but since then they became extremely hard to steer almost to the point that your breaking physics and tempting the kracken by trying to turn and or tow something\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe solution for me was a 2 fold thing..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENEVER\u003C/strong\u003E use the small docking port to tow anything.. not in current versions.. around 0.20 it used to be ok.. but even then I put that cone shaped spacer between a locomotive and her wagons..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the best case scenario using the small docking port with or without a spacer will pull the docking port away from the rolling stock physicly while being bound to the same object still.. giving an extreme rubber banding effect that pulls everything different ways all the time in a very unpredictable way.. .. if you \u003Cstrong\u003EMUST \u003C/strong\u003Euse this small docking port for towing for any reason its only good for shunting or slow speed operations.. im approaching this from a train perspective but it translates the same into a car/trailer also\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euse the docking port.. not jr or sr.. the plain docking port.. it works quite well but as previously mentioned they made it strong as hell post 1.0.. if you want something to smoothly turn.. put it on the end of that cone shaped truss. it\u0027ll still transfer fuel and electricity.. but it\u0027ll have the elastic properties and smooth turning you want. I use them from 3 to 5 car fuel wagon trains and it does me well.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim taking a little leave from trains myself while I deal with real world issues.. but I was just floating around the forums when I saw this.. so PM me if you want any more advise or post here and i\u0027ll check back maybe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas an example i\u0027ll post a modern video of former 40 class #3 on her maiden mainline testing.. poor girl didnt last too long.. but you\u0027ll see how the couplings work.. all this is using stock or close to stock.. so I dont know how using mods would go.. they may be too slack and free pivoting for hauling anything with a degree of accuracy..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealways disable steering on any towed vehicle too.. also helps to kill off the electric motors of a trailer.. use the lead unit as a locomotive..or if you must only power the back wheels of every 4 wheeled trailer.. no steering ..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep the speed below 30m/s as well. things get a little scary above that and the rear most wagon will start dancing.. take corners slow.. accelerate on straights.. standard stuff really for any heavy equiptment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eshould yield the results your looking for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(although things are better with more than 1 trailer.. aka..a train \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the only \u0022modern\u0022 video I have.. the rest are post 1.0 so the couplings act differently\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wu-AkeNCuS0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
