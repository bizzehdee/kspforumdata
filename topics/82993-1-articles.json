I want to redecorate it with a class A asteroid I\u0027ve put in Minmus orbit. However, since the base is in a slope, if I just toss the asteroid in its general direction, even with the horizontal speed killed, it will roll over and probably end up going down a cliff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I want to put it gently on the surface and, once is there probably use a rover to secure it in place. So I built a large skyhook sort of ship and attached the Claw to a Infernal Robotics hydraulic column (to gently put it down), but the asteroid kept bouncing off the Claw. So I ask in the IR thread, and they confirm it docking parts don\u0027t work well with IR. Ok. I use the KAS winch. Same issue. Maybe it\u0027s something with mods with movable parts. So I attach it directly to an RCS tank, pointing downwards.
