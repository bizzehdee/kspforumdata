Launch it up and try to dock, that you don\u0027t have to jump ship to ship and reset RCS and SAS/ Smart A.S.S. then jump back and wait for each ship to load. Basicly You make a station you get it into orbit, set RCS and SAS to on. Return to space center, goto space hanger make a Single stage to orbit ship, fly into space and move to your station. While docking you make a noob mistake and bump the station. The game goes \u0022Oh this station has its RCS and SAS on\u0022 And the station (provided it has power, RCS fuel, and a kerbalnaut or AI) fires its RCS, or spins up, or down its stabilization wheels to stop the station from spinning out of control. All this happens WITHOUT having to jump into station wait to load the station parts, Set them and then jump back out, wait, THEN dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some people that have LARGE piece stations this is a godsend as they won\u0027t have to wait for 1000 plus parts to load and can just dock and wait once for them all to load after docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T13:22:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 01:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Damaske\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChange of goal.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T13:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure what you\u0027re proposing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have SAS, which does what you\u0027re suggesting.

I left it to make a new section for it and once i got up there is was slowly spinning froward and 45 degrees from upright position. And once i got closer i can tell that is was also in a clockwise spin. If the game remembers if RCS/SAS is one and holds it position what would cause the station to do something like that? The station was only the middle part and i had no arms attached to it. However the middle piece did contain a modded part from Davon supply mod, and was in the current build sandbox mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is not a bug, or something that i am just missing then the only thing i can think of was a random space junk strike, as i did see a few fly past me as i was getting closer to the station. Since then i have been cleaning up the junk with the tracking station. On a side note, i just thought of a mod that might be cool. A guided missile or weapon system that you can fire from the ground and hit orbiting space junk destroying it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T14:37:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Damaske\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
