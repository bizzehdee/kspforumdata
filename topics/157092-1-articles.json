I\u0027m not saying it should work in stock, or just be a mod, whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if at the beginning of career, we would only have access to SRBs. AND also to drill, converter and related parts. (or just drill and container) We would have to set up some mining facilities to get liquid fuel. The amount of mines would limit the amount of fuel our rocket can carry. The idea is to get rid of mine\u0026gt;convert\u0026gt;transfer mechanism at this point. Mines would just work constantly. But only on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you couldn\u0027t just spread 30 mines around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, because their efficiency would be the same as one. Let\u0027s say that one mine inside a circle with 15-20km radius works as good as 30 of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow that\u0027s more complex than I thought it would be an hour ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-28T11:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFine for a mod but I wouldn\u0027t want to see it in the stock game as it currently plays.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf - and it\u0027s a very big \u0027if\u0027 it were implemented in stock, I\u0027d want to see the following features added too:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbility to simply buy in whatever fuel I need, so that I can get in with running a space program without having to run a mining conglomerate too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave different fuels and manufacturing facilities.
