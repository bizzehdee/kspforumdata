You mine using the drill to gather resources, and recover the vessel with the resource. The resource will be converted into money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObjective: Build a miner (fixed in the ground) to get the most funds in 1 launch in the shortest time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Start in new career. Difficulty options set to Normal. Only use stock parts. Use of ISRU converter is allowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2, Use of alt\u002Bf12 or cheat mods are \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E allowed to give funds, or science to unlock parts (feel free to unlock entire tech tree), but not for anything other than unlocking parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Time warp is allowed (because I see some electric consumer generates energy instead of consuming energy in high time warp).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Use of an engineer is allowed, maximum 1 engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Build it in VAB, not SPH. Launch it in Launchpad, not Runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Breaking the Launchpad means repairing it again, and the repair cost will be deducted from your funds you get from mining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Mine in Kerbin since you will not go to space today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. (NEW) Tell me the versions you used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. (NEW) Miner must not launch, it have to stay in launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. I can\u0027t think of anything goes wrong from this set of rules, so have fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScoring:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScore = (Product ^ 2) / Time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProduct (F) = Funds required to build the miner - Funds from recovering the miner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime (in seconds). Be aware of what time you are using (Kerbin or Earth)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBackground:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSC got bankrupt. They have no money to build rockets anymore. Moreover, Walt Kerman is away for vacation (so there is no Bail-Out Grant). Fortunately, there are a banks (Kerbin Banks?) that are willing to give us a loan up to 100000000 Funds. However, the money have to be returned after 1 launch or 1 Kerbin years whichever come first, and no more loaning. If the money isn\u0027t fully returned (even missing 1 Fund counts), the bank will shut down KSC (forever?). Completing an interplanetary contract would take more than a year. Completing a local contract yields too little money to fend off the bankruptcy. An important meeting is held for discussing on how to save the KSC. One kerbal suggested to start a mining program. How they will make the most of their miners? Will the KSC be saved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two KSP versions. That means I need to separate two versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScoreboard coming soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it! If there\u0027s any flaw (I am not perfect), please let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-08T12:34:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2016 12:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Anbang11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
