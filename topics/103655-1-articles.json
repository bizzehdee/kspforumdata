If you\u0027re going to have a nose up orientation on the runway, you need to have enough lift to get completely off the ground.

I\u0027d cut it back down to three wheels, make sure the rear pair are positioned just a bit behind the COM so you can get the nose up easily. If you really feel like you need more wheels put them together, so essentially you still only have 3 points of contact (just the rear point are wider). Also have them perfectly perpendicular, angled wheels can work but only in a three wheel config."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T01:39:49Z","Content":"As others have been saying:\n\n\\* Straighten your landing gear.\n\n\\* Put the rear gear just in front of CoM.\n\n\\* If you have tailstrike problems, raise the gear on hardpoints.\n\nSee the first few posts of the ***Kerbodyne*** thread and my build videos (both linked below) for tips."},{"CreatedByName":"Miro Beero","CreatedById":67935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T03:27:13Z","Content":"Success.\n\nI added an extra wing flap on the side near the front and got rid of all the extra wheels, and moved the 2 back wheels up to be with the Center of Mass.
