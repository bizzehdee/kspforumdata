The rocket will probably sway back and forth, due to ASAS. when you get used to controlling stuff, you can stop this sway manually, but for now, no harm in letting it settle down itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) keep watching the rocket climb and keep an eye on the fuel levels. somewhere around 27000m altitude (roughly) the outer 4 tanks will empty and the outer engines will quit. when this happens, hit space again (once) to stage and dump these empty tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) press \u0027m\u0027 to switch to map mode. rotate the view around so you can see your orbit path and also click the ^ at the bottom center of the screen to bring up the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Hover your mouse over the \u0027Ap\u0027 symbol as your rocket climbs, (still in map mode) and when your apoapsis hits 100000m, hit \u0027x\u0027 to shut off the engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) coast until your 1:20 or so away from apoapsis then (you can time warp if you want but you shouldn\u0027t have to wait long)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8)hold down F then D again to start rolling towards the horizion along the 90 line using the navball. This ship has a lot of mass and no RCS other than the pod, so it might not seem to do much at first, but it WILL turn eventually. Once it starts moving, let off the D key, but keep F pressed. when it gets to the 10 degree line or so let off on F, then when the horizion line passes through the dot in the V, tap F again to reset the point ASAS is trying to center to..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) by this time, you should be 25 seconds from apoapsis.. hold down shift to start your circularization burn how.. open it to 100% throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) while the burn is happening, hold down F once more and try to get the dot centered on the 90 line and the horizon line (that divides the blue/brown) using the WASD keys.. (turning will likely be more responsive under thrust since one of the first stage engines is gimbaled ) It\u0027s not super critical, close is really good enough for your first orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11)keep an eye on the planet while your burning, as soon as \u0027Pe\u0027 appears, mouse over it and be ready to hit X once again to kill the engines once it gets to 100000m as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Congratulations, if everything worked, and nothing exploded, you should be in a relatively circular orbit at 100km over Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-14T04:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2012 04:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Qumefox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blossm13","CreatedById":22021,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T04:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bagg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bagg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, before you start trying to get space stations into orbit, try just doing simple orbital test with the smaller parts.
