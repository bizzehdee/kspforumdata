Therefore, I guess most players avoid using command seats this way, since it kinda feels like cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, would this kind of tactic possible in real life? the problem with a flaming atmospheric reentry in a chair is obvious. Also, being unprotected to radiations during a month long trip would pose problems. However, let\u0027s say you somehow were interested in going on something hard to land on like tylo with a docked lander and then getting out as fast as possible. In game, by simply using a chair, you can achieve this with a far smaller lander than with the 600kg lander can. what kind of minimal weight do you think a real-life command module to land on something like tylo (then immediately take off) would need to be? Also, I\u0027m curious about what kind of autonomy a spacesuit has.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T09:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a real world example there is planned, later abandoned Lunar Escape System (LESS).
