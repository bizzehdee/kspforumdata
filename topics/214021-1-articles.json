Upon further inspection I noticed that my engine was somehow crooked and no longer properly oriented from its parent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r/KerbalSpaceProgram - Need help with my ship!!\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/c4to8shda0la1.png?width=1920\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;v=enabled\u0026amp;s=a0ab48016015bfb9001b0eb70603892658954f24\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs seen in the picture above the engine is no longer properly mounted onto the reaction wheels that make up its parent. Upon reloading the save in an attempt to see if this would correct the issue, it seemed to get worse...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/720163972413915177/1080262444368269312/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the engine has a visible gap between its parent and I can see inside the model itself. At first I thought that the texture had somehow been misplaced, but upon trying to see if I could pass through the bottom of the engines, which would\u0027ve had no hitbox if the texture was just wrongly positioned, I was met with a hitbox. The entirety of this engine, despite being longer and featuring a gap, somehow has a hit box that accurately reflects the new space taken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/720163972413915177/1080263388652912680/image.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs shown above, Bill is attempting to pass through the gap, but there is a hit box in the way. Somehow the entire SWERV engine model has become broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had first noticed this engine problem \u003Cb\u003Eafter I had redocked from a Duna lander departure. Reverting through saves shows that the most likely\u00A0\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cb\u003Eoccurrence was during the separation of the two craft.\u00A0\u003C/b\u003EAfter trying a select few saves that would put me back where I\u0027d need to be to continue, and none providing a fix for the current bug, I find myself here. After the initial appearance of this bug it seemed to travel through different save files. The bug only cleared when I went back far enough. I can not report on any significance of the file that did not load up with the bug, as even that file had the crooked engine.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TImjfjdd","CreatedById":179902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T12:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed similar issues with other parts too, stuff like lights and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters often get a weird offset during a mission.
