There are two parts, the radial parachute and the goo container. Both have a mass of 0.15, yet in game it behaves as if the radial parachute has more mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst some experiments to try:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Build a ship with a radial parachute on one side and a goo container on the other. Under thrust the ship will tip toward the side with the radial parachute (even with moderate SAS torque).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Build a tower out of girders and put radial parachutes all down one side and an equal number and placement of goo containers on the other. No matter the alignment it will always tip over toward the parachutes as soon as it spawns.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked into the part files and the only difference I could find was angularDrag. The goo is 2 while the parachute is 3. This would explain the ship tipping, the parachute is creating more drag and pulling that side of the ship down. It might also explain the tower, perhaps when it spawns the small movement in which it \u0027settles\u0027 is enough for the imbalance in drag to tip it over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you continue flying the ship out of the atmosphere it gets weird. Even without an atmosphere the ship still wants to tip toward the parachute when under thrust. Even if you first use time warp to remove all rotational velocity as soon as thrust is applied the phantom mass imbalance kicks in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone help me understand what is going on? Could the mass center of mass for the parts be different (meaning the 0.15 is farther away from the ships center on one side, moving the ships center of mass in that direction). The parachute is much closer yet it seems to be the one shifting the mass toward it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T22:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone help me understand what is going on?

It\u0027s not going to cause you to spin -- quite the contrary, it will dampen any tendency to spin.

However, it\u0027s definitely the case that your orbit can change as you spin around. I\u0027ve heard that be attributed to your orbit being set by the location of your cockpit. At the same time, you can change your orbit by spinning around and transferring fuel back and forth (because angular momentum isn\u0027t maintained when you transfer fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Philoman","CreatedById":88477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T23:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike when Apollo 13 had to move things from the LEM to the CM because of the weight balance, so they would stay on the right trajectory?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T23:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith more experiments it seems to be the center of mass is the issue, the difference in angular drag is likely a red herring (unless it has some effect on a part\u0027s center of mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goo container\u0027s center of mass seems to be very close to where it attachs to the side of the ship.
