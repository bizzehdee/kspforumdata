VERY. My reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You would probably not be able to burn up the entire planet do to different gas densities separating to different layers of the planet, and if a non-flammable gas were to settle somewhere at a certain \u0022layer\u0022 it would create a fire-retardant wall, stopping the combustion from \u0022eating away\u0022 other layers. Also, you would probably just change the chemical composition of the planet, as it would take RIDICULOUS amounts of force to overcome the gravity of all that gas. I guess the leftover gases from the combustion could still be called Jupiter or Saturn. It all depends on what you consider as what.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T02:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat chemical reactions?
