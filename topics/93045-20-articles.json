I love the idea of it, but I\u0027m confused by some things. Firstly, the how-to seems to indicate that I should be able to put a thermometer and barometer on my first sounding rocket, but those don\u0027t appear to be researched (and they don\u0027t show up in the first two nodes I can see). I\u0027m using the (modified) community tech tree. This makes getting research hard early on; about the only source seems to be the build-based research from KCT (on account of having to make ~10 rockets to get one where the engines don\u0027t loose thrust or shut down early). Then, once I\u0027d finally accumulated the 25 RP needed, I tried to unlock the Early Orbital Rocketry tech, but KCT tells me it will take 625 DAYS to complete the research, despite having put two points into research (it says 1RP/day, which seems like it should get that tech done in 25 days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs all of this \u0022working as intended\u0022, or is there something messed up with my install?
