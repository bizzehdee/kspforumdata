(Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Jool, and Laythe) can be taken to be the same atmospheric density, and the dropoff of decay above that is dependent mainly on the acceleration of gravity adjusted for altitude (which determines how fast atmospheric density lapses).\u00A0 Eve has higher gravity than Kerbin, but a much thicker atmosphere, so its interface is higher, but the decay force drops off a little faster.\u00A0 The same is true, in spades, for Jool (complicated by not having an actual surface).\u00A0 This is still just a simple arithmetical calculation, with variables for each body (gravity and radius to atmospheric limit).\u00A0 This gives a retarding force, just as drag does in the atmosphere proper, but with a far lower value and little or no consideration to shape -- only frontal area and density really affect it (you could include a factor for number of shock fronts, since it\u0027ll always be supersonic for the medium, but that may be an unnecessary
