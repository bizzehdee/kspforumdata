The graphics and whole idea looks great, but I have to be honest--the faux-kid\u0027s voice was pretty grating. It also got me to thinking:\u00A0 will all the accents for the English-speaking tutorials be American?\u00A0 With all the work of diversifying the Kerbals, I hope that long-term they will diversify the tutorials as well. I am American by birth, but I would really like to hear some Irish, Aussie, Kiwi, Indian etc --- And of course, our favorite Scottsman!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd age-diverse accents as well.\u00A0 Many, many of us who play this are not 12 (and I am not sure at age 12, I would have responded well to the voice-over I heard). This is a game that appeals over all age groups, and all nations. I think the VOs need to reflect that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy 2 cents/pence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakitess","CreatedById":89253,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T12:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust hope we will quickly be able to do our own community VoiceOver thanks to a mod or an official support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m French and I would be okay to do so for our community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
