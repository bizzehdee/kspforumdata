It\u0027s quite a lot heavier than other jet engines and that odd squarish bit coming out one side gets in the way mounting sometimes. It also needs high atmospheric pressure to work? - flame out at 11,000m on Kerbin was a fair surprise. The drag is fairly high, not usually a problem but I\u0027m using FAR for plane testing.

And the KintakeAir doesn\u0027t act like regular intake air. Instead of going away gradually with altitude, KintakeAir goes away all at once if the engine\u0027s operational parameters are exceeded.

Some careful mounting will let you place a stage behind a single centered engine. The Kethane engine doesn\u0027t work with high-altitude screamers, but it works great if you fly low or slow.

It flies on 2 of the Firespitter electric props supplied by both the solar panels and the Kethane generator. That generator is SCHWEET, only running as and when needed (which is what gave me the idea), thus just barely sipping on Kethane most of the time. So the solar panels do most of the work with the generator assisting when the sun\u0027s at a bad angle, or the plane is banked away from it, or at night.
