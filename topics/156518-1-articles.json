And connected to this but above all the possibility to create colonies! Yes, colonies! I dream of Kerbals moving and talking autonomously after landing on Duna and creating a little colony maybe controlling or repairing (a sort of scripted thing, or something like this) with a pad or a screwdriver in their hands: obviously if i want to take control of them i will do by clicking an apposite button and maybe doing a mission with a manned rover, then returning to base and re-giving control to IA. I think that the biggest thing that this wonderful game lacks is \u0022life\u0022, when i land on a planet if i do not control a Kerbal, he will stay there (forever alone) years and years without moving until i decide to re.take control of them. It\u0027s not a critic, i love this game, it\u0027s only a little fact and a big suggestion as i can see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS Maybe also Kerbals moving and living in a Space Station would be really wonderful, hopping with no gravity in the interior of the SS but without exiting it, they could exit maybe only with direct control of user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-16T12:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a on/off difficulty feature, yes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout, no.

When a craft is landed, for example, the crew should have a toggle to remain in the craft, or to behave normally. In the latter case, they should autonomously EVA. Scientists would walk around and take samples, engineers would walk around and kick the tires, pilots would walk around. On orbit, they would EVA on a tether, perhaps. They need not\u0022do\u0022 anything too important, but it would be so much more alive if you landed at a base, or docked with a station while kerbals were actually doing something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StupidAndy","CreatedById":171175,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-18T23:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand you could make them do useless things on the space stations or bases and stuff, like install batteries on the side of the station, and they have the EVAs last longer then three seconds, so it could make them do things you don\u0027t like to do!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoutman1121","CreatedById":175081,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-18T23:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a pretty good idea.
