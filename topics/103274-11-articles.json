I think there was some confusion around this whole topic. It sounded like 99% of the features they announced (excluding maybe the Delta V or engineer report?) were going to be in. When they were talking about adding more features instead of doing more bug fixing I think it had to do with more features beyond what was already announced for 1.0 (i.e. more planets/moons/whatever)."},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody_1707","CreatedById":42582,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T18:11:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I suspect 1.0 will run better than .90, which is reason enough to get hyped on its own.\n\nYes, I suspect that too.
