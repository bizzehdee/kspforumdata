First, obviously, you\u0027ll need to convert the png textures to dds, which can be done in paint.net or in KSP4DDS or whatever that utility is called. Second, the way the 0.9 configs reference the relevant .mu files needs to be updated. Previously to this version, from what I\u0027ve seen, the B9 configs did not include the .mu file extension in the file path; this is something you\u0027ll need to add for KSP not to lock up on the loading screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maars","CreatedById":125934,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers for that.
