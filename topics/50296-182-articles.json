Also noticed that it\u0027s MUCH MUCH harder now for space-planes to re-enter. I\u0027ve used FAR\u002BDRE since 0.24 and my normal re-entry method is causing the cockpits and other critical parts to explode from overheating at like 55km up. I\u0027m starting from a 100km circular orbit, burning retrograde 1300km downrange (as per MJ2), setting my landing point near KSC.. then pointing due east, 0 degrees pitch, locking speedbrakes on, and riding it in. That\u0027s always worked before, and now it doesn\u0027t - is this potentially due to some kind of bug (the cockpit seems to get super hot super fast, and I thought these were shielded? Mk2 and Mk3 cockpits) - or is this now more realistic, and I need to change my procedure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake your reentry angle a lot shallower. That sounds way too steep. You\u0027re going to want to be halfway around the planet, roughly. I can\u0027t say for sure exactly if it\u0027s more or less with FAR. Probably more than halfway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd make your pitch about 35 degrees. You have some leeway but you want to increase your cross section. Increase drag and lift and do as much braking as you can high up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final warning: If you have the overheat gauges on, they WILL light up, even following my advice. That\u0027s the skin temperature. However, as long as you\u0027re not coming in too steep then it\u0027ll be in thermal equilibrium and not explode. (though again; I haven\u0027t done a reentry with FAR very recently so you might not be able to do enough braking high up. I may need to bump up the skinMaxTemp value on those parts. But it works in stock aerothermo)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T02:57:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T07:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E35 degrees huh?

Seems like if I combine stock radiators with Interstellar radiators in any way (including Mk2 cargo bays which you have to toggle the internal radiator off in-flight, can\u0027t do from SPH/VAB), things like to randomly explode.. especially when docking with another craft.

But this version ain\u0027t behaving for me. During reentry parts don\u0027t experience FLUX changes so nothing heats up.
