I try to get mechjeb to calculate an interplanetary transfer (kerbin - Jool) and it dies, or so I think. It will happily spit out a trajectory and I burn the burn. It turns out that was nowhere near getting me even into SOI. It happens again and again, and gets annoying.

Have Mechjeb do your transfer burn, then have it fine tune closest approach to target (you may have to wait until you are outside the SoI to do this) and set it to something like 20km (My standard orbit for a planet without an atmosphere). At that point, oce that node is executed (it should only be a few m/s) you should get your encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T12:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoving this to General Add-on Affiars, the place for all your mod-related questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T12:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wabbit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wabbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am using the latest version of MJ\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefine what you mean by that.
