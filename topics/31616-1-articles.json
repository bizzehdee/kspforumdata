I tried flipping up the rover on its side and building onto it from there, but when I went to put landing legs on it, the legs were oriented cylindrically towards the \u0022sides\u0022 of the rover, rather than around the bottom of the rocket\u0027s fuel tank. I could try building the rocket under it, but getting it off of the rocket\u0027s nose and safely onto the surface seems like a challenge. can anyone tell me what I should do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA link to a screenshot of my rover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://tinyurl.com/lwha835\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tinyurl.com/lwha835\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camelotking524","CreatedById":58776,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T02:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry Something Like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img541/4040/screenshot27u.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T02:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the main issue is that the seat is on the top, so the only way I could think of it coupling to something is from the bottom.

This way you can undock the car and go drive around. When you get done, you pull under the transport and reconnect to the docking port. Done by lowering the landing legs to raise the car.
