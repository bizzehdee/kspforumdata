I\u0027ve managed to get a behemoth of a space station with Science Lab and dock-able lander into a 75km circular more-or-less equatorial orbit around the Mun. However, in true Kerbal style I didn\u0027t bother to test it out and so to Jeb\u0027s chagrin, the lander has enough fuel to get down to the Mun but not back again to the station at 75Km. I would\u0027ve thought 200 units of fuel would be enough, but the weight of all Jeb\u0027s snacks is just too much. Or, more likely, I\u0027m simply burning fuel really inefficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m unable to get back into the game until the weekend and this question has been bugging me, so I\u0027m hoping some kind member can inform me before then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027d like to know - if I lower the orbit of the station to say, 15Km, would that reduce the fuel requirements of my lander?

You also need to consider that at that altitude you would be limited to 10x time warp. However, a different landing/ascent trajectory could make much more of a difference. In the ideal landing, you lower your Pe to just above the surface and get most of your deceleration done just above the ground. You want to time it just right so you finish your burn just above the ground. Ascent follows a similar path where you reach orbital velocity and kick your Ap up to 75km while still just above the ground.

But rasing orbit from 15 to 75km is not that much compared to what getting at orbit takes (about 600m/s) and well within safety margin you should have. Get Flight Engineer mod and ask him what he thinks about your lander. You just need to undock and look at total delta-v in \u0022vessel\u0022 tab. If you are under about 1200, you wont make it back no matter what. 1500 should be enough to have a few seconds of \u0022hover\u0022 time and a spare bit for small plane change. More then that is a waste since you will be hauling dead weight down and back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso look at TWR of your lander. If you have big engines, you can go close to suicide burn to spare fuel (read: do breaking burn very low) but you need some experience to pull that off. (or lots of loading :-). Generaly speaking, with TWR under 3.0 you stick to shallow descent paths, with 5.0 or more you can fall from higher up. Also, know that ascent from mun work different then from kerbin. You dont need to waste fuel getting off atmosphere, turn to 90 immediately and once you are clear of terrain (should be a second unless you are in really deep crater), you can begin chase the horizon. With apopasis over 5000m you sholud be already leveled and building orbital speed. You can cut off once apoapsis is over 10000m and do circularization burn there. Any orbit over 8000m is good and from there you can either go for your station or bring it down to meet you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would advise to bring it to about 32km anyway \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 its close to surface but high enough for decent timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T18:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022whoshotdk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022whoshotdk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...I would\u0027ve thought 200 units of fuel would be enough...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hidden thing in what everyone else has said is \u0022200 units of fuel doesn\u0027t say anything about what you can \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022 A gallon of fuel in your car might let you drive 50 miles.

Lowering the station closer will also save you fuel in the long run. For example, a hohmann transfer from 60k orbit to 200k will need about 100 delta-v. This is extra delta-v you will need to use every time you want to go down to or up from the mun surface. It will also help with rendez-vous maneuver window calculations. Also, what Pecan said. The engine thrust doesn\u0027t change your velocity but your momentum, which takes the ship\u0027s mass into account.

Plane changes are prohibitively expensive on low orbits and you are better off on equatorial orbit anyway.

If you really want polar orbit, do it on arrival, imediately after SOI change. Plane changes are cheap when you are slow.
