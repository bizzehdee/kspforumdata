One difference is that I finally installed Kerbal Engineer in the middle of my .23 save, when I went challenging TyMoholEve. But starting fresh, having KER doesn\u0027t seem right. So my first and foremost question is where on the science/tech tree would you put KER?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich got me thinking about where other stuff should go on the tech tree. Thing that are in stock and some features provided by mods. And should they be unlocked on pure science and only science? Perhaps some things could be unlocked by reaching milestones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe something as simple as basic instrumentation (navball, altimeter etc.) could be unlocked after a suborbital lob. I can just imagine Jeb reporting back to the engineers \u0022Wow that was fun, but I could use some way of knowing where I\u0027m going and where I\u0027m pointing guys.\u0022 That same lob could also unlock the \u0022Ten Times Time Dilator,\u0022 (Time warp) with more advanced Dilators coming available just as you need them. Maneuver nodes after an orbital mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like ladders could be unlocked with science points, but also unlocked after using RCS to board a landed vessel 5 or 10 times (with the same kerbal). You\u0027d think after awhile Bob would be thinking there has to be a better way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb (haven\u0027t tried it) would be a fairly advanced autopilot, in the top half of the tech tree. The piloting skills (Launch, land, dock) could be unlocked with repetition, or with science points for people who really want it. Engineering data would be in the lower half of the tree; build and flight engineers could be separate. KER\u0027s reference bodies would only be unlocked after being visited by at least a science probe. KAC features would be tied to the time dilator and flight engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think? What features would you like to see unlockable, and where would you put them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T22:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo my first and foremost question is where on the science/tech tree would you put KER?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf KER had the MJ functionality of revealing bits as you go along I\u0027d go for that, but for the most part it\u0027s mostly just maths, so the starting node is as good a place as any. For instance, delta-V in the VAB should always be available, as should TWR and such (think of it as your army of slide-rule bearing randos). There are certain telemetry items that might not be appropriate for the first node and that could maybe be unlocked later in one of the electronics nodes, like periapsis, apoapsis, that sort of thing that (I think) is more gleaned from ground control radar (earlier) or GPS sats (later).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T01:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep all discussion on the development of KSP to the \u003Cem\u003EDevelopment Discussion\u003C/em\u003E section.
