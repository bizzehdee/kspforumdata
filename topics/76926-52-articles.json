For example, I was in a suborbital trajectory on an intersect course with a stranded kerbal in orbit, and when we came within loading distance, the kerbal was suddenly in a suborbital trajectory as well. This most likely has to do with the physics range extension feature of BDArmory. You may want to remove BDArmory if you are playing KSP for real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the inconvenience - this is still in \u0027Addon Development\u0027 for a reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - I was still able to save the kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... it was your mod doing the match velocity thing.
