The technology exists and has existed since the 1970s to refine the waste, separate out those components that can\u0027t be reused, and reuse the rest.\n\nWhat would have to be stored are tiny amounts of materials with short half lives, storage times for these would be measured in months to years, not decades.\n\nYou\u0027re talking about a few test tubes of materials per year from an average size nuclear power station.\n\nBut we\u0027re prohibited by law from doing that, law created as a knee jerk reaction in response to environmentalist fear mongering in the 1980s that drummed up the image in peoples\u0027 minds that all nuclear power stations are nuclear bombs, that nuclear waste is pure raw material to make nuclear bombs from and that the only way to prevent countries from doing that is to prohibit the refinement of nuclear waste into nuclear fuel and other useful materials.\n\nThese laws have made nuclear energy massively more expensive, both directly by removing a very viable source of raw materials for nuclear fuel (and making countries without Uranium deposits far more dependent on those that do have them, especially the USSR (now Russia), and indirectly by massively increasing the cost of waste disposal.\n\nIt is now known that those very protests and disinformation campaigns were in fact instigated and paid for in large part by the KGB as part of their anti-nuclear weapons campaigns in the west designed to weaken NATO."},{"CreatedByName":"blou04","CreatedById":63156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:53:43Z","Content":"To sum up, it\u0027s a viable idea that\u0027s just no going to happens because of the stigmatization of nuclear power?"},{"CreatedByName":"fairytalefox","CreatedById":115320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:26:24Z","Content":"What would stop a suicide welder with a cutting torch from digging a hole to such reactor and gaining access to a mixture of highly active isotopes?"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:59:25Z","Content":"I would imagine that even being close enough to the core to do damage to it would expose someone to enough gamma radiation to kill them before they even got out of the reactor building.

It would literally cook them.\n\nAdditionally, the core breach created by one person with a cutting torch wouldn\u0027t cause the reactor to catastrophically fail. At most, it would make the control systems SCRAM the reactor, shutting it down until power plant workers can figure out what happened and fix it.\n\nI forgot to mention, nuclear power plants are also surrounded by a big fence with video monitoring and armed guards, too.
