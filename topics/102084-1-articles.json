My question is, would it be not only possible, but feasible and permitted to change ownership of a Thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask this because I just joined a company with a rather massive thread, containing all kinds of goodness, development notes for certain craft, especially joint projects, the entire companies craft repository, and so on and so forth. The person maintaining the OP is planning on leaving the company, at least thats what they posted, and I was thinking it would be a shame to let all that go to waste. Especially since the amount of views and replies add a lot to a companies prestige.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T17:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible, but depends on a few things.
