The RCS,SAS,any keys on the keyboard, staging, etc. nothing works besides the esc menu to go back to the space center. The space center and other vehicles work fine, just not the ones that I have used max warp on. \n\nScreenshots: [http://imgur.com/a/uQz2K](http://imgur.com/a/uQz2K)\n\nSave Files: [https://www./folder/ed0wedaaylpeu/Kerbal_Space_Program](https://www./folder/ed0wedaaylpeu/Kerbal_Space_Program)\n\nOutput log: Same link as above\n\nSystem info: Same link.\n\nThis has been going since Beta, I tried uninstalling google chrome and that didn\u0027t help it either.

Hit max warp to enjoy a few trips around Kerbin, back to normal and then nothing. Can\u0027t turn, throttle, stage, nothing. Just by luck found a way around it. Went to the Tracking Station, selected my rocket on the screen, and hit the \u0027FLY\u0027 button.
