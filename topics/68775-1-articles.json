If you wouldn\u0027t mind elaborating a bit more on why you believe you were a victim of the CVE-2014-0160 or Heartbleed bug, I would be grateful. From what I can understand, this is not an attack on your personal pc, but rather an attack on a service provider, such as the KSP forums, which leads to the exposure of any private information stored on that server.
