It covers all United States from the Eastern Seaboard to midway through Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and completely covers Georgia but ends at the Georgia-Alabama state line. Right now, however, when Daylight Savings Time is in effect, it becomes Eastern Dated Time, and only 4 hours are subtracted from GMT instead of the usual 5.\n\nSources:\n\nLifelong resident of the US\n\nThis might help you visualize it:\n\n[http://www.worldtimezone.com/time-usa12.php](http://www.worldtimezone.com/time-usa12.php)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T02:43:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"}]}
