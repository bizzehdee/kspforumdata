It would be only capable of detecting the largest of asteroids at first but as more satellites are added, it would be able to detect smaller and smaller sizes. Each satellite would only be able to detect 1 asteroid at a time as soon as the network is set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso i had this in suggestions first just so you know...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut still just a request\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T21:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egood idea. asteroids are too easy now.
