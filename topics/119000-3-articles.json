That and it makes my craft look more sci-fi and not like a F22 or F35 or (insert modern jet here) clone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still will most likely not use the new cockpit as i dont really like frontally mounted cockpits on anything but supply ships and non military craft (i dont even recall when ive made a \u0022non-military\u0022 craft in the last 2 years playing KSP, even my peaceful mining rigs and explorators probes have missiles on them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). Then again, i will definitely take a look at it when it comes out, it cant be any worse then the current cockpit which while not bad and above average compared to some parts (2.5m 3 man pod im looking at your ugly model/texture thats from the pre KSP days, that and the turbojet looks bad), is still outdated a bit compared to teh new MK2 and MK3 stuff that looks stellar, heck, even the mk1 command pod while old looks decent enough to keep around as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei can see why a fighter styled is desired as many people make fighter jets from it, but its not like its a change that will affect me personally. Provided they dont ruin the MK1 inline thats the main cockpit of 90% of my designs due to the bar above teh corsshairs that help me aim missiles at enemy ships, ill still be happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, i like teh idea of the new engine, but i dont get why they keep going small, but ignore the larger needs of transporters. Its a really big pain to have to strap 20\u002B engines to get a not so heavy 300t cargo ship into orbit. Itd be much nicer if we could have 2-3 2.5m engines instead. Guess cutting down on part count isnt the priority for the devs, large SSTOs are all but dead for me as i dont want to have 100 bloody parts of just engines on it. Ohh, and a 47kn thrust maximum, thats very very weak, i bet itll be as underpowered as the current basic jet engine which is just useless for everything but slow low altitude stuff (if it had some stationary thrust id use it for VTOL, but for now its heavy and has way less thrust then the turbojet gives on the ground immobile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T19:33:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T19:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty sad that they can\u0027t even include an IVA in a part they make.
