Most recording software has the option to hide the cursor. If it doesn\u0027t hide the KSP cursor it should surely hide the default Windows cursor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso remember: Run a 5-10 second test before you start big projects. I can\u0027t tell you how many times my mic was off, or I was recording a different screen, or my sound was too low. A test run would have shown you before you got to 20 minutes of footage that there was a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
