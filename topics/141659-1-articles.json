Passing within ~2.3 kilometres of it causes lag, and on exiting the lag and passing within 2.2 it disappears, killing the crew on board it. It doesn\u0027t leave any debris behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happens repeatedly, regardless of the aircraft design used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo possibilities I can think of are that the ship is being deleted for being too complex and taking too long to load [It contains around 150 parts] or that it collides with the water on loading and is destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the ship loads fine without damage when selected and flown from the map view, and it seems to load in reasonable time when this is done, so neither seems particularly obvious as the cause. Does anyone have any idea what\u0027s causing this and how it can be prevented?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/syzOg/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
