View full album](//imgur.com/a/WwffV)\n\nSmall, deadly, and highly versatile, the [OV-10 Bronco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Rockwell_OV-10_Bronco) is the premier light attack and observation aircraft of the Cold War era. With a ridiculous number of external hardpoints and a easily reconfigurable science/cargo section, I intend to deploy this aircraft in a variety of early/mid career missions including scientific survey, surveillance and security functions. \n\nSpeaking of \u0027security\u0027 functions, reading about the OV-10\u0027s impressive combat record on an [automotive blog turned combat aircraft discussion site](https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-amazing-ov-10-bronco-was-never-allowed-to-meet-its-1695837367) made me put on a full loadout of demonstrator ordnance just for the fun of it!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KeMC4-7px0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe Kerbal replica of the OV-10 is noticeably larger and more powerful, with a greater wingspan. This was due to reasons of practicality (roll rate would be really slow with one set of ailerons) and to preserve a fully stock airframe. It is maneuverable and STOL capable. With a bit of tweaking you could even make a VTOL or STOVL out of this craft. \n\n**The craft files can be downloaded from KerbalX:**\n\n[Light Strike variant](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/3103) - KAX and TweakScale\n\n[Unarmed survey variant](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/3106) - needs KAX mod only"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T19:07:51Z","Content":"Hey, I think that my local aviation museum might have one of these!

As in, since the tailplanes I would assume are built off the symmetried tailbooms, how do you get that center wing section to connect to both sides? (I guess I would assume struts clipped into the wing structure or something? As I haven\u0027t installed KAX yet (and I\u0027m worried about pushing my limits with installed mods), I haven\u0027t been able to DL and check the aircraft to see its construction secrets.

I often tried to have at least some connect between an offset part and the collider (or at least texture) of the parent part, I was afraid that the physics would get wonky with floating parts the way they sometimes do with (badly) clipped parts. \n\nThanks again for the info! Gah, I really have to have another install dedicated to atmo craft--though I do have to plan on some sort of electric Duna flyer... and the OV-10 has all that extra lifting surface. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (Now it\u0027s just a matter of making foldable main wings or making the front fuselage a lifting body to make it all fit in a fairing...)"}]}
