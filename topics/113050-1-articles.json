This was due to reasons of practicality (roll rate would be really slow with one set of ailerons) and to preserve a fully stock airframe. It is maneuverable and STOL capable.

As in, since the tailplanes I would assume are built off the symmetried tailbooms, how do you get that center wing section to connect to both sides? (I guess I would assume struts clipped into the wing structure or something? As I haven\u0027t installed KAX yet (and I\u0027m worried about pushing my limits with installed mods), I haven\u0027t been able to DL and check the aircraft to see its construction secrets.
