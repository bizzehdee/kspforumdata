This of course makes it hard to find the craft I want to work on. It occurs to me that this is probably a common problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA craft search by name seems like it wouln\u0027t be too hard to add.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that it\u0027s been brought up, a folder system would be awesome too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you all think?

Same thing for searching for a particular save. I think it should also work that when you press a letter on the keyboard, it skips straight to the craft and saves beginning with that letter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchweinAero","CreatedById":126909,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T21:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully support this suggestion. It would also help a lot if the craft selection window could be made taller somehow, but a search bar would be the more flexible aid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TorchedForever","CreatedById":165378,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T02:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be very useful. I had to store some of my Sandbox crafts in a backup folder because it was too hard to navigate. There is already a search bar for parts, so the technology is there.\u00A0The \u0027first letter only\u0027 search would cut down scrolling time for sure. However, players who use naming conventions might have disproportionate craft under certain letters which would reduce the effectiveness of single letter jumps. Other organizational tools like folders could also help solve this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T09:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
