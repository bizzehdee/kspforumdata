I have been playing for a while (0.21) and I love it. All the mods and the game concept struck me core deep from day one. And it never gets boring. As of now I have 19 KSP installs I have modded in different ways. I live in west part of Norway close to a ski resort walking distance, and one more 10 mins by car.

There is a ski resort on a glacier that opens when all the other close down towards the summer.
