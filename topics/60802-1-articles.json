This way, I have to fit and attach the payload to the SSTO by myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane uses KW, B9, KAS, and IR mods. It has a movable telescopic arm with an attached winch with an electromagnet to lift any payload to the cargo bay. Inside the cargo bay there\u0027s another winch that\u0027s used to secure the payload to the bay. In the front there\u0027s also a KAS container box to store different parts if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome pics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/VcRkf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
