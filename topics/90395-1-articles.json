So, I\u0027ll be putting a poll up which will let you vote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will design very few modules peronally, one being the core, and some others I feel are necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11-15-2014:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 1: We have a stunning amount of contributers.
