For example, instead of right-clicking every RCS tank I wish to have off before launch, I can just keybind them. This would help save a lot of time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Maneuver Nodes. When is the best time to start your max throttle? For example, node burn time is 30 seconds, so do you begin the burn at t-30 or t-0? I usually began at t-0 but i feel like I\u0027m wasting fuel and not getting my desired end result orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)Part meshing/overlapping (clipping?) During Assembly, is there a way to overlap parts without them stacking on each other? For example, overlapping rover wheels on a single axis, but different angles. Like this \u0027X\u0027, and without turning from green to red.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all the questions I have for now, thanks again for reading! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedKosmos\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Kosmodrome\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-15T18:31:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2013 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RedKosmos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T20:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi and welcome to the forums, RedKosmos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) no, sadly not\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) since the maneuver node assumes an instant \u0022impulse\u0022 burn without duration, you get the most precise approximation of the impulse by centering the burn around T=0. You want to have 50% of the burn finished at t=0.
