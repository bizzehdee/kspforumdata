Most of the time has been spent building ridiculous rockets that don\u0027t work well and there has also been a few lousy attempts at landing on the Mun as well as a few good attempts and some successful ones. I\u0027ve definitely had a few other missions as well, mostly non-returning interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, do we know anything about the career mode at all? I\u0027m worried for a novice player like myself that the career mode might not really ever be an option because the cost associated with failure. I assume sandbox mode will always be available so I can always have fun. I just wonder what career mode will add to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see cooperative multi-player myself. It would be awesome to work on a space station with friends and in the future mine resources together. I\u0027m just not sure how you allow for time shifting because that almost seems like a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
