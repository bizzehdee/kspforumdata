Everything is fine except that when I have the Kerbal leave the command seat he or she is forced to spawn on top of any surface that may be directly above their head, no matter how much space they have above them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I orient the rover so that the cargo bay doors are above it then the Kerbal will leave the seat normally and stand directly in front of the seat on the floor of the bay only if the doors are left open. If I have the doors closed then the Kerbal will end up standing outside of my craft on top of the exterior of the closed doors. If I want to have a Kerbal exit a command seat from within the bay with the cargo ramp then it will always spawn outside of my craft. Frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming this is intended behavior so as to not risk Kerbals becoming trapped between inaccessible parts within a spacecraft, but you can exit from any command pod without this complication. I guess it has something to do with the fact that Kerbals in a command seat exist in a quasi state between being on EVA and also in command of a vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this normal behavior for everyone else? I am running a heavily modded install, but the only mod that sounds like it would impact this behavior might be Take Command which I have tried running without with the same results. Has anyone worked out any building techniques that overcome this problem? Is there a config setting that alters the check for structures around the Kerbal that can be modified? Will this behavior possibly change in 1.1 I wonder?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T04:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have KSP in front of me right now, so can\u0027t test, but I\u0027m not super surprised.\u00A0 I doubt that it\u0027s deliberately designed behavior, so I seriously doubt that there\u0027s a config setting for it.
