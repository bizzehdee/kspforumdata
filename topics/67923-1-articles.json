I open it, click play, and I can even hear it, but the window does not show up. It even appears on the list of tasks in the task manager. I can still play the game, I just have to go into the KSP folder and open KSP.exe. This is not a really bit deal, but is there a way to fix this? thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T23:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThere\u0027s a forum for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in other news, I have no idea what might be causing this. Try downloading it again from the site, and if that fails then try downloading the entire package and running it from there if it\u0027s just the files in your ksp folder. And if all else fails, turn your machine off and back on again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T23:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T23:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis issue \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74602-KSP-Opens-as-Background-Process\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealready has a thread\u003C/a\u003E, I reccomend you post your info there to prevent spreading the info around, a fix is being worked on.
