It are mostly the grey buttons, like EVA and IVA, the delete, merge buttons in the VAB, flagtexts et cetera. Some of the buttons still work (for example the EVA and IVA buttons), but some of theme I can\u0027t press anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone can help me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonatan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T23:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your installed mods? What did you do to your game before this happened? Post your logs too and a screenshot, it may help to narrow the problem.
