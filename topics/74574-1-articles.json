Why is it so difficult to get a proper connection? What am I doing wrong? Are there any tips or tricks that someone can recommend I try? If I want the booster to go \u0022that direction\u0022 slightly, it goes another direction instead. The camera and movement options are aggravating (because I\u0027m still a rookie).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if I do get a connection, it\u0027s usually off center even with the symmetry mode on. I feel like a dog chasing its own tail, I just go around and around and around and never get anywhere. LOL Please help. Is there a way to use the keyboard to move a part into place instead of trying to use the mouse? Why don\u0027t boosters \u0022snap\u0022 to the decoupler when they get close enough to each other?

The key seems to be to grab the booster stack and slide the mouse pointer right onto the decoupler itself - then it does indeed \u0022snap\u0022 into a proper connection. I could even slide the booster stack up and down vertically while it remained \u0022glued\u0022 to the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHANK YOU STICKYDUCK!

However, if I grab the stack of four boosters in the middle of them, they separate into two pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use this technique, I have to grab the top one of the four boosters so they all stay in one piece, then mouse-over the decoupler. But then I can\u0027t slide the booster stack upward very far, as soon as my mouse pointer leaves the decoupler, the booster stack no longer attached to it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do I grab a stack of four boosters in the middle and keep them all together as one to attach to the decoupler? Can I group the parts somehow and then they won\u0027t come apart?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Actually, I can grab the booster stack in the middle and it won\u0027t come apart. But when I slide my mouse over the decoupler, the mouse position suddenly changes and now I\u0027m grabbing onto the top booster (instead of where I actually clicked).
