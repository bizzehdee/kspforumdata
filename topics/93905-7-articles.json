Venus is a hot hellhole with a literally crushing atmosphere. Solid ground and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eguaranteed\u003C/span\u003E insights into its history are not the only benefits of a manned Mars mission vs a manned Venus mission. Is it infinitely better than your pie-in-the-sky (or rather airship-in-Venus\u0027s-sky) idea. Mars\u0027 atmosphere is thin, but it\u0027s there. It does a good job of protecting against some of the worst types of solar and cosmic radiation (which is just one reason why Mars is better than the Moon, but that\u0027s neither here nor there). The sun isn\u0027t dim on Mars at all, not in normal conditions, that\u0027s why most surface missions to Mars have had solar panels. Dust storms, while they block out sunlight, also clean solar panels (see both MER rovers). Plus, it would be idiotic not to take with you an alternate source of power on a critical mission like a manned one. Even if there wasn\u0027t one, you\u0027d have batteries and generators. There\u0027s nothing \u0022dubious\u0022 about being able to walk or drive around your landing site, that\u0027s the whole point. That\u0027s golden. If I sent you somewhere to explore and told you to stand still in the one spot I dropped you off, and I set off on a walk or took a drive in a car, who\u0027d you think would come back with the most information about the place? You could explore long distance on Mars, why couldn\u0027t you? Electrical powered rovers could get you tens of kilometers in one day, and keep going, day after day. On your Venusian airship, you\u0027re confined to your pressure vessel, looking out at some clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get the Sabatier reaction on Mars too, and it\u0027s a hell of a lot easier and less risky because it\u0027s on the ground and not in some giant airship floating in the sky. That\u0027s not to mention the fact that humans cannot survive on oxygen and water alone. You can grow crops in Martian soil. I would go on but I realised I\u0027m wasting my time when you mentioned graphene. Graphene is not necessarily the saviour of mankind. We haven\u0027t figured out how to make anything more than a few atoms large out of Graphene yet.

It needs double the delta-V than an unmanned probe comparable in capability, since the probe doesn\u0027t have to come back. In addition to life support and medical support mentioned above, a manned mission taking a long time and distance from the Earth needs a considerable amount of radiation shielding, the weight of which further eats into the delta-V budget.\u003Cp\u003EWhile unmanned probes can and sometimes do fail in unpredictable ways, they are relatively cheap in comparison to manned missions. A viable strategy of reducing the probability of mission failure is to send multiple probes, something not easy to do with a manned mission. And the capabilities of computer technologies today allow for more sophisticated probes that are more capable at handling unexpected circumstances (like a dangerously-steep landing spot) than their predecessors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA could pluck you from your chair, put you in a probe, send you to Mars, transmit the instructions and tell you to go out and do what Curiosity has taken three years to do, and you could do it in under a day. Do you know how far Curiosity has travelled in three years time? About 9 kilometers. Even at a slow speed of 3 km/h, you\u0027d catch up to it in three hours. That\u0027s not to mention all the things you can do. The human eye and instinct is something a rover will never have. You could pick out interesting objects and features and analyse and value their importance on the fly, something mission controllers in California spend weeks and weeks on, before sending a pre-planned set of commands to Curiosity. If anything comes up, they have to wait. Curiosity can automatically detect and avoid some rocks, that\u0027s it. It doesn\u0027t know when to perform scientific experiements or when to take experiments, and even if it did, it doesn\u0027t have the resources it would need.

Robotic exploration is great for places humans can\u0027t go, but they\u0027re limited. There\u0027s a third option, teleoperated robots from orbit, but that\u0027s still very expensive - you have to send the robots and the humans, and even if the humans aren\u0027t going on the surface of Mars (for example), they still have to go almost the entire way and back, and they still don\u0027t get as efficient as human autonomy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVenus is a much more hellish, hot, strange place that has acid rain as it\u0027s only rain.
