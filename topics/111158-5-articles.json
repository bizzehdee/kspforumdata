If such content has been left alone it is likely that it was not brought to the attention of the moderation team. \n\nFor the most part we follow the Principle of Minimum Moderation and try to be reactive rather than proactive (one of our best moderators says we are firefighters, not police). Unless something we see is particularly egregious or so clearly in violation of the rules that we can\u0027t leave it be then we usually wait for someone to complain about it. The last thing we want is to be seen as eager to moderate or exercise our powers, so generally we do so reluctantly and as lightly as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T23:59:06Z","Content":"THat is singlehandedly the wisest thing I\u0027ve heard a mod say on this form.
