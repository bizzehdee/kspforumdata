I think it\u0027s pretty obvious that the service module hasn\u0027t gotten the same amount of attention as the rest of the parts, so you\u0027re complaints are justified. To be honest I\u0027m debating on just dropping the service module all together. Now that I know about setting up a custom drag model in FAR I should be able to get this baby to fall just fine even with a double node on the bottom, meaning I can just give it a second shroud that goes to 2.5m. And I want to work on a 1.875m parts pack after these are done anyway. (The current shrouds size and 1.5x the \u0022normal\u0022 sized parts.)

Compact, yet elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno... I think that dedicated SMs have their ups and downs. Sometimes, you have to cut your part count, and using an all-in-one part is a great way to chop 10-12 parts off your ship... but the ability to adjust the setup of your craft is often more important. It\u0027s something that is up to the end user... So, perhaps doing both to provide some flexibility.
