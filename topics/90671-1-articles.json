The landing was rough on the main ship I had used to fire engines during the last state of the landing... The ship was knocked off the rock, and was partially destroyed... But the rock rolled off the ship, teetered for a second, and came to a rest. I then zoomed in on the ship to check the damage, and when I zoomed back out, the rock was gone, and a couple seconds later I was back at KSC, and tracking had no sign of the ship I had landed the rock with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the rock and the main ship survived. The other ships that provided parachutes disappeared with the rock when it vanished, but they had survived in tact... Well, till they disappeared...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDang!

Asteroids are considered ship debris and will despawn if you are further than 2.5km away unless you have a command pod or an active probe core attached. If you have ship debris amount set to zero in the options, it\u0027s likely that the game removes the thing entirely when you go to the tracking station even when you are within ship range to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
