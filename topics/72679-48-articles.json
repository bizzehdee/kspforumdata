This is on latest dev build of FAR and scansat. I have a heli with the first altimetry scanner. After I active it and even after the animation stops playing FAR continues to update the voxels for the ship which should only happen during an animation. It makes flight pretty much impossible with constant lag from FAR. I dont know what the cause would be other than some call happening when the radar scan is engaged that triggers FARs voxel updates. Even after then retracting and stopping the scan the updates continue to happen every few seconds from FAR.
