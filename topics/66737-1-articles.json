After quite a lot of \u0022Now where the fark am I?!?\u0022 I came to the conclusion that the navball heading indicator doesn\u0027t seem to work reliably on Mun. Incidentally, I haven\u0027t tried to navigate on any other body using the navball heading indicator, so I don\u0027t know if it does or does not suffer from the same apparent problem elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile motoring around Kerbin the navball heading indicator always appears to be correct and reliable: head toward an object, get a heading fix; wander around in circles for a while, then go back to your marked heading, and lo and behold! you\u0027re once again heading toward exactly the same object. Try that same trick on Mun and you\u0027ll end up doing a Dukes of Hazzard off a crater rim and lighting up the dark side with a fireball worthy of JJ Abrams.
