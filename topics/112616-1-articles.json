In rare cases they will stand but still not respond to input. These could be considered dead bodies since they just stay there doing nothing for eternity unless you put in a bugfix modlet for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of command seats I\u0027ve discovered that no matter the speed if you aren\u0027t commanding the vessel, a kerbal in a command seat will survive any crash (excepting the bug above). I discovered this with a 4v4 BDA AI biplane dogfight. The AI never really went off full throttle so when they lost their wings they kinda drove themselves into the dirt. Record speed was 120m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MailletC\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MailletC\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen Kerbals die they explode into a puff of smoke.
