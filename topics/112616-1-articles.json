Kerbals can survive ejecting from a supersonic jet and landing on their head and 2. Kerbals will spazz out for a couple of seconds and then explode once they fall down on the ground from, say, tripping over an I-beam. So Kerbals\u0027 crash tolerance is directly related to their adrenaline level.

In rare cases they will stand but still not respond to input. These could be considered dead bodies since they just stay there doing nothing for eternity unless you put in a bugfix modlet for it.\n\nSpeaking of command seats I\u0027ve discovered that no matter the speed if you aren\u0027t commanding the vessel, a kerbal in a command seat will survive any crash (excepting the bug above). I discovered this with a 4v4 BDA AI biplane dogfight. The AI never really went off full throttle so when they lost their wings they kinda drove themselves into the dirt. Record speed was 120m/s."},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:46:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When Kerbals die they explode into a puff of smoke.
