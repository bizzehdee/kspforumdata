Data size * data value = science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mistery goo had 18 mits data size so my question is how? Base value is 10 cap 13 (if iam not mistake) so how i got size of 18 mits. I want to edit some experiments and want to increase some mits while reduce others. I know xmitdatascale sets how much % will transmitting data return (even tho temperature return 100% at kerbin with scale of 50% so maybe dont apply to kerbin?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: i was searching more in cfg files and found that seti changes that, and there is base value of 18.

Its only used if you decide to transmit the data rather than bring it back to Kerbin manually. The antenna you use to transmit the data will determine both how much power will be required to transmit the data and how long it will take to process. For example, the size of a Goo Observation (the scientific experiment for which you require a Goo Container) is 10 mits (I\u0027m going off the wiki here; not sure if the data there has been updated post 1.0 or not but the new atmospheric experiment is there so I\u0027ll assume the data is up to date). A small antenna transmits at a rate of 3.33 mits per second and burns 20 units of electricity per second while in operation, so it\u0027ll take four seconds and eighty units of electrical charge to finish transmitting the data. Transmission efficiency for a Goo Observation is 30%, so you\u0027ll reap only 30% of the science points you could reap if you were to return the experiment to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData Value, on the other hand, is how many science points you can expect to harvest from the experiment. As you\u0027ve pointed out, the base value for a Goo Container is 10 points with a 13 point maximum per biome/scenario. Kerbin has got some pretty sucky multipliers - 0.3x on the ground, 0.4x splashed, 0.7x in low atmo below 18k, 0.9x in high atmo between 18 and 70k, 1.0x in low orbit below 250 kilometers, and 1.5x in high orbit above 250 kilometers. So, what\u0027s happens there is that for each possible scenario, you multiply the base and maximum values times these scenariosm, and that\u0027s how much you can hope to expect to get from them. For example -for your first Goo Observation in high orbit over kerbin, you can expect to reap 15 science points (10*1.5 = 15), and the maximum potential value there is about nineteen to twenty points (13*1.5 = 19.5, not sure which way it rounds). So you take the goo and get it back to Kerbin - fifteen of the nineteen/twenty sci points for that scenario have been harvested, leaving four or five points left over. Next time you go, the amount of science points collected is subject to an adjustment that lowers what you harvest quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you transmit your first Goo Observation from high orbit - 30% transmission efficiency, so instead of 15 points gathered, you get four or five. Now, I may be wrong about this, but I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E that if you transmit the amount of data you can possibly gain for a scenario still drops by the same amount - so there\u0027s only four or five science points still available for that scenario (which is why it\u0027s almost always better to return your experiments to Kerbin if you can).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewiki\u0027s Science Page\u003C/a\u003E is reasonably up to date with this kind of data. Look specifically for the Celestial Body Multipliers table; it contains the \u0022Experiment Subject Value\u0022 multipliers used in the post Gaiiden pointed out to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that clears matters up for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
