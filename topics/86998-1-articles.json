It\u0027s not known how long he will survive, but a combination of boredom and solar radiation will probably do him in. It\u0027s decided an interested party is needed within five days or it will, simply put, be too late. Quickly, and with great resolve, Jebidiah Kerman agrees that he will lead the rescue mission. Some time later, checking the calendar an employee at this corporation realizes they haven\u0027t heard anything about the results of this mission. Digging into it they discover, five years later, that the contract in question was never actually completed and the budget for it was spent largely on \u0027snacks\u0027. Questioning Jebidiah about his failure to complete the contract he simply said, \u0022I just couldn\u0027t find the time.\u0022 Later it would be discovered roughly three thousand flights came well within five kilometers of the hapless Kerbal, several of which built permanent stations in orbit, to which a second questioning received only a, \u0022That sounds good now, but at the time I would have needed more boosters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T21:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t kept track on contract deadlines because they are very forgiving that there\u0027s not really much rush to get them done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T22:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to \u003Cem\u003Eaccept\u003C/em\u003E within 5 days, but having done so, you have 10 YEARS to rescue him as I recall.
