I got a concussion last February. I was walking outside, slipped on an icy patch and hit the back of my head on the sidewalk. It\u2019s odd...it honestly didn\u2019t hurt that bad. It\u2019s kinda funny cus just a few seconds after I fell I blacked out. The paramedics arrived and whisked me away, and asked me questions...I couldn\u2019t remember my name, where I was, what year it was, or who\u00A0the current\u00A0president is,\u00A0etc. I was taken to the hospital, got put in a bed...I honestly don\u2019t remember the rest....and that\u2019s the problem....I can\u2019t remember anything anymore. Dates, times, places, they are all a blur...you can ask me what I had for lunch yesterday, I won\u2019t remember. Play some song lyrics for me, I won\u2019t remember the song. This has been a huge problem in school, as I\u2019ll work on a concept one day...and won\u2019t have any clue about it the next. This is especially fun with my parents...I\u2019ll tell them i simply cannot remember how to do said math problem...my mom\u2019s answer is \u2018bull crap, yes you do! Now do it!\u2019 But I can\u2019t!!\u00A0I gave up guitar (I just....lost musical ability with this. Piano, ukulele, harmonica, guitar...all gone) I fear that this is going to have life-long implications...does anybody have any ideas/know anything about this kind of injury?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncheers-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLewie\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-09T00:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey dude, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re not feeling so hot.

Call between 9AM and 4PM, and have a pen and paper with you. I also encourage you to talk about how you\u0027re feeling with your parents and to have someone on the call with you. Don\u0027t be afraid to ask questions or to pipe up if you\u0027re concerned: After all, you are the expert on how you\u0027re feeling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027d rather speak at an appointment I\u0027m sure that\u0027s possible, but it might be more complicated because of Coronavirus protocols and your insurance coverage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever you end up doing, I hope you feel better soon. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-09T02:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022123837\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dman979\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0will definitely see to that!
