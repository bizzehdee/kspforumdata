There\u0027s a bar that spans the entire bottom of the screen and the only things down there are the time acceleration meter and the day clock. There\u0027s plenty of room for the bars at the top, and they\u0027re just hanging out there all by their lonesome. By moving the trifecta bars down there, you\u0027d more effectively utilize the space along the bottom bar while also decluttering the top of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T03:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather the time controls go at the top like they are pretty much everywhere else, but yeah, I agree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T03:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey could just move the bar to the top of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T03:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey could just move the bar to the top of the screen.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever works, I just feel that consistency is a good thing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T03:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhatever works, I just feel that consistency is a good thing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso is OCD \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
