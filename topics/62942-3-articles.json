This is pretty much me experimenting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s what I came up with: launch a rocket that can just barely get the payload to 75x75 LKO, then deploy the payload with the rocket running on fumes. Then launch a space plane to rendezvous with the rocket and bring it back to KSC. The theory is that if the space plane burns about as much fuel as the dry weight of the rocket, then with careful center of gravity management, it\u0027ll weigh about the same on landing as when it took off and have similar flight characteristics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the fleet from the last test run:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Up Chuck Mark XX\u0022 Medium Lift SSTO Rocket Jet: ~65.5t launch weight, ~25t dry weight, 20t design payload to 75x75 LKO, tested up to 22.5 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Unladen Swallow Mark XI\u0022 SSTO Space Plane retrieval vehicle: Also about 65t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oops Sat 1\u0022 Orbital fuel depot.
