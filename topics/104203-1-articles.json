I have found some tutorials that deal with .mbm, .pbm, .png, blah blah blah... I cannot get anything to open up properly in PS. I have PS CS4 64-bit. The closest I have come to getting a real editable image was a greyscale image that was out of proportion and had a blank line every other line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it because I\u0027m running 64-bit PS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a more direct option? idk why Squad makes this type of edit so ridiculously complicated and unpredictable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have followed every step, done all the math and still nothing will open up properly.
