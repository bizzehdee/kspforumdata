I build a jet and no matter how I build it. When I go to try and take off the front wheel locks up. The back end starts to wobble from side to side until blowing up. It\u0027s almost like the breaks on on for the front wheel and only the front wheel. I have tried everything I can think of, changed out landing gear, moved it around, rebuilt the plane 5 times all in different ways and it does the same thing every time. Anyone ever seen anything like this before I am at a loss\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T13:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStupid question, but are the brakes turned on in the SPH?
