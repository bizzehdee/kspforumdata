business reasons\u0022.\u00A0 The reason for doing it is because the test team is lacking.\u00A0 Not that the test team isn\u0027t doing their job, it\u0027s that they aren\u0027t enough.\u00A0 Software development takes a lot of testing.\u00A0 I used to operate by the guideline that whatever it takes to develop, it takes 3x that much to test.\u00A0 So a week of development is nearly a month of testing, Not just time either, 5 programmers means 15 testers.\u00A0 (This assumes there is no possibility of automated testing, in a game that would be very hard to do). Squad doesn\u0027t do this, they rely on their customers to do their testing.\u00A0 Because they are an indie company, depending on the person that may or may not be an acceptable business practice.\u00A0 However, that is how it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: And Squad isn\u0027t the only company that does it either.\u00A0 You have to understand and accept that if you choose to buy an indie game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the good business reasons I had in mind were along the lines of \u0027we do it this way because otherwise we go broke\u0027. I\u0027m aware (or can imagine) all the points you raise and am very much aware that all that testing takes\u00A0time and money. But we\u0027ve also seen that Squad are in this for the long haul and that they do, in time, fix the bugs, change things in response to feedback etc. So they\u0027re obviously finding the resources from somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the consistently overoptimistic deadlines do get tiring. It suggests that some part of the pipeline isn\u0027t working and that somebody somewhere has a consistently wrong understanding of how much can be done in a given amount of time. It also suggests that lessons either are not being, or cannot be,\u00A0\u00A0learned, which is depressing whichever way you look at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me also be quite clear -\u00A0I\u0027m also well aware that none of the above\u00A0may\u00A0be Squad\u0027s fault at all. They undoubtedly\u00A0have external pressures and deadlines they have to meet. In which case I feel for them - they can\u0027t talk about all that internal\u00A0stuff and yet they end up carrying the can when things go wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-20T18:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, \u0022don\u0027t know\u0022 means \u0022don\u0027t know\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t work for Squad, so I don\u0027t have any more visibility into their internal processes than you do.\u00A0 I do, however, know something about their \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ekind\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of situation, since I\u0027ve been a professional software engineer at companies large and small for more than twenty years, so I do have some idea about what\u0027s involved in getting software out the door.\u00A0 I can also say this:\u00A0 if you\u0027ve never been in the commercial software business yourself, please be careful about making assertions about an area which (and I mean this in the friendliest way) you know nothing about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly, the problems with the console release represent \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esome\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E kind of a miss.\u00A0 As a player, you\u0027re perfectly within your rights (and your area of expertise, i.e. \u0022playing the game\u0022) to say that.\u00A0 The console release is out, a lot of players are justifiably very unhappy with the problems, I don\u0027t think anybody\u0027s questioning that.\u00A0 And if your position is simply \u0022I paid money for a product, and it didn\u0027t live up to a reasonable expectation of what it should do, so therefore I\u0027m unhappy with the company that released the product,\u0022 that is of course your prerogative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, once you leave that simple, basic starting point, and start to speculate about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that happened, or what the motivations were behind it, or how culpable various parties are, or what happened, or who exactly caused the problem, etc.... well, then you\u0027re getting into areas that (not to put too fine a point on it) you really have no idea what you\u0027re talking about, and speculation doesn\u0027t help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I don\u0027t know Squad specifically, but I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E know software developers, and software companies, and the software production and release process.\u00A0 And so I\u0027m in a position to tell you a few things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNobody \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewants\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to ship a product with severe problems, ever.\u00A0 Software developers are just like carpenters or bakers or landscapers or artists or musicians or anyone else who makes things for a living:\u00A0 they take pride in their work, they\u0027re emotionally invested in wanting to make something great, and they put a lot of hard work into doing so.\u00A0 If, as a player, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyou\u0027re\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E unhappy, when all you did was fork over $40 and a few hours of your time... imagine just how unhappy the person is who \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emade\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that thing, who poured their heart and soul into making it over a period of months or years?\u00A0 Software developers are people too.\u00A0 It\u0027s okay to be unhappy... just realize you\u0027re not the only one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaking software is hard.\u00A0 Doing platform ports is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hard.\u00A0 Doing platform ports on a relative shoestring as a tiny company... not sure what the right adverb is, here, but, well, it\u0027s a lot harder than that.\u00A0 Tossing a product over the fence and having an external vendor do the port for you can be a viable strategy sometimes, and depending on circumstances might be the only option... but it\u0027s always a gamble at best.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnfortunate things sometimes happen, even if you\u0027re competent and diligent and trying your best.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t played the console version myself (don\u0027t own a console), but from hearing the descriptions here, I gather it\u0027s something that folks run into pretty darn quick.\u00A0 So I can totally understand that from a player\u0027s perspective, it may seem completely inconceivable:\u00A0 \u0022How on \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eearth\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E could you not catch something so glaringly obvious before shipping?\u00A0 You must not have tried at \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\u00A0 Well... there\u0027s always a reason.\u00A0 For everything.\u00A0 Things happen that in retrospect seem bone-headedly obvious, which weren\u0027t so obvious at the time.\u00A0 During my observations of Squad and KSP over the last couple of years, I haven\u0027t seen anything that indicates to me that anybody there is either stupid or evil.\u00A0 There are a lot of ways something could go wrong that results in what just happened.\u00A0 If you have no insight into what actually happened (and you can\u0027t, if you don\u0027t work at Squad), then it\u0027s pointless to speculate about the reasons why.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, if a company just completely blows off QA, they\u0027re going to ship something with problems.\u00A0 It\u0027s also possible to work \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehard\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E at QA and end up shipping something with problems anyway, due to a lengthy slew of other potential problems that can crop up, some of which are potentially preventable, many of which are not.\u00A0 You can choose to believe me or not about that; I\u0027m just giving my two cents, speaking as someone who\u0027s been doing this for a living for a couple of decades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words:\u00A0 It\u0027s pretty safe to say that Squad didn\u0027t want this to happen.\u00A0 It\u0027s also safe to say that they didn\u0027t do it on purpose.\u00A0 If you want to complain about how unhappy you are, by all means do so... but\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E (and this is a comment I\u0027m
