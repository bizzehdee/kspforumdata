There seems to be a malfunction in the code that handles that (I think it\u0027s compensating for the translation incorrectly). However, they ONLY rotate around the north/south axis, so a station pointed up/down will still be up/down when you return to it (assuming kraken drive effects don\u0027t cause it to rotate on it\u0027s own once it\u0027s in physics range)."},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:37:55Z","Content":"Okay.
