I set it as a target and got very close, but never actually touched it as far as I know. I reentered Kerbin, landed and recovered. Then I went back up in a new rocket and the fuel station was no longer there. Its no longer there no matter how many times I launch new rockets. Do you \u0022use up\u0022 a space station when you try to dock with it? I think I might have got into the fuel station at one point, but it was in a pretty stable orbit about 600 km up. I don\u0027t think taping it or taping the thrusters would have changed much of anything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-30T14:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you don\u0027t see it any where on the map view orbiting the planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-30T14:38:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2017 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-30T14:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you have a probe core, or command pod on it?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf not, it may have been marked debris and deleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-30T14:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223256110\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514644885\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, it may have been marked debris and deleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just hidden by the filter options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-30T17:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223256114\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514645168\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119953\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Harry Rhodan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just hidden by the filter options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s probably this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/68474-chik-sneadlov/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002268474\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/68474-chik-sneadlov/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Chik Sneadlov\u003C/a\u003E be sure to check which icons are highlighted in the row that drops down at the top of the map view screen.

The planet has to be the focus of the camera in order to see the ore concentration filters, so make sure you double-click on the planet or moon itself so that the camera switches focus to the body you are wanting to check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will next have to click on the planet resources icon in the toolbar. This is not the same as the \u0022i\u0022 info icon. The resources icon looks like a sphere with a triangular wedge cut into it. If that icon isn\u0027t showing then it means that you haven\u0027t selected the planet as the focus. When you click the resources icon it will show you the resources panel with \u0022Surface\u0022, \u0022Ocean\u0022 and \u0022Atmos.\u0022 tabs at the top. Make sure \u0022Surface\u0022 is selected then click on the \u0022Ore\u0022 filter below it. The other tabs are really only there for mods to take advantage of. Now you should have the cutoff percentages and color scheme filters available at the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tricky thing to understand is that this map from the orbital scanner only shows you the odds that you will find \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E ore in those biomes due to the average distribution of ore in that region. It does \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E guarantee you will find ore in those sites, it just shows the probability of of finding ore in that biome. However, if you take the Surface Scanning Module down to the surface and \u0022Run Analysis\u0022 it \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E tell you the ore concentration at that exact spot. It will also make the orbital scan overlay more accurate for those biomes you have analyzed from the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference is subtle but important. The Orbital Scanner cutoff percentage shows you the overall odds that you might find some ore in those highlighted biomes (20% chance, 50% chance, etc.) The Surface Scanning Module tells you the concentration of ore directly beneath you at that point, or in other words what percentage of ore is mixed in with the soil in that spot. The concentration percentage determines how efficient your mining operation will be and how quickly you can harvest ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in this screenshot, note the icon on the right toolbar that is selected to show the resources panel. And for your previous problem of disappearing ships, note the filter toolbar at the top of the screen that appears when you move your mouse to the top of the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002275WN2rs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/75WN2rs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last thing to mention, I suppose, is the M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner. This is the one that looks like a hexagon rotating on a post. What this does is let you sample the ore \u003Cem\u003Econcentration\u003C/em\u003E of the site you are over if you have performed an orbital survey. It\u0027s not that useful if you haven\u0027t run an analysis with the surface scanner first though. Without that surface analysis the Narrow-Band Scanner will only give you an average of the ore concentration within that biome. You\u0027ll still need the surface scanner to tell you the actual concentration at any specific site, but once you do then you\u0027ll be able to drag the pointer across the Narrow-Band Scanner readout to see the exact concentration of ore at any specific point in order to target the best site to set up a mining base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-31T20:56:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2017 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
