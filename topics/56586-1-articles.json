A bit of a pain in some situations as I had to get used to giving myself about 2-3 extra seconds to throttle up, but at the same time it makes it easier to say, smooth your decent speed during landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T14:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw it too, and I\u0027m also running on a Mac (Macbook Pro)- though take a look at the game time clock in the upper left. I got the slow throttle when all other controls seemed to be behaving perfectly, but the game clock was running about 1 second for every 1-3 real-time seconds. It might be a new way lag manifests itself with the update in unity: Camera seems unaffected but simulation slowed a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mileage may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T14:37:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
