While I\u0027ve got the parachute module in and running, it suffers from the same issue that stock has in that deploying chutes during reentry is a great big, \u0022I win, avoid all heat\u0022 button. Trying to set parachutes being cut (and destroyed) based on part temp doesn\u0027t work, because while that works for reentry it also leads to them auto-destroying when you try to deploy them later because of the heat remaining in the pod / chute. I\u0027d rather not do a simple, \u0022check shock/ambient temp, if \u0026gt; x, cut\u0022 because that doesn\u0027t provide much feedback in the way of, \u0022you set the chute on fire.\u0022 So something will have to show up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other holdup is getting ModularFlightIntegrator up and running. FAR has to extend the FlightIntegrator class to override stock\u0027s drag, but anything wanting to override heat or add anything to aerodynamics also has to do that. If we all just tried to extend FlightIntegrator itself we\u0027d either A) have multiple FlightIntegrators running resulting in everything going completely wrong or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E only one of them runs.

I\u0027ll have to figure out if there\u0027s an effective way around that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so more good dev news and slight hyping. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some justifiable complaints from tetryds that there were a few voxelization artifacts in vehicles (most of which were caused by the voxel resolution being too low), I tried increasing the resolution to see what would happen. Previous pictures showed voxel models with up to 125000 voxels within the bounds of the vehicle. I tested increased versions up to 500000 with no apparent loss of performance in the flight scene (testing a 114 part spaceplane, with many wings so extra overhead from that). I\u0027m sure it can go higher, but larger voxels require more memory to be put up to hold them; the 125000 versions required 2 MB for the duration of their existence (which is only long enough to generate aero properties before it\u0027s recycled), but I have concerns about how much memory this will churn if I test higher resolutions. And besides that, higher resolutions also take longer to generate, which makes them less viable for real-time aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, the obvious solution for this is to expose the options, so the voxel counts for controllable vessels and for debris (which are much lower) are now exposed. In addition, the rate-limit on updating the voxel has been exposed as well, to prevent situations like deploying landing gear from turning into a hitch-fest due to the garbage collector being slammed with cleaning up unused voxel memory. Fortunately, since the generation of voxel models and aero properties is done in separate threads, none of this actually has any impact on the game\u0027s framerate as a whole, just the few times the GC gets punched in the face. So woohoo for minor things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFerram could you say \u0022cut chute if speed is above Xm/s\u0022?

Deploying a chute at 600 m/s in the very upper reaches of the atmosphere should still work great, because the forces and heating up there would be incredibly low for that speed. It also falls apart on Jool, where 350 m/s is only Mach 0.3, so it\u0027s not even getting shock heating.\u003Cp\u003ENo, I don\u0027t want to hear hack-solutions that don\u0027t provide any feedback to the player about what happened and about what caused the issue. That\u0027s what\u0027s caused every single problem in oldFAR, and is the cause of every issue in newStock. Adding hacks because it\u0027s a fast way to make things work is a terrible idea, because however temporary you \u003Cem\u003Esay\u003C/em\u003E they are, they always become permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose one way would be to poke the ships average temp and see if it\u0027s rising or stable/falling (though it would of course be rather hackish).
