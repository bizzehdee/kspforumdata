It\u0027s aerodynamically stable during reentry and descent, and then I pop my chutes and jettison the heatshield, but the darn heatshield is so light and has so much drag that it doesn\u0027t fall away, but rather sticks to the bottom of my rover and starts causing disturbances, like out of control spinning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat have you all done to solve this type of problem?
