Short version is gas giants suck you into a very high entry speed, and the density curve in the upper atmo is too steep so its like hitting a wall of heat.\n\nI had no problem diving into Serran\u0027s atmosphere and had a probe do multiple passes for aerobraking without so much as a high temperature warning.

Not sure if you\u0027d be able to get an aerocapture out of it though, or whether it would be just a degree of braking assistance. If the curves are untouchable, then atmo height is another option.

It\u0027s fairly simple as I made a calculator to automatically create the curves based on the stock curves which is used by a few people. The main problem I have is that the radical change to atmospheres in KSP1.0 means that gas giants are crazy to enter. I for one like the challenge, however I can see how it puts people off....\n\nThe thing is: should I overwrite stock curves just to allow for easy gameplay? The curves for my 3 giants match Jool to within 0.000001% so I\u0027d have to change Jool too if I changed my own just for consistency. You can understand my hesitation at doing this, as I like the stock game, that\u0027s why I left all stock planets alone instead of replacing them which was one of my original plans for New Horizons.\n\nSo we have to back to the question: should I overwrite stock curves just to allow for easy gameplay? I personally say no, however seeing how insistant people are about the topic of being able to enter gas giants at 10\u002Bkm/s then I can always make a optional patch to thin the atmospheres out a little, but it won\u0027t be the default for the pack. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T16:42:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KillAshley**"},{"CreatedByName":"_PRATTER_","CreatedById":137421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T17:18:18Z","Content":"It only happens on the new planets, and im only going in at about 2km/s"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T18:07:52Z","Content":"Hmm that\u0027s a little odd, do you have any other mods installed?
