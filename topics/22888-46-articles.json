Some very interesting stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the historic designs can be created with just the following stages: the S-I, S-IV, S-IB, S-IVB, S-II, S-IC.

The Saturn \u003Cstrong\u003EINT-20\u003C/strong\u003E for example planned to have only 3 or 4 (because 5 was too much for that smaller design) F-1 on its first stage.

Those had a stage-and-a-half approach, similar to the Atlas. A central F-1 was the sustainer engine.

I was wondering when someone else would notice this little gem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, Transstage was originally built as an orbital tug for multi-deployment missions. It used two AJ-10 engines from the Delta second stage to provide power, and it had internal RCS and guidance packages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs NathanKell put it, Centaur is a very different animal all together. Originally created to serve as a high-energy upper stage for Atlas-derived launchers, it has since been used on many other launchers, including the Titan IIIEs used to launch the Voyager spacecraft. A Centaur derivative is still in use today as the upper stage of the Atlas V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, given that frizzank has made both the Transstage and the Agena upper stages, I personally feel that a Centaur would be a very good addition. If it were up to me to make one, it would likely be very impact-sensitive, have a very low dry weight, and a VERY good fuel supply, and have nodes for both one and two engine configurations (since it has been flown in both versions). But, if Frizzank, doesn\u0027t make one, I\u0027m not going to complain. The pack has plenty of other cool parts to use. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zakkpaz","CreatedById":62361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T04:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei know its got to annoy frizz and Denny, but I like the fact that everyone\u0027s coming up with ideas. the best thing about this mods is that none of the parts are single use, unlike some other historical reaction mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway it seems like the most useful thing for expanding Saturn V usefulness would be the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc5n.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EC-5N\u003C/a\u003E stage with a NERVA engine, it wouldn\u0027t requiter to much work and would add just enough Delta V for maned launch to Duna or Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bq42v.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bq42v.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T04:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoldForest: Nova was actually the name for the inhouse Saturn-like booster NASA was developing while Von Braun\u0027s ABMA team was developing Saturn (\u0022the one after Jupiter\u0022). They had the same performance. When Saturn was picked, Nova then became the name for post-Saturn megaboosters. An interesting note about that picture: note how LOR clearly hadn\u0027t won yet; the Apollo CSM is shown in direct ascent configuration with its retrograde / landing stage below it. It may also be back when they were still planning to put a Centaur on top of the S-IVB and below the CSM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat reminds me Frizzank.
