For literally years I have come back again and again hoping to get a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E experience, but every time I run into problems that make it unplayable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA little over a year ago the problem was that my game crashing constantly, but this was probably because I had too many mods installed. i basically installed all the recommended mods for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I didn\u0027t know that this would cause a problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis time the problem is that it is too easy now. It seems like progression zero is not supported by the newest version of KSP, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. In addition to that the rockets have an unrealistically big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s\u00A0making even single stage to orbit vehicles too easy to\u00A0make (imo these should be extremely hard to make if not impossible) and\u00A0for some reason when I build a rocket now the delta-V and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0are calculated completely\u00A0wrong. When I build a rocket the info box shows me some stats and those stats seem accurate when I start a flight simulation, but when I actually build the rocket for real suddenly the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E goes up from 1.5 to 8. Something must have gone very very wrong in my install.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLong story short (or not)\u00A0I am desperate to find some sort of mod list that could give me the most authentic true to life KSP experience. So at the start I should not even have any sort of stabilization help from my core at all. I would need to be forced to make the rocket spin as it takes off to prevent it from going unstable and turning. Realistic progression zero offered this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem is also that there is such a huge \u0022recommended list\u0022 forrocket parts for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and I have no idea how many of those should install. If I install too many the game might get unstable,\u00A0the game could became too easy with overpowered parts or the list in my game could become too crowded and confusing.\u00A0If I don\u0027t install enough I might have a hard time building a decent rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically I\u0027m at a complete loss. There is just too much to think about and I really don\u0027t have any preferences other than it being as realistic as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what would a person do if they don\u0027t really care about picking out this and that. All I want is just a true to life \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E experience without the fuss of having to worry about what mods I should and should not install.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes someone have a nice list like this? I can downgrade my KSP version too if necessary.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI really hope that someone can help me with this. This mod package has the potential to be one of the most amazing games every, but I\u00A0always have game breaking problems when I try to compose a list myself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027\u0027m sure a lot of people would be happy if they had access to such a list and not have to through all the fuss of trying to work out what works and what not.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-05T17:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the Forums \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176143-agen0/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022176143\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176143-agen0/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Agen0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep it simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend using the FEWEST extra mods possible,\u00A0rather than downloading everything with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E config and hoping that it all works as expected.
