The first one would require the plugin from NearFuture Solar which I include with my mod and it has a curved solar panel plugin. With that the way you would set it up would be to name them all the same thing and in the config it should look like this. \n\n(all my solar panel game objects are named sunCatcher)\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleCurvedSolarPanel\t\tPanelTransformName = sunCatcher\t\tTotalEnergyRate = 30\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\t//animationName = ExtendPanels\t\tpowerCurve\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 206000000000 0 0 0\t\t\tkey = 13599840256 1 0 0\t\t\tkey = 68773560320 0.5 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0 10 0 0\t\t}\t}\n\nThe other way, which could work, is to use the stock solar panel plugin. I didn\u0027t have luck with this after my revamp but it seemed to work with the original model. You still have them named all the same and only have one module solar panel thing in the config and see if that works."}]}
