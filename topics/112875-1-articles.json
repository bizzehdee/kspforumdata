{"TopicId":112875,"ForumId":51,"TopicTitle":"Elcano II: Destination Mun","CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:47:11Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:47:11Z","Content":"After getting around [Minmus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123355-What-another-Elcano-challenge-Minmus-my-destination), Svetlana Kermana and the rest of the engineering department have been hard at work on a Mk II rover design intended to address all the issues with the Mk I (mainly, that everything that could possibly fall off did).\n\n[![mkii-rear-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mkii-rear-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mkii-rear.png)\n\nA surviving prototype Mk I can be seen in the background. While the Mk II is considerably longer, it\u0027s not a great deal heavier, so it should be straightforward to launch. Unlike the Mk I, the main body of the rover is entirely enclosed in a NF Construction octo-truss, a sturdy piece of equipment. The important parts mounted on the top deck are shielded from side impacts by structural panels. The six medium tracks should provide good traction in all conditions, with skids mounted on outriggers as a first line of anti-roll defence. (There are also underbody skids to prevent the main truss from bottoming out.) A Universal Storage hex-core provides a water purifier in addition to the fuel cell and electrolyser from the Mk I to further extend electrical endurance; however, energy storage is significantly lower than the Mk I - the Kerbal Foundries rover body was, apparently, packed to the brim with batteries. KIS storage is provided for a winch and a variety of attachments for it.\n\nRCS thrusters on the side panels provide further roll prevention. When kOS detects a roll, it will activate RCS and return stowable solar panels and the camera boom to the positions in this picture. Once MechJeb has stabilised the rover, the crew will manually deactivate RCS and raise the camera boom.\n\nThe side panels and outriggers will also be able to mount Kerbal Foundries screws to convert the Mk II to an amphibious configuration.\n\nVisibility from the pilot pod atop the vessel is excellent. The same cannot be said of the two inline pods within the strut structure, but they are at least heavily protected and can use the camera boom.\n\n[![mkii-front-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mkii-front-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mkii-front.png)\n\nThe camera boom is provided to reduce the risk of driving off cliffs. Its high vantage point should be useful to alert Jebediah, the pilot, to terrain irregularities. It can rotate and pitch freely.\n\nAs on the Mk I, two external command seats are provided for Sally and Svetlana, as and when they feel the anti-roll precautions are sufficient.\n\nTo do:\n\nTest the array of headlights and decide which are necessary. Consider mounting a headlight on the camera boom. Fit underbelly camera.\n\nMove the RTG from the easily accessible prototype position to one inside the struts - not adjacent to any crew module.\n\nFit MKS inflatable habitat for crew comfort.\n\nFit kOS and SCANsat BTDT modules; fit launcher with full array of SCANsat modules.\n\nFit forward-facing engine to provide additional cliff-driving-off protection.\n\n(I\u0027m not generally a big fan of Tweakscale, but I\u0027ll make an exception for batteries and OX-STATs where mounting lots of little ones drives up the part count. Why am I posting when I\u0027m not quite done? Partly to get these things out of my head.)"},{"CreatedByName":"B-STRK","CreatedById":126119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:08:52Z","Content":"The boxier solution would likely be more survivable, though in serious need of a makeover (![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), but I think the safest part would actually be the track clearances on the front and back. Before I made the hallelujah! conversion to KF, octocores served as wheel bogies for XL-3 skid wheels, which were then clipped into the main fuselage (usually a resource tank), and the exposed parts strutted against the fuselage.

I did tweak dampening and spring strength to what I felt was appropriate to prevent any boinginess (up a couple notches, to 0.04 or 0.004, I forgot how many zeroes ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) on the dampening seemed to do the trick). In fact, I feel like I should have increased spring strength a bit, as I\u0027m kinda afraid of a nose strike being more possible when the rover hunkers down at speed. BTW, I also use the plugin with the stock KSP wheels, and they also exhibit this behavior. It\u0027s probably going to be less pronounced on the tracks, if it is even observable.

I\u0027m still fiddling with the launcher, so I could have a look at that (although the mod thread is quite coy about its exact contents, sigh)."},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T21:00:40Z","Content":"Another day, another learning experience. Here we are just after takeoff:\n\n[![mun-1-takeoff-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-1-takeoff-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-1-takeoff.png)\n\nAlthough the rover itself is quite a bit heavier than the Mk I and a more awkward shape (hence the huge fairing with adapters above it), the launcher itself weighs almost exactly the same while still bringing a considerable dV surplus... or, given the shenanigans I had to go through to get it landed on the Mun, perhaps it should be thought of as a dV reserve.\n\nOne interesting feature of this design is that the SRBs have LFO nosecones on top with fuel lines linking them to the central engine. This lets the SRBs be dialled down a bit - the main engine keeps TWR reasonable at launch and is shut off when the nosecones are dry - but in the meantime TWR has risen because weight has been burned off. The SRBs burn longer and don\u0027t spend so much time shoving us upwards at terminal velocity.\n\nThe plan of installing SCANsat modules on the launcher proper is no good. The huge mass of the launcher has to be got into first a high orbit for the high-res altimetry sensor, then a medium one for the multispectral sensor; you have to wait around burning up life support supplies (yeah, but every little helps) and unless you\u0027re going to make multiple passes, you don\u0027t even get anything but a narrow strip around the equator. Instead, the launcher should carry and deploy a probe for each scan type.\n\nkOS power management works well but should be decoupled from roll detection. In orbit, you don\u0027t want kOS folding up the solar panels all the time.\n\nNERVAs are fine for a variety of purposes, but probably not landings. When they heat up on a suicide burn, there\u0027s no shutting them off and doing the rest of the burn later. I had to circularise just above the Mun\u0027s mountains and cool off before doing the landing... and at that, it was a close-run thing, hitting about 90% of maximum engine temperature.\n\nHere we are coming in for a landing before I think better of it and abort. Just as well I had all that spare juice.\n\n[![mun-2-landing-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-2-landing-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-2-landing.png)\n\nAnd here we are landed. Not one of my better landings, either, more \u0022engine nozzles touch, craft falls over, rotate to land tracks-down\u0022 - but nothing actually fell off, so no foul.\n\n[![mun-3-landed-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-3-landed-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-3-landed.png)\n\n(Another more serious issue with the Mk II rover is that KSP believes the hatches on the two lower pods are blocked because they\u0027re set into hollow trusses. I don\u0027t - there\u0027s clear air above each pod - but I still can\u0027t get anyone out of any pod but the top one. I\u0027m not sure what to do about this.)"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:17:57Z","Content":"I suppose at some point I\u0027d better actually drive somewhere, but first a kerbals-eye view of a flag planted by Svetlana at the landing spot. In theory it should be possible for the rover to reattach to the engine module in an emergency. In practice it is not, because as soon as I undock the engine module is going to roll away downslope and get lost or destroyed; and in any case the rover probably needs legs to elevate its nose for a ground-scraping takeoff.\n\n[![mun-4-flag-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-4-flag-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-4-flag.png)\n\nHere\u0027s the in-cockpit view, which I\u0027m using whenever I\u0027m moving.

However, with the aid of the BetterTimeWarp and KerboKatz PhysicalTimeRatioViewer mods, I can physics-warp up to about 100% speed. This itself cuts down on the driving-off-cliffs problem - it turns out that 18m/s real-time across the Mun\u0027s lumpy surface (Minmus has hills, but smooth ones; the Mun is locally quite bumpy) is quite alarming enough and I can resist the urge to let it zoom down hills at silly speeds.\n\nIt turns out the Farside Crater is really, really, huge. I landed in a sub-crater, and crested the rim of that (quite a steep slope), but have now moved 5 degrees longitude to the east over a seemingly endless series of small ridges, and I\u0027m still inside the crater proper.\n\nThis is just for demonstration purposes, it still being light - but if driving in the dark proves too annoying, plentiful life support supplies mean the kerbals can just stop every night and relax in the inflatable habitation module.\n\n[![mun-6-habitat-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-6-habitat-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/mun-6-habitat.png)\n\nI plan to do more than 1/72 of the trip in each update, but it\u0027s gone midnight here and it\u0027s taken me a while to work through all the annoying discoveries."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:34:48Z","Content":"Why put the camera on the pole if you don\u0027t have it on the MFD in the front cockpit?"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:29:28Z","Content":"Er...

Seriously, however, rep that you got the yoke working with KSP. It certainly is better than having to hold down W (or autokeying it as Fengist had done), moreso when that key is also tied to pitch-down. BTW, can you also control vehicle attitude as well as rover controls with the yoke, or is it really all on MechJeb \u002B kOS? If so, how did you configure the controls?\n\nOn a note of trivia, regarding your observation of a single axis for throttle, it might be that the Unity engine\u0027s setup for throttle axis could be based off an Xbox 360/PS3-4 bumper-trigger setup, which is what I\u0027m using. The rover throttle axis lines up neatly with using the triggers, which in Xinput are both modeled to a single axis (defaults to 50, LT pulls it to 0, RT to 100, like a joystick rudder-twist), and it also happens that seventh-gen racing games use the triggers as gas and brake/reverse. Also--and this would potentially betray my age ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)--I think the DOS-era *MechWarrior* games configed the Thrustmaster throttle so that 50% was dead stop, and forwards/reverse on the same axis--just like as observed here.\n\nEDIT/ERRATUM: Oh wait.

BTW, can you also control vehicle attitude as well as rover controls with the yoke, or is it really all on MechJeb \u002B kOS?

It also (of course) lets you bind axes for proportional control of steering and throttle (but not brake, but Control Manager makes it easy to say \u0022press the brake button if I have pressed the brake pedal at all). Unfortunately, the Mk II rover is too long and thin to pivot on the spot on its tracks, but you can\u0027t have everything.\n\nI could also bind the pitch/yaw/roll axes but MechJeb\u0027s stability control is in charge of those.
