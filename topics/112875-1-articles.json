While the Mk II is considerably longer, it\u0027s not a great deal heavier, so it should be straightforward to launch. Unlike the Mk I, the main body of the rover is entirely enclosed in a NF Construction octo-truss, a sturdy piece of equipment. The important parts mounted on the top deck are shielded from side impacts by structural panels. The six medium tracks should provide good traction in all conditions, with skids mounted on outriggers as a first line of anti-roll defence. (There are also underbody skids to prevent the main truss from bottoming out.) A Universal Storage hex-core provides a water purifier in addition to the fuel cell and electrolyser from the Mk I to further extend electrical endurance; however, energy storage is significantly lower than the Mk I - the Kerbal Foundries rover body was, apparently, packed to the brim with batteries. KIS storage is provided for a winch and a variety of attachments for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS thrusters on the side panels provide further roll prevention. When kOS detects a roll, it will activate RCS and return stowable solar panels and the camera boom to the positions in this picture.
