We could plug in basic Kerbin orbital parameters and get an idea of whether or not we have a reasonable launch window prior to launching the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T22:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA good idea at that!

I think they are making a mistake by not including something like this. I also think the lack of basic information such as TWR or DV that we need to plan out our rockets efficiently is on par with being criminal. Heck so is the lack of an auto pilot!!

If you use the manoeuvres right, you can even get delta V for landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be some limitations, just using the one spacecraft at a time system manoeuvre nodes have now makes it harder to plan a whole mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, I wouldn\u0027t like it to give you all the answers. Having a loose plan, then winging the rest is part of the fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also support the idea of a delta V counter in the editors, that would be useful. Though there\u0027s got to be a balance between useful, immersion enhancing planning tools, and making the player use their own smarts to work things out. That\u0027s also part of the fun to me- the game doesn\u0027t give you many answers, you must plan and think by yourself. And that\u0027s much more rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
