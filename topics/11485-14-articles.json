That includes what changes we\\\u0027d like to make to the rules, keeping in mind that many of them are in place to give all participants a fair turn.\n\nThe main thing I\\\u0027m thinking is to keep the current \u0027You get 48 hours to launch one new craft into orbit\u0027 bit, but not worry about where you put that craft. The only restriction on where to land (if you choose to land) would be that you can only start one NEW base per turn, and only add 1-2 new items to each existing base. So a space station with 20 independent landers hooked up to it could land one at every existing base, and 1-2 at a new base somewhere - and still keep 10 attached to land next time that player\\\u0027s turn came around. The limits would basically be what you can design, and have time to pilot within the 48 hours you\\\u0027re given.\n\nIn short, 1 turn = 1 launch, 1 new mod, 1 new base, 1-2 new landers at existing bases. You\\\u0027re always free to land a monster craft with 10 detachable rovers on it - just don\\\u0027t detach more than 1 in a turn and leave it parked there. Landing one with extra rovers for later would let you drive additional rovers to any new bases set up later.\n\nYou\\\u0027re also still free to just launch one craft, land one lander, at one of the existing bases. It just seemed like enough people wanted to do ridiculously complex multi-lander launches that I\\\u0027m suggesting this change. What do people think? leave things as they were or go this route?\n\nAny other changes you\\\u0027d like to see in the rules, post them here and we\\\u0027ll discuss them!\n\nIn the meantime - I\\\u0027m going to stop flights for a couple days. Anyone who wants to help, I\\\u0027d like to build a record of our progress with the best possible screenshots of each base, and post the results over in a thread on General Discussion. Grab the persistence file and do whatever moving of rovers, turning on rover headlights, time-warping, etc. is needed to get a shot you think is perfect!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cthulufaic","CreatedById":6660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T17:01:28Z","Content":"The universe must like me today, I actually have to go on a trip to North Carolina, don\\\u0027t know how long but it will be a week or so maybe,\n\nbut with this few-day delay on flights, I may actually have time to go to North Carolina, do stuffs, and comeback to KSP with my turn!\n\nBut still, you can bump me down, I don\\\u0027t think the universe likes me that much. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T17:08:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\\\u0027re also still free to just launch one craft, land one lander, at one of the existing bases.

I\\\u0027m not particularly attached to any of them, as long as it\\\u0027s Munar (though I\\\u0027m about 99% sure my chosen craft can reach Minmus): whichever base you feel it would fit in is fine for me.\n\nAnyway, I know I\\\u0027m new to the forums and don\\\u0027t have many posts, but here\\\u0027s an image of the craft post-landing near my first Munar base. There\\\u0027s still plenty of fuel left in the main tanks (the RCS is mostly for maneuvering during orbit/trajectory corrections - it doesn\\\u0027t help much as the craft is somewhat heavy), and I managed to get within 100m of the Methodios Base.\n\nHere is the Gecko Precision Lander and Personnel Delivery Vehicle\n\n![FgUqx.png](http://i.imgur.com/FgUqx.png)\n\nThe forums are a bit wonky atm with the .16 business, so I\\\u0027m just kind of throwing this up there while they\\\u0027re loading for me. I\\\u0027m not sure if I\\\u0027m going to have to wait for the mod authors to update the packs for them to all work with .16 or not so this thing can land there. As far as mods are concerned, I won\\\u0027t have to add anything except maybe a parts pack; I\\\u0027ll have to look and see what has been added and compare it to what I have on this puppy. The forums are just really slow so it\\\u0027s hard for me to look.\n\nThanks in advance, and I hope I get to take part. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
