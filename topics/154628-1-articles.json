(Btw my game version is \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E1.2.2.1622\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first, I only had a couple of\u00A0mods installed (KSOS, KWR, OPT SP, PD, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E). When I loaded up KSP only a few of them worked. I assumed either my game was outdated or the mod was. Then when I downloaded more and sorted the game data correctly this time more of them worked but not all. This time when I had all of them installed, when I clicked on the application on my homepage nothing would happen, the game wouldn\u0027t open. I then went to the KSP folder in my Steam apps and had to start it up manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the game opened everything was normal. I decided because I had so many mods installed I would need to start a new save file, and so I\u00A0did. When i got to the space center and I tried to enter the Spaceplane Hangar it wouldn\u0027t open,\u00A0Nor did the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. When I clicked on the runway to load a plane nothing would happen, same with the launchpad. I couldn\u0027t interact with anything, hence the name \u0022Ghost Mode\u0022. I couldn\u0027t even quit the game from the menu! The only thing I did manage to interact with was the Recruitment center but once I entered I couldn\u0027t exit. In a nutshell my game is now unplayable. Could you help me or explain this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any way to help me or an explanation be sure to let me know as soon as possible.
