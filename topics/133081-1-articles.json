Usually a little greater where there are mountains or deposits of heavy metals such as iron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe atmosphere actually goes far beyond even the moon and is gradually being blown away by the sun. Of course the Electromagnetic field protects it somewhat and the loss is very small. It is also being recreated by plankton and such but the point is, it\u0027s out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe atmosphere from any planet will affect anything else in its orbit over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll our space junk will eventually fall back to earth because of these gravity fluctuations and the very slight reduction in orbital velocity cause by the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you get a high enough orbit, it will be stable for longer but it will not have any of the benefits of the protection from our electromagnetic shield and the movement of other bodies in the system will affect it over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moon, for example, is getting bored of our company and is gradually breaking away from us. It was quite a bit closer and appeared larger in the sky when the dinosaurs were around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moon also affects the orbits of items in orbit around the earth. Just as it pulls on the seas it also pulls on things in orbit. Just a little because they are so much less massive than an ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you see the answer is no it is not a bug if the intent was to show orbital drift (Albeit in an extremely overpowered manner)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the answer is yes it is a bug considering how great the discrepancy is, I doubt it was intended to be so vigorous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also be argued that the \u0027bug\u0027 if indeed we accept that it is one, is not the fault of squad or the game but of the game engine Unity which is a virtual environment with it\u0027s own limits and faults.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you read this far, then you are now as wise about it as some of us are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-28T16:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2016 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nobodyhasthis2","CreatedById":154685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T18:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222433372\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133081\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456662929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152441\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Delta_8930\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Delta_8930 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill the orbits eventually decay or will they move slightly above and below the original apoapsis?

Even an orbit that dips into an atmosphere will not decay as long as you will not switch to that craft. Only active craft in an atmosphere will decay.
