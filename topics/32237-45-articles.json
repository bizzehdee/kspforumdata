A rendezvous with a large space station, about 1/3 FusTek by part count has become incredibly sluggish.

Something such as the Wavefront .obj format is a huge mass of ASCII text, partly the sort of info that is in a part.cfg, partly the 3D coordinates of every vertex in a theoretically human-readable form. Which leads to all sorts of extra work for the computer, converting the ASCII to 32-bit integers, probably signed integers. The .mu files used by Unity are of that sort, not ASCII. Is that going to mess up things so much?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know. But those six components might end up being treated, by JSITransparentPod, as six distinct parts. The Kupola model doesn\u0027t do that, all the glass is in the same model.mu as the rest of the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the old days, I worked with programs in interpreted BASIC, and I really hope Unity isn\u0027t that bad, but finding six small components by reading an ASCII file is going to be slow. I found ways to replace several lines of BASIC with a dozen bytes of machine code, and the speed difference is incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new behaviour of the FusTek parts feels like a reversal of that change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd do you need to reference all the different components in the part.cfg?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Hell, no! It doesn\u0027t need Blender, it\u0027s essentially a merging and positioning of the components, made as distinct files and saved as a single file (I used Wings3D and I know Blender can do the same). A key term-of-art here is \u0022Material\u0022. You can have the same material defined for all the component meshes, the same label, and that label will be in the end product, much easier for JSITransparentPod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can think of several things I can do. There\u0027s a tool to get an .mu file back into Blender. But then I have to deal with the IVAs. One thing is obvious, just from the filesizes: even with the efficient use of the same .dds files for so many different parts, they\u0027re big files. And I find that one of them is a whole set of barcode labels for different things They\u0027re big enough to distinguish the line patterns. When you\u0027re in the IVA, everything looks incredibly sharp, much sharper than the IVA in a Squad component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with the efficient re-use of each texture, they\u0027re just too good. You could halve the dimensions of every file, and likely still be better than what Squad uses, and there would be a quarter of the data for the graphics chipset to be handling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a common trick is to make a high-res model and generate things such as normal maps from that model. Things such as ambient occlusion are \u0022baked\u0022 into the texture after being generated from the high-detail model.

That\u0027s something that makes a memory leak unlikely. It\u0027s got a particular look. but it isn\u0027t vital that you use it. Since a lot of in-line docking ports, such as are used in spaceplanes, use the Clamp-O-Tron stock docking port, there is an argument for sticking with the stock docking port at 1.25m size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other 1.25m docking ports.
