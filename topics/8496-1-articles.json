If you can\\\u0027t look around the forums and read updates, say the stuff that goes in Announcements, that\\\u0027s not my fault. Also, it\\\u0027s pretty easy to find posts, eve now, that explain why updating isn\\\u0027t working. So when it was posted, asking what happened when you had 5 days of advanced warning, is, in fact, a useless post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
