Rovers are useful if you want to get science from several biomes. Without them you should hop from one biome to another on your craft and while it can easily be done on smaller planets, it can be painful on worlds like Tylo.\n\n(I just thought that I\u0027ve never sent a rover to Tylo, thanks for an idea ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T08:12:22Z","Content":"You build rovers for fun and exploring different biomes, note that Minimus is extremely hard to drive on !"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T08:26:15Z","Content":"You can get a bunch of science done just driving around and near the KSP launch facilities.\n\nMaybe someone can confirm this, but I think each building area is a separate biome?"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T08:38:47Z","Content":"In current kerbal universe, probes and rovers don\u0027t have a great scientific value ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T08:39:52Z","Content":"Rovers *feel* really slow.
