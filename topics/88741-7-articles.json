I know some folks will be bundling the CTT, and I know others will require that it be downloaded. So the important question for us to answer now is: where in GameData will this sit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EGameData/CommunityTechTree/tree.cfg\u003C/span\u003E. That means we don\u0027t end up with multiple mods putting it in different places and us ending up with duplicates. It means that ModuleManager will produce a pass for CommunityTechTree, so parts can \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003E:REQUIRE\u003C/span\u003E or run \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003E:AFTER\u003C/span\u003E that. It means that CKAN packaging will run out of the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of updates, we\u0027ve got a few options. New versions can release with the same path, but then players run the risk of ending up with an old version of the CTT if a mod bundles an older version of it. If we\u0027re targeting TechManager (which I hope we are), then the tree should be ModuleManager friendly\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B9. One possible solution then would to then have \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Etree.cfg\u003C/span\u003E be invariant across new versions, and changes be made by having update files (\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Etree-update-1.1.cfg\u003C/span\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Etree-update-1.2.cfg\u003C/span\u003E). Those update files will run after the original tree.cfg and can update it appropriately. This means someone installing an older bundled CTT won\u0027t be changing any files, and the player won\u0027t end up with a surprise backgrade to their tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECKAN installs are of course immune to all of this, because the CKAN will always install the most recent compatible version of the CTT. I\u0027m happy to do the CKAN packaging, although having releases on Github or Kerbalstuff will help a lot there, as our bots are then able to detect new releases automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for all your hard work on this, Nertea, I very much appreciate it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ Paul\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B9 Anonish, I\u0027d love your confirmation that my beliefs on the awesomeness of TechManager and ModuleManager are correct here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty much what I though we\u0027d do.

What do you plan on doing with NFT? I think in the end it makes sense to do the repo as just the tree, and leave it up to the mods to bundle or not bundle, since folks really aren\u0027t going to grab this on their own, they will likely nab it with one of the larger mods using it. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for this.
