The video shows the attachment of a FLT-400 fuel tank to the probe body. \u00A0At the 3 minute mark, the forklift carrying the fuel tank crashes into a pile of wood planks, causing it to drop the fuel. The engineers nearby cringe for a few moments, before returning to normal. The dented fuel tank is picked up again, and in violation of every single construction law in the country, \u003Ci\u003Ereattaches \u003C/i\u003Eit instead of disposing of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EReview: Training Protocol\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EReview: Flight Procedures\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EReview: On the Procurement of Fuel\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ESub-article: On the procurement of biofuel.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ve spotted a truck advertising for free food driving around town.
