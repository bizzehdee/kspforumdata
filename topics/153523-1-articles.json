Maybe with rewind and slow motion and other features to see whatever you want in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-14T17:57:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2016 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T19:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a good suggestion. \u002B1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T19:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDude, I have always wanted this!
