I am under 10m from the next contract, a rescue mission. How do I get the stranded kerbal from the debris, to the hitchhiker pod? I have tried \u0022transfer\u0022, no dice. Do I need to risk jetpacking over to it lol?"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:29:06Z","Content":"get your ship with a distance 2km or less, then press [ or ] to switch focus, then EVA the poor man and move him/her to your ship, and then happy landing."},{"CreatedByName":"Veldez","CreatedById":140511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:30:36Z","Content":"Ah ok. So I DO have to manually jetpack over. There is no button to do it? Guessing F5 will be my best friend there....."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:35:59Z","Content":"Right. Moving the poor man to your ship needs to be controlled by you. To be more precise, you click EVA, then press Space to leave ladder, then press R to activate jetpack, then WASD{LShift}{LCtrl} to move. Shouldn\u0027t be harder than rendezvous as jetpack gives a decent acceleration and you don\u0027t need to worry about unaligned RCS CoT versus CoM. I actually think doing rescue is a good tutorial for rendezvous."},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:57:14Z","Content":"I like to get my ship within 100m as I prefer short EVA trips and it is not hard to get that close. I have been as close as 20m. I agree that doing a rescue is good practice for rendezvous/docking."},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrazine_Soup","CreatedById":91100,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:51:42Z","Content":"Distance in space is overrated, you can send a kerbal on EVA to rendezvous with a ship 20 kilometers away with no trouble"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:19:23Z","Content":"It\u0027s the EVA jetpack that is OP. I once encountered a bug that I can control a ship that hasn\u0027t been rescued (1st vessel in the save, save in KSC, then do quick load - you\u0027ll not switch to KSC but instead focus on your first ship, regardless of whether you have control or not). And it happened to be a high orbit ship to rescue - and I just EVA the poor man, get him to LKO with EVA jetpack only. 20km - oh that was a Ap~23000km orbit"}]}
