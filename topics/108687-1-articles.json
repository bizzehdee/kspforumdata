Moving the poor man to your ship needs to be controlled by you. To be more precise, you click EVA, then press Space to leave ladder, then press R to activate jetpack, then WASD{LShift}{LCtrl} to move. Shouldn\u0027t be harder than rendezvous as jetpack gives a decent acceleration and you don\u0027t need to worry about unaligned RCS CoT versus CoM. I actually think doing rescue is a good tutorial for rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to get my ship within 100m as I prefer short EVA trips and it is not hard to get that close. I have been as close as 20m.

I once encountered a bug that I can control a ship that hasn\u0027t been rescued (1st vessel in the save, save in KSC, then do quick load - you\u0027ll not switch to KSC but instead focus on your first ship, regardless of whether you have control or not). And it happened to be a high orbit ship to rescue - and I just EVA the poor man, get him to LKO with EVA jetpack only. 20km - oh that was a Ap~23000km orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
