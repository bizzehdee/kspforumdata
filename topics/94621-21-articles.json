I forgot to report here mostly because it was not big problem, but could be related with yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depends how that moded hangars stores(saves) craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps to reproduce my subassembly problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have created a crafts tail that consist of two vertical custom shaped pieces, two horisontal small wing surfaces(also custom shaped) and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink for craft file is available in signature if it is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI liked that tail, so I deceidet to make subassemly from it for future usage. All well so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when I start to build another new craft I used that tail subassembly and all parts was unshaped like I was used parts from palete without customizing sizes and shapes. It was pretty much looked similar to your problem on picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once I actualy attached that tail on craft, it is formed in my customized shape like I have saved in subassembly and worked as normal tail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T09:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK - there\u0027s definitely something strange going on with these procedural (all-moving) control surfaces, but I am not sure whether it\u0027s a product of me not understanding aerodynamics, or something actually wrong - I\u0027d appreciate some feedback. It\u0027s specifically a problem when the control surface is held at maximum deflection, I think, or at least most apparent then - like I described earlier for the spoilers that cease working if you hold down B, but work fine if you pulse it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that this is probably a FAR issue on some level - but is it possible that these procedural parts are not delivering the right \u0022shape\u0022 to FAR, or something? Sorry, I just don\u0027t know enough about how it works to know whether that question even makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought at first it was a lack of control surface area, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. Here\u0027s the plane, for reference - I mean, I think the elevators are definitely (apparently) big enough to force pitch enough for a loop with the plane, right? :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/procControls1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022procControls1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in fact doing a loop is impossible. Here are the symptoms:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When I at first press W or S to engage the elevators, the plane jerks sharply up or down. I figure this is normal - those elevators are huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If I HOLD W or S, however, the apparent force pushing up/down on the tail seems to decay rapidly to zero. It\u0027s like the only thing that\u0027s actually then rotating the plane is the reaction wheels in the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I thought maybe my design was just crappy, so I repeated this with stock elevons. Problem does not happen - still a crappy pitch-wobbling design, but it wobbles all the way over in a loop at a relatively constant overall rate of pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. This does not apply to procedural control (not all-moving) surfaces used as ailerons - I can roll constantly, just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The problem doesn\u0027t seem to apply to the all-moving procedural control surface used for yaw, either - only pitch, but a little hard to tell with the yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Thinking the problem might be that the elevators were just too huge, I tried a different (smaller) size of procedural all-moving surface. The result was REALLY weird pitch behavior - hard to describe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelatively normal speeds here (100-250m/s, tried at different speeds). You\u0027d think that holding W or S would cause the plane to continue pitching up or down, but it doesn\u0027t. It *feels* (yeah, yeah) like there\u0027s some weird response curve or something associated with holding down the key (or with reaching maximum deflection, or something) that just makes them stop working. As if the shape FAR is seeing on the elevator is maximally deflected \u003Cem\u003Eat first \u003C/em\u003Ewhen you press the key, rather than after holding it down for just a moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo - I can take this over to the FAR thread, too, or post over there, but thought I\u0027d ask again since I don\u0027t see the same behavior with other control surfaces (but still with FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe another mod is interfering too - I use a lot.
