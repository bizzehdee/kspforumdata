Unfortunately I don\u0027t know the duration of the contract, because it doesn\u0027t say in the Failed Contract description. However, the only thing it could be, as far as I know, is that I exceeded the duration. However, I\u0027m only in Year 8 of my whole campaign. These contracts typically last for 10-20 years, and the absolute max that I could have accepted it is about 3 years ago.
