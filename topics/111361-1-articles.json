Slapping mechjeb on anything gives lag/fps drop every second. This problem seems to get worse the more ships there are out there using mechjeb. Removing or launching anything without mechjeb makes the game behave just fine. I suspect that mechjeb tries to calculate the delta_v for every ship at every physics tick, making the game unplayable. Now I do rely on mechjeb, I\u0027m better at building than at flying.

I think it is because MechJeb is doing some CPU heavy math every second, and it gets worse the larger and more complex the ships are. My best fixes are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Disable landing prediction --\u0026gt; This is really calculation intensive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the vessel is really large or complex and MechJeb has no idea what the Delta-V is anyway, just disable those windows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

It\u0027s extremely annoying to use mechjeb when it makes the game lag so horribly and freeze every few seconds, not sure how it\u0027s so popular... It needs some serious optimization. As soon as I attach the mechjeb part in the VAB, the lag begins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) I don\u0027t think it\u0027s doing landing predictions in the VAB...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)
