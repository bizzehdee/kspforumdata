Slapping mechjeb on anything gives lag/fps drop every second. This problem seems to get worse the more ships there are out there using mechjeb. Removing or launching anything without mechjeb makes the game behave just fine. I suspect that mechjeb tries to calculate the delta\\_v for every ship at every physics tick, making the game unplayable. Now I do rely on mechjeb, I\u0027m better at building than at flying. Does anyone have any idea how to fix it?\n\nThe game is ran at 64 bits ubuntu.\n\nGreetings,\n\nJelmer\n\nEDIT: THe same occurs in 32 bits windows.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T08:05:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jelmew**"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T19:10:06Z","Content":"I have had this issue as well. I think it is because MechJeb is doing some CPU heavy math every second, and it gets worse the larger and more complex the ships are. My best fixes are:\n\n1. Disable landing prediction --\u003E This is really calculation intensive\n\n2. If the vessel is really large or complex and MechJeb has no idea what the Delta-V is anyway, just disable those windows\n\n3. Point the camera at the sky (Yeah I know there are no views, but the FPS goes way up in general, and also allows more CPU time for MechJeb\n\nHope these help!"},{"CreatedByName":"jelmew","CreatedById":138716,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T05:51:33Z","Content":"Hi\n\nUnfortunately, none of these do anything.

It\u0027s extremely annoying to use mechjeb when it makes the game lag so horribly and freeze every few seconds, not sure how it\u0027s so popular... It needs some serious optimization. As soon as I attach the mechjeb part in the VAB, the lag begins. \n\n1.) I don\u0027t think it\u0027s doing landing predictions in the VAB...\n\n2.) Craft size has no relevance to the stuttering at all. Even the mechjeb part by itself causes stuttering.\n\n3.) Again, not relevant inside the VAB.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T20:24:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by leptoon**"}]}
