I hesitate to say that I \u003Cem\u003Esuffer\u003C/em\u003E from this disease, as I feel that I do not. To me, treatment is simple and straightforward, and I have good medical benefits to help me out. And I\u0027ve been lucky. But I know others aren\u0027t nearly as fortunate as I am. Treatments aren\u0027t cheap, and poor control often leads to other expensive complications down the road such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, blindness, or kidney disease. None of these are any good, and with nearly one in ten people being diagnosed with diabetes, and with another one out of every four being at risk, this is closer to you and the people you love than you might think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAnyway, as you\u0027ve probably figured out at this point, this is where you come in.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy family and I will be riding in the Wichita Tour de Cure event on April 29. I\u0027ve committed to raising $250 in donations before the event as part of my entrance requirements. The funds tracker below will link to my personal giving page on the Tour de Cure website. Donating through the website is pretty straightforward as long as you use a credit card or PayPal. If you can\u0027t use one of those options but still want to give, please PM me and we\u0027ll see what kind of arrangement we can work out. If you don\u0027t trust links you find on this website, you can type \u0022tour.diabetes.org\u0022 into your address bar and follow the \u0022donate\u0022 link at the top of the page, searching for my name (Dan Bender).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tour.diabetes.org/site/TR?px=12292245\u0026amp;pg=personal\u0026amp;fr_id=11738\u0026amp;s_src=BF_emailbadge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022status.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://bfapps1.boundlessfundraising.com/badge/tourdc/display/12292245/11738/status.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022border:0;\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EIn case you\u0027re wondering...no, I don\u0027t know why the progress image has the \u0022TdC 25\u0022 logo.
