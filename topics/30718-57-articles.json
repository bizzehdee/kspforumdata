Behind him, a pressure washer started up with a hissing roar, sluicing an evil-looking slurry of decomposing plant matter out of the back of the refrigerated trailer parked in its inspection bay. The aseptic tang of hot sterilising fluid joined the fetid stench of rotting greenleaf, making Joemy cough. Pulling his mask up over his nose, he checked off the cargo on his order tracking form and looked around for the truck driver he and his team were helping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother white car marked with the paintbrush-and-tree-stump logo of the White Cross Company was parked in the next inspection bay next to a larger trailer, wisps of vapour wreathing its back doors. Joemy watched a pair of boiler-suited figures, one of them with her hair scrunched up under a blue plastic cap, unloading a crate of greenleaf and mentally wished them luck with the cleaning up. Behind them, another truck rumbled out of its bay, another one taking its place almost immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, the queue stretched down the road and out of sight. Joemy noticed several smaller vehicles dotted in amongst the big trailers and nodded to himself in satisfaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh, there you are. Everything checked off?\u201D Joemy spun round to face an elderly kermol dressed in a traditional poncho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEverything\u2019s repacked and tagged,\u201D he answered, handing the other a clipboard. \u201CCould you sign here please, by your company name and\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCompany name, the kerbal says. That\u2019s just the name of my farm, son. Ain\u2019t big enough to bother any of the big haulers with - I just hire a truck come harvest and move it all myself.\u201D A wiry, corded arm waved at the row of vegetable pallets. \u201CThis lot\u2019s all second pickings - we sell the best stuff right at the gate. Finest greenleaf for kilometres around.\u201D The farmer shot Joemy an appraising look. \u201CTranquility Shores, Melfrey\u2019s - all the fancy sea-view restaurants. All of \u2018em send their vegetable chefs out to us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll be sure to remember that,\u201D said Joemy. He smiled. \u201CNot that I\u2019ll be eating at Melfrey\u2019s anytime soon, I\u2019m sure. One last thing, sir - if you could make sure all the marked crates stay marked until they get to Bolfactad, we\u2019d appreciate it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor quality control?\u201D The farmer nodded sagely. \u201CHeard all about that from a couple of the other smallholders round my way. Not a problem, son.\u201D A movement by his trailer caught his eye and he turned his head to watch one of Joemy\u2019s team passing a compact piece of equipment out to her colleague before winding up a reel of hose. He peered at the collapsed plastic sacks strapped against its sides and scratched his head. \u201CI\u2019m guessing that would be your compressor? Never seen one like that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy grinned. \u201CYou wouldn\u2019t have. Our office is on the next unit along from the old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E assembly building, back when we\u2026 uh they, were working out of Jeb\u2019s place. We got a couple of their engineers to put something together for us. Completely portable, water sacks on the side don\u2019t carry enough water to flush out a trailer in one go, so we carry enough spares to make sure the job\u2019s done properly. Battery powered, pressurised by compressed air stored in a surplus thruster propellant tank, heated with a couple of propellant line heaters from the same thruster. Or so they told me anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe farmer gave him a crooked look. \u201COr so they told you. It wasn\u2019t your old rocket ship they borrowed all their bits and bobs from by any chance?\u201D He saw the expression on Joemy\u2019s face and chuckled. \u201CThought I recognised you from somewhere, son. Got a good memory for faces still, even if that\u2019s about all it\u2019s good for. So tell me - which rocket did you fly? And what in the name of my old mother\u2019s Grove is a kerbonaut doing out here sorting through greenleaf bushes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho Six,\u201D said Joemy quietly. \u201COrbital rendezvous with Richlin aboard Moho Five. Didn\u2019t manage to get onto the roster for any of the Pioneer flights, so I figured I\u2019d move sideways a way and go into engineering full time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe farmer nodded. \u201CI do remember that one. All the folks on the news talking about you sending up two rockets at once and wondering whether you\u2019d pull it off.\u201D He frowned. \u201CNot that there\u2019s been much about rockets in the news lately. You all are still planning to take us to Duna aren\u2019t you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re working it,\u201D said Joemy, trying his best to sound cheerful, \u201Cbut it\u2019s a big operation. Lots of stuff to build and test first before we can think about sending kerbals out there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell you\u2019d better get a move on. President Obrick had it right, I reckon.\u201D The farmer made as if to spit but thought better of it. \u201CKerm crisis he said - well that\u2019s what I\u2019d call it too and it\u2019s going from bad to even worse. Seems there ain\u2019t going to be enough room for all of them trees down here, so we need to get busy shipping some of them off to the next planet over. Not that I\u2019d fancy the farming up there - going to take a Kerm or three to turn that orange dust into anything like soil.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy looked at the old kerbal incredulously. \u201CI wish it were that\u2026\u201D A thoughtful expression crossed his face. \u201CAlthough\u2026\u201D He moved in a little closer and lowered his voice. \u201CBetween you and me, sir, we\u2019re having the same problems that you are. Food going out to the factories, rocket parts coming back from the factories - everything\u2019s taking too long to shift and it\u2019s slowing us right down. That\u2019s if we can get the parts made at all - government money has mostly dried up because of the fighting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other scowled. \u201CSo what\u2019re you wasting your time for packing greenleaf, son? I remember when you lot were just starting out. Building all your own gear and folks falling over themselves to help. Engineer like you should be back at those factories lending a hand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause we\u2019re going to need more than that.\u201D said Joemy quietly, wondering at the farmer\u2019s suddenly intent expression. \u201CHard for people to build spaceships if they\u2019re worried about feeding their families. We started the White Cross Company to fix that for them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut now we need more,\u201D the farmer echoed. \u201CReckon that\u2019s another thing that the President got right. Engineers and agronomists, young and old, kerman and kermol. I ain\u2019t no agronomist but, sure as luffas sit by the sea, I\u2019m a kermol. And I\u2019m thinking it wouldn\u2019t take so many wagons of greens and beans to feed all your rocket engineers and their families.\u201D He gave Joemy a toothy grin. \u201CWe wouldn\u2019t be feeding them on greenleaf soup, son - don\u2019t look so worried. I\u2019m not the only fella round our way wondering what happened to the rockets and plenty of us have had it up to here with the blighted inspections.\u201D This time the farmer did spit. \u201CYou help us get the trucks past those seffleks, son, and we\u2019ll make sure your engineers get what they need. Can\u2019t promise them any meat but beans and mushrooms never hurt a kerbal and they\u2019ll fill you up just fine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney steered around a pothole in the road and, muttering imprecations to himself, pulled up at the set of bollards blocking the road into the factory grounds. A uniformed guard emerged from his booth and approached them, three security passes clutched in his hand, lanyards spilling over his fist. Geneney climbed out of his car, closely followed by Jeb and Lucan. The guard eyed them at length, eyes flicking back and forth between their faces and the laminated photographs in his hand Lucan frowned for a second then relaxed at the sight of Jeb and Geneney\u0027s blandly polite expressions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Your security passes, sirs. Please wear them at all times whilst on the premises. Guest parking is on the right, bay five has been reserved for you. If you could stay by the car, somebody will be down for you shortly.\u0022 The guard flashed Jeb an apologetic look before retreating to his booth and flipping a switch on his desk. The bollards sank into the road with a muted whine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s do as the good kerbal said then,\u0022 Jeb slipped his pass over his neck and climbed back into the car. Geneney twitched his eyebrows at Lucan, who managed to hide his confusion behind an impassive stare. \u003Cem\u003ECheck your repeaters and keep quiet...?\u003C/em\u003E His gaze flicked across to a sudden movement from the booth roof and the confusion turned to chagrin. \u003Cem\u003EOh. Receiving you loud and clear, boss.\u003C/em\u003E Pulling his own pass over his head, Lucan got into the car and jerked the door shut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Careful with that,\u0022 Geneney said without rancour. \u0022Too many inspections, remember?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry,\u0022 Lucan buckled his seatbelt. \u0022Cameras at the gate? Seriously?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s what I saw,\u0022 agreed Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well it explains why the guard was keeping himself to himself. I figured he wouldn\u0027t recognise me or Gene but I thought the first kerbal on the M\u00FCn might get a bit more attention.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shrugged. \u0022Compared to the blocks of wood they employ at the inspection points he was downright chatty.\u0022 He exchanged a look with Geneney. \u0022It does make me wonder what Stratus are up to though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney gave a non-committal grunt and started his car. Lucan frowned at the half-empty car park as they drove past and turned right into the, almost deserted, guest parking spaces. Geneney swung into bay 5 and switched off the motor. They waited in silence, each wrapped in his own thoughts, Lucan staring at the factory building ahead of them. He was about to suggest going back to the security post and asking the guard to check whether anyone was actually been sent to meet them, when the door to Reception opened and a familiar looking figure strode towards them. Jeb nodded in satisfaction and unbuckled his seatbelt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Afternoon, Halnie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was answered by a warm smile. \u0022Hi, Jeb. Hi, Gene - good to see you again. Hi, Lucan.\u0022 Halnie\u0027s eyes dropped to the security passes around their necks. \u0022Sorry - force of habit. How was the journey?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It went,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022Inspections were no worse than usual.\u0022 He shook Halnie\u0027s hand, noting the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes and the skin drawn over her cheekbones. \u0022You\u0027re looking well, Halnie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well it\u0027s good of you to say so,\u0022 said Halnie dryly. \u0022Come on inside - we shouldn\u0027t keep Thomplin or Shervin waiting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shervin? I thought he was due to retire?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie shook her head. \u0022There was... a change of plan,\u0022 she said. \u0022He was kept on to personally manage a number of new clients.\u0022 She glanced at Jeb. \u0022As part of that, he was also promoted to vice-chair of the Board. Whatever you\u0027re trying to sell us, he\u0027ll have the final say on it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded. \u0022Appreciate you setting this up for us, Halnie. How\u0027s Thomplin doing, by the way?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Still with us,\u0022 said Halnie with a smile. \u0022and recently sent upstairs to be our VP of sales and marketing. He\u0027ll be in the meeting too.\u0022 She led everyone through the Reception area and up a flight of stairs, leading to a long corridor with large safety glass windows along one side that overlooked the factory floor. Lucan craned his neck trying to get a better view but couldn\u0027t make out any details beyond the factory machinery and a row of kerbals with their backs to him working at one of the production lines\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It looks quiet down there,\u0022 he commented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re only fully open three days a week at the moment,\u0022 said Halnie. Lucan saw the sudden tension in her shoulders. \u0022The space program contract is on hold as you know, and the rest of our business has been having the same problems as everyone else with the inspections.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What about those new clients?\u0022 Jeb asked casually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We value their continued custom and they appreciate our efforts on their behalf in these difficult times.\u0022 Halnie led them through an archway before zipping her pass through a keypad on the opposite wall. A door unlocked with a faint snick and she held it open. \u0022After you, good kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan stepped through into a carpeted corridor, a row of dark wooden doors leading off in either direction, each sporting a small brass plate. At the end of the corridor a cluster of leather armchairs had been arranged around a low table, scattered with journals and magazines. Framed certificates and photographs lined the walls and Lucan was startled to see one picture of a group of kerbals, including a rather younger Jeb, Geneney and Halnie, all posing by a partially completed Moho upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Conference room is the second on the left,\u0022 said Halnie. \u0022Coffee should have arrived by now, so please go in and make yourselves comfortable.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch to Lucan\u0027s surprise, the coffee table sported a selection of bottled soft drinks, including a high quality brand of smoky sapwood. He popped the top off a bottle and poured the contents into a glass, sniffing appreciatively at the released aroma of peat-and-woodsmoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Always good to meet an engineer with taste.\u0022 Lucan looked up to see a silver-haired kerbal decanting a second bottle into a glass. He waited for the other to take a sip of his drink and set it aside, before offering his hand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shervin. It\u0027s been too long.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A long time since the old Moho days,\u0022 Shervin agreed. \u0022What\u0027s Jeb got up his sleeve this time?\u0022 He snorted at Lucan\u0027s raised eyebrows. \u0022Don\u0027t give me that. The last time Thomplin got a call out of the blue from that scoundrel, it was to invite us down to Barkton to watch him being shot into space. This time he has the nerve to request a private meeting with, and I quote, \u0027an appropriate decision maker\u0027. He\u0027s up to something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan nodded. \u0022He is. Although from what I saw on the way up, it should benefit both of us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s what he said the last time too.\u0022 Shervin retrieved his glass. \u0022Although, in fairness, he was right. The kerbal won\u0027t have any luck begging any more free tanks off us though, I can tell you that now. Hey now - take it easy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry.\u0022 Lucan\u0027s voice was strangled. \u0022Sapwood went down the wrong way is all.\u0022 Coughing, he reached for a napkin to blot his jacket sleeve. \u0022Ow, that woodsmoke is hard on the lungs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just like the real thing,\u0022 said Shervin. \u0022You all right now?\u0022 At Lucan\u0027s answering nod, he strode over to the conference table. \u0022Right. Let\u0027s get started. Bring your drink over and take a seat.\u0022 He waited for everyone to settle themselves before tapping on the table. \u0022We\u0027re all busy people, so I\u0027ll get straight to the point. I understand that you good kerbals have a proposition for Stratus which you believe will be beneficial to us and presumably to the KSA?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney glanced at Jeb and Lucan. \u0022We do,\u0022 he answered. \u0022And before we get started, please be aware that we have the backing of Director Lodan in this matter.\u0022 Geneney took a sip of coffee. \u0022Project Starseed has stalled for reasons that we\u0027re all aware of. We need Stratus Inc to help us get it back on track. To that end we propose an informal, non-financial, exchange of services. In return for resuming your supply of parts and systems to the KSA, we can expedite movement of goods to your other customers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin burst out laughing. \u0022Of course you do. I\u0027ll wager that this was all Jeb\u0027s idea too - it has Jebediah Kerman brass neck all over it.\u0022 Around the table, Thomplin looked faintly disappointed whilst Halnie just looked thoughtful. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, but with all due respect to Lodan, you\u0027ll have to do better than that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnperturbed, Geneney took another sip of coffee. \u0022So how can we make this work?\u0022 he asked. \u0022If the inspection points around here are anything like the ones at Barkton, then I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027re having an easy time getting materials in our out of here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That would depend how much of it is for border security,\u0022 said Jeb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney braced himself for an outburst but apart from a tightening around the jaw, his friend\u0027s face remained calm, matched by three studiously inscrutable looks from the Stratus team. Jeb raised an eyebrow. \u0022It wasn\u0027t difficult to work out. Security cameras on the gates, a very nervous guard, a mention of new clients whilst carefully avoiding talking about them too much.\u0022 Jeb smiled at Halnie. \u0022I\u0027ve been out of comm range for a while but I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027d have heard about a new aerospace startup. Especially one ambitious enough to be ordering significant quantities of Stratus parts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if our new client was an existing player?\u0022 said Shervin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then we\u0027d have heard about it through Director Lodan.\u0022 Jeb exchanged looks with Geneney. \u0022I haven\u0027t forgotten our chat before Pioneer One, Gene, but I think this works out rather well.\u0022 He turned back to Shervin. \u0022Whatever work you\u0027re doing for your new client, it\u0027s left you with plenty of capacity. We help you smooth out your logistics problems and get you back to full production. You set aside some capacity for KSA use. We both win.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How many other companies have signed up to this kind of arrangement?\u0022 said Halnie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022None yet.\u0022 Geneneny leaned forward in his seat. \u0022At the risk of sounding trite, Stratus have been an irreplaceable partner to us since before Kerbal Two and, to be perfectly honest, without you on board, we\u0027ll be facing an uphill struggle with everyone else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And no doubt we would get some free advertising and our logo on the Starseed ships,\u0022 said Thomplin blandly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned at him. \u00A0\u0022Well it worked the last time but I think it would be a little too corporate for Starseed, don\u0027t you? Besides, we can do better than that. You\u0027re going to need some background first though.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Stratus team listened as Jeb outlined the pivotal meeting with Rockomax, Lodan\u0027s realisation that he had the theoretical legal standing to relaunch Starseed but without the practical authority to go with it, and his conclusion that a grass-roots volunteer effort would be required instead Thomplin\u0027s mouth quirked in a half-smile that was quickly replaced by an intent look as Jeb described the founding of the White Cross Company and its mission. \u0022We thought that we\u0027d be in for the long haul there,\u0022 Jeb admitted. \u0022Building trust, helping the haulage companies reduce their backlogs, getting everything moving again.\u0022 He gave Shervin an abashed look. \u0022Turns out we\u0027d forgotten about the kermol in all of this - but they hadn\u0027t forgotten about us. More to the point, it seems that a lot of them are taking President Obrick\u0027s speech to heart.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ohhh,\u0022 said Halnie, eyes suddenly shining. She saw Shervin\u0027s politely confused look. \u0022But now we need more. Engineers and agronomists, young and old, \u003Cem\u003Ekerman and kermol.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Exactly,\u0022 said Jeb. He looked Shervin straight in the eye. \u0022We can\u0027t pay you - but we \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E feed you. You, your factory workers - and their families. No queueing, no hoping to Kerm that the next food convoy arrives. We can\u0027t promise anything fancy but, as the good kermol said, beans and mushrooms never hurt a kerbal and they\u0027ll fill you up just fine.\u0022 Jeb eased back into his chair and watched Shervin mull it over. Then he took a deep breath. \u0022I mentioned that I\u0027d been out of comm range for a while but I didn\u0027t say why. It\u0027s a long story - and I\u0027ll spare you all the details - but the short version is that I was in a bad place.\u0022 Jeb squeezed his eyes closed for a minute. \u0022Kerm, this isn\u0027t easy.\u0022 Shervin watched as Geneney laid a hand on Jeb\u0027s shoulder. \u0022Thanks, Gene. Okay folks - bear with me if this doesn\u0027t go too smoothly.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaltingly at first, Jeb began to talk about the aftermath of \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4,\u003C/em\u003E about his growing despair as his beloved rockets turned from vehicles of exploration to weapons of war, and finally, about the training accident that claimed Ornie\u0027s life. Listening to Jeb recall his eulogy for his friend, Shervin\u0027s mind drifted back to his first meeting with a much younger kerbonaut on the eve of his first orbital flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...seriously though, Thomplin. I\u0027ve got a lot of good friends on this team. How can I possibly let any of them fly a spacecraft that I wouldn\u0027t be prepared to fly myself.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...apart from anything else, I never did like our village Keeper very much as a kerblet. Luckily - and not for the first time - Gene was able to talk some sense into me, so we set out for the Grove. And by all the Kerm, I can\u0027t tell you how glad I am that we did.\u0022 Geneney listened as Jeb described his first Communion with Elton to the increasingly wide eyed kerbals around the table.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He wanted to learn all about spaceflight, so I figured that showing him the view from Moho One would be a good place to start, which it was. And I don\u0027t know whether it was sharing the memories with a Kerm or what, but preserve me, it brought it all back to me with in a rush.\u0022 Jeb paused. \u0022So I decided to show him the view from Munar orbit aboard Pioneer Four.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which just about brought the house down,\u0022 added Geneney. \u0022Literally. I never knew a Kerm\u0027s branches could stand on end.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded. \u0022Mine too. Or they would have if I had branches. Or... oh Kerm take it, you know what I mean. Anyway, remembering those views of Kerbin in the darkness - and sharing them with one of the oldest beings on Kerbin - really hammered it home. We can make Starseed work. We have to make it work. And Elton agrees.\u0022 Struck by a sudden idea, Jeb\u0027s head snapped round to face Halnie. \u0022You never did join the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E in the end - never got a chance to fly or really see Kerbin for yourself.\u0022 Jeb swept his arms out, \u0022But you could. With Elton\u0027s help, I could show you - I want to show you! Elton wouldn\u0027t mind, he said himself that everyone should see!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sagged in his chair. \u0022Sorry, getting carried away with myself.\u0022 He looked at Shervin. \u0022Anyway, that\u0027s what I think. Helping your customers and feeding your workers aside, we need to do this because it\u0027s right and because, frankly, we don\u2019t have any other options left.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin nodded, before bowing his head in thought. Then he looked up at the three kerbonauts. Halnie caught a glimpse of his expression and her heart skipped a beat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s quite a story. Any other kerbal, I\u0027d be showing them the door about now.\u0022 Shervin shook his head. \u0022But... we followed you on one crazy ride before and that went places we couldn\u0027t have imagined. Kerm help me if we don\u0027t follow you on this one too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat should keep you going for a week or two.\u201D The truck driver slammed the trailer doors shut and locked them, before turning to Lucan with an angry scowl. \u201CSoup kitchens and folks with kerblets queueing for food - they didn\u2019t tell me it was this bad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut thanks to your Grove, we can give them something worth the wait.\u201D Lucan eyed the pallets of vegetables and neatly stacked sacks of dry goods. \u201CThank you so much - you\u2019ve been more than generous.\u201D The driver waved a dismissive hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019d need to thank the other Groves round us too but I\u2019ll tell them you were appreciative.\u201D He climbed into his cab and leaned out to grab the door handle. \u201CYou get the rockets flying again and we\u2019ll keep the food coming. Deal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDeal.\u201D Lucan had a sudden thought. \u201CAnd I\u2019ll do you another one. \u201CYou get me the names of everyone back at the Groves and I\u2019ll set them all down in a book. And if we ever get out to Duna, I\u2019ll make sure the first ship to get there has that book on board. Deal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe driver gave him a sharp nod. \u201CDeal - and I\u2019ll hold you to it.\u201D He thumbed a button on his dashboard and the truck motors rumbled into life. \u201CWon\u2019t be me bringing the next load but I\u2019ll make sure whichever of the gang they send your way has those names in their cab.\u201D Tipping his cap in farewell, he released the brakes and the truck rolled forward amidst a hiss of compressed air. Lucan watched him go, then turned to the first stack of sacks and began loading them onto a nearby handcart. Unheard, a door creaked open at the far end of the warehouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere are these all going, Lucan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan straightened up. \u201CDerny wanted tubers and mushrooms to go with the last of the greenleaf tonight, and he\u2019s putting a bean and veg stew on for tomorrow. I\u2019ve got everything for that all loaded up if one of you could trundle it out. Rest of the fresh stuff goes in the kitchen, anything dry goes into storage with the rest.\u201D Lucan smiled. \u201CPretty sure I saw a couple of sacks of cornmeal in there, so if you ask Derny real nicely\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCornbread?\u201D The other\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201CHaven\u2019t had any of chef\u2019s cornbread for an age.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was hoping for a good bowl of grits myself,\u201D Lucan said straight-faced, \u201Cbut each to his own.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBah, what else can you expect from a kerbal who drinks smoky sapwood for pleasure. Right, I\u2019ll take this lot out now while you load up the tubers and fungus.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlready on it. You want to sort out the greenleaf once you\u2019re done?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep.\u201D The other laughed. \u201CIf we ever need a decent kitchen porter or two out at Duna, we\u2019ll not be short of offers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot something I thought the space program would ever need,\u201D Lucan agreed. \u201CNor soup kitchens for that matter.\u201D He looked pointedly at the loaded handcart. \u201CWouldn\u2019t want to keep Derny waiting though, if you\u2019re serious about that cornbread.\u201D A cheerfully tuneless whistle and the receding squeak of rubber on concrete was all the answer he needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrecariously balanced on top of the tuber sacks, the mushroom trays were rather too large for the handcart, and Lucan decided to come back for them later. He wheeled his load out of the warehouse, blinking at the glare from white canvas catching the early afternoon sun. The last of the lunch shift were making their way back to the factory, leaving their families behind at the kitchen marquees and a familiar voice caught Lucan\u2019s ear as he made his way over to the long trestle tables set up outside the tents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPut the knife down lad, before you lose any fingers. You, you, you, you and\u2026 you - you\u2019re on tuber scrubbing duty. You three - watch those pots and tell me when they come to the boil.\u201D Derny eyed a huddle of older kerblets. \u201CYou lot - find yourselves a pair of kitchen gloves each. The pepper cactus is over there - you can help me get the spines off. Everyone gets a go at pounding on them to loosen up the pulp.\u201D Derny looked up at Lucan standing by his cart. \u201CExcellent timing as always, Lucan. Sacks on that table over there if you please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo problem, Derny. Mushrooms wouldn\u2019t fit on the cart so I left them back at the warehouse. I\u2019ll fetch them over with the rest of the tubers.\u201D Lucan saw one of the kerblets looking mutinous but before he could say anything, the youngster had caught Derny\u2019s eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you waiting for?

But right now we need you here, snapping spines and pounding pulp.\u201D He gestured at Lucan. \u201CLike we need Mr Lucan there. He\u2019s been to space, walked on the M\u00FCn even, but right now?\u201D Derny raised his eyebrows. \u201CRight now, he\u2019s organising truck drivers and hauling sacks of tubers for you lot to scrub.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan perched himself on the edge of the table. \u201CTell them what they\u2019re making, Derny,\u201D he suggested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhh yes,\u201D said Derny. \u201CHadn\u2019t thought about it like that but these are proper space rations we\u2019re cooking up here. At least they would be if we freeze dried them and stuck them in a pouch. The cactus pulp thickens up the tuber paste and adds a bit of flavour too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou don\u2019t want sloppy food in space,\u201D Lucan added. \u201CWe had a ration pack burst on Eve 2 - the crew spent half of their second day in space chasing vegetable mush around the capsule.\u201D Two of the kerblets smirked at him. \u201CSo now we test all the new ration packs the same way we test the capsule,\u201D Lucan finished. \u201CWe shake them up, put them in the vacuum chamber, and when we\u2019re done, Derny gets to open them. So far he hasn\u2019t ended up with space food all over his face.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot yet,\u201D said Derny.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the one that burst, mister?\u201D asked one of the kerblets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe kept changing the recipe until it worked,\u201D Derny replied. \u201CMe and kerbonaut Sherfel that is - she was the one who thought of adding cactus pulp to the tuber paste. Took us plenty of tries to get the vegetable stew just right and that was with both of us in the kitchen, peeling and chopping and boiling.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the kerblets started to look more enthusiastic about their chores. Lucan caught Derny\u2019s eye before slipping off the table and walking over to the mutinous-looking one, who was still scowling at his feet. \u201CYou can come and help me, lad,\u201D he said. \u201CWe could use a strong pair of hands back in the warehouse.

The loading bay doors rumbled open and a truck emerged, towing a trailer emblazoned with the Stratus Inc logo.

The dispatchers in the main office area snapped to attention behind their desks and began handing out clipboards to their colleagues pouring in through the front door. To Lodan\u0027s pleased surprise, several of them sported a White Cross Company patch on the breast pockets of their boiler suits. The throng of volunteers organised themselves into groups of four amidst much pushing and good-natured banter, each group taking a clipboard and leaving through the side door, shouted orders from the dispatchers following them out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Fresh leaves - main depot!

Cheap steel shelving, already cluttered with box files and other paperwork, occupied most of one wall. The other was taken up with a large map of Foxham and its surrounding towns and Groves and, under the window, an old computer and printer sat atop a worn plywood desk. Lodan eyed the equally worn chair in the corner with some trepidation before walking over to study the map, whilst the manager busied himself with kettle and mugs. \u0022It\u0027s only instant I\u0027m afraid, Director, but it\u0027s a decent enough brand.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan took the proffered mug without comment, blew on it and took a cautious sip.

We began to see a lot more traffic from Kallahat after Jeb - I mean Jebediah\u0027s visit, so I started looking around for new office space out by the western depot. I put Helke in charge and gave her a couple of the more experienced dispatchers to get her started.

The immense structure nestling on its dollies reminded him of nothing so much as a gigantic kerblet\u0027s stacking toy glued together and set on one side. A latticework of stringers covered the surface of each cylindrical section, the widest cylinder at the back studded with equipment fittings, ductwork and protruding window modules which gave it a curiously insectile appearance. The narrowest cylinder at the front was almost featureless by comparison, although, as far as he could see, still more than wide enough to accommodate a pair of kerbals kneeling side by side. A tapered annular section sat around the middle cylinder like a collar, a webwork of struts securing it to the rest of the structure.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Main pressure hull is to to the rear.\u0022 Ademone\u0027s voice broke into his thoughts. \u0022 You can\u0027t see it from here but it\u0027s fitted with a CORDS-3 adaptor for docking to the main hub module. The cylinder at the front is the airlock and docking port, or it will be once it\u0027s finished. The forward gangway links them together and also provides access to the observation deck.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022One half of which will be the colony ship bridge in the production version,\u0022 Lodan noted.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Exactly,\u0022 said Ademone. She gestured at a set of wheeled stairs parked in front of the airlock tube. \u0022You\u0027re welcome to inspect it if you wish.\u0022 The corner of her mouth quirked upward. \u0022The assembly crews normally get in through the CORDS-3 but I thought you might appreciate the full experience.\u0022 She watched Lodan make a show of checking his watch. \u0022The launch isn\u0027t until this evening, Director. I\u0027m sure I can find a few minutes in my schedule.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Well, if you insist.\u0022 Lodan walked over to the stairs and checked the brakes, before climbing up onto the upper platform. For a moment he stared into the open maw of the airlock, a circle of light illuminating the inner depths of the structure and glinting off a set of rungs set into the side wall. \u0022I presume this will take my weight?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022It will,\u0022 Ademone replied. \u0022We built it with enough of a margin to handle any less than perfectly judged docking attempts.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan nodded. A thought struck him and he removed his shoes, setting them neatly to one side, before crawling into the airlock on hands and knees. Once inside, he straightened up, brushing one hand over his head and found plenty of clearance between himself and the smoothly polished ceiling. Working his legs out in front of him, he shuffled forward on hands and feet before easing himself out of the airlock and dropping to the floor inside the forward gangway. He walked forward and paused under the circle of light, staring up the access tube at the open space and curved metal surface beyond. The ladder rungs that he\u0027d noticed from outside were sized with a space-suited kerbonaut in mind and he was able to scramble up them with ease.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHe emerged into a wide, empty compartment. Light from the outside world shone through apertures of varying shapes and sizes in the outer hull wall and, much to his relief, a maze of temporary baffles had been bolted to the convex floor to prevent assembly technicians, or visiting dignitaries, from slipping. Every available surface appeared to be marked with stencils indicating, Lodan presumed, the mounting points for control panels or other items of equipment. Directly ahead, the outer hull angled sharply inwards to meet the forward bulkhead, creating a windscreen like effect which was accentuated by the round-cornered rectangular holes cut into the tapered wall.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan clambered forward and arranged himself in front of the nearest window hole. The outer surface of the airlock tube stretched out ahead of him obscuring the wheeled stairway beyond. A pang of doubt crossed his mind as the sheer size of what the KSA was attempting became awesomely clear. Two bridge modules back-to-back, the hub module sandwiched between them and supporting a great eight-spoked wheel. Lodan shivered. \u003Cem\u003EWhich is nothing compared to the colony ship - the colony ships. But if we can pull this off... \u003C/em\u003EHe shook his head. \u003Cem\u003ENo ifs. \u003C/em\u003EWhen \u003Cem\u003Ewe pull this off.\u003C/em\u003E He closed his eyes and for a moment the bare metal compartment around him lit up with display screens and control boards. Radio chatter and status reports filled his ears and the view of the factory floor outside faded into the star dusted vista of deep space, broken by a single red dot.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CExcellent. I very much look forward to seeing the flight article.\u201D Lodan buckled his shoe and perched himself on the edge of the stairs. \u201CWill the Type Six be enough to launch it?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAdemone nodded. \u201CWe think so. Even our most pessimistic mass projections are comfortably within payload capacity. In terms of size, it\u2019s too wide for our standard fairing but we decided that designing and building a new fairing would be preferable than waiting for the R7 to come online, especially as we now have a spare booster immediately to hand, courtesy of the Pioneer Seven team.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan nodded. \u201CIndeed - and I think Bill would approve. I presume you\u2019ve carried out what tests you can on the ground?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWe have. All our modelling is telling us that the stretch fairing will work, that our guidance and control systems can cope with the new aerodynamics and that the booster airframe can handle the additional loads.\u201D Ademone favoured Lodan with a half smile. \u201CI understand that the flight dynamics and \u00A0structural engineering teams have a standing joke every time we fly a new rocket - \u2018it worked in the wind tunnel, so I \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u2019t\u003C/em\u003E have been surprised\u2019. We had hoped to have the actual flight test results ready for your visit but the launch was postponed due to high winds. You would be welcome to watch our second attempt with me this evening.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan looked thoughtful. \u201CTempting. If you could find me some office space with access to a telephone, I think I\u2019ll take you up on that.\u201D He paused. \u201CWhat are you intending to launch inside the new fairing?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CJust a standard test mass. Why?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CThere\u2019s nothing more useful that could be launched? Under the circumstances it does seem a little \u00A0profligate to use an entire booster to put a lump of concrete into orbit.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CIt does,\u201D Ademone agreed. \u201CBut even assuming we had the customers, we wouldn\u2019t entrust their payloads to an unproven launch vehicle. In an ideal world, we\u2019d be launching experimental Starseed hardware - an orbital refueling test most probably. But we don\u2019t live in an ideal world.\u201D She gave Lodan a sideways look. \u201CA number of the propulsion engineers suggested that we launch Geneney\u2019s old car into orbit but I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be particularly impressed with the notion.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan\u0027s mouth twitched. \u0022No,\u0022 he agreed, \u0022He\u0027s quite attached to that car. In any case, I suspect it wouldn\u2019t make a very reliable test mass. After listening to Geneney grumble about the good inspectors stripping it down on numerous occasions, I wouldn\u2019t be sanguine about it remaining intact during the flight.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHe looked at the pressure hull assembly, head cocked to one side. \u201CBut back to the point. That\u2019s certainly an impressive looking pressure hull but it\u2019s a long way from a pressure hull to a functional spacecraft. May I ask how work is progressing on the internals?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CNot as quickly as we\u2019d like but a lot quicker than we hoped,\u201D said Ademone. \u201CIf you\u2019d care to follow me?\u201D She closed the door to the assembly bay behind them and set off down the corridor, footsteps echoing on the polished floor. \u201CInsulation panel and outer hull fabrication is going well. We\u2019re using essentially the same insulation materials that we used for the Pioneer spacecraft, so we have all the manufacturing facilities on site.\u201D She stopped by a window and stood aside to let Lodan look through.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EInside, a profusion of silvery and copper coloured crinkled foils, cut to different shapes and sizes, hung from a maze of overhead conveyers. Rows of workers, standing at room-length worktables, unclipped the foils as they moved past and stacked them into what looked like curved, dull bronze frames. Lodan watched one worker slide a completed frame into a press at the end of her worktable before pulling a large lever. Another worker heaved his press open and inspected its contents before placing the finished insulation panel on another conveyer.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CThe outer hull sections are fabricated separately,\u201D said Ademone. \u201CWe\u2019re in the middle of a manufacturing run at the moment, otherwise I\u2019d show you inside the workshop. For now, lets get you suited up.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan followed her along another stretch of bare corridor which ended at a locked door. Ademone zipped her pass through a card reader and the door unlocked with a clunk. Inside, Lodan was surprised to see a locker room with rows of white coats hanging from rails and pairs of white rubber overshoes on racks underneath.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201COne size fits all, I\u2019m afraid,\u201D said Ademone. She reached into a box and pulled out a pair of translucent blue plastic caps. \u201CYou\u2019ll need one of these too.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan donned his protective clothing without comment and followed a similarly garbed Ademone onto the factory floor. Pieces of partially assembled spacecraft, each with their attendant group of technicians, rested on a bewildering assortment of benches and stands. Many more pieces sat abandoned, like bizarre pieces of high-tech sculpture.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAs I said,\u201D Ademone said quietly, \u201Ca lot better than we\u2019d hoped. Persuading Zaltonic to contribute helped us considerably - until the transport problems began I don\u2019t think we really appreciated how many electrical or electronic components they actually made.\u201D She looked at Lodan. \u201CShe\u2019d never admit it in public but I think even Nelton would concede that your volunteer program is working better than we expected.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CNot well enough though,\u201D said Lodan. \u201CNot if the number of empty assembly bays out there is anything to go by.\u201D He reached under his cap to scratch behind his ear. \u201CWould it be possible to meet your team leaders this afternoon and have them draw up a priority list of subcontractors? The \u00A0White Cross Company\u2019s efforts so far have, quite understandably, been targeted at former \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E suppliers, particularly those where Jebediah or Geneney have personal contacts.\u201D He gestured at the nearest group of technicians. \u201CClearly that is helping but I think it\u2019s time they shifted their focus a little.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAdemone nodded. \u201CI\u2019m quite sure they\u2019ll be able to find the time. Thank you, Director.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan stretched, checked his watch and began stacking his papers together. He was just slipping his jacket on when there was a knock at the door and Ademone walked in. \u0022Are you ready to go, Director?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022I am.\u0022 Lodan snapped his briefcase closed. \u0022I presume the weather is being kinder to us today.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAdemone nodded. \u0022Conditions at the Space Centre remain acceptable according to the latest meteorology update. The countdown is proceeding on schedule, so we should leave imminently if we\u0027re going to watch the launch.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EDespite himself, a thrill of anticipation ran down Lodan\u0027s spine. \u0022By all means, lets go then,\u0022 he said. He waited for Ademone to lock her office door before following her down the corridor to the lifts. \u0022I must admit that I\u0027ve been rather looking forward to this. I don\u0027t get to see nearly as many launches as I might like.\u0022\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAdemone smiled. \u0022Why do you think I chose an east-facing office? I don\u2019t always have time to watch them from the launch sites but I try to make a point of looking out for any flights out of Foxham. The conference room is east-facing too for the same reason - a coffee break and a rocket launch has smoothed many a difficult negotiation.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022They do tend to get the point of the negotiation across,\u0022 said Lodan. \u0022I recall Geneney saying much the same about the Barkton Space Centre.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022I can\u0027t imagine Geneney or Jebediah missing that particular tactic,\u0022 agreed Ademone. A bell chimed and the lift doors opened onto the lobby. \u201CIt\u2019s my car or yours I\u2019m afraid. I would have requested a driver but I believe that most them have thrown in their lot with the White Cross Company for the time being.\u201D She caught sight of Lodan\u2019s expression. \u201CWhich is greatly to their credit - and besides, I did give them the choice.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAhh. Commendably public spirited of them.\u201D Lodan held the door open for Ademone. \u201CIn that case, I think your car would be wisest - I\u2019m not particularly familiar with the roads around here.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAs you wish.\u201D Ademone took her car keys out of her jacket and pressed a button on the fob. Across the car park, the lights on a modest two-seater runabout blinked on with a muted clunk of unlocking doors. Lodan raised his eyebrows.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CEncoded radio transmitter,\u201D said Ademone. \u201CI forget which spacecraft subsystem it was originally developed for but the licensing rights turned out to be quite profitable.\u201D She gave Lodan a small, mischievous look. \u201CYou have to admit - it is rather space age.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s certainly more dignified than the plush kerbonaut bobble-head toys that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E came up with,\u201D said Lodan. \u201CThe last time I visited Barkton you could barely find a car without one of those ridiculous things hanging from the rear view mirror.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201COne of Geneney\u2019s more playful marketing suggestions,\u201C said Ademone straight-faced. She pulled her door closed and waited for Lodan to fasten his seatbelt. \u201CPersonally, I rather liked their collectable rocket part earplugs.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs they drove away from the factory, Lodan was pleased to see a small queue of vehicles waiting to get on-site, including one truck hauling a heavily laden covered flatbed trailer. He didn\u2019t recognise the company name on the tarpaulins but the satisfied grunt from the driver\u2019s seat told him all he needed to know.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe main road to Foxham was mostly free of traffic and Ademone was able to make good time to the Space Centre. Lodan found himself whisked efficiently through a security barrier, past a long row of warehouses and other, less identifiable, buildings and into a private car park. Inwardly sighing as Ademone waved her car keys over her shoulder, he followed her around the front of a modern-looking two storey office block and came to an abrupt halt.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe evening sun threw long shadows from the buildings around him, casting the buildings around him in a soft, fulvous glow and glittering from the almost mirror smooth Northern Ocean to his east. Lodan squinted hard, just able to make out the Rockomax Type 6 sitting on its pad, the steel gantries behind it glowing like bars of solid fire. With a shiver of anticipation he followed Ademone inside and along to Mission Control.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022...all controllers, please give me a Go / No Go for terminal count.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan leaned against the balcony at the back of the Rockomax mission control room and listened to the flight control team reporting in. On the main screen, the Type 6 booster stood against the launch tower, plumes of orange-tinged vapour swirling around it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022SK1 TVC verified.

Below him, auxiliary monitors lit up around the main screen as the unruffled cadence of status reports and system calls continued.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022T-minus two minutes and counting.

Streaks of flame shot through the smoke and then blinding light erupted from the base of the rocket, the exhaust from its five main engines suffusing the steam and smoke with an unearthly glow before lofting it skyward on a torrent of golden fire. Lodan\u0027s eyes lit up in sheer delight, heart racing as the camera swung up to track the gleaming white booster arcing out over the sea atop an expanding plume of rocket fire.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Stage one propulsion is Go.

Seeing Lodan\u0027s look of concern, she opened her mouth to speak only to be interrupted by one of the flight controllers below.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Vehicle is through max-Q.

Beside him, Ademone crossed her fingers behind her back.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CShutdown\u2026and staged.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EA different controller spoke up. \u201CVehicle attitude is stable, Flight.

Ademone nodded in satisfaction. \u201CThat was the one part we couldn\u2019t fully model in the wind tunnel,\u201D she murmured. \u201CWe stage the lateral boosters high enough that it shouldn\u2019t have been a problem but it\u2019s still a big in-flight change in vehicle configuration. Core staging and fairing deployment coming up in the next minute.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe image on the main screen flicked to the launch site and then back to the orbital tracking plot. One of the controllers announced a successful main engine cutoff and then, almost immediately after, a successful separation and SK1 ignition. Lodan crossed both pairs of fingers and, catching Ademone\u2019s eye, rested them on the balcony rail.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CPayload fairing deployed.

Two of the robed figures, keeping vigil over the new Kerm, gripped their companion\u2019s shoulders in a silent gesture of good luck, before taking their own places under the leaf clusters.

Unseen, his limbs spasmed, throat clenching around a silent scream.

The same two kerbals grinning out from a photograph, lab coats replaced by ceremonial academic robes.

As if sensing his agitation, more shards swooped at them, then hung before them quivering. One of them brushed against his mind in an explosion of panic and disjointed, blotchy images that knocked him back on his heels. The shard shivered, questing towards him before flicking round and diving for Erlin\u2019s prone form. Gusemy fought the urge to vomit as the two shards already embedded in his friend\u2019s skull bulged out to meet it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGet out of here, Gus.\u003C/em\u003E Erlin\u2019s pain-wracked mental voice was barely discernable. \u003Cem\u003EYou too, Obrett.

Two, perfectly normal sets of EEG traces whisked quietly across the surrounding screens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett groaned and rolled over, head slipping out from under the leaf cluster.

Two figures holding him fast against against the maelstrom. Shards and fragments of a shattered mind burying themselves in his as one despairing figure faded away from him.

You really should learn to drive sometime.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sighed. \u201CI know. In my spare time. Which reminds me - are you and Fred still on for Tiles night next week?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI managed to talk Fred into it,\u201D Ferry replied. \u201CNone of the others were keen - Jerdin\u2019s still halfway convinced that he\u2019ll be impaled on a Kerm vine if you lose a box.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stared straight ahead. \u201CI\u2019d hoped the village archivist\u2026\u201D He shook his head. \u201CI suppose it\u2019s no surprise, given that he\u2019s been having to rewrite most of what we thought we knew about Kerm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s only so much change a kerbal can handle in one go,\u201D agreed Ferry. \u201CAnd it\u2019s been one thing after another ever since you planted\u2026\u201D He broke off at Jonton\u2019s woebegone expression. \u201CFor too long now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just keep telling myself that the changes haven\u2019t been all bad.\u201D Jonton opened the car door. \u201CSome days that\u2019s easier than others.

He found Enely and Meleny sitting at the kitchen table finishing their breakfast. Enely put his mug down as the kitchen door opened. \u201CThe Berelgan called for you, Jonton. The number\u2019s on the pad - I said you\u2019d call back as soon as you got in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton froze. \u201CDid you get a name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDirector Halsy Kerman.\u201D Enely looked worried. \u201CI hope Erlin is all right.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton was already dialing. He nodded at Enely and held up a pair of crossed fingers. \u201CGood morning. May I speak to Director Halsy please? Yes of course. It\u2019s Jonton Kermol returning his call.\u201D Jonton\u2019s heart thudded in his chest. \u201CThank you. Good morning, Director. Sorry I missed you earlier - how can I help you?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe top sheet of the notepad ripped free. \u201CBut he\u2019s awake now? And the Kerm? No\u2026no I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be yet. Oh preserve me yes.\u201D Jonton crumpled up the torn sheet of paper and tossed it aside. \u201CNo flights, I quite understand. The trains are still running though? Of course - I\u2019ll call ahead with arrival times as soon as I have them. Thank you, Director.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton put the phone down with an audible click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re going to the Berelgan,\u201D said Enely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CErlin went an-Kerm last night with the help of Gusemy and Obrett.\u201D He saw the immediate concern in both his friends\u2019 eyes. \u201CThey\u2019re all recovering well. Erlin is sleeping now but he was lucid - and entirely kerbal, so far as Halsy could tell - when he came to last night.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely blew out his cheeks. \u201CHe let the shards go?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe did. And Gusemy and Obrett both anchored him rather than\u2026\u201D Jonton swallowed. \u201CRather than trying to anchor the Kerm as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA small mercy is better than no mercy.\u201D Enely gave him a sad look. \u201CAt least we were able to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny crossed the room and hugged him. \u201CAre you going to tell Elton?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton let himself be held. \u201CI don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll have a choice,\u201D he said. \u201CHe\u2019ll probably be watching over Jonelle and I have to Commune with her anyway.\u201D He hugged Meleny back. \u201CI\u2019ll be taking Joenie with me of course.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Enely\u2019s surprise, Meleny didn\u2019t argue. \u201CI think that would be best. She needs a break from that Kerm.\u201D She sat down at the kitchen table. \u201CI\u2019ve given up trying to stop her Communing with Jonelle - and Adbas has too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton didn\u2019t miss the pointed undertone. \u201CI know,\u201D he said tiredly. He opened his mouth then thought better of it and shook his head. \u201CI don\u2019t know what we would have done without you - any of you. Where are the two of them by the way?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny inclined her head towards the sleep room door. \u201CJoenie is in there. Adbas is out rafting with his father and two of his other friends.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton winced. \u201CI\u2019ll talk to her on the train. You\u2019re right - it\u2019ll do her good to leave the hut for a few days.\u201D He walked over to the door. \u201CExcuse me a moment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe white light of Communion faded into a vista of two neighbouring mindscapes, the silverlace draped Kerm tree still standing between them. Jonton cast his mind outward, searching for Joenie, and found her drifting over a densely woven tangle of coloured threads, engrossed in conversation with Jonelle. Frustration, overlaid with determination billowed out from both the youngsters, one doing her best to understand, the other doing her best to explain. The tangle shifted fractionally and a sudden sunrise of comprehension lit up Jonelle\u2019s mindscape, followed by a blur of excited thoughts tumbling over each other almost too quickly for Jonton to follow.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA quiet pride brushed at the edge of his consciousness. \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;good morning, Jonton\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGood morning, Elton.

His mental voice turned serious. I\u003Cem\u003E\u2019m afraid I need to take Joenie away for a few days.

The silverlace erupted around her before settling on the higher branches, safely out of reach. Healing vines emerged from the surrounding soil, their tips clamped tightly shut as they crept towards Jonton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;forgive the intrusion, my daughter\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSparks flared as the gnarled vines wrapped themselves around his waist and tugged him over the line separating Elton\u2019s mindscape from Jonelle\u2019s. Jonton shuddered, clutching at them for reassurance. The black waters gradually drained away, leaving a stagnant grey mud behind on both sides of the line. Joenie clambered down from her branch and joined her father.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDad?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton put his arm around her wordlessly.

Joenie ran her hand over one of the ornately wrought pillars holding it up, tracing one of the many leaf cluster motifs worked into its surface. She tipped her head back, eyes following the pillar upwards until it splayed out into a set of supporting arches, each cunningly shaped to resemble a Kerm branch. With a flutter of wings, a bird tried to roost on one, squawking indignantly as it failed to find a purchase between the thin steel leaves decorating its surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAn ironic design really.

But you\u2019d know more about it than me, Keeper Jonton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie jumped, clutching her father\u2019s hand and staring at the uniformed kerbal standing beside them. Jonton blinked. \u201CI suppose it is,\u201D he said. He searched for something to say. \u201CI expect all that was long forgotten by the time they built this station.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother column of soldiers marched past, heading for a different platform. Joenie pressed herself against Jonton\u2019s leg and stared at them. The uniformed stranger smiled at her reassuringly. \u201CDon\u2019t worry - you\u2019ll have a compartment to yourselves.\u201D He turned to Jonton. \u201CYour seats have already been booked. One adult, one kerblet to Olbinad via Cabaralb and the Capital. We were asked to get you there as quickly as we could so you\u2019ll be on the troop transport to Cabaralb tonight arriving lunchtime tomorrow.\u201D He pressed an envelope into Jonton\u2019s hands, \u201CYou\u2019ll be on the first train out to the Capital the next morning. Accommodation vouchers - bed and breakfast, naturally - and onward tickets are all in the envelope.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton frowned. \u201CNot that I\u2019m ungrateful but this is all terribly organised.

Even if you weren\u2019t getting the official treatment, Keeper - well as far as the team here are concerned you\u2019d be a VIP anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOhhh-kay.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CWhy - that\u2019s very kind of you. Please pass on my thanks to everyone who organised everything at short notice.\u201D Jonton gestured at the soldiers lining up to board their trains. \u201CEspecially with all this happening.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn unreadable look crossed the manager\u2019s face. \u201CThink nothing of it, Keeper.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CIt\u2019s ridiculous but I still have to take you through security I\u2019m afraid.\u201D He saw the puzzled look on Joenie\u2019s face and turned to look at her. \u201CNothing to worry about, young lady. We just need to make sure that nobody has hidden a Kerm seed in your luggage. We don\u2019t want anyone planting them where they\u2019re not supposed to, do we?\u201D To his surprise, Joenie\u2019s faintly scornful look gave way to a vigorous shake of her head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell I wish all our passengers were as sure as you are.\u201D The station manager summoned up a professional smile. \u201CIf you\u2019d just like to follow me then.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease, there\u2019s really no need.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe insist, Keeper. Jerl and me\u2019ll be fine in the dormitory carriages with the soldiers. Wouldn\u2019t be right to put you and yours in with them though.\u201D The train driver pointed at the door to the front cab. \u201CBill and Rod\u2019ll be fine too. We\u2019ll keep the noise down at shift change as best we can.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton held up his hands with a smile. \u201CWell in that case, thank you very much. It\u2019s very kind of you. He and Joenie followed the driver along the carriage and into a small but homely cabin with curtains at the window and two already-made beds facing each other across a narrow folding table. After giving them a quick tour of the cabin amenities, the driver bowed to Jonton and left, sliding the door shut behind him. Whilst Jonton busied himself stowing their luggage in the storage racks over their beds, Joenie took her bag and disappeared into the adjacent moss room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked up from his book as Joenie emerged in her night clothes and felt a sudden pang at the sight of her wrinkled nose. \u003Cem\u003ESo like her mother.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CEverything alright?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s no moss in the moss room,\u201D said Joenie. \u201COnly paper. That\u2019s \u003Cem\u003Edisgusting.\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stifled a smile at her indignant look. \u201CI suppose it\u2019s hard to grow moss on a train,\u201D he said, \u201Cand dried moss would be worse than paper. Which side would you like?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie shrugged. \u201CDon\u2019t mind.\u201D The carriage juddered under their feet and she grabbed hold of the table to steady herself. \u201CThis one\u2019s fine.\u201D She curled up at one end of the bed and stared out of the window, watching the station and then the scalloped buildings of Barkton town centre sliding by. Jonton put his book to one side and joined her at the window as streetlights and brightly lit windows gave way to and the setting sun, smeared across the horizon in bands of cerise and orange, and the distant firefly glow of Kerm Groves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow about a \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E before bed?\u201D Jonton stood up and studied the miniature water heater set into the wall. He pressed a button and presently the rushing noise of water beginning to boil filled the little room. \u201CWhere do you suppose they\u2019ve hidden the cups?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie peered under the table and found a tiny cupboard stocked with two cups and a selection of hot drink materials. \u201CHere.\u201D She handed the cups and two sachets to her father. The heater clicked off amidst a throatier rumble of water boiling in a confined space and a green light came on. Jonton clipped one of the cups into its receptacle and pressed the second button, filling the cabin with the fragrance of surprisingly fresh \u003Cem\u003Edjeng.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell this isn\u2019t so bad. Fresh beds. hot \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E and when we wake up we\u2019ll be most of the way to Cabaralb.\u201D Jonton passed the full cup to Joenie before preparing his own drink. He sat down, watching his daughter rub her temples as she stared out at the darkening sky, a distant look in her eyes. Jonton nodded to himself and sipped his drink in companionable silence. When Joenie pushed her empty cup across the table and retreated under her bedcovers, he simply drew the curtains and dimmed the cabin lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPeaceful night, Joenie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe train drew up at Cabaralb station amidst a squeal of brakes and a clamour of voices from the next carriage as the soldiers disembarked. Jonton and Joenie followed at a distance, Joenie clutching her bag and sticking close to her father\u2019s side as rifle-carrying, green and brown clad figures marched past her in all directions. They stopped by a large marble slab on the main concourse and Jonton looked around to get his bearings before studying the relief map of the town centre carved into its top. \u201CIt\u2019s not far to the hotel, Joenie. We go out of the station, straight across the main road onto Ralador Avenue and then take the fourth street on the right.\u201D He pointed at one of the taller buildings on the map. \u201CThat\u2019s the hotel there, look.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe billboards outside the station were plastered over with curfew notices and the main road was crammed with drab green trucks parked end to end. Groups of soldiers stood by them, checking backpacks and unloading crates and heavier items of equipment. Jonton caught sight of the warning symbols painted on the sides of one stack of crates and pressed his lips together in a thin, hard line. \u201CCome on, Joenie - I don\u2019t think we should be here.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded and followed him across the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther back from the station, the traffic noise diminished sharply, replaced by the sounds of birdsong and the rustling of wind through the trees. A solitary tik-tik whirred past, the clicking of its chain all but swallowed up by the silence. The few kerbals that they did meet hurried past, not stopping to apologise or even look up as they bumped into Joenie\u2019s bag or brushed her aside. Jonton scowled and stepped around his daughter, keeping between her and any oncoming pedestrians.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fourth street on the right led straight down to the harbour, the angular grey shapes of warships at anchor clearly visible in the distance. Jonton stared at them wordlessly, oblivious to Joenie tugging on his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs that the hotel, Dad? Dad?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head and turned to see where Joenie was pointing. Three towers stood in a triangle, the hut-shaped buildings around their bases merging into a single structure. Circular windows dotted the towers, apparently at random, and a spiral of steel and glass walkways linked them together. A sign above the main entrance proclaimed the resulting edifice to be the Grove Hotel. Jonton blinked. \u201CI guess so, sweetheart. It\u2019s in the right place and its got the right name. But I think I preferred the version on the map,\u201D he muttered under his breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t look very much like a Grove,\u201D Joenie said critically, as they made their way across the road and in through a strange rotating door made of glass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jonton agreed. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t.\u201D He walked over the reception desk, pulling the envelope of vouchers out of his pack as he went. \u201CGood afternoon. Do you have a reservation for Jonton and Joenie Kermol?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe receptionist smiled at him, not bothering to check the leather-bound book on her desk. \u201CWe do, sir. Could I see your vouchers please?\u201D She examined the embossed cards that Jonton handed her. \u201CThank you. Your room key is here, sir - will you be needing a spare?\u201D At Jonton\u2019s answering nod, she unhooked a second key from under her desk and handed it to him. \u201CBreakfast is served from seven onwards, so you\u2019ll have plenty of time to catch your train in the morning. If you need a wake-up call, just call reception from your room and I\u2019ll arrange one for you. We have a cafe next door if you need anything for lunch and our restaurant opens at six for dinner.\u201D An apologetic look flicked across her face. \u201CWe do have a list of local alternatives but I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t say if any of them are still open.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI quite understand,\u201D Jonton replied. \u201CThank you for all your help.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy pleasure, sir.\u201D The receptionist smiled again. \u201CPlease make yourselves at home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe afternoon was not a success. After leaving their bags in their room and a rather meagre lunch, the two kermol set out to explore the town. At first, Joenie trotted along ahead of her father, staring up at the rooftops and more than once, Jonton had to pull her to one side as a lamppost loomed. Eventually though, even the birdsong and the shady, tree-lined boulevards weren\u0027t enough to break the oppressive silence or to make up for yet another, nearly-deserted street of stone buildings and stone underfoot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Jonton it seemed that every second street revealed a spectacular view of the old harbour, now marred by gun emplacements and the predatory silhouettes of warships against the horizon. Turning his back on them, he led Joenie up a narrower street, lined with shuttered windows, fronted by long wooden tables and benches set out under striped awnings. They emerged in a leaf-strewn park, lined with unkempt flowerbeds and dotted with weed-choked rock gardens. Joenie stared at it all in dismay. \u0022Don\u0027t they have Kerm to keep everything tidy? Jonelle would never let all these weeds grow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s face tightened at the sight of a large, flattened-down patch of raw earth, its edges ragged with overgrown grass, gone to seed.\u0022I don\u0027t think they do,\u0022 he said. \u0022I suppose all the gardeners must have left when the fighting started. Come on - lets go back to the hotel.\u0022 He breathed a silent sigh of relief as Joenie just nodded and turned away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We only have a limited menu at the moment I\u0027m afraid,\u0022 The waitress handed Jonton and Joenie a typewritten card each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s quite all right,\u0022 Jonton answered with a smile. \u0022After seeing the town this afternoon, I\u0027m surprised that you\u0027re open at all,\u0022 He studied his menu. \u0022Could we get a jug of water for the table please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Certainly, sir. Can I get you anything else to drink?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked across at Joenie. \u0022What would you like?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um - could I have a redfruit juice?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course you can. Would you like ice and mint with it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie blinked. \u0022 I... think so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe waitress smiled at her. \u0022Why don\u0027t you try it with mint and if you don\u0027t like it, I\u0027ll bring you a fresh one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um... okay. Thank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Make that two redfruit juices please,\u0022 said Jonton. \u0022With mint and ice for me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Certainly, sir. I\u0027ll be right back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie watched the waitress go before looking at her card with a frown. \u0022There\u0027s a lot of food here, Dad. I don\u0027t think I can eat all of this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked at her in surprise. \u0022It\u0027s not all for us. Haven\u0027t you been to a restaurant before?\u0022 \u00A0He cocked his head on one side. \u0022Actually, I\u0027m not sure you have. The last time you went with your Mum and me, you\u0027d have been too young to remember. Anyway - you just choose one dish and the people in the kitchen over there will cook it for you. And if you\u0027re still hungry afterwards you can have a dessert.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie brightened up. \u0022Could I have apple and sapwood?\u0022 She pointed at her menu. \u0022It says they\u0027ve got apple and sapwood.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe. If you eat all your first course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment the waitress reappeared, carrying two tall drinks on a tray. She set one down in front of Joenie, making the ice clink against the side of the glass. Joenie took a cautious sip and her eyes lit up. The waitress laughed. \u0022I guess I won\u0027t need to bring you a fresh one.\u0022 \u00A0She turned to Jonton. \u0022What can I get for you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The creva rakottka looks good.\u0022 Jonton looked slightly abashed. \u0022What is a rakottka exactly?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s kind of a layered bake of smoked creva, sliced ploom and sour prickleberry mash. According to chef, it\u0027s an old Wakiran dish, from when their sailors used to keep salted meat in barrels of pickled fruit to stop it going off,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well I\u0027m not sure about salt and pickles,\u0022 said Jonton, \u0022but the smoked version sounds delicious. A creva rakottka for me please. With mashed roots rather than natas.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Perfect.\u0022 The waitress turned to Joenie, who had already drank half of her redfruit juice. \u0022And what can I get for you, honey?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s special cavalla?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well now, cavalla is just a fancy name for eggs baked in a herby sauce but chef makes hers special by mixing in some grated mushroom and serving it over slices of grilled breadfruit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie looked at her solemnly. \u0022That sounds nice - can I have some of that please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe waitress smiled. \u0022Of course you can, honey. One special cavalla and one creva rakottka coming right up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time their food arrived, the two redfruit juices were long gone and Joenie dug straight into her baked eggs before Jonton had even had a chance to pick up his fork. The waitress put a bowl of flatbread strips \u0022for mopping up\u0022 in the middle of the table and left them to their meal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe returned to find Joenie wiping a piece of flatbread around an already spotlessly clean plate.\u0022Well now, I guess I can tell chef that you liked her cavalla. Can I get either of you a dessert?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie just nodded, her mouth still full of food. Jonton sighed. \u0022Could I get one apple and sapwood and just a coffee for me please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Certainly.\u0022 The waitress winked at Joenie. \u0022The apples are a bit wrinkly so we\u0027ll just have to give you more sapwood to make up for them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, a fed, rested, and noticeably more cheerful Joenie, followed her father back to Cabaralb rail station. After being searched for Kerm seeds, they were whisked onto another troop train bound for the Capital. After a while, the novelty of watching the countryside go by began to wear thin and she retrieved a sketchpad and pack of coloured pencils from her bag and spread them out over the table in front of her. For a while Jonton watched her drawing, before turning back to the view outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe train sped northeast, following the Kolan coastline for a while, then leaving it far behind. Jonton rested his chin in his hands and stared out the window at a countryside speckled with sparse copses of Kerm trees surrounded by lenticular patches of Blight, each marking the site of a new Grove planted to make use of every last scrap of land. \u00A0Other, more overt signs of war, were clear to see: a convoy of camouflage painted trucks waiting at a level crossing, a backhoe loader escorted by a squad of armoured cars, a ragged pall of smoke hanging over a distant town or Grove. Jonton glanced at Joenie, relieved to see her still engrossed in her drawing. Then he took a closer look at the patchwork of shapes she was colouring in, and sighed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are you drawing, Joenie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie looked up. \u0022It\u0027s a picture for Jonelle. I\u0027m trying to draw all the colours she shows me when I\u0027m talking to her.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded, suddenly very glad that they\u0027d been given a private compartment again. \u0022That\u0027s what I thought. I think Jonelle knows all about those though. Why don\u0027t you draw something else for her - maybe some flowers or that paper mallek you made with Enely, or Adbas\u0027s new raft.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flicker of guilt showed in Joenie\u0027s eyes. \u0022What new raft?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The one that Thombal made for him,\u0022 said Jonton gently. \u0022The one that he took his other friends to see the other morning when you were talking to Jonelle.\u0022 He raised his hand. \u0022I know that you like her - and I\u0027m glad that she likes you too - but you need to leave some time for your other friends as well. Believe it or not, you\u0027ll even make Jonelle happier that way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn all too familiar, mutinous expression appeared on Joenie\u0027s face. Jonton counted to ten under his breath. \u0022Listen to me please, Joenie - not as your father but as a Keeper.\u0022 He paused, collecting his thoughts. \u0022A Keeper\u0027s job is to look after their Kerm. Which is a funny sort of job when you think about because they\u0027re quite capable of looking after themselves.\u0022 Jonton rubbed the scar on his forehead. \u0022So what do you think it means - how do you look after a Kerm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u0027s brow furrowed. \u0022Jonelle says she gets lonely,\u0022 she said at last. \u0022Do other Kerm get lonely too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They do,\u0022 said Jonton. \u0022Not as much as Jonelle, I don\u0027t think, but they do. Even before Elton Awoke, it was always very easy to tell if he thought I\u0027d been away for too long. But even more than that, he was always very curious about things that were happening outside his Grove. Do you remember the pictures of Grandma I showed you when I was still part of Elton?\u0022 He waited for Joenie\u0027s answering nod. \u0022Where do you think those pictures came from? They couldn\u0027t have come from me - I was still in Grandma\u0027s pouch, remember.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You looked grumpy,\u0022 said Joenie. \u0022Did the pictures come from Grandpa?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Exactly!\u0022 Jonton gestured at her sketchpad. \u0022It sounds a bit silly but Kerm are trees - they don\u0027t have eyes. Their world is all about smells but kerbals aren\u0027t very good at understanding those.\u0022 He tapped his head. \u0022All those colours you see when you\u0027re talking to Jonelle aren\u0027t real - they\u0027re just your brain trying to make sense of all the smells that Jonelle is trying to share with you. Having eyes - being able to see things - is a very strange idea for a Kerm and it fascinates them. Even more than keeping their Kerm company, a Keeper\u0027s main job is to show them the world that they cannot see for themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled. \u0022I remember when the kerman first started flying rockets out at Barkton. They invited everyone - especially the Keepers - from the nearby Groves to go and see their factory and ask them any questions about the rockets and what they wanted to do with them, so Patbro and Ludvis and I all went. I came home late that night and stayed up for a while with your mother. You were only just big enough for her to take you out of her pouch and let me hold you...\u0022 Jonton shook his head. \u0022Anyway, that night was one of the longest nights I\u0027d ever spent Communing, Elton was so excited.

If that\u0027s too scary then I\u0027d understand.\u0022 He looked at his daughter with pride. \u0022You don\u0027t have to tell me now.

Not sure if I\u0027ve used \u003Cem\u003Ealba\u003C/em\u003E (water) before, so that could have been a bit of a curveball, and I\u0027ve also thrown in a contraction for good measure (linguistic drift and all that). The original name was \u003Cem\u003ECabarad-alba\u003C/em\u003E, which translates literally to \u0027we shelter water\u0027\u00A0(\u003Cem\u003Ecabarad\u003C/em\u003E =\u00A01st person plural of \u003Cem\u003Ecabara\u003C/em\u003E). That can either be taken very literally - Cabaralb is a coastal settlement (probably a fishing village originally)\u00A0and harbour,\u00A0so fresh water (rather than salt)\u00A0may have been at a relative premium.

You can see it in the sky sometimes but it\u2019s so far away that all you can see is a little red dot. The kerman have sent robot spaceships there already to take pictures and test the soil. As far as they can tell, it\u2019s just looks like a big desert; lots of dust and dirt but no proper soil. The air is too thin to breathe properly and it\u2019s freezing cold - so cold that there are places where you can find huge sheets of ice buried under the dirt.\u201D Jonton rubbed his forehead. \u201CSo it\u2019s a really, really hard place to grow plants but the scientists at the Berelgan are trying to work out how to do it so we can send people to Duna and not just robots.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201CJonelle could help them!

Joenie dragged herself out of her seat and followed her father onto the platform, scowling at the other passengers around her. She dropped her bag and clamped her hands over her ears at the sudden raucous announcement that the the train from the Capital had arrived on platform 2. Jonton grabbed the abandoned luggage and found a place by a pillar for them to stand and wait for the crowd to disperse. He looked down the platform and, much to his relief, saw a poncho-clad kerbal holding aloft a signboard with their names printed on it. He tapped Joenie on the shoulder and pointed. \u201CThis way, sweetheart.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJonton? Joenie?

I\u2019ve got a car waiting outside, so if you\u2019ll follow me, we\u2019ll get out of this madhouse.\u201D He led them along the platform and across the main concourse, nimbly avoiding the worst of the crowds. Looking around, Jonton noticed the absence of soldiers around the station although he cast a puzzled look at a group of workers by the exit, dressed in blue boiler suits, with what appeared to be a lopsided white cross emblazoned on the chest pocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhew, that\u2019s better.\u201D Fragrant blossom fluttered down from a single enormous sapwood tree planted on a grassy island in the middle of the car park and tall leatherbark trees shaded the parking bays from the the evening sun. \u201CWish they could plant more greenery inside the station too.\u201D Mallas stopped by a dusty off-roader. \u201CIt\u2019s a bit of a drive to the Berelgan I\u2019m afraid but there\u2019s a cooler in the back with ice water, bread and fruit in, if you\u2019re needing a bite of supper. Hop in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time they\u2019d left Olbinat behind, Jonton and Joenie were both onto their second bottle of ice water. Joenie held hers against her head, letting the beads of condensation trickle down her face. Jonton tore a hunk of bread off the loaf and chewed on it as he watched the fields roll by outside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey drove through a belt of woodland before emerging into fields again, these planted with a wider range of crops and laid out in neat grids.\u00A0Copses of trees and the occasional low roofed building broke the monotony, and hedgerows large and small festooned the landscape, marking out roads and separating one field from the next. \u00A0Mallas pointed out one of the larger copses. \u201CThat\u2019s our sapwood plot. One of the oldest parts of the Berelgan and very popular with the staff. Wild sapwood prefer marshes and wet soils - one of the first serious research programmes carried out here was to breed a variety that could thrive in drier conditions. Most of the sapwoods you\u2019ll see outside the tropics are descended from our trees.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u2019s eyelids began to droop as the conversation turned to root networks and soil types. She perked up briefly at a mention of worm trails but soon her chin dropped onto her chest and her eyes closed. By the time Mallas turned in through a turreted brick archway and stopped by the gatehouse, she was fast asleep. The lowered voices and muted clunks of carefully closed car doors didn\u2019t disturb her, nor did the lowing of a startled creva, as it galloped away from their headlights.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing she knew was Jonton\u2019s hand on her shoulder shaking her awake. \u201CWake up, Joenie, \u00A0we\u2019re here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a soft crunching of gravel outside followed by murmured voices. The back of the car whooshed open, the cool night air playing across her face. Joenie stirred, squinting at the lights outside, sensing the looming bulk of buildings around her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll get you folks to your rooms,\u201D Mallas said softly. \u201CLet you get back to sleep, Joenie, and I don\u2019t expect your dad will be long after you. Long way from Barkton by train - don\u2019t envy you that journey at all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSleeping in a proper bed and bathing in a proper moss room the next morning did much to restore Joenie\u0027s good mood and after a quiet word from her father to one of the catering staff produced a bowl of fresh mint leaves for her breakfast juice, she began to feel positively cheerful.\u00A0She looked up at the sudden knock at the door\u00A0before turning her attention back to her second bowl of cold natas and sliced fruit.\u00A0Jonton put his mug down and wiped his mouth. \u201CCome in.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis eyebrows shot up at the sight of a familiar figure in the doorway. \u201CObrett! It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett stepped into the small, private dining room. \u201CIt\u2019s good to see you too, Jonton. Thank you for coming so quickly.\u201D She sat down at the table and poured herself a small coffee. \u201CGood morning, Joenie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie swallowed a mouthful of cereal. \u201Cg\u2019morning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t be here earlier,\u201D said Jonton quietly. \u201CHow is Professor Erlin?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTired but doing well, all things considered,\u201D Obrett replied. She gave Jonton a look. \u201COr so he tells us. Neither Gusemy nor I have asked him to Commune with us yet, and so far he hasn\u2019t offered.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CIt\u2019\u2019s\u2026 not easy the first few times,\u201D he said. \u201CIf I\u2019d known as much, I wouldn\u2019t have been in such a hurry to invoke my Right with Donman. It took me a long time to pluck up the courage to Commune with Ger\u2026 with anyone else.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The corners of Obrett\u2019s eyes crinkled in sympathy. \u201CI can believe that.\u201D She saw Joenie staring out of the window, drumming her feet on the table leg. \u201CI think we\u2019re all finished here. Shall we go?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie hopped off her chair and made for the door. \u201CI thought we were never leaving.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJoenie,\u201D said Jonton warningly. Obrett just chuckled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuite right. Easier if I go first I think - this building is like a gronnek warren.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey followed her along one wood-panelled corridor after another, including a long portrait gallery that Jonton had no recollection of from the previous night. Finally, they descended an ornately carved staircase, into a marble-floored entrance hall. Jonton blinked at the unexpectedly grand decor as Joenie ran on ahead, shoes clattering on the polished stone. A set of double doors led out into the Berelgan grounds, down a flight of, no less ornately carved, stone steps. They found an open-mouthed Joenie at their foot, staring at the Berelgan grounds stretched out before her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton took a deep lungful of air, savouring the smell of dew on grass, the rich aromas of greenery from the surrounding fields and even the earthier scent of distant livestock. He joined Joenie at the foot of the steps and surveyed the fields and glasshouses, feeling himself relax for what seemed like the first time in weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere are all the Kerm, Dad? There\u2019s hardly any trees anywhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey don\u2019t have many Kerm here, Joenie.\u201D Jonton pointed at the belt of woodland on the horizon. \u201CI think they\u2019ll have some with the rest of the trees over there but apart from that, all the crops are looked after by scientists and farmers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause they\u2019re trying to work out how the Kerm manage to look after so many different plants. So the scientists try to copy the soil around the Kerm trees and then they compare how well different crops grow in their copied soil compared to the ones growing in proper Kerm soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie frowned as she thought it over. \u201CI suppose.\u201D She cocked her head on one side. \u201CWhere are they learning to grow plants on Duna?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside her, Obrett sucked in her breath. Joenie looked at her in confusion. \u201CDad told me about it on the train. They are aren\u2019t they? Learning to grow plants on Duna I mean.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey are.\u201D Obrett pointed at five domed glasshouses arranged in a cloverleaf pattern and linked by tubular walkways. Each of the domes was built from panels of frosted glass and three of them were tinted in different shades of butterscotch brown. Three sturdier looking domes stood apart from the main complex. \u201CIn those glasshouses over there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould I see them?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett smiled at the enthusiasm in her voice. \u201CI\u2019m sure that could be arranged. I have to take your dad to see Professor Erlin first though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded sagely. \u201CSo that dad can help him become part of his Kerm.\u201D She didn\u2019t see the wondering expression on Obrett\u2019s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s right. They\u2019ll probably have a lot to talk about\u201D Obrett raised her eyebrows at Jonton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI expect we will,\u201D Jonton agreed. \u201CEspecially if Professor Erlin wants to practice Communing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hope so,\u201D said Obrett. She turned to face Joenie. \u201CEither way, we should have plenty of time to visit the Project.\u201D She walked over to the off-roader, left where Mallas had parked it the night before. \u201CIt\u2019s quite a long way to Professor Erlin\u2019s Grove though, so I think we\u2019d be better off driving there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoenie stared wide-eyed around the dimly lit glasshouse. The frosted glass walls grudgingly admitted the bright morning sunlight outside, their yellowish tint diffusing it into a uniform ochre haze which turned her skin a lifeless shade of murky green. Half of the space inside was sectioned off with more glass walls, behind them, white-coated scientists worked at their benches; the brighter light from assorted display screens penetrating the gloom. The rest of the glasshouse was taken up with evenly sized plots of dirt and gravel, dotted with patches of scabrous grey-green growths, and separated by boardwalks and low wooden fences. Joenie sniffed at the air, surprised by the smells of flint and dust rather than damp and mould.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother pair of scientists looking, she thought, rather ridiculous in short laboratory coats and knee length rubber boots, were hunkered down by one of the plots, scraping samples into small glass jars. One of them looked up and waved at her. Startled she recognised Mallas\u2019s face from the night before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi Joenie! Welcome to Duna!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie blinked. \u201CIt\u2019s very dark,\u201D she said doubtfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell the real Duna is lot further away from Kerbol than Kerbin is, so it gets less daylight.\u201D Mallas screwed a lid onto one of his sample jars. \u201CSo if you\u2019re working out how to grow plants there, the first thing you need to do is get the light right.\u201D He smiled. \u201CYou get used to it pretty quickly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie leaned over the nearest plot and studied the vegetation growing on it. She reached out to touch the nearest patch of crusty grey then thought better of it and settled for bending over to study the growth up close. \u201CWhy are you growing lichen and not clover?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas\u2019 companion gave her a startled look. Mallas put his jars in his lab coat pocket and came over to join her. \u201CClover would be better,\u201D he agreed, \u201Cbut lichens are tougher and good at breaking down rocks into useful minerals.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo feed other plants?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly. We won\u2019t have Kerm on Duna - not to begin with anyway - so we\u2019re trying to work out other ways of turning sand and dirt into something like soil. And without a Kerm to control the whole system we need something as simple as we can get away with.\u201D His companion snorted and Mallas held up his hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, okay, simple is maybe the wrong word.\u201D He paused, looking at Joenie\u2019s expectant expression. \u201CDo you know about evolution?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie shook her head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell the whole thing is a bit complicated but plants and animals can change over time to fit in better with their environment and help them live longer. Which is a problem for all sorts of reasons but one of those reasons is that the Kerm have been helping us grow crops for so long now that all the insects and worms and other things that live in the soil have got used to having the Kerm around to tell them what to do\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike Jonelle\u2019s tapestry.\u201D Joenie interrupted. \u201CShe\u2019s teaching me how to read it but it\u2019s complicated too. Probably as complicated as evolution.\u201D She saw Mallas\u2019s confused expression. \u201CI think the tapestry is how she tells everything in the soil what to do, like you were saying.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas blinked. \u201CJonelle is a \u003Cem\u003EKerm\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh-huh. She\u2019s my best friend. Well - after Adbas anyway,\u201D Joenie added dutifully. \u201CDad thinks I need to spend more time with Adbas and the other kerblets in the village, so I can show Jonelle what they\u2019re like.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas rubbed his forehead. \u201CThat sounds\u2026 right,\u201D he said slowly. \u201CBut aren\u2019t you a little\u2026 well young for all of that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDad says I could be the youngest Keeper he\u2019s ever met,\u201D said Joenie, \u201Cmaybe the youngest that Elton has ever met too.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other scientist made a startled noise. \u201CYou know Elton?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh-huh. He\u2019s really old. I used to be a bit scared of him but he\u2019s okay now that he\u2019s got Jonelle. I think maybe he was a bit lonely before she woke up too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJoenie is Jonton\u2019s daughter,\u201D said Obrett, throwing the two scientists a warning look. \u201CI\u2019m showing her around whilst he\u2019s talking to Erlin.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019ll have plenty of time to see everything then,\u201D Mallas said with a grin. \u201COnce the Prof get\u2019s talking he\u2019s hard to stop.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what Elton says about Dad,\u201D said Joenie. \u201CSometimes he complains that Dad can\u2019t say anything without turning it into a long story but I think he\u2019s just teasing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCuriosity burned behind Mallas\u2019s eyes, but he contented himself with a rueful shake of his head. \u201CA Kerm with a sense of humour? That\u2019ll take some getting used to. Maybe when the Prof\u2019s\u2026 never mind.\u201D He smiled at Joenie, \u201CHow would you like to see the lab?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded eagerly. Mallas disappeared inside and, much to her delight, returned with a white coat which he held out for her. \u201CYou\u2019ll need a proper lab coat first. Let me help you with the sleeves - there you go. Hmmm - bit big still. He fished a handful of test tube clips out of his pocket and knelt down beside her. \u201CLet\u2019s see if we can pin this up a bit. It won\u2019t look very elegant but it\u2019ll stop you tripping over.\u201D Finally, he removed a blue elasticated cap from his pocket. \u201CBetter put one of these on too. That\u2019s it - tuck your hair up first.\u201D He studied her for a moment. \u201CGood enough. Right then Dr Joenie - if you\u2019d like to follow me?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter an interminable wait in the locker room for the adults to change their shoes and find a lab coat for Obrett, Joenie trotted into the laboratory behind Mallas, oblivious to the smiles from the other scientists. Her nose wrinkled at the unfamiliar smells as she stared in fascination at the row of microscopes on one bench, the strange instruments on another and the racks of test tubes and complicated tubing all laid out in their own glass doored cabinet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can use my bench - up you get.\u201D Mallas waited for Joenie to clamber onto his stool before busying himself at the fume cupboard. He returned with a slide, coverslip fixed in place and set it under his stereo microscope. \u201CI\u2019ve got some soil worms here. They\u2019re only tiny but they\u2019re really important. Take a look.\u201D He guided her hands to the focus controls. \u201CUse this one first until you can see something, then this one to make it clearer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie peered into the eyepieces, forehead furrowed in concentration as she turned the focus knob. \u201CThere they are! Ewww, that one\u2019s ugly. And that one\u2019s only got a tail. Why is it still wriggling if it\u2019s only got a tail?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas looked puzzled for a moment, before his face cleared. \u201CYou can move the slide, Joenie. Rest your hand here by these little wheels - this one moves it up and down and this one moves it from side to side.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COhhh. I found it! I found its head! That one\u2019s ugly too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs it the same as the first one?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie spun the stage controls back and forth. \u201CI think so\u2026 no - that one\u2019s got a pointy head instead of a round one.\u201D She looked up, blinking water out of her eyes. \u201CWhat colour are they?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas looked puzzled. \u201CI\u2019m not sure what you mean. I added a drop of stain to make them easier to see but apart from that I don\u2019t think they really have a colour.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealisation dawned on Obrett\u2019s face. \u201CNot that sort of colour. You\u2019re talking about Jonelle\u2019s tapestry again aren\u2019t you, Joenie?\u201D The lab came to a gradual standstill, scientists abandoning their experiments to listen as Obrett described her long-ago Communion with Jonton and being shown the worm pheromone trails in Joenie\u2019s sandpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can\u2019t see the worms,\u201D said Joenie, looking up from the microscope again. \u201CJust the yellow beads they leave behind for other worms to chase. Dad told me they were playing,\u201D she confided to Mallas. \u201Cbut I think they wanted to make baby worms.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a hastily smothered chuckle from another bench. Mallas did his best to keep a straight face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019ll know more about it than you, Mallas,\u201D somebody called out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWith two sapient Kerm to teach her? She probably does,\u201D came the good humoured reply. \u201CIf you ask her nicely, she might be able persuade them both to teach you dunderheads too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett saw Joenie\u2019s eyes light up. \u201CI think,\u201D she said firmly, \u201Cthat we\u2019ll need to speak to Jonton and Professor Erlin first.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas caught her glancing at her watch. \u201CThat would seem wise. Tell you what - I\u2019ll go find Ambassador Gusemy and take him over to the Grove now, if he\u2019s not there already. One of us can bring Jonton back here once he\u2019s finished with the Prof, and we can have a quiet word with him then.\u201D He smiled at the engrossed kerblet bent over his microscope again. \u201CI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have a problem finding something to do whilst\u00A0you\u00A0wait.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, Director.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd a good afternoon to you also, Bill.\u201D Lodan shook the proffered hand. \u201CI presume you\u2019ve received the news from Foxham?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout the test flight? Yes.\u201D Bill smiled faintly. \u201CIt was the right decision, even if it wasn\u2019t quite where we thought our booster would be going. Being able to start construction with the Type Six will save a considerable amount of time.\u201D He held the door open for Lodan. \u201CAfter you, Director. I believe you know the way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you.\u201D Lodan waited for Bill to fall in alongside him. \u201CAdemone informs me that the new fairing will be able to accommodate the bridge modules and the redesigned forward shelter module.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded. \u201CAnd the spokes. We\u2019ve been running extensive tests with the mockup sections and the mission planning team have reviewed Nelton\u2019s latest EVA sequencing report. Geneney thinks it looks plausible enough, although, like Nelton, he\u2019s not committing anything to the checklist until we\u2019ve tested the basic sequence in the Pool.\u201D Bill checked his watch. \u201CI think we\u2019ll start with the PAL if you don\u2019t mind, Director. Roncott\u2019s team should be ready for us in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-2 by half past three.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan crossed the road to the Assembly and Fitting building and looked up at a dark rectangle of fresh paint, standing out against the lighter warehouse walls. \u201CI see you finally dispensed with your sign.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. Shervin - vice Chair at Stratus Inc - made some pointed comments about it and it turned out that several of our other old contractors were of a similar mind, although they were a little more diplomatic out of deference to Jeb. We haven\u2019t decided on a new name yet - Geneney and Bob were in favour of Kerman Aerospace Engineering, although between ourselves, I think it\u2019s a little bland.\u201D Bill looked at Lodan. \u201CAnd not especially tactful given how much support we\u2019re getting from the Groves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Lodan thoughtfully. \u201CI don\u2019t think President Obrick would be particularly impressed either. I certainly prefer an aerospace engineering company to a \u00A0junkyard and spacecraft parts company but for the moment, I believe that something more inclusive would be in order.\u201D He stopped at the side entrance to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-2 and waited as Bill retrieved a key from round his neck. They stepped through into a narrow, concrete block corridor, Bill locking the door behind them. He led the KSA director past a row of offices and through a heavy fire door into the main assembly area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me a moment, Director.\u201D Lodan watched Bill speak briefly to a group of coverall clad engineers. One of them hurried off and returned with a spare laboratory coat and dust cap, handing them both to him with an apologetic look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry, sir but\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan waved off the apology. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201D Donning his coat and cap, he walked around the large cylindrical spacecraft on its dolly, noting the undersized engine opposite a CORDS-3 docking adaptor mounted on a flared collar, the ring of thruster blocks mounted on one end, and the tangle of exposed plumbing where another ring had yet to be fitted. An open equipment bay occupied most of its upper surface, with a stowed photovoltaic array mounted along each flank. Squatting, Lodan found a third array mounted to its belly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe call it the PAL,\u201D Bill said, squatting beside him. \u201CFor Power, Assembly and Logistics. I\u2019ll spare you Jeb\u2019s joke about it being every kerbonaut\u2019s best friend.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan raised an eyebrow and stood up, being careful not to touch the bundle of cables plugged into the underside of the spacecraft. \u201CI presume you intend to launch it separately? It looks rather too large to fit into a fairing with the forward shelter module.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe do,\u201D Bill confirmed. \u201CThe flight plan isn\u2019t so very different to a Pioneer flight - and actually, you could think of the PAL as a modified Pioneer service module. Rockomax will launch the station module, we\u2019ll launch the PAL, and we\u2019ll dock them together on-orbit. Both spacecraft are controlled remotely - we\u2019re working on a fully autonomous docking system but we\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd once they\u2019re docked, the PAL will ferry its module over to the space station?\u201D A thought struck Lodan. \u201CHow do you maintain control of the station module before docking?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt stays attached to the the booster,\u201D said Bill. \u201CThe Type Six upper stage is already equipped with the necessary attitude control thrusters. Again, we\u2019ll be borrowing from the Pioneer flight profile with the PAL executing the payload extraction manoeuvre rather than the CSM. Once the station module is clear, the booster stage can be safely de-orbited.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded. \u201CAnd the bridge module is equipped with its own thrusters if I recall correctly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D Bill walked over to an equipment cart and checked the cables connecting to the PAL systems. \u201CIf you would care to join me at the console, Director, or anywhere behind the yellow line, we can proceed with the demonstration.\u201D He waited for Lodan to move back to a safe distance then touched a button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bundle of thick tubes, wrapped in what appeared to be white cloth and linked by solid, disc-like hubs emerged from the top of the PAL and unfolded into a mechanical arm, several metres in length. Bill touched a sequence of controls and the arm went through a series of movements, its different sections flexing, twisting and bending about each other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAssembly,\u201D said Bill. He flipped open a protective cage on the control panel and pressed the button underneath. One of the PAL\u2019s photovoltaic array covers sprang open, the hinged panel beneath slowly extending to its full length. \u201CAnd power. A lot of our work has been focused on defining the range of movements available to the manipulator arm and writing failsafes into its control codes to provide a safety zone around the photovoltaics.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan walked round to the back of the spacecraft and sighted along his upright hand, tipping it back and forth in thought. \u201CI can certainly see where your manipulator would be helpful in docking the spoke modules,\u201D he said. \u201CBut unless it\u2019s a lot more flexible than it seems, I can\u2019t see how it would be able to handle more than three of them without repositioning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded. \u201CYou\u2019re quite right, Director. Allowing for that safety zone I mentioned, it can\u2019t handle more than three spokes. We did think about putting the docking adaptor on a rotary joint but never progressed that idea beyond the early design stages. Far simpler and more reliable to simply undock the PAL, rotate it to the desired attitude and re-dock.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat makes sense.\u201D Lodan frowned. \u201CYou\u2019ve put this all together in a remarkably short period of time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs I mentioned, Director, the PAL is largely based on the Pioneer service module - you\u2019ll recall that it was already fitted with an equipment bay. The SPS was somewhat overpowered for our requirements so we used a lander ascent engine instead. Goliath Products built the arm for us - it was originally commissioned for Munar resource extraction in the post-Pioneer 4 expansion but was put on hold as the Kerm Crisis developed. Goliath were one of the first of our contractors that Jeb approached once Stratus were back on board.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. I look forward to seeing it working on-orbit.\u201D Lodan glanced at his watch. \u201CI believe you mentioned that your team in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-2 would be ready for us by 3:30?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey ought to be,\u201D Bill took Lodan\u2019s lab coat and cap before removing his own protective clothing and handing them over to one of the engineers. \u201CThank you, Edsen.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the way over to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-2, Bill described the planned PAL operations in more detail, to an attentive Lodan. \u201CWe\u2019ll be monitoring its systems throughout station assembly, especially the thrusters and propellant tanks. Once - if - Starseed moves into the main production phase, we\u2019re hoping to have a number of PALs permanently on-orbit as space tugs for shuttling colony ship modules to their assembly sites. We expect they\u2019ll also be used as auxiliary power modules for the ships during assembly, fitting and provisioning. Wernher is designing the LV-Ns as dual mode systems, capable of generating electrical power and thrust as required, but we\u2019d prefer not to be running the reactors with that amount of traffic around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan glanced at Bill\u2019s serious expression. \u201CNo,\u201D he agreed, deadpan. \u201CThat would seem to be an unnecessary complication.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy thoughts exactly, Director. After you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA group of engineers, dressed in the seemingly obligatory coveralls, stood in a loose group around a curious looking device that reminded Lodan of nothing so much as a broad cylindrical stack of folded towels packed between two aluminium discs, one of which was tethered to the floor. A rather larger group of more casually dressed onlookers stood back at a safe distance. One of the engineers stepped forward and glanced at Bill, who gave him a reassuring nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood, um, afternoon, Director. My name is Roncott Kerman, team leader for the pneumatics group.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan racked his brains for something to say. \u201CA pleasure, Mr Roncott. Would that be Roncott as in Roncott actuator?\u201D He was answered by a delighted look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s me, sir! Although the actuator was an, um, team effort - these things always are.\u201D Roncott took a deep breath. \u201CAnyway, you\u2019re here for the demonstration, yes? Some background first then - it may help to um\u2026 explain why we\u2019ve taken this approach.\u201D \u00A0He stepped back and clasped his hands behind his back. \u201CWe\u2019d been thinking about the spoke modules for the colony ships - and for your space station, sir - for quite some time. Building them was never going to be a particular problem, although their length did present some, um, interesting challenges compared to other habitation modules that we\u2019ve launched in the past.\u201D \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott shook his head. \u201CNo, the real problem was always going to be transportation. Each spoke module is mostly empty space you see, which makes them, um, inefficient to launch. We could easily fit a single module into a standard Rockomax fairing but even their, uh, enlarged fairing isn\u2019t big enough to hold two. And at two modules per spoke and eight spokes for a wheel, launching enough modules for, um, your space station would take a considerable number of flights, let alone the three wheels worth that the colony ship design requires. So we started thinking about collapsible modules but couldn\u2019t think of a way of making them, um, robust enough.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUntil you had an extraordinary idea,\u201D said Bill. Roncott flushed dark green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI should have thought of it much sooner.\u201D He gave Lodan a sheepish look. \u201CI remembered the Pioneer Four launch, Director. One of the entertainments provided for all the kerblets that came to watch, was an, umm, bouncy castle and the more I thought about, the more that castle seemed to have the, um, properties we needed. It packed down flat, it expanded to quite a considerable size and, best of all, that expansion was created by inflating a relatively small number of tubes, rather than the whole structure.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan eyed the folded cylinder as Roncott continued. \u201CObviously launching a bouncy castle into space wasn\u2019t going to work, haha, so I decided to speak to um, Halnie here. She\u2019s in charge of the, Portable Systems Division at Stratus, where our EVA suits were developed. I thought she might be able to suggest some better construction materials. Um\u2026 over to you, Halnie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, Director. As Roncott said, I\u2019m in charge of the Stratus Portable Systems Division and - as you might expect - we have considerable experience in designing, manufacturing and manufacturing with, space-grade fabrics.\u201D Halnie gestured at the spoke module behind her. \u201CNaturally, we\u2019ve prepared a full technical specification for the KSA, together with details of our test protocols and outcomes of those tests. To cut a long story short, Director, we were able to devise suitable laminate materials which combine the requisite air-tightness, tensile strength and impact resilience.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe fully appreciate that it\u2019s not an easy idea to get to grips with.\u201D Halnie offered Lodan a faint smile, \u201Ceven Jeb dismissed it out of hand the first time he heard about it, but we believe that our fabrics offer some significant advantages over conventional spacecraft construction materials. The module is inflated using an onboard compressed air tank - another area in which Stratus have considerable experience.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the engineers wheeled an equipment cart over, which held a spherical pressure vessel and its regulator valve, secured within a steel framework. Halnie unreeled a length of hose, attaching one end to the spoke module and the other to the valve. \u201CWe use a relatively low inflation pressure to prevent any damage to the structure during the unpacking process.\u201D She checked that both connections were secure and opened the valve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a sustained hissing of compressed air, the module began to expand. Lodan watched in fascination as the uppermost aluminium disc began to rise, lifted on a slowly inflating ring. The ring rose, pulling a dozen protruding tubes out from the stack of folded material, which gradually extended to reveal the fabric panels beneath. Cross-tubing appeared, zig-zagging between the ring and a second ring, emerging from the folds of fabric. The resulting lattice structure reminded him of the pressure hull for Ademone\u2019s partially completed bridge module.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe structure wobbled. Lodan looked sidelong at Halnie, who looked back at him unperturbed. The last of the rings pulled taut, followed by the last sections of cross-tubing then, with a final quiver from the now fully-extended spoke, the hissing stopped. Halnie unplugged the hose and rolled the equipment cart to one side before turning to Lodan with a smile. \u201CI\u2019m afraid this is just a proof of concept model, Director - it\u2019s not full-size and the endplates are just simple bulkheads, so there\u2019s no way inside. The next prototype, and the production versions of course, will have an airlock at each end to allow access. Nevertheless\u2026\u201D Halnie gestured at the fabric tube towering over them all. \u201CI trust you see the potential?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed. I look forward to reading your report.\u201D Lodan stepped forward and tapped the module with one outstretched finger, before gingerly leaning against it. \u201CInteresting - it\u2019s sturdier than I\u2019d expect.\u201D He raised an eyebrow. \u201CAlthough I have to confess to some skepticism about building substantial portions of a space station - let alone an interplanetary spacecraft - out of them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh goodness, no,\u201D exclaimed Roncott. \u201CWe\u2019d use a truss system to provide tensile strength and structural integrity. Imagine a very big cage with inflatable modules secured to the bars of that cage. It\u2019ll make the assembly a little more complicated but it\u2019ll be worth it!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the engineers nodded. \u201CSplitting out the load-bearing structure from the pressurised volume means we can specialise them both - make a lighter and stronger structure than if we tried to combine both functions into a single set of components.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd we can still get away with a significant reduction in launches,\u201D finished Halnie. \u201CAccording to the figures Rockomax gave us, we should be able to fit three inflatable sections into their upgraded fairing - or the equivalent number of truss pieces to go with them. So we\u2019ll need at least a third fewer flights than if we were launching conventional modules - and that assumes that the conventional modules are robust enough not to need any trusses of their own.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan raised an eyebrow. \u201CIf your inflatables work as advertised.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie nodded. \u201CNaturally. It\u2019s not Stratus\u2019s decision of course, but, if I could make a suggestion, the space station would be an ideal platform for properly testing them. From speaking to Jeb and Geneney about the colony ship design, I think the that you could use them for the cargo sections too. Even if the KSA would prefer not to use inflatables for the crew compartments, I think the savings would still be worthwhile.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he left \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-2 with Bill, Lodan saw a group of workers gathered around an extensive roped off area behind the Kerbonaut Training Facility. An excavator was parked inside the ropes, stabiliser legs deployed and bucket hidden behind a dip. A yellow-hatted kerbal stood by it\u2019s front wheel, talking to the nearest worker and making notes on a clipboard. There was a glint of light as something exchanged hands and the worker walked away, pinning something to his chest pocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill caught the direction of his gaze. \u201CThe Pool,\u201D he said. \u201CFor EVA training. Or it will be when it\u2019s finished. The idea is to put mockup space station modules in there and have the crews practice assembly operations underwater. They\u2019ll be in full EVA suits, weighted for neutral buoyancy. The Endurance crews all seemed to think it would provide a reasonable simulation of zero-G conditions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIngenious,\u201D said Lodan. \u201CDo you intend to weight their equipment for neutral buoyancy as well?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne of the Endurance crews did suggest that to Nelton but was told, and I quote, that \u201Cpicking your tools off the bottom might teach you not to drop them again. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re not short of backup crews.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan walked towards the ropes, picking his way over excavator tracks and around various items of debris. Before the KSA director could climb over the rope, Bill glanced at his shoes. \u201CSafety boots only inside the line I\u2019m afraid, Director.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan stopped. \u201COf course.\u201D He stared at the construction site taking in the gaping pit surrounded by a second set of safety ropes. Further back from the edge, a pair of temporary cabins rested on concrete blocks, beside racks of shovels and other tools. He frowned. \u201CShovels?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill shrugged. \u201CWe\u2019ve got more volunteers than machinery and it\u2019s a lot easier to get a team of kermol with spades to the bottom of the pit than an excavator.\u201D He smiled. \u201CAnd I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019re any slower either. According to Seelan, one good kerbal was rather forceful about that, telling her that this old kermol might not know one end of a rocketship from the other but, by the Kerm, she knew which end of a spade to hold.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe wasn\u2019t wrong. Tougher than a Kerm root that one and she keeps the younger lads on their toes too. None of them want to be out-done by someone old enough to be their grandmother. Good afternoon, Director - I won\u2019t shake hands if you don\u2019t mind.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan eyed the other\u2019s dust caked gloves and weatherbeaten overalls. \u201CNot at all. Although you appear to have the advantage of me?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeelan Kerman. Went up on Prospector One, structural engineer before that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeelan was our lead engineer for the FLT series of propellant tanks,\u201D Bill added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep. Might even get to build a couple more of them sometime soon.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hope so,\u201D said Lodan. He caught sight of the enamel badge pinned to Seelan\u2019s chest. \u201CThat\u2019s an optimistic badge, kerbonaut Seelan.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease, Director - just Seelan.\u201D Seelan unpinned her badge and handed it over. \u201CI got my flight - don\u2019t imagine I\u2019ll be training for another one any time soon.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSooner rather than later, if I have any say in the matter,\u201D said Lodan. \u201CAlthough, for now, I fear you may be correct.\u201D He studied the badge, noting the stylised image of Kerbin rising over Duna, seen through a spacecraft window. He made to hand it back to Seelan, who shook her head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeep it if you like, Director.\u201D She pullled a bag out of her overall pocket. \u201CGot plenty more of them - \u00A0everyone who takes their first shift in the pit gets one when they\u2019re done, and we stick their name in the Book too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLucan\u2019s idea,\u201D said Bill, seeing Lodan\u2019s politely enquiring expression. \u201CWe\u2019re compiling a list of names of everyone who\u2019s volunteered their time for Project Starseed. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re KSA personnel, a White Cross volunteer, or a kermol farmer donating some of their crop to the space program, they go on the list. We\u2019re going to have that list printed and properly bound, Director - on very thin paper if need be.
