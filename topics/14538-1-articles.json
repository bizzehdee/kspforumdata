When it takes me a year to get things carved out just to deal with the usual influx of immigrants streaming into my fort before winter, the thought of planning some gigantic project and managing all the associated logistics didn\\\u0027t strike me as something I particularly wanted to sink my time into.

I\\\u0027ve seen beautiful works of art and writing made by players (I\\\u0027ve made one or two myself, not nearly so beautiful though), based on their fortresses\\\u0027 histories and various statistics pulled up from the Legends window, but really \u00E2\u20AC\u201D who are the dwarves? Or the elves or the humans or the demons or anyone in the generated settings, for that matter? The world I meet in Adventure Mode is, to put it bluntly, a buggy wasteland of cultureless cities full of samey houses and faceless nobodies with nothing interesting to say to anyone. Legends mode is fun to peek around in for a giggle or a gasp or two or to get a list of kobold names to play around with in my own settings, but after that there\\\u0027s really nothing to see unless you have a very active imagination... which I do, but I feel it would be better spent creating worlds of my own design than fleshing out the rather ephemeral randomly generated world of a half-finished video game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-27T13:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a hard time playing DF, but this is all I know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELava does \u003Cem\u003Eeverything.\u003C/em\u003E Cannons, orbital destruction devices, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: What I mean by orbital destruction devices is that a guy put a lava cannon so high up, that it went in all directions and also made the outside nearly inaccessible for days on end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thermobaric","CreatedById":31322,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-27T20:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eohgod you guys made me wanna play it again. i played it a very long time ago, 3 years ago or maybe even more! ahh good old dwarf fortress. does someone remember the gold old utter newbie tutorial? its still online. i learned it quite fast from it, and after the basics i used the df wiki to learn all the hard (but the BEST!) parts of the game, like automatic pumps and very creative traps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eohman, \u003Cstrong\u003Ei always trapped goblins in cage traps and brought them to the arena to fight with dogs\u003C/strong\u003E. i still remember the good times when 3 dogs fighted a naked goblin and blood was everywhere. after some fights the whole arena was red from it and the cleaners puked everywhere hahaha.
