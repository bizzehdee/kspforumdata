Theoretically all we need for interstellar travel is\n\n-A fusion reactor that actually works\n\n-A Cannae drive that proves itself in space\n\n-Humans that can live for 30,000 years\n\n-And that only eat a few calories per year. \n\n-A place that is ready for them to go to. \n\nThese things should be easily accomplished. \n\nBut there are more practical applications. The previous designs meant that the reactors, if ever made would necessarily need to be placed in large population centers due to the very high cost of building, you wouldn\u0027t want to waste that electricity in 100s of miles of transmission, and these would be too costly to spread around to suburban centers or in medium or smaller cities.\n\nThe new design would allow reactors to be more dispersed distribution (remember that there is no effective waste from fusion power, the products of fusion are simply not dangerous enough to worry about). This means you can place the reactors closer to demand. \n\nI suspect that this reactor claiming it could be functional in 10 years, probably something working in 50 years, lol. by past precedence."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:05:02Z","Content":"That is what I always say... if they take a lot of time with a construction without trying to identify the time release for new technology to include it in the design, then it will be a waste of money because technology will keep going and find a better way to solve a problem.\n\nI am talking about ITER."},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:06:22Z","Content":"tl;dr: They bought wide enough rubber bands to contain the jello that is the Plasma ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:08:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That is what I always say... if they take a lot of time with a construction without trying to identify the time release for new technology to include it in the design, then it will be a waste of money because technology will keep going and find a better way to solve a problem.\n\u003E I am talking about ITER.\n\nIf everybody kept on waiting for some new technology to be developed by somebody else, everybody would be still waiting for the wheel."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:20:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That is what I always say... if they take a lot of time with a construction without trying to identify the time release for new technology to include it in the design, then it will be a waste of money because technology will keep going and find a better way to solve a problem.\n\u003E I am talking about ITER.\n\nIf they don\u0027t keep trying with the tech they have, better technology won\u0027t be developed."},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:25:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If they don\u0027t keep trying with the tech they have, better technology won\u0027t be developed.\n\nNo, that\u0027s not how it works.

It\u0027s not even the mainstream technology. It\u0027s a generation or two old one that has proven to be reliable and of long lifespan.\n\nConsider plasma TVs. They were all the rage when introduced, but soon their inherent faults arose, such as the burn-in effect. Imagine it\u0027s not a TV we\u0027re talking about, but something critical. If you use latest technology there simply hasn\u0027t been enough time for such dime dependent issues to show themselves, so you critical part fails.
