With funds dwindling we attempt to mount a rescue mission to save our dear scientist and bring him back home safely. More importantly his brain, who needs his body when Kerbal medicine can do a brain transplate, right?! Anyway here is a video showing off the rescue and talking about plans for a next video. (for anyone that doesn\u0027t watch the video but still would like to give some advice... I do need help figuring out how to transport a materials container full of refined material from KEO to Kerbin to get money back out of it. Also launching said container, empty into KEO. I am not very good at designing space planes capable of hauling any kind of cargo so I\u0027m not too sure on how to do this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/cWKkuce3UCE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/cWKkuce3UCE\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVideo is still uploading but I\u0027m headed to bed, should be up in about a half hour more.
