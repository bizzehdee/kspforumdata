First of all, an equatorial orbit around Kerbin has an inclination of 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. The problem is that you can\u0027t really adjust your inclination from within Kerbin\u0027s SoI, because inclination changes rotate your orbit around an axis that passes through both your ship and the body you\u0027re orbiting (Kerbol for interplanetary missions), and you have to maneuver at a specific place to align your orbit with Eve\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a tutorial ready for this, but you should burn at the intersection of the two orbital planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LegitBro","CreatedById":52801,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T10:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh...
