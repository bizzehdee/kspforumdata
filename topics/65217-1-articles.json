The wear and strain on the landing gear at a full load of 80,000 lbs of fuel was much more than at the normal 45-60,000 lbs. And with a full tank the minimum controllable speed with an engine out was around 300 knots. So at speeds less than that if an engine failed they would have to cut the throttle on the remaining engine to avoid uncontrollable yaw. And at that point it would not have enough thrust to stay in the air. Meaning crash and burn.

Yes, it burned 21,000 pounds per hour in cruise, while the 737-800 (comparable in maximum takeoff weight and fuel capacity) burns about 6000 pph in cruise. However, this works out to about 0.094 miles per pound (or 0.63 miles per gallon) for the SR-71, and 0.085 miles per pound (0.57 miles per gallon) for the 737-800, which has literally forty years of Boeing and CFM spending a fortune to try and improve fuel efficiency that the Blackbird didn\u0027t have. So in terms of miles per gallon, the Blackbird was about 11% more fuel-efficient than the 737-800.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing by specific fuel consumption (pounds of fuel burned per hour per pound of thrust) and correcting for speed as per Wikipedia\u0027s recommendations, I get a result for the Blackbird of 0.309 pounds per hour per pound thrust, and 0.220 pounds per hour per pound thrust for the 737; correcting for speed by the method they recommend (dividing by speed), I get 1.572*10^-4 as the SFC for the Blackbird, and 4.305*10^-4 for the 737. (The units are pounds of fuel per (pounds thrust times miles), which is a hideous thing to write out.) So in terms of specific fuel consumption, the Blackbird was about 2.75 times as efficient as the 737!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is simple--the Blackbird\u0027s engine was actually designed to do some very unique tricks at full speed. The J-58 turbojet was actually a unique engine; it operated as a straight turbojet at subsonic speeds, then it started to add more and more bypass air as it got faster, akin to a modern high-bypass turbofan, except that instead of using the engine fan section to move the bypass air, it simply used ram air pressure and inlet shaping to compress it instead. Above about Mach 2, most of the thrust was coming from the afterburner, fed by bypass air, and the engine control system actually started reducing power on the gas turbine section of the engine, since it was no longer needed to compress the air. By Mach 2.5, the engine had transitioned over to being essentially a straight ramjet, with the turbine merely running at low idle power to keep the alternators and hydraulic pumps running, and to avoid trying to windmill-start it during deceleration/descent. In fact, by that speed, the inlet alone was generating a significant amount of thrust; the Air Force has stated that at cruise, 60% of the Blackbird\u0027s thrust came from the intake, 35% from the afterburner, and only 5% from the turbine itself. With the gas turbine just idling and not spending much of its energy output compressing air to make thrust, this translates to a significant reduction in fuel flow and, even with the afterburner running at all times, the net is surprisingly low fuel flow for the thrust generated...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T22:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure that is a fair comparison, you need to compare payload, too.

reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn\u0027t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \u0022November Charlie 175, I\u0027m showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \u0022 Houston Center voice.\u0022 I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country\u0027s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn\u0027t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nJust moments after the Cessna\u0027s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \u0022I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\u0022 Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \u0022Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\u0022. Before Center could reply, I\u0027m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol\u0027 Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He\u0027s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \u0022Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we\u0027ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \u0022Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\u0022 There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \u0022Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \u0022Ah, Center, much thanks, we\u0027re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \u0022Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day\u0027s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nFor just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-25T04:40:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReminds me of the Cessna(?) that reported a flight level of 3000.
