Obviously, if you\u0027re clicking away at stuff, it\u0027d make sense to just keep the conversation going, but no sudden cuts or kerbals talking over kerbals, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Astronaut center... Maybe chatter only? No beeps at all, etc, kinda like the squawk boxes NASA used to have for families and such in the early days. No two way thing, just hearing how the mission is going, and maybe at a reduced volume (3/4 or half what the normal setting is)... you know, cause you can\u0027t interfere with the music! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is a way to determine it in game... If you can detect if a death has occurred... No chatter at all in the Astronaut complex... NASA would shut off the squawk boxes in an emergency, and I would think the KSC would too... Time it out for at least 1-3 in game days, maybe even longer, like a week... Is the background music and the background noises separate assets... In such a scenario, I could imagine the sounds of Kerbals getting on with their daily activities, but maybe with the music turned off. Kinda morbid, but you know... If we\u0027re going for that feel of realism... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you made this, and he installed it, Danny2462 would have a perpetually silent Astronaut Center... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T08:09:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkMoon","CreatedById":148057,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!
