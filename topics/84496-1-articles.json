Now that would be easy to do there and then, just dive into the CFG. file of a part and mess around with it. But where is the challenge in that? So, I came up with the Tele-Fuel tank! A small lightweight fuel tank that would have a very high capacity, but would take up a lot of electricity. Why? It would teleport fuel from the KSC up to your vessel. The CFG file creation is the easy part. And this will be my first mod. So the alpha models might not look great, but I\u0027ll learn and I\u0027ll hopfully have a mod that looks good and works well. I\u0027ll also look into making a Remote-Tech 2 version, where you need a connection with KSC/vessel full of fuel and some cool anntena. So right now it\u0027s a idea. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emight\u003C/span\u003E be made. If you have any ideas before I dive into development hell, please share them with me. I\u0027ll do my best to implement them (y\u0027know, Coding noob right here). Thanks for reading!

I just thought it would be cool for lightweight craft that have plenty of fuel but they need connection with KSC and/or need plenty of power to do so. It\u0027s also a introduction to modding for me. Start off with the basics (CFG. File creation, modeling, etc) and then move on to the hard stuff when I\u0027m ready. I\u0027ll work on the addon in my free time. I don\u0027t mean for it to replace your addons, justin. I don\u0027t want it to be a big thing. It\u0027s my first few steps into modding and it\u0027s not the only thing I can think of.
