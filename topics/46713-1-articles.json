Is there a setting so you can change orientation or does mechjeb not function properly if you use a rotated or inverted part to attach onto?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T23:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe orientation of the part you are controlling the craft from determines which way MJ2 thinks is up. If MJ2 is trying to fly horizontally then that means the controlling part is currently oriented horizontally.

The navball would sometimes be at a 20\u0027 angle when sitting on the launch pad like it\u0027s affected by the COM.
