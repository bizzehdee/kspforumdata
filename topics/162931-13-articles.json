TL;DR for competition description: you fly an unguided \u003Cstrong\u003Eliquid methane \u003C/strong\u003Efueled rocket with 1 kilo payload to as close to 45,000 feet as possible, and we have until May 2018 to put something together that flies. We\u0027ve done a lot of the theoretical calculations so far, and we have designed the engine already, but guess why we can\u0027t do testing and manufacturing yet? Money. We estimated that this rocket - including GSE, ground station electronics, custom fabricated test stands, test equipment - will cost us upwards of $60k. The engine itself would cost $15k to 3D print out of Inconel 716. It would be 3D printed because drilling extremely long and thin regenerative cooling channels into the thin, curved walls of a small methane fueled engine is probably impossible. While most of our efforts are focused on continuing to design, the president and I are organizing business majors to go to companies in person to attempt to get funding (or even spare rocket parts). We had limited success with Cryoquip, Inc. when we talked to them in person over the summer for example - they were extremely excited to design high pressure composite cryogenic tanks for us - but they got some LNG deal in South Korea recently and they dropped our project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI skimmed through this thread and saw something about using turbopumps. If you can shell out tons of money for the manufacturing of it, then sure. We considered turbopumps over our helium pressure-fed system for a week, but after realizing the engineering required for the complexity of designing and manufacturing one, we elected to use a helium pressure fed system pressurized to 15Mpa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe intend to apply what we learn building (and hopefully launching) this rocket to design an orbital cubesat launcher over the span of a few years because we need research, experience, and money/sponsors with operating something like this, and who knows, another university with extremely deep pockets (\u003Cem\u003Ecough \u003C/em\u003EPurdue, USC, etc) could beat us to it by then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1U cubesats - 10x10x10 cm.

If we do it right, we could probably do it for under 100k, maybe 50k. The main cost driver in rocketry is the cost of hiring designers, the testing equipment, and most of all, the paperwork. Everything in a rocket (conventionally)\u00A0has to be checked 500 times and must be traceable back to the ore in the ground. We can get around this by having a small non-payed design team, and using off-the-shelf materials and tools. A good example would be cubesats, everyone says scratch building one takes thousands of dollars using standard space rated materials, but if you just take a metal box and stick a RPi with some foam insulation and a battery inside, your pretty much done!
