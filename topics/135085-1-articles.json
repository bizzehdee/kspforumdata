A dozen m/s perhaps to rendezvous with the ISS, a lot less than that to leave it again. The biggest single maneuver is the deorbit burn. All of these are executed by the Draco RCS system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s important here to remember that the original Dragon capsule is a purpose-built system. It has no application beyond going to the ISS. And in the process of going to the ISS, it is placed exactly where it needs to be by its carrier rocket. As a result of this, the need for orbital maneuvering is almost nonexistent. A spacecraft like Apollo or the STS orbiters, by comparison, had to be able to execute a much wider, less well defined field of tasks. As such, they were outfitted accordingly (though the shuttle kinda cut it close, only carrying about 300 m/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew Dragon, too, is built to go to the ISS. Now, it\u0027s designed to be a little more general purpose than that, to the extent where people have thought about sending it to Mars (see: Red Dragon concept). The increased versatility comes courtesy of the SuperDraco launch abort system, which the capsule keeps carrying with it once successfully reaching orbit (as opposed to ejecting it on the way there like classical launch abort towers are). While not required for the ISS profile, if you really wanted to have a Dragon that could maneuver in space and didn\u0027t mind a slightly rough landing under parachutes (or don\u0027t plan to return the capsule at all), the SuperDracos can provide about 400 m/s extra dV in addition to whatever is contained in the normal Draco RCS system. And that\u0027s merely the stock configuration. Due to the easily stored propellants, you could theoretically build a special purpose Dragon V2 that sacrifices some (or all) of its interior volume to hold extra fuel tanks. You can get a lot of dV that way - enough to capture into Mars orbit, pick your landing site with precision, and land there fully propulsively while carrying a small Earth return vehicle as cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T12:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T20:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222478471\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135085\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459252902\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew Dragon, too, is built to go to the ISS.
