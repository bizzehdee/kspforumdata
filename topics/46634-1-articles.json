That means if you drew the orbit on a flat piece of paper, the center of the object being orbited would not be above or below the paper, but actually on it. In the real world this is because the gravity force keeping an object in orbit comes from (well, is centered on) the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of a 2-D situation: Object - Circle, Orbit - line.
