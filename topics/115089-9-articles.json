And the mission with the plane was long, repetitive and boring. I should have mentioned that Bob reseted the experiments multiple times and included a pic of him doing so next to one of the KSC buildings or atop the mountains.\n\nThis challenge was way more fun than I thought it would be. And When I set out for Duna I had no idea on how difficult it would be, I really missed my precision nodes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T08:08:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nefrums**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T17:42:34Z","Content":"Welcome to the cave Nefrums.\n\nHere is a big UGH, for being put under the light and revealing your caveman talents.\n\nI never doubted the truthiness of your mission, but was interested in the verdict from our chief caveman.\n\nGreat job on landing on Duna.
