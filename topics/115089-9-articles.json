Getting into Jool orbit with only 18t on the launch pad and having room for full science was a pain. It was even trickier to make sure I didn\u0027t run out of power with such low solar light available that far out. It helps that Jool has a huge gravity well. The probe\u0027s orbit is roughly 100,000km x 350km, so I could probably get some encounters with the inner moons there too if I try.
