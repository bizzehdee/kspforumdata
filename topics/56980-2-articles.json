However, it would also put into the debates of whether or not we should include Deadly Re-entry and Real sizes as well for realism. If we do that, then the game becomes many times more difficult. It would also discourage new players from starting due to the extremely steep learning curve of making bigger and bigger vehicles, adding on to the already difficult game as it is.

You can\u0027t really have one without the other, and since both are in the game, ignoring the aerodynamics is basically like only exercising one arm, so I would not say it is a relatively small part of the complete picture. It affects the rockets, SSTO Spaceplanes, and standard aircraft. You shouldn\u0027t need a mod to have a relatively accurate model in a game that chose to include aerodynamics.
