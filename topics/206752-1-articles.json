Even at lower numbers, finding out which asteroid is going to enter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of a planet can be a right bother because it will only show the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E-change icon of the asteroid that is currently selected. The only method I have found is to click each asteroid, one by one, and using Eyeball Mk-1 to spy for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change icon on the map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d really like is a mod that just gives me a simple list of tracked asteroids that are going to hit a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change in the upcoming months or so (or marks them some way in the tracking station). Over the years I\u0027ve done many increasingly imaginative google searches to look for a mod that could do that, without luck. Does anyone know of a mod that can do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailing that, how do you kerbonauts handle this yourself? Do you just untrack any asteroid that doesn\u0027t hit a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change in its upcoming orbit to keep the numbers down? Have you trained your muscle memory and eyes to hotkey through hundreds of asteroids in 3 minutes flat? Is there some config trick to show \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E changes of asteroids in the tracking station when they are not actively selected? Any pro tips are welcome. To be clear, I am specifically NOT looking to change asteroid generation, cheat orbits and encounters, or anything like that. Just a better way to manage large numbers of stock asteroids on Kerbol orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iaTmj7xr_o.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://images2.imgbox.com/3c/2a/iaTmj7xr_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BekfastDerp13","CreatedById":214450,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-04T17:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really use asteroids, but I will try my best to give some advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPick a few asteroids for each planet that you visit.
