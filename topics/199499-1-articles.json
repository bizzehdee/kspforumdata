But they also have a really unique property, Isotopes are something you\u0027ve probably heard of. Well Isotopes have the same Proton Number, but different amounts of Neutrons. And many of these are wildly radioactive, so Neutrons can \u0022Activate\u0022 materials we normally don\u0027t think of as radioactive into Isotopes that belch hard gamma for potentially hours to years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best bet is to shield with something that contains a large amount of hydrogen, as it\u0027s just a proton and electron and the chance of any single H atom capturing a Neutron is low. As the neutron scatters, it will stop at some point. The two isotopes of hydrogen are Deuterium (Stable, and not radioactive) and Tritium (Half Life 12.7 yrs~, mild beta emitter). But as the formation of the latter requires 2 capture events, it\u0027s extremely unlikely unless you\u0027re directly in front of a strong Neutron source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater, Paraffin Wax and Hydrocarbons can all be used for Neutron Shielding (Carbon also is rather difficult to Activate thankfully).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s another subset, and it\u0027s an important one to consider in this context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBremsstrahlung (Braking) radiation is produced when you take high speed radiation, and smack it into your brick wall of protons and electrons. It\u0027s due to the conservation of energy, that momentum MUST be conserved and for things like photons and electrons there\u0027s only one really viable way to do it. Emitting massive amounts of hard gamma as they decelerate. So if you\u0027re depending entirely on high Z materials like lead, tungsten or iridium to protect you, depending on how absolutely bathed in radiation you are it might ironically backfire on you due to this. So you\u0027re going to want some way to slow the incoming radiation down ideally, so that you can keep these events to a minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my answer would be that 100% is basically impossible for ALL radiation at ALL times, but you can approach it if you know the conditions beforehand and have multiple choices for your suit. Modular systems would work wonders here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s also the other wild card....does it/will it matter? Humans are some of the most fragile organisms on the planet when it comes to how radiation affects us, and we already can see genetic technologies on the horizon today. In the near/far future, I\u0027d imagine genetic modifications to enhance our own ability to handle radiation would be mandatory for anyone serving on a ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-11T23:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223906993\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199499\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610356638\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197414\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Incarnation of Chaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Incarnation of Chaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiation comes in different forms, which makes this hard (And a lengthy answer, sorry dude)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings like Cosmic Rays and the Van Allen belts are made mostly of Charged Particles (Cosmic Rays can have some High Z materials in them though, so not entirely).

These have no charge, and are almost as massive as protons. So they can ignore most things in their way, and do significant damage while barrelling their way through. But they also have a really unique property, Isotopes are something you\u0027ve probably heard of. Well Isotopes have the same Proton Number, but different amounts of Neutrons. And many of these are wildly radioactive, so Neutrons can \u0022Activate\u0022 materials we normally don\u0027t think of as radioactive into Isotopes that belch hard gamma for potentially hours to years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best bet is to shield with something that contains a large amount of hydrogen, as it\u0027s just a proton and electron and the chance of any single H atom capturing a Neutron is low. As the neutron scatters, it will stop at some point. The two isotopes of hydrogen are Deuterium (Stable, and not radioactive) and Tritium (Half Life 12.7 yrs~, mild beta emitter). But as the formation of the latter requires 2 capture events, it\u0027s extremely unlikely unless you\u0027re directly in front of a strong Neutron source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater, Paraffin Wax and Hydrocarbons can all be used for Neutron Shielding (Carbon also is rather difficult to Activate thankfully).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s another subset, and it\u0027s an important one to consider in this context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBremsstrahlung (Braking) radiation is produced when you take high speed radiation, and smack it into your brick wall of protons and electrons. It\u0027s due to the conservation of energy, that momentum MUST be conserved and for things like photons and electrons there\u0027s only one really viable way to do it. Emitting massive amounts of hard gamma as they decelerate. So if you\u0027re depending entirely on high Z materials like lead, tungsten or iridium to protect you, depending on how absolutely bathed in radiation you are it might ironically backfire on you due to this. So you\u0027re going to want some way to slow the incoming radiation down ideally, so that you can keep these events to a minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my answer would be that 100% is basically impossible for ALL radiation at ALL times, but you can approach it if you know the conditions beforehand and have multiple choices for your suit. Modular systems would work wonders here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s also the other wild card....does it/will it matter? Humans are some of the most fragile organisms on the planet when it comes to how radiation affects us, and we already can see genetic technologies on the horizon today. In the near/far future, I\u0027d imagine genetic modifications to enhance our own ability to handle radiation would be mandatory for anyone serving on a ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks...I was looking for IRL plot enablers.
