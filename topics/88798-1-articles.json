As a result, they made no effort to limit TWR in the later stages of ascent--the closest they came was the Atlas\u0027s \u0022stage-and-a-half\u0022 staging where the two outboard booster engines (which made about 3/4 of the total launch thrust) were jettisoned two minutes into flight, but that was less for TWR control and more for a more efficient use of propellants. All three of them saw G-loadings exceeding 7g during the ascent; Titan II-Gemini actually did this twice, once near the end of the first stage burn, and once near the end of the second stage burn. I don\u0027t know much about the Saturn IB used for Apollo 7 and the Skylab and ASTP flights, at least in ascent G loads, but when it came to the Saturn V, as Mike Collins put it, \u0022Saturn is a gentleman,\u0022 with maximum G loadings of about 4.5g during ascent, thanks to the planned early shutdown of the center engine in the first and second stages--which was done solely for TWR control without the added complication of a throttle. Shuttle maintained a 3g maximum through throttles on the SSMEs and careful shaping of the SRB propellant castings to control thrust levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for entry G loadings, KSP re-entries are currently ballistic, as the aerodynamic model doesn\u0027t simulate spacecraft body lift, only wing lift. In reality, the only manned spacecraft designed for pure ballistic re-entries were the Mercury and Vostok spacecraft. While I don\u0027t have any access to the Vostok\u0027s entry G-loading data, I do know that Mercury\u0027s G-loading soared on entry, particularly on the two suborbital flights (which, by nature, had a steeper entry angle than the orbital flights). If you listen to the cockpit tapes of Al Shepard\u0027s Mercury flight, you\u0027ll hear him reading out G-loadings during the entry. \u0022Three... five... seven... *grunt* nine... ELEVEN... I\u0027m OK... OK... OK...\u0022 After the parachute had deployed, he reported to the ground a peak G-loading of about 11.5g during the entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll other capsules, as mentioned above, had/have their center of mass *not* along the vehicle centerline, so that their aerodynamically neutrally stable attitude is tilted slightly, to generate some lift and reduce the entry G-loading. For return from low Earth orbit on a normal lifting entry trajectory, there\u0027s a handy rule of thumb--the peak entry G-loading is equal to the reciprocal of the spacecraft\u0027s lift-to-drag ratio. For example, the Gemini capsule had a lift-to-drag ratio of 1:4, which meant that the peak entry G-loading in it was about 4g. (I\u0027m not sure this held true for the Space Shuttle, but it flew an extremely shallow entry profile designed to reduce peak thermal loading at the cost of a much longer thermal soak, to suit the reusable thermal protection system employed; the ablative TPS used on capsule-type spacecraft can handle a much higher peak thermal load, but is more limited in the length of the acceptable exposure.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, attempting to use a \u0022normal\u0022 shallow entry profile on Apollo wasn\u0027t an option, except on 7, 9, and the Skylab and ASTP missions. Coming back from the Moon, there was no braking burn into Earth orbit before entry; they flew a direct entry trajectory that saw them plummet straight into the atmosphere to land. Using that shallow of a profile would have resulted in the spacecraft \u0022skipping\u0022 off the atmosphere and off into a high Earth orbit that would not return before the command module\u0027s consumables were used up and the crew was dead (some \u0022skip\u0022 profiles would even see them end up in an orbit that would never re-enter the atmosphere!). As a result, a much steeper profile had to be used, and the L:D rule of thumb didn\u0027t work any more. A normal Apollo lunar re-entry would hit about 7.5g, and if the trajectory was a bit off but still within survivable limits, that could soar as high as 14g. (As a result, all Apollo Command Module Pilots had to be trained to fly the entire entry--solo, in case the Lunar Module crashed or couldn\u0027t launch from the surface--at 14g in a centrifuge, which, according to Collins, was \u0022no fun at all.\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As a side note, there *was* a contingency plan for Apollo, in case the designated landing zone was forecast to be in a typhoon at landing, to deliberately use a trajectory that was shallow enough to create a small atmospheric \u0022skip\u0022 before the terminal entry and shift the landing point a few hundred miles into hopefully better weather. Since this was never tested unmanned, the crews were understandably a bit apprehensive about actually using it...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
