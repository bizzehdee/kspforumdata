I suggest starting small and learning everything step-by-step, copying my configs and modifying them more and more, because it seems like you\u0027re trying to do everything at the same time. There\u0027s a learning curve to planet making. I also recommend starting from a clean install and a fresh install of OPM, because after a lot of tampering you might just\u0027ve messed with too much stuff, which is causing your issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll explain how KopernicusTech (aka KittopiaTech \u002B Kopernicus) works. Kopernicus is used to create a new planet or moon based on a stock body (Jool, Minmus, Tylo, etc.). The new body inherits everything from the template, so if you do nothing but set up a new body it\u0027ll have the same orbit, texture, etc. as the template. Kopernicus is great for orbital characteristics, biomes, science multipliers and the textures for the planet as it looks in the map view. KittopiaTech is useful for custom terrain and can be used for rings, atmosphere, etc. Just like the orbital characteristics and such, the terrain is also copied from the template. Unless you change a value for a certain PQSMod, it doesn\u0027t need to be in the KittopiaSpace/SaveLoad config. So that\u0027s why I recommend against copying all the PQSMods that Kittopia generates when you save using Kittopia\u0027s in-game menu. It just confuses you the dev and in some cases the game if things like MapSO aren\u0027t changed.
