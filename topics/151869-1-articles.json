Unfortunately many of these crafts used a fuel tank from the SSTU mod pack that has since been removed from the mod (MFT-B for those familiar with the mod). It wasn\u0027t a major issue as the mod has an identical part with a slightly different name (MFT-A) so i was able to use notepad\u002B\u002B to replace all instances of the old fuel tank with the new fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt worked perfectly in that I can load and edit the craft file without any issues, however KSP still displays the \u0027contains locked or invalid parts\u0027 message in the load menu. It\u0027s not a game breaker of an issue, more of a minor inconvenience, but I\u0027d like to remove the message.
