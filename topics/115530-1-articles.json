(Although if I may nitpick, I feel like there\u0027s not enough \u0022clearance\u0022 on the bottom border between the edge and the start of the emblem).\n\nAssuming \u0022GD\u0022 is just shorthand for GameData, and that you didn\u0027t actually put it in a subfolder of \u0022GD\u0022, then off-hand I\u0027m not sure what could be going on. All I can think of it to try Vanamonde\u0027s suggestion of copy-pasting an existing file, and then cracking open MS Paint and replacing the image with this one."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T07:08:19Z","Content":"Well I\u0027ll be a RatSquirrelFish\u0027s uncle.
