Right click on your persistent.sfs file, go to properties and hopefully you\u0027ll have a past versions tab. From that tab you should be able to select a version of the file from a day or two ago. Might not be exactly where you left off, but will be better that loosing it all.\n\nFor the future, I have a tool that will protect you against any save or craft file becoming corrupt (as well as those times when you forget to quicksave). It\u0027s a bit out of date, but still works fine in the current KSP. [**Jebretary**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72212-Jebretary-Automatic-Version-Control-%28backups%29-for-craft-and-saves-v0-4-0) is a version control manager that runs as a stand-alone program so it can manage version control for multiple KSP installs. It tracks every single quicksave and autosave so you can revert to any point in your saves history. It also tracks how each craft is each time you edit and then launch so you can rewind any crafts development too. \n\nIt uses the git version control system (so you do need to install that too), but it handles all the interaction with git so you don\u0027t have to worry about it. By using git it is much more space efficient than just taking copies of save and craft files. It runs as a web server on your KSP machine and you interface with it using your browser (and you can also access it on any web device that\u0027s connected to your local network)."},{"CreatedByName":"Pablonaut","CreatedById":144617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:09:53Z","Content":"Thanks for that, I\u0027m running KSP on OS X, I have resorted to stitching a previous save with things that look fine from the corrupted persistent.sfs file"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:30:14Z","Content":"Typically speaking, a corrupt save file is most commonly simply truncated -- that is, the write operation is interrupted, and you\u0027re left with a file is that simply incomplete, missing all the data after a certain point.

It doesn\u0027t need to be as complex as your suggestion, as a move/rename is a safe \u0022atomic\u0022 (100% success, or 100% fail, no halfway points leaving inconsistency) operation on all 3 operating systems supported by KSP. Just rename the current persistent.sfs to persistent.sfs.bak, the OS semantics are that any failure there will leave the file untouched as its previous name (unless your filesystem is broken, in which case nothing an application does can guarantee or improve safety).\n\nI\u0027m strongly against any unnecessary complexity related to persistent.sfs, as it is automatically saved frequently during game play. For example, copying it to a backup is orders of magnitude slower than renaming it; copying would double to triple the most time intensive part of saving. Additionally, if something with game or system state has created a situation which would be likely to corrupt the save, copying would make it very likely that you would also have a corrupted backup, where renaming does not touch the actual data blocks and is very unlikely to corrupt the file unless the filesystem is broken.\n\nIf you\u0027re not frequently hitting F5 to quick save after significant operations in the game, you should be, and you really need to get into the habit of doing that, even if you don\u0027t believe in undoing player mistakes via quick load. Then, at the end of each session, or other points where you\u0027ve made significant progress that you don\u0027t want to lose, you should be using the named save feature.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T02:54:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman Fry","CreatedById":185723,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-23T10:57:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E o answer your question, each savegame is complete in itself.
