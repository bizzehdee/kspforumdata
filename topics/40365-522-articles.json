Anyone please feel free to correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma thrusters are good, they use electricity, so any kind of power, and don\u0027t need to be connected directly to a thermal or power source. They work really well when you have a good microwave beamed power infrastructure, the vessel doesn\u0027t have to produce the power, it can receive it with a lightweight dish. The more power, the more thrust, up to the max power they can handle which is listed in the part specs in the VAB. You can use them as landers if you use one of the higher thrust(lower ISP) fuels, though mechjeb doesn\u0027t control them very well. I have a 60 ton or so lander, that is able to take off from Duna using Argon pretty easily with only about 6 gigs of beamed power available. You will see much much higher trust output if you have a lot more power than that, like 25 to 75 gigs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal rocket nozzles are really great too - using microwave power. I use a big fat one right in the middle of most of my launches(I have problems equalizing the power input when using more than 1 at the same time), that same engine powers the trans stage to take the vessel to different planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-07T07:40:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2015 07:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jarardo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"glaser","CreatedById":134020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T16:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei just download 0.13 interstellar on my 0.25 KSP,but when mousing over interstellar parts in the editor (VAB/SPH), they zoom to infinite size before disappearing, anyone know why i have this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T19:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022glaser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022glaser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei just download 0.13 interstellar on my 0.25 KSP,but when mousing over interstellar parts in the editor (VAB/SPH), they zoom to infinite size before disappearing, anyone know why i have this issue?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe zooming-parts bug is a good indication that the Interstellar plugin isn\u0027t loading.
