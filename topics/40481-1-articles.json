Like many others I have created a craft with the same concept as the space shuttle but I am having trouble keeping the craft stable while the shuttle is being carried by the rocket. I know it is to do with fuel balance but I am unsure how to solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle pulls the rocket on its side but that is offset by using the shuttles own engine thrust to counter. I guess this is inefficient to have the shuttle and rocket pushing against each other so if someone has a better solution please suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the craft is powered by the two aforementioned LV liquid fuel boosters attached to two FLT800 fuel tanks on the shuttle and a single mainsail attached to two jumbo fuel tanks stacked horizontally on the rocket itself. The fuel tanks on the shuttle need to be full once it seperates from the rocket so the jumbo tanks currently feeds fuel into the FLTs. This could also be done by pumping fuel from the jumbos directly into the liquid fuel engines, though I don\u0027t suppose it matters much. My problem is that the top jumbo empties first thus creating an imbalance. So what I would like to know is how can I get the two jumbo tanks to empty simultaneously? I am also aware that once they do both run empty that there could well be an imbalance caused by the full liquid fuel tanks on the shuttle, so how should I proceed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.majhost.com/gallery/GoldenElite0/stuff/shuttle.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shuttle.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T14:53:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Isamin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have built dozens of spacecraft and all of them have been symmetric.
