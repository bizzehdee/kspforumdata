I have successfully depleted very large Kethane deposits before, but it took several trips to do so. If you want it to be doable within a sane amount of time, you\u0027ll have to construct a truly Whackjobian solution. Why you want to bring raw Kethane to Kerbin orbit is beyond me, of course; that\u0027s its least efficient form. Kethane is meaningfully more useful if you convert it to fuel on the surface first and then bring it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bnethor","CreatedById":104664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T02:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, it\u0027s funny you should mention this because I had built a fairly big refueling station earlier and I needed to give it some meaning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane was the first mod I installed and I literally started fiddling around with it a day or two ago. I prefer building large ships and when I got a contract to test the KR-2L or some engine landed at Dres I figured I\u0027d make a craft for that and Kethane operations at the same time.
