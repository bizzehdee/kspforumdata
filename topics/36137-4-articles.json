Game. Ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphics are a bit dated, and were even when it came out in 2000, but the gameplay, and the sounds, and the voice acting, and the artsy cutscenes before each mission were just...... wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to describe in just a few words what was good about the gameplay. Basically they knew they wanted and FPS about sneaking, which rewards stealth over button mashing, and makes the careful player do better than the twitchy player, and (this is very important) made your ability to sneak into a PLAYER skill not a character skill. Most modern games say that if your character has the right level of skill in sneaking the character sneaks successfully no matter how stupid the player is being at walking right through well lit areas (i.e. Skyrim style sneaking). But in the Thief series they did it *right*. They provided you with the tools for how to move the character around, how to carefully control the speed you move at with keyboard control tapping, which in turn controls how much noise you make. Then they made sure the lighting actually mattered - where the darkness of the place you stand affects how close guards have to be to see you. Then they made sure that having weapons drawn made you easier to see so you had to make the judgement call yourself whether it\u0027s better to be unarmed and sneaky or armed and visible. Then they made sure that you do very poorly if you try to fight more than one guard at a time - such that preventing someone from noticing you and raising the alarm and thus attracting other guards became more important than actually fighting him. And all of this depended on the player\u0027s skill so YOU felt like the thief and YOU felt the tension as you tried to gauge how fast to tiptoe across the well lit room to the safety of the other side before the guard comes back, balancing the need to be quick against the need to be quiet. One twitchy move too fast and suddenly you hear in the distance \u0022Hey what was that?; and think \u0022Yikes\u0022 and try to blend in as best you can before he comes looking for you... such a GREAT immersive game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wice","CreatedById":57743,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T21:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGrim Fandango\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Grim_Fandango_artwork.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Grim_Fandango_artwork.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EZelda: A Link to the past\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.n1ntendo.nl/file/misc/Random/link-to-the-past1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022link-to-the-past1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeavy Gear\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/Heavygear_activision.jpg/220px-Heavygear_activision.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022220px-Heavygear_activision.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"llamatoes","CreatedById":57750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T06:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add pictures later, but wing commander prophecy.
