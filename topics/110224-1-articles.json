I\u0027ve noticed a huge spike in the population of the community with the release of 1.0. I\u0027ve had numerous folks ask me how to accomplish things in KSP. Everything from how to achieve orbit, land, get to the mun etc has been mentioned. Because KSP is a more complicated game, I believe its important that we nurture these new players by providing them with all the info we can! My solution was to start a basic tutorial series on youtube. We can also point them to guys like Scott Manley, and of course pay close attention to unanswered questions on the forums. The bottom line is that the community has grown measurably since full-release, and community members have at least some responsibility for keeping these new players on-board.
