Outside of the universe for me I would guess would be extremely different than what we consider normal. A place where it is infinitely cold, and no energy exists, and where no light is visible. The most paradoxal form of our universe. Even in space we believe that it is an inhospitable place where nothing exists. But energy and light are all around us, even in space. We can see things, feel things, and see the passing of time right before our eyes. In the omniverse (what i will call the paradoxal form of the universe) everything is nonexistant and cold. No life, no planets, no energy, not even the ability to see the passing of time in the most miniscule amount. It\u0027s probably like being in pitch black. If you were to trap an animal or a person in a completely black universe for 5 years. The human would not know how much time has passed. The brain cannot know about such things if there is no stimuli to respond to.
