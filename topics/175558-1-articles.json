The variable distance is measured in \u003Cem\u003Eincrement\u003C/em\u003E, a very rough mesurement which corresponds to moving once an object using the offset tool with the maj key pressed. I tried clamp-o-tron snr,\u00A0clamp-o-tron\u00A0 and\u00A0clamp-o-tron jr, in matching pairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVertical stability.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EThere are stable region where the train can stably levitate\u003C/strong\u003E. It goes against my prenotion that docking ports were simple magnets which get more and more attracted as they get closer (in that case, no stable levitation, if it goes a bit too low, it falls too high it rams into the rail and docks). The magnet force is really small, maybe null when the port are right next to each other, increases to a max value when the ports are 2 increments appart, and fades at 4-5 increments. It follows that there can be 1 stable equilibrium.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELateral stability.\u003C/strong\u003E As expected, levitation is latterally stable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMagnet force.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E4.4kN.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EMagnet force does not depend on the size of the port. Forget aboubt clamp-o-tron senior.\u003C/strong\u003E 4.5 to 4.5 kN is the max I could get, but the stability region looks very small, 4kN should be safe. It means a clamp-o-Tron jr can pull 20 time it\u0027s weight, \u003Cstrong\u003Esame force to mass ratio than the ass kicking 48-77s spark engine\u003C/strong\u003E. I haven\u0027t tested the minimum force before it docks, but 2kN is also possible, although stability region looks smaller than the one of 3kN.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only found one place in the web where this idea is ever mentionned, but it is a very promising redit post showing a mostly working prototype.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3908643394\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/7fpupe/stock_maglev/\u0022 style=\u0022height:466px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Finally, although mono rail should be possible, I would advise put two in a mickey hear configuration for increased stability (but needs testing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can share upon request the craft file I used for my test, but that\u0027s not much really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-02T21:35:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2018 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Kesa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-03T13:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery interesting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-03T15:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting idea!
