The script asset management tool we needed to offload scripts to dll files is implemented, but I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just go moving files around on my own, as that would cause conflicts with the things everyone else is working on, especially Mike and Jim\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s UI overhaul. To properly migrate our code, we need to do this when everyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s project state is as little modified as possible, so that means the code move will have to wait a while.\n\u003E \n\u003E In the meantime, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been fixing miscellaneous issues with the U5 version, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been able to get the VS compiler to build the game without errors (it used to complain about a library we use to validate mod plugins), so that means now we can use the very awesome VS debugger whenever we need it, which gives us a host of new tools to debug issues. \n\u003E \n\u003E Not much more to tell I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m afraid\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 some weeks make for better dev blog material than others. \n\n**Mike (Mu)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a fun week in the life of Mike. I sold my old car and bought another one. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been working through lots of bugs and new bits for the Unity upgrade. Whoever thought this would be plain sailing was very wrong! It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a lot of work and some very odd bugs come out occasionally. I have been merging a lot of stuff together this week and filling in holes or bits we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve missed over the weeks.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I went to the dentist today and my head is a bit funny, hopefully Kasper can proofread this to ensure it makes sense. I\u2019m still working with Ted and the Amazon guys to bring the 1.0.4 update asap. They told us their developer platform was having some trouble getting the binaries to them, and although this affected other developers besides us as well, they have apparently worked it out now and we gave it another go. If it was fixed indeed there should be nothing more to do on our end and the update should be available soon.\n\u003E \n\u003E The office is under maintenance, so we\u2019ve been working on a bit of a nomad approach, it hasn\u2019t been fun.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Doing some blueprints for the new office and photoshopping how it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to look after the remodelations. Moved my workstation twice too. Fun stuff. In the meantime I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on the same assets of last week.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Time for a progress report again. This week i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been setting up the new Application Launcher and three stock apps: MessageSystem, Contracts and the Engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Report.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Overseeing the remodelling of our studio has taken most of my time so far, particularly things like setting up temporary workstations for everyone so we can still be productive while we upgrade our GAB (That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s our Game Assembly Building). Besides that, a healthy mix of working with Ted as he transitions to his more production based role and continuing my hunt for a locally based CM has been keeping me busy. May finally have someone!\n\n**Ted (Ted)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In the past week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working heavily on production tasks. Primarily, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been the usual mix of handling internal documentation and planning/design for 1.1 features. Additionally, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working with Marco to hopefully finally remedy the Amazon updating issue. Again, if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re affected by the outdated KSP PC version on Amazon US, please do e-mail support (at) kerbalspaceprogram.com.\n\u003E \n\u003E Outside of that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on the KSP Experimental Testing Team application form, which is now open and available [http://goo.gl/forms/VQfXnWTZMN](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003E**here**. Applications close on the 3rd of August and successful applicants will be contacted during the week of the 17th.\n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on an article about 1.1 development and discussing a couple of the features being developed for it. That should be available tomorrow.\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Back on the job after my week of studying. The first order of business on Monday was to visit the Shapeways factory in Eindhoven, where I was given a warm welcome and a very interesting tour. While I was there I saw at least two orders of 3D printed Kerbals being packaged at that very moment, so if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re receiving a Jebediah, or a group of Jeb, Bob and Bill this week then it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very well possible that they were inspected by myself!

All you need is a few part mods and something to make the game look better, and boom, you run into the 4 gig memory restriction and the game crashes. Active texture management mod helps, but even with that you can\u0027t have part mods and visual mods at the same time. The way the game loads EVERYTHING into memory at startup is stupid, and necessitates a 64-bit version because that will solve all the memory restriction problems. I REALLY hope for the sake of KSP\u0027s future that at some point SQUAD transitions from the age-old 32-bit era to the modern world of 64 bits.\n\nIf you look at Rust for example, that is a 64-bit Unity 5 game that runs very well and is completely stable. SQUAD can\u0027t blame Unity anymore for the lack of an official 64-bit version. If they have problems with KSP running on 64-bit Unity, it is their own code causing the issues, not some mysterious bug in Unity that can\u0027t be dealt with. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love KSP. I just want it to be improved so that the game would run better (single-threaded physics) and support more mods at the same time (limited to 4 GB of RAM due to KSP being a 32-bit application)."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T12:58:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the spirit of rocketry and Kerbalesque safety regulations I vote for seperate H2 and O2 dispensers located next to eachother.\n\nThat has the potential to go really, **really** bad."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:15:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hoping for [clouds](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/image/j/i/Cumulus_2.jpg), the implementation of [Dans \u0022kerbal picking up a sample\u0022 animation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120710-More-animations-for-Kerbals-EVAs?p=1927101\u0026viewfull=1#post1927101), integration of [Proot\u0027s Renaissance compilation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76972-0-90-KSPRC-Renaissance-Compilation-artworks-remake-V-0-2-%2818-04-15%29?p=2091076\u0026viewfull=1#post2091076), More [Kerbal activities while landed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package) on a foreign moon, and some sort of better contract generation control.\n\nGo home, r4pt0r.
