I think the main problem in the editor is just a visual bug; as for flying, try adding more struts to keep your wings in place and see if that helps. KSP has this weird issue where joints can flex unevenly under equal loads if the joints are oriented in different ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@taniwha: \u003C/strong\u003EAny region where Cm * AoA \u0026lt; 0 indicates a stable AoA region for the plane; the situation you\u0027re describing basically indicates that the plane is stable until it starts to stall, at which point it becomes unstable. If you\u0027re certain that the plane won\u0027t be capable of stalling itself, then it shouldn\u0027t be a problem. If you want to make sure that it is stable during a stall make sure that your forward wing / canard has a higher aspect ratio than the rearward wing / tail; that will cause the forward surfaces to stall at a lower angle of attack than the rearward ones, making the plane stable. FYI, aspect ratio is equal to the wingspan / wing chord (distance from leading edge to trailing edge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@DauntingFlyer: \u003C/strong\u003EIt\u0027s possible I screwed something up during the drag update; I\u0027ll check it out.

While FAR still allows flying brick outhouses (so long as they\u0027re built with due care), they won\u0027t get the delta-v gains that FAR provides to well designed ships. Also, flying ships with FAR takes a bit more skill (cf various comments about gravity turns). It took me a week to work out how to get my rockets into equatorial orbits (ASAS \u002B untweaked control surfaces (rv-8 is it?) \u002B FAR = a bucking bronco that winds up in a near polar orbit (for me)), and my ships were stable (CoM ahead of/above CoM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake your payload streamlined, or get it hidden behind something that is (ie, use fairings. I\u0027m not sure if FAR supports wind shadows caused by non-connected parts being behind other parts). If you can\u0027t streamline it, at least keep it balanced. Randomly protruding bits makes for random aerodynamic forces. not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor any stage that will be operating in atmosphere (below about 45km for Kerbin for these purposes, though different ships might have different limits), get that CoL below/behind the CoM (turn on the indicators). If the CoL is not below the CoM, slap tail fins on the stage until it is. Don\u0027t put the CoL too far behind the CoM, or the stabilizing forces will overpower your control forces. Set the deflection angles of any control surfaces to about 3 degrees or less (first page in the FAR box in the VAB. Nothing showing = no control surfaces so effectively 0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above means that if you do onion or asparagus (the latter not recommended due to the distribution becoming uneven), put fins on the inner stages as well as the outer stages. Keep that CoL behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s generally a good idea to keep ASAS off during ascent, even with tweaked control surfaces, at least until you\u0027re above =45km (beyond that, the air\u0027s too thin to cause control problems, though it\u0027s still thick enough to drop your apoapsis if you cut your engines. It\u0027s also too thin for your fins to be effective for control :/). ASAS will happily throw your ship way outside the recommended 5 degree angle of attack (because its control algorithm doesn\u0027t correct properly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep an eye on your surface speed. You do not want to be going much faster than 300m/s when you hit 10km (if, like me, you use deadly reentry too, you \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E burn). Up to around 400m/s seems to be ok for 10km-15km. About 600m/s for up to about 18km. 800m/s for about 20km. 1000m/s seems to be ok above 22km. 1500m/s is safe nearing 30km. Above 33km, it doesn\u0027t seem to matter. Rule of thumb: if you see reentry effects (above 10km) or hypersonic effects (below 10km, the white streaks streaming off your ship), you\u0027re probably going too fast. Thin, dull red streamers seem to be safe for the most part (though some parts (eg, Kerbal Attachment System\u0027s detachable connector) have much lower temperature tolerances, despite being behind a fairing), but if you see any yellow, consider it a failure: you\u0027re already dead.

I\u0027m too busy watching my space plane\u0027s pitch, AoA, and vertical and surface velocity to take accurate notes. Again: try to avoid hypersonic/reentry effects on the way up: they mean you\u0027re going too fast for that altitude (if nothing else, you\u0027re wasting delta-v that should be saved for higher altitudes when you\u0027re going nearly horizontal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne accurate figure I can give: ~1100m/s at 17-18km produces near-complete destruction of my planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the TWR of your lower stages fairly low will allow for worry free ascents. Just keep that angle of attack low by starting your gravity turn as early as you can (eg, 200m (yes, 0.2km)). If you use mechjeb: turn start of 0.2 and 40% seems to work well (I\u0027ve never had any problems when my TWR wasn\u0027t too high).
