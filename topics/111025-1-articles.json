The rotation of the planet would cause the atmosphere to rotate with it, which would push the surface of the liquid, as what happens here on Earth.

Since Kerbin has a sun and an atmosphere, it should have wind. It also should have waves.\n\nAnd it should have tides, too.\n\nWhat bugs me is that it has no real lakes. All water is exactly at mean sea level. I would guess that means that every body of water on the planet is saltwater. Maybe kerbals don\u0027t need fresh water, which is why they can go on these 20-year space missions with no problem."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T17:02:24Z","Content":"I like the birds, but when I return to the space center at night it\u0027s always a bit jarring to hear \u0027em still singing.

Even the engines and RCS ports, because of the fuel flow, and the fact that the expelled fuel is not a (total) vacuum.\n\nYour wording reminds me of that old debate: \u0022If a tree falls but nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?\u0022\n\nWhat could cause a vibration on an airless body? Rocks falling from space (like meteorites), underground movement of molten rock, volcanoes (consider Io), other landers, bases, rovers, kerbals (etc.), erosion due to radiation pressure or possibly tides of rock caused by fluctuations in gravity (for example the Earth\u0027s surface moves up and down by about a foot/30cm along with the ocean tides)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T17:27:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover**"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T17:27:11Z","Content":"They aren\u0027t birds.
