Are there any known unused MODULE{} types in KSP\u0027s code. I seem to remember coming across a mention of a stock rotation module, but I can\u0027t find any trace of it on the forums.\n\nSome time last year I copied and completely repurposed a few stock parts, just to see how much I could do. Now I want to extend that to see just how complicated a mod I can make without using any plugins. On a side-note, if I released a mod, would I be okay to distribute some models and edited textures from the stock game if I credited SQUAD? What licenses could I use if so? (I don\u0027t intend to charge or anything)\n\nMods: If this is in the wrong section please move it. I wasn\u0027t sure exactly where to put it."},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:54:53Z","Content":"\u0022ModuleRotatingJoint\u0022 is the one you are thinking of ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) yes there are quite a few unused part modules, they can be found if you open up MonoDevelop (comes with Unity), open Assembly-CSharp.dll (which is found in ksp\\_data/managed) right click it in the side bar, at the bottom in \u0022display options\u0022 and tick \u0022Show All Files\u0022 then click the little \u002B next to Assembly-CSharp and double click assembly-csharp.dll, then in the new window that opens click the first {} and scroll down to where it gets to M alphabetically and you can find all the part modules!\n\nI discovered this yesterday after having seen some people do it before, took me a while to figure out where it was haha.\n\nI also found ModuleFuelJettison, so many time I have needed this and never knew it was a thing"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:13:44Z","Content":"I kind of wanted a list without having to install anything, but I looked up MonoDevelop and installed it in under 5 minutes, so I should be able to do that myself now, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:34:22Z","Content":"yeah no one seems to have published one, It\u0027s definitely something that would be a good resource, i might spend the time doing it if I ever find myself with a pile of free time, but tbh most people who want to know already mod KSP and therefore will have Unity, and since Monodevelop comes with Unity they just need to go there"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:47:17Z","Content":"The less known module are not tested since they are not use by any parts.
