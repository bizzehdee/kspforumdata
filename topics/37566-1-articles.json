You need to set a 10 or 15 km periapsis and avoid a direct re-entry to make sure you spend as much time as possible in the densest part of the atmosphere. You may need to aerobrake and bleed speed over several orbits. You can also use MechJeb aerobraking predictions to plan more extreme manoeuvres (8 km PE or so \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) to aerobrake in one orbit, but these can be dangerous...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-18T12:55:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2013 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by el_coyoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T12:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t take much tho, a toroidal tank and 2 of the little orange radial engines, fire retrograde a little bit while your between 50-30m from the ground.
