A lot of what it does is because you can milk money out of \u0022being green\u0022, not because of a fundamental desire to \u0022be green\u0022, and because it lets big oil companies avoid changing the status quo too much while still making it look like they\u0027re doing something. And on the consumer side you have issues like older engines being unable to cope with the fuel mixture\u0027s increased corrosiveness, constantly changing standards, and also higher prices (although governments subsidize this difference away to equalize prices at the pump, that subsidy money is still coming out of your taxes and going into the pockets of fuel companies).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I suppose, it is helping a little. The CO2 emitted by biofuel is not CO2 that was previously bound underground for millions of years and now gets dumped into the atmosphere; rather, it is CO2 that came from the atmosphere in the first place (that\u0027s how plants get their carbon). So every liter of biofuel used slows down the mass flooding of our atmosphere with bound CO2 by a tiny amount. So long as people don\u0027t use it as an excuse to avoid more fuel efficient cars, of course. Replacing 20 MPG cars by 40 MPG ones saves far more carbon emissions than mixing biofuels into gasoline or Diesel will. (Electric cars obviously beat this several times over.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T08:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Europe, service stations already sell E10, which contains 10% ethanol and can be used by any regular petrol/gas vehicle.

That arable land could be put to much better use, such as, for example, producing food. Where I live (in the south of France),\u00A0crop rotations are nearly exclusively rapeseed, corn, and sunflower. The rapeseed is increasingly dominant because it\u0027s used to make biofuel. As a result, we are\u00A0progressively moving towards a monoculture, which is encouraged by various subsidies, producing less corn and sunflower.

Lignin is a pain to deal with but unfortunately it\u0027s also what gives plant stems much of their structural strength. You can breed or engineer low-lignin plants for improved digestibility, but there\u0027s a fine balance between a plant stem that\u0027s more easily processed into biofuel and a plant stem that\u0027s too weak to grow properly.
