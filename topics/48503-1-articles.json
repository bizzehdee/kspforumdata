Put a probe on the surface to test landing gravity, a Satellite with a Kethane scanner into a 90 degree orbit for obvious reasons and you can never have enough satellites. After that a rover for exploring. All that on every planet and moon where possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the next stage of the mission create a main ship to fly to each planet and moon. On that ship will be a Kethane mining vessel to go to a near by moon or planet(if reasonable) get some Kethane and refuel the main ship. Then a landing pod to land a kerbal or more on the surface of all the moons and planets to plant a flag. This presents the challenge fly planets like Eve with high gravity, lots of atmosphere or both where landing and returning requires insane amounts of delta v. So I thought about using a ion powered space plane for these planets to get a kerbal down and back. So now to my questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes Gilly have Kethane? Simple question but I haven\u0027t been anywhere but kerbins moons and Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a rover on Minmus already however due to the low gravity I only managed to get the thing to dance on one wheel. While amusing it wasn\u0027t what I was expecting. So anyone have any tips for fixing this? I was using the brown aircraft wheels so maybe that was the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext ion powered space plane for Eve and such? Good, bad of maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally for those of you who have been to the magic boulder. Should I try this mission to include it? I assume it can\u0027t be mined or orbited easily but landing on it? Should I just try and go from where I end up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure some of my questions could be solved with Google. However I\u0027m looking for answers along with the useful tidbits that come with more experience if anyone has any to share so I stated the question anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T00:21:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Shade0017\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"svdragster","CreatedById":87063,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T18:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think every planet and moon has kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a good rover for minmus, it must be really heavy because of the low gravity.

The question is whether it\u0027s in a convenient place or not. You want deposits near the equator so you don\u0027t have to burn a lot of fuel changing your orbit inclination a lot. You want it in reasonably flat ground, and you want enough of it to do the job. You can go into the Kethane config file and change the minimum amount of Kethane to some nice number (do this BEFORE you scan as it erases any previous scans) but the placement is luck of the draw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel-efficient way to convert Kethane into LOF for spaceships is to refine it in orbit, not on the surface. To keep things simple, therefore, you should have a lander with a Kethane tank, drills, enough electricity to run the drills, and enough rockets to lift the Kethane to orbit and dock with your mothership, which has the refining part. All this makes for a pretty big lander so you might do better having a 2-ship flotilla, the mothership and the Kethane drill/lifter separate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny place where a Kerbal can achieve escape velocity with his jetpack is no place for rovers.

First, ion engines produce very little thrust and Eve has both high gravity and thick air, so you\u0027d probably never move fast enough to get back into orbit.

I had MechJeb keep the satellite pointed retrograde while I burned and went and made popcorn. I came back with the satellite around 20k above the surface. Those 4 solar panels made it to the ground in one piece. I can only assume with my limited knowledge that because the panels were not side ways that they were able to stay in one piece for the decent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T22:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERovers - try driving it in docking mode and turn on SAS when you don\u0027t want to turn; if you have a probe core on the rover, it\u0027ll have a tendency to self-correct when it wants to flip over that way.
