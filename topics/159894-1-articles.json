Or is the thermal mass of the part only dependent on the dry mass of the part. The latter seems like it would be really incorrect but I\u0027m not sure exactly how the thermal system handles it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-29T02:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThermal mass of the fuel is modeled, in fact you can pump out hot fuel and pump cooler fuel in to cool a part. So yes, having the wings full of fuel would cause their temps to rise less quickly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
