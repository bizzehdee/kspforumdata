I created a custom event and wanted to have my parts module listen for it, but I got some errors because it was \u0022listening\u0022 for the event 3 times.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EOn investigation, I found that the OnLoad(), OnStart() and\u00A0OnStartFinished()\u00A0methods was called exactly 3 times on startup of scene for my module. Now I can find anywhere where I do anything more that use those methods once.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003ETherefore my question is. Have anybody seen this behaviour before? Are anybody aware why this could happen. Normally it does not mess up my plugin is it is executed more than once, but in this case it is important that it is only done once!\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EAn observation I had was, that even if I introduce a bool, which I switch on first execution, the next one does not recognize that, and reports it to the log as false still - it\u0027s like it is a new instance, but why..... I\u0027ve gone through my save file to see if my module was there more than once on my vessel, but I could only identify the one.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI\u0027m testing on the simplest craft I can think of. Command module, fuel tank, engine. My module is in the engine part.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003ESo again, have anybody observed anything like this? I\u0027m definitely still working on the assumption that the error is mine, but I\u0027m trying to gather information.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: LOL....... Just notice, I had another craft at my space center on the runway, and it had two engines......
