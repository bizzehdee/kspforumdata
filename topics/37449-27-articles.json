Courage would reduce the stress build up in short term instances. For instance during landings/take-offs. These would introduce less stress for a courageous Kerbal than for others. Stupidity would be the other way around... er, if it wasn\u0027t a reverse stat. Well, the more intelligent you were the better you\u0027d deal with the long term build up of stress from being cooped up in... you know? I think it might work the other way around. Being too stupid to know there was a problem. If you\u0027re smart enough you start to consider all the things going wrong and get more worried over time. Might be a good counter. In KSPI there is already a point to having low stupidity Kerbals. If stress is done this way there\u0027d be a point to having HIGH Stupidity Kerbals.
