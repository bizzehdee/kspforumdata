I can quite literally do and excel at almost anything, and this caused lots of problems beyond just the indecisiveness when it came to what to do with myself that\u00A0I don\u0027t really want to get into. The short of it was, I spent the last 5 years doing what kept the bills paid while I figured myself out. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd eventually, it hit me like a brick one day a few weeks ago\u00A0and I finally felt decided on what I wanted to do. If I could do anything, why not something amazing? Being an astronaut was the most amazing thing I could think of.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis decision became even more solidified after I found out what it truly takes to become one, both from talking with actual astronauts (I love my annual pass to KSC) and just trolling the internet in general. Aside from the base requirements, all the hobbies and general \u0022flair\u0022 that really helps you get noticed and selected are all things I\u0027ve wanted to do anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m going to start school later this year (finally) and start my path to becoming an astronaut. And the great thing about it is, even if I never get to become one, everything I\u0027ll have to earn and learn and do is going to practically guarantee I\u0027ll never be wanting for a job anyway. Its kinda funny really, given the most common response to what I decided to do is to ask whether or not I have a backup plan, as if astronauts are somehow unqualified to do anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T22:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsking on the KSP forum if you should try to become an astronaut?

However, I do have some strong recommendations for you to undergo before you set out on this (decades-long) investment of time and energy and effort:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Go ahead and get the most extensive medical evaluation you can schedule. At the least, I would recommend shooting for a 1st Class Medical Certificate by an FAA examiner - but that\u0027s the bare minimum examination I would recommend. You \u003Cstrong\u003Edo not\u003C/strong\u003E want to get all the way to applying for NASA or Virgin Galactic only to be told the seizure you had in 1st grade disqualifies you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Take care of your finances. As mind-blowing as it sounds, you\u0027re not going to get a job (anywhere respectable, really) if you have $5,000 in credit card debt and unpaid student loans. Any Government organization like NASA will screen for stable finances and \u003Cstrong\u003Enow\u003C/strong\u003E is the perfect time to get your bank account in order before investing the time. If you can\u0027t readily survive the pre-approval for a home, you probably won\u0027t survive the pre-screening for this type of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u003Cstrong\u003EStudy habits.\u003C/strong\u003E I know \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of pilots and I know \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of wannabe pilots who never made it. Being intelligent and being knowledgeable are two different things, and frankly the guy who has good study habits will always outplay the guy who is naturally good but only studied 2 hours a night instead of 6. I got a job flying MD-80\u0027s in Oct 2014 and about 30% of the guys in my class \u003Cstrong\u003Efailed\u003C/strong\u003E because they didn\u0027t study - \u003Cstrong\u003Eand all of them were already ATP rated pilots with thousands of hours and had been flying commercial for \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E Experience and talent only get you so far. I\u0027m absolutely 100% serious - learn good study habits now if you haven\u0027t already. This will be the make it or break it part of your endeavor. You\u0027ve been warned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Last but not least, if all the above work for you, just make sure you have good team support. Your family and friends have to be in it with you. No one makes it to the top alone. Get the people around you interested in your success. I say this because people can fail at reaching their dreams when their significant other or their friends just aren\u0027t there for them. For instance, if you know you have to study for a test but your girlfriend is more interested in bothering you about re-modeling the living room, you have to make it clear where your heart is. \u003Cem\u003EThe people around you can distract you from your goals if you let them.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I wish you the best of luck.
