First re-entry with the new patch was a beautiful success. I love the new gliding abilities! Great job. I\u0027ll keep that cfg forever ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Most fun I had in a while in KSP. \n\u003E I didn\u0027t notice any changes about orbit maneuvering though.. something has changed there? I like it as it is by the way. However compared to any other stock vessel I have to chase the maneuver target much more with the shuttle. How come? It\u0027s not burning straight ahead?\n\ngood to know it was a successful edit!\n\nthanks for reminding me of the issue.\n\nI did not change the orbit maneuvering. I don\u0027t know if I need to change reaction control torque or the rcs thruster power?\n\nlet me know.\n\nalso the oms engines are thrusting above the centre of mass so it will try to spin the orbiter around. its just how it is designed..."},{"CreatedByName":"olivertk","CreatedById":124146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:40:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yes it is. its because I overworked it during development to work out other issues.\n\u003E is it rcs or reaction wheel power that you want less?\n\nthe reaction wheels"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:44:39Z","Content":"I actually like the way it is right now. I wouldn\u0027t change reaction wheel torque or thruster power. It s fine the way it is and I could do with less or more so no strong opinion for me.\n\nAbout the oms engines that s good to know.. It explains why the maneuver node targets always shoots up. Trim -12 in Y almost solves the issue completely. This is very enjoyable to fly both in space and in atmosphere now.
