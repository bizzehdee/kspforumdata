I wasted a good amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E by burning way higher than I should have, but I ended up with enough to de-orbit and \u0022land\u0022 on the Island Runway after overshooting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway.  \n\nA few things to say about this, this was the first successful orbit, and payload delivery of this craft after 5 design changes. This craft is extremely unstable during descent and re-entry, having a tendency to flip backwards, and tumble. I have come to the conclusion that after depleting all liquid fuel, and delivering it\u0027s payload, it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECenter of Lift\u003C/abbr\u003E is more forward than it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECenter of Mass\u003C/abbr\u003E. I will do further re-entry testing, and see if this can be remedied by pumping leftover oxidizer into the forward tanks. I would have landed on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway if it weren\u0027t for the tumbling, and I would have had a better landing on the Island runway if it wasn\u0027t for it\u0027s poor gliding characteristics. Credit where credit is due, it did glide for about 5-10~ Km.

I did do the monoprop delivery last night but didn\u0027t take any screenshots as it would be pretty much the same as previous report, got a satellite to drop into polar orbit which should be doable with this though!.  Working on a bigger version for cargo now may enter that for something once I\u0027m happy with it (doesn\u0027t reach orbit right now)."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-10T11:36:59Z","Content":"OK [@Aquaticfantastic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/189287-aquaticfantastic/) if you want to include that delivery mission for listing and kudos a text report will do, just need to know the name of the ship and details like dock/transfer in orbit and landing location and that no parts were lost etc. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-10T11:37:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2018 11:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aquaticfantastic","CreatedById":189287,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-10T11:53:44Z","Content":"[@boolybooly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/6572-boolybooly/) It was the same craft (R8-ZR), 500 units of mono from the plane into the station mono tanks, landed back at runway with no parts lost.
