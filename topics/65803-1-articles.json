The closer you try to get to a perfect circular orbit, the more noticeable this gets (as you can see the Ap / Pe markers actually jerking around as the game keeps recalculating the orbital parameters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is, there\u0027s rarely any time when you really need that much precision. The \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E important things to pay attention to, if you want something that\u0027s geosynchronous or something like that, are the semi-major axis and the orbital period. A slightly elliptical orbit will still roughly maintain its position relative to the surface if its period correctly matches the planet\u0027s rotation period, with minimal need for adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vozlov","CreatedById":101189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T21:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.

However, if you never dip into the atmosphere the orbit will not decay. In other words, if your craft\u0027s maximum altitude is say 100,500m and the lowest is 99,500m around Kerbin, it will stay that way unless you mess with it. The altitude will slowly drift between those two altitudes as the craft orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress M in-game and take a look at the map. It will show you the highest (apoapsis) and lowest points (periapsis) of your orbit.
