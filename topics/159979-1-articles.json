\u00A0When it\u0027s in its housing, the Terrier engine of the CSM doesn\u0027t come into contact with the capsule, but the way this has behaved so far - and I did try putting a small decoupler between the two - I\u0027m wondering if maybe I need something in there as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s my problem; I\u00A0hope somebody will be able to explain how to reproduce this type of fairing using the stock parts. \u00A0Apologies for all the screenshots, but they made it much easier to explain than me trying to do it in words. \u00A0Thanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reusables","CreatedById":179182,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T14:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you connect the payload stage with docking port jr., you can enable staging on the part.
