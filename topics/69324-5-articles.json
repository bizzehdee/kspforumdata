Usually in all my manned flights, if it\u0027s not a shuttle launch but a crew capsule (not lander, I always put those up separately) I always use one, and they have proven to be useful. I always program them and a separator to save the kerbals if things go bad. Once I break about 50km I program all escape towers to eject with my action sequence 10. Also, because the aerodynamics model is getting reworked, I have been using them to jettison nose cone sections and things once I break orbit to save mass, they are VERY useful for things like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, it depends on the type of ship and use. Also, this is in interesting topic for another reason. Let\u0027s talk escape towers in reality. I once heard that the Apollo escape/abort system was useless. They said if something actually went bad, that system would have not been able to react in time to it. It was more so there as a political statement to show they didn\u0027t want to kill astronauts. The systems did work, it\u0027s just they didn\u0027t have a chance of actually saving astronauts. Anyone here of this? On the other hand, in the 80\u0027s on a Russian Soyuz I believe and escape tower DID save astronauts from a dangerous situation. I heard it propelled them to some super high g-force and scared the crap out of the astronauts. Maybe the 80\u0027s had better technology for rockets/computer systems for the abort sequences, but I did hear the Apollo one\u0027s weren\u0027t that great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T12:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, i run the rocket in a simulator and if it fails i rever...ehm... redesign and when the simulator shows it\u0027s working then it sudenly becomes the real thing.
