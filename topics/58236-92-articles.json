Maybe this is intended now. Also, before I start DennyTX did a recompile of EngineIgnitor, no more NREs from it and temperature displays as before. Continuing. Before. A part had both ModuleEngines(FX) and ModuleEngineConfigs. When ModuleEngineConfigs was present the min/max thrust worked, would only throttle to that set point. Once throttle hit 0%, engine would shut down/off. Instead of stock behavior with *just* ModuleEngines(FX) when it would throttle as it should, but engine never shut down, well effects would, but still would maintain minThrust. NOW. The same behavior exists with ModuleEngineConfigs as it did with stock in 0.90. Engine still runs at min thrust even with throttle at 0%, but now effects and all still show up until the engine is actually shutdown. I actually kinda like the present behavior. Now with the recompiled EngineIgnitor this behavior doesn\u0027t quite jive because when throttle hits 0% and is then increased it still uses and \u0027ignition\u0027, all the while the engine was running and never shut down, so an ignition should never have been used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that leads to the question of. How are engines supposed to be configured in the config file. Is it the same as before and things should more or less transfer over, just a slight change in behavior involving shutting down or do we need to include a new module with engines or other parts. Basically are there intentions of a GOOD example or wiki of all variables involved with the new RealFuels. I\u0027d be more than willing to create some documentation, but it would obviously require much help in what those variables are, and how they are used, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve ported over the actual engine module changes to ModuleEnginesRF. All RO engines are forced to use that module; it derives from ModuleEnginesFX but has many improvements (like the minthrust thing you mentioned, thrust curve support, chamber temperature handled differently from part temperature, Isp curves extended to 0 Isp, etc). However, that means that you need to change the engine module in your patch to @name = ModuleEnginesRF. ModuleEngineConfigs now _only_ exists to handle multiple engine configs, rather than changing how the engine works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn time this will allow much more realistic engine performance (say, calculated from chamber pressure, expansion ratio, and cycle efficiency), inside-the-module ullage support, much better thermal calculations, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not yet had a chance to see how that plays with Engine Ignitor, partly because as above (or maybe mentioned elsewhere?
