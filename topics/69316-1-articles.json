Then we started seeing them in sport class aircraft, solar powered research aircraft, etc. This has made me somewhat curious about the maximum limits of electric propulsion which can be achieved. Currently there are limits on the power output of aircraft power systems. It takes many megawatts (mechanical) to keep a commercial airliner flying. Suppose this problem went away. perhaps you have or or more 100MW polywells onboard. regardless of the power supply, what could you do with it as far as propulsion goes? could you achieve supersonic or hypersonic flight purely on electrical power? what about non-mechanical systems like what you see on ionic lifters, would they offer any improvement over electric ducted fans or props?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T10:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I\u0027ve been thinking about this since I know about polywell.
