Note that my usual sub-orbital trajectory has the Pe around 25km in atmosphere, so that the circularization burn takes \u0026lt; 100 m/s dV. Now, i did this flight only to see the re-entry heating so i did not circularize. On my way down, all fine \u0026amp; dandy, the shield ablated roughly 50% of the ablative coating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, i took the same rocket - but this time without a heat shield. Roughly the same trajectory.. give or take. To my surprise i could re-enter even without the heat shield. Given the fact that it was just a sub-orbital flight, thats fine for me, since the temperature values were extremely close to the point where things blow up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd rocket.. same design, but with 2.5 parts. Mk1-2 pod, chute \u0026amp; heat shield. Same trajectory.. In this case, the max temperature on the parts reached ~600 deg, which translates to about 300 deg. celsius.. which seems extremely low for a re-entry. Even a sub-orbital one. On top of that, the heat shield ablated just 1.5 of its ablative coating. 12 units out of 800. That feels a bit underwhelming in terms of re-entry danger. Even feels a bit like cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT #1: Just did another test run with the Mk1-2 pod \u002B chute but without heat shield.

Thanks so much guys. I was having a huge head-scratching fest going on with regards to why heatshield behavior seemed so erratic based on what was attached to them. Had some Munar free returns almost completely deplete a 1.25m shield, while ones from Minmus (and Munar returns with different vehicles) didn\u0027t even make a dent in it. Am also playing at 120% settings, because yes, reentry heat is a joke at present, and I wanted a more challenging experience (which it isn\u0027t really providing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all makes sense now thanks to the above comments \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T02:02:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJK","CreatedById":114951,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not fiddled with those two options yet.. but i\u0027m assuming its something related to the sun\u0027s radiation and / or light levels (for solar panels)?
