I bought myself a new hard drive (which didn\u0027t have Windows, so I downloaded Ubuntu) and a hard drive reader. While my computer works, the hard drive reader is about a millimeter too small. So I have not been able to recover my data yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I am unable to recover my data, I will make up a storyline.

Even if I can recover my data, I am playing in GPP now. And I will do something cool in it if it kills me. Wait, no, if it kills my computer. It crashes occasionally when going into map mode, but I deleted Scatterer and that helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am currently exploring GPP on Easy Science mode, but tomorrow (or earlier) I\u0027m going to start a new thread.
