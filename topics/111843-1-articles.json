I\u0027d be tempted to replace the second stage with 2.5m parts even though it\u0027ll be overpowered - perhaps couple that with a less powerful first stage. If you transition from 2.5m to 1.25m at the docking port on the bottom of your payload, you can put struts inside the fairing (strut upwards).\n\nI\u0027ve taken to putting (going downwards) payload, docking port, probe core to control rocket once detached from payload, rockomax adaptor type 2, fairing base.

I strutted it up so it wasn\u0027t quite so wobbly, but I guess it is too light?

If I used a 2.5m fairing, would that be structurally more sound, or is it still relying on the internal structure and the fairing is just protecting it aerodynamically?"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T14:44:01Z","Content":"Ditch that last stage. it has a laughable amount of fuel and it\u0027s only making the lever the drag is pushing you down with longer.

Depending on what ends up being flipped some part of the ascent prograde and retrograde will be mixed up on the navball (and for mechjeb etc.) unless you use two probe cores and switch control during flight.\n\nIt looked pretty funky with the decoupler and nose cone on the end stage engine (didn\u0027t have farings unlocked yet) but it worked fine.

Strut the hell out of it for good measure too.\n\nLower TWR helps in cases where one attachment node is overwhelmed but that can also be taken care of with struts. Aerodynamic effects are far worse and together with the wobbly nature of the beast almost guarantee rocket flippiness. You can avoid them by lifting up above the air, then burning for orbit in a less efficient ascent profile. Very late \u0022gravity turns\u0022 may be frowned upon, but they have their uses.\n\nAnother enemy is SAS. If you lock SAS, the craft will almost certainly begin to shake itself apart at some point, which is another reason to go slow. I lock it for initial liftoff, then release while the rocket climbs through the \u0022locking SAS will shake it apart\u0022 zone, then try to engage in brief periods that help keep the thing pointed up.\n\nBut yeah, the solution is to waste fuel. Just waste fuel. But obviously, not for fun, but for profit. Or science! Actually, for orbit!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If you don\u0027t want the additional weight of a larger 2.5 m engine such as the poodle you could try emptying some of the fuel before launch and using a smaller engine covered by an interstage fairing, now that I think of it, why not use interstage fairings to make the rocket smoother without dumping the 1.25m cor for a 2.5m core Also, fins at the bottom will help you fly straight, and winglets will actually provide you with control authority.\n\nIn my experience any rocket that get\u0027s thinner in the middle will flip if not built and piloted veeeery carefully.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T21:00:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T00:07:04Z","Content":"My new rule is, if it has a bulging fairing then it gets fins.

Put the light, long (or heavily winged airplane) on the bottom and build heavy, thrusty rocket above this. That way, the CoM is forward and the CoL is aft like they should be.\n\nFor example, a lifter for 2x airplanes going to Laythe, mounted on a transfer tug that\u0027s a full orange tank at launch. This is in 1.0.2. The lifter is SSTO and the explosion in the right pic is it exploding after staging in orbit via TAC Self-Destruct so as not to be debris.\n\n[![17727503938_80774f4de3_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7781/17727503938_80774f4de3_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t1w6iC)"},{"CreatedByName":"banterlad","CreatedById":143938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T03:51:26Z","Content":"Strut it up, a fairing would be nice as well"}]}
