I set the camera to ORBITAL, and align it so that Kerbin is in my field of view. I crank the time warp up to 1000, and as expected, the camera remains fixed to the attitude of the vehicle. However, as time passes Kerbin remains in the field of view of the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProblem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would expect that\u00A0in this case, Kerbin would drift off the left edge of the camera plane, and eventually return on the right side of the plane sometime less than one Munar orbit later. The attitude of the vehicle should remain fixed in inertial space, and the camera, being fixed to the attitude of the vehicle should remain pointed at the same location on the skybox. However, by following Kerbin, it seems that the camera is rotating with the orbit of the Mun, and thus the vehicle is also being rotated in the same way. As the vehicle\u0027s attitude should remain the same w.r.t. inertial space rather than the local space of its parent body, this appears to be a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHelp!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone can reproduce this in an unmodded game on the latest version, then this is probably the result of one of my mods causing the issue - likely Mandatory \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s persistent rotation feature.

Kinda frustrating that the altitude extends so far up, as you can\u0027t really have anything stationary at that altitude given the limitations of the game engine. Also doesn\u0027t look like there is a way to modify that without recompiling, so I guess I\u0027m going to have to boost my altitude a bit so I don\u0027t run out of power every 3 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
