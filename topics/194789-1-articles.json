If your 1.0.4 install is messed up bad enuff, to where you are ready to reinstall it, I would suggest grabbing 1.0.5 and trying that. 1.0.5 was the last stable version of the 1.0.x stage, and should probably be used/tried for any mods compatable with 1.0.0-1.0.5, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pusteblume!","CreatedById":110954,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-02T09:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answers and suggestions.
