I want to get back to Kerbin so I can actually have some challenge. *Just go to Minmus, there\u0027s a challenge for ya.* Pfff...been there, done that way too many times. *So why aren\u0027t you asking how to get from Minmus back to Kerbin?* Because the Mun is the first place I landed, so I want it to be the first place I return from. *Why are you saying stuff in the 3rd person in these quotes?* Because I like to answer questions before anyone asks them. Please give me atleast a few tips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T06:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFly up till you are at 800 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck you are in kerbin orbit on map\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn retro so Pe is 30km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeply parachute in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime accelarate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet food\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch tv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEat food\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T06:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet in orbit around the Mun.

I like to set my orbit to actually pass throught atmo at about 40,000m, because you will pick up A LOT of speed during the fall, and the aerobraking will make sure you eventually de-orbit, even if you run out of fuel before fully shedding your velocity.

Anyway, getting back from the moons is much easier than getting to them because Kerbin is a HUGE target. In fact, you never leave its SOI radius, even when you transition to the sub-SOIs of the moons, so all you have to do is de-orbit from wherever you find yourself upon exiting the moon-SOI, and there\u0027s no plane-matching to worry about. The one additional complication of returning from Minmus is that you might get caught by Mun on the way back, but that\u0027s mostly a matter of timing your flight home.\n"}]}
