A trailer (if applicable) detailing what the mod can provide users. These two combined show the effort which is put into mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for some ---\u0026gt; constructive criticism \u0026lt;---, I think squad should note that a lot of fleshed out, decent, high effort and outright amazing mods have NOT been in the spotlight. They should definitely look back at some mods and consider showcasing them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, squad is not \u0022just for fun\u0022, squad is a professional company - star mods shows what Squad can do for the community, and saying they\u0027re doing this \u0022just for fun\u0022 goes against that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m all about fairness proportional to the effort that goes into these community made projects. I would love to see more fairness in future StarMods showcases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-29T02:37:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour feedback has been moved to its own thread.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T18:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue here with \u0022Star Mods\u0022, I feel, is that by a SQUAD representative posting a mod in the \u0022Star Mods\u0022 section on the Official Kerbal Space Program Forums they are pretty much endorsing said mod as being a good, solid representation of what their game is/can be/can do . What has obviously got people upset is that they feel the are mods out there that have been released that haven\u0027t been given endorsement by SQUAD that they feel does represent what KSP is or can potentially be whilst a particular selection are being listed in the \u0022Star Mods\u0022 section that are either not currently \u0027fleshed out\u0027, are of a much lower standard compared to others or could subjectively be argued against being a \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E representation of a mod for Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this being said, I think a simple solution would be to get those who chose the mods that get featured to actively be involved in the \u003Cstrong\u003Eplaying\u003C/strong\u003E community of the game to grasp an understanding and better knowledge of the modded KSP community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: To add to the above point, generally a lot of modders don\u0027t even play the game anymore as they spend most of their time with KSP either coding plugins, doing artwork etc. I don\u0027t see why being a SQUAD member of staff, having to work with the game in a job environment, would be much different. Maybe its time to outsource these decisions to community based members/community based group?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-02T18:34:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2017 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Poodmund\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
