Not only that, but once I have filled the tree, I keep gathering science, as I feel it gives the game a goal, and I find it fun. When the ore/fuel was added, this was an awesome tool, and one thing that was added in particular caught my eye. It was the survey scanner. Put one into a polar orbit, and you can see all the densities of ore on the body in question. My suggestion is this: make a biome scanner of some sort in the same vein, so that science farmers like myself can locate biomes without resorting to cheats. Maybe also a \u0022current biome\u0022 part like the surface scanning module is for ore. Having a reason to put a satellite into orbit long term is very cool to me, and I would love to integrate that idea into the science aspect of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T03:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a cool stock addition, but there are two immediate workarounds that pop into my head: Biome maps, and mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T05:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t already, you ought to give the SCANsat mod a try:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72679-105-scansat-v148-real-scanning-real-science-at-warp-speed-february-10/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...but yeah, I\u0027d really like to see something like this in stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T00:43:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nagree\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T03:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, note that this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222432983\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133087\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456625941\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Radav\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/28/2016 at 6:19 PM, Radav said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe also a \u0022current biome\u0022 part like the surface scanning module is for ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...is actually part of the stock game.\u00A0 The \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Surface_Scanning_Module\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esurface scanning module\u003C/a\u003E tells you what biome you\u0027re over.\u00A0 Even if you\u0027re in orbit.\u00A0 (You have to be down on the surface to use it for ore, but just \u0022what biome am I over\u0022 works from high up.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T09:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the gravioli detector also tells you the biome you\u0027re over.
