You should cease this generous behavior at once\\*.\n\nIt is like you hate us or something.\n\n\\*No, seriously, SQUAD you are awesome. Keeping giving us more. Unity 5 sounds like a horrible pain, but it also sounds like a massive positive overhaul. I like the sound of more effective multithreading.

Typical reentry speeds on Kerbin are sub 3km/s (you can get a bit more when coming back from Minmus, but whatever...) and, with the current drag and heating you\u0027re never going to build up enough speed heat to really damage anything beyond small parts. Jool is entirely different because you\u0027re entering at high speeds (usually much greater that 3km/s) from interplanetary transfer and have to scrub a lot of delta-V to aerocapture, which means your parts are subject to a lot more heating most especially because you\u0027re in a thinner atmosphere for much, much longer than reentry on Kerbin. In fact, it\u0027s pretty safe to say that aerocapture on Jool from an interplanetary transfer would be fairly close to actual reentry here on Earth, at least higher up.\n\u003E So, yeah, it boils down to the fact that Kerbin is stupid tiny, like pretty much everything else in this game.\n\nFair enough - I haven\u0027t gotten far enough to try atmospheric entry or aerobraking at inter planetary missions speeds of 10kms trying to shed 6kms of it in one go - if I can do that but just barely with heatshields then I will consider the atmospheric heating up to snuff ;-)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Aero*capture*, it\u0027s aero*capture*.
