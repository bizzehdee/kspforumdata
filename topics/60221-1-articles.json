But when i started research i noticed that you cant do anything fun in Germany. The biggest thing you can launch on your own would be a rocket with 20g Blackpowder as propellant (ISP only 40-80), with a special course we could use up to 150g, but only premade motors. Its also not possible to buy KNO3 (for R-Candy, a easy to handle Propellant with an ISP of 130) as a private Person, nearly anything related to it is prohibited. So there is no way to do something fun, i planned to launch a rocket with a Raspberry Pi and a camera to do some pics. Is stuff like this prohibited in your country too? In germany its all forbidden due to terror-danger (but the bad guys get their stuff somewhere else) how about e.g. the USA, with their extreme fear of terror?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T10:26:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the netherlands you\u0027re allowed to fly them provided that they don\u0027t carry an explosive charge, they weigh no more than 1.5kg at launch and carry a maximum of 125g of fuel. You\u0027re allowed to launch bigger rockets of up to 35kg launchmass if you manage to get a permit and discuss it with the aviation control. There are some other limited restrictions, but they\u0027re fairly obvious (Don\u0027t fire them next to airports, check for small aircraft before launch etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really wanted to launch something and circumvent the fuel issue you could always use water rockets instead. Sure, the ones made from PET bottles are kiddy material. But they can reach some serious heights when you use a strong and lightweight plastic pipe. If you properly construct the pressure container you can bring it up to something scary like 25 bar. I think the world record was more than half a kilometer height with a camera as payload. They have the added benefit of being completely reusable without requiring new fuel blocks every flight. All you need is some water and a electric socket for the compressor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T10:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eof course under Dutch law the propellant would be an explosive charge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd given that the entire country is effectively a restricted zone because of all the low level airways all over the place, and the rest is taken up by the few circuits available around small airfields, the altitude restrictions make flying them effectively impossible even where legal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T10:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are surprisingly lacks in Denmark\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcF5xNrb3HA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T11:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thiel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thiel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe rules are surprisingly lacks in Denmark\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcF5xNrb3HA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey launch from international water.
