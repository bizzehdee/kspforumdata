It\\\u0027s been a while since Seanoog posted anything about it, but he was reworking the rules we had for the last one (because too many people weren\\\u0027t able to fly a mission when their turn came up) and will start the new \u0027community base\u0027 thread with the stock parts only bases when he can, and I\\\u0027ll put in the second post with the mod parts allowed bases.\n\nBe patient for a little longer and we\\\u0027ll have that set up again, but if you\\\u0027d like to run a separate minmus-only one that\\\u0027s cool too. We\\\u0027re letting you know about that other thread in case you want to use it instead of starting your own, but it\\\u0027s not like there needs to be only one such setup."}]}
