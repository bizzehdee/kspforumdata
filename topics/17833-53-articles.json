Resizing the windows is a no-go as it would just cascade down a whole new set of bigger problems, so that\u0027s out of the question, at least for now. The easiest solution would be to just have the burn time always show on a new line. Also because of how the readouts work, it could possibly be fixed by just making the space flexible.
