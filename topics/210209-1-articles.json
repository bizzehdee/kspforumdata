There is a random fluctuation of more or fewer people ending up with a given surname with every generation, but once a particular surname goes extinct, without someone just legally changing their name, it can\u0027t be brought back. Over time, fewer and fewer surnames remain. This process can be faster or slower depending on cultural norms associated with how surnames are passed to new generations, and it generally takes a really long time, but it is a process that exists. Can it be the cause of kerbals having the same surname? It\u0027s hard to tell. We can look at human civilizations for some examples. While most Western civilizations have relatively recent surnames, In China, surnames go about a thousand years back, and 22% of China\u0027s population share just 3 surnames. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p-Jdjo7sSQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a video that gives an overview.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how long would it take for all of us to have the same surname? Well, if we take the patrilinear tradition as an example, we don\u0027t actually have to guess. There is a concept in genetics of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EY-chromosomal Adam\u003C/a\u003E, a patrilinear ancestor of absolutely every human on Earth. Whoever you are, you are a child of a son, of a son, of a son... of that person. And while it\u0027s hard to be precise, based on mutations on Y-chromosome across the population, it is estimated that the most recent such ancestor has lived as recently as 160,000 years ago or as late as 300,000 years ago. If humanity has invented a concept of surnames all the way back then, stuck to it, and has insisted on strictly passing surnames father to child, we\u0027d all be guaranteed to have the same surname.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is partially the case because the population of humans has been very small, possibly as few as tends of thousands, at one point in time. That was way before any modern surnames existed, so it couldn\u0027t impact us, but if we imagine Kerbal civilization to be very ancient, and that they\u0027ve had some sort of a global catastrophe at some point in the past where their population has been reduced, or if it never exploded in the first place for whatever reason, it is entirely possible that they had a natural extinction of all but one surnames as the result. And, of course, this is all assuming their naming traditions are anything like ours to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-24T05:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224189109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666441120\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222600\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tajwo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/23/2022 at 1:18 AM, tajwo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that..
