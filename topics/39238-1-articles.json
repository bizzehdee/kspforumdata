I have tried making a ship in 2 parts, and assembled it in space. However even though I took this into consideration, the Action Groups of doesn\u0027t seem to effect both parts. For example they both had Toggle Engines on 1 and Toggle Solar Panels on 2. However only 1 ship is reacting to the input.

That way, no matter what ship you\u0027re flying, the action keys do the same thing. I\u0027ll give you an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, these are my constants\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - main engine shutdown (has saved me a couple of unnecessary space station \u0027maneuvers\u0027 and a bunch of flat-spins on my SSTOs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - toggle engine mode on SABRE engines (part from B9 Aerospace)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 - toggle antennae/dishes (great for RemoteTech)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0 - toggle solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK, things like solar panels should sync up on docked ships. i.e. Say you dock ship A with the panels closed, to station B that has them open, pressing \u00270\u0027 in my case, would open the panels on ship A, while pressing \u00270\u0027 a second time would close them all. At least that\u0027s what I remember from .20.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
