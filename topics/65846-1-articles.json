This is because displaying preferential treatment for one particular modification will open up the doors for many other requests for sub-forums such as for kOS, and its derivatives; MechJeb, and its endless support threads and RT2 to name but a few. We would ultimately end up with so many sub-forums that there would, in the end, be no benefit at all. What is the solution to this? Well, if we look at some of the larger KSP modifications, then we can see that some have created sub-reddits, which I personally think is a reasonable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T13:26:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about a sub-forum for custom planets in general?
