Vertical snap is the most valuable \u0022gizmo\u0022 they could have, as it is perfect for so many things like lining up radial decouplers and boosters, centering parts on structural elements, getting the launch clamps into the perfect places all the way around, placing stage separator motors so that they are balanced, placing RCS on symmetrical probes or just needing to keep the center of mass on a sub-assembly near the center etc. and if you want perfectly placed multi-symmetrical onion or asparagus staging, it\u0027s a must. All my rockets fly true when they are based on vertical snaps, and I wouldn\u0027t want to build ships without them.
