Nothing fancy. But i quickly realised that it is really good for training purposes in KSP1.0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only managed to get twice in a 90km orbit around kerbin, after 15\u002B launches and failed most of the time to achieve an orbit at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe i am just bad at this game, but i am playing since .19 i think, so there is at least some basic knowledge in my head \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this craft you have to burn and ascend very effective(i think \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) in order to achieve orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to have 3-5 units LF(and equivalent oxidizer of course) left in 90km orbit, so there is not much room for error \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, try out for yourself if you like.
