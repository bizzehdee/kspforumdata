Whichever ship has the heaviest part, the auto-struts on the other ship will link to those instead. The problem, however, is that the re-configured auto-struts remain in place linking the two ships together even if the ships are later un-linked, meaning that you have two ships that are visually separate but invisibly attached together, making it impossible to move the two apart.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich wouldn\u0027t be so much of a problem if wheels and landing gear weren\u0027t already configured so that they are locked to auto-strut to the heaviest part. I\u0027m not sure why these are set and locked that way, but we need to be able to change that so as to avoid this happening. The option to change autostrut even appears on the context menus for landing gear, but it does absolutely nothing - why even put the option there if they are hard-coded to strut to the heaviest part?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is making planetary and moon-based surface operations nigh on impossible for me since I rely on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E links to refuel landers and pass harvested resources between entities. I\u0027ve had to on-purpose destroy several landers that became locked to my base upon unlinking, because they would not move upon takeoff. Either we need more flexibility in changing auto-strut options, or we need better recognition when two ships are separate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T10:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not a bug.
