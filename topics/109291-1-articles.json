It was much smaller than I\u0027d usually send, the idea being that I would use a pair of drills and an ISRU converter to mine ore out of the asteroid and convert that to fuel to replenish the vessel as necessary. This took longer that I had hoped, but ultimately it did work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I sent another vessel to the surface of Minmus to gather some ore, and I was surprised to discover that the pair of drills appeared to be consuming power at a much higher rate than they did while drilling the asteroid, draining all power in a matter of seconds compared to being able to run them indefinitely at the asteroid. This unit used the same solar panel set up (4 * 1 x 6) as the asteroid vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould being on the surface of Minmus reduce the panel effectiveness enough to cause this? The asteroid is now in orbit of the Mun, per contract requirements, but I can still run the drills indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked the cfg files and there is a difference in the modules for asteroid mining and surface mining in the form of the Efficiency variable, with asteroid being at 10 and surface being at 1, but I would assume that has to do with how much ore it pulls out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T14:18:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T01:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid has like %90 ore and its limited. While surface does have infinite ore, you need to find the red spots to be able to dig efficiently and i think it doesn\u0027t pass %10 since my best find was %9 ore. So what im trying to say is, the less ore there is the more energy drills use and they get overheated alot more. Tho there is a current bug that if you have just a small ammount of electric gain and some batteries then you can just fast forward with 7x or 8x and the power levels will bug which will let you drill infinitely even tho you might have 1e/s this will still work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T01:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 01:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T07:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat n0xiety means is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually you\u0027d think that drills consume a steady amount of power but produce a variable amount of ore depending on the concentration.

That\u0027s how you can get 1/1 ratio between ore mass and fuel mass.
