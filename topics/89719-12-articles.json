I think a shack for Mission Control, a few shacks with a shack-observatory for R\u0026amp;D, another lone shack for Admin, a group of RVs for Astronaut Complex, a flattened out area of dirt surrounded with sandbags as a launch facility, and a bigger shack that\u0027s a horizontal construction facility with train tracks leading to the pad smas the \u0022VAB\u0022. Some dirt paths between them, and you\u0027re all set. It\u0027s humble and not too grandiose. The barn VAB is very grandiose, and not really \u0022humble\u0022 because of its size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I like the KSC in this stage, but the barn is a bit big.

I kind of find it hilarious that some complaints are essentially based off of the premise of the person telling the people \u003Cstrong\u003Ewho made Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E how Kerbals are supposed to behave and think. Being inconsistent doesn\u0027t help (saying that Kerbals are good engineers but don\u0027t care about safety and then immediately go into why they wouldn\u0027t use a wood barn because it\u0027s unsafe springs immediately to mind).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here is my thing: part of the arguments I\u0027ve seen are based around the idea the Kerbals are good at building things, even if they aren\u0027t good at safety. Of course, a lot of that depends on how you play the same. I\u0027m sure there are plays that build rockets that are both models of engineering and safety. I bet \u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E players do not, however. And while the rockets may be models of engineering (and even that is debatable in many cases), there is no guarantee that they will build a rocket that is of sound engineering. Indeed, in many ways engineering and safety go hand in hand. I can still remember some of the complaints about B9\u0027s new KSC and about how it was too nice and spiffy for Kerbals. Now apparently the Kerbal\u0027s tier one primitive space center is now \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E primitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess in short my thoughts are this: if textures are bad and you say so, fine. Perhaps if you have ideas of how to make their general vision of what the Tier 1 space center should look like better, then fine. But I\u0027m kinda shaky on the idea of basically being like \u0022this is not how Kerbals would build a space center, even a Tier 1 one\u0022 because, really, how do we know?
