At low speeds, the reaction wheels are doing... ok. What I have in mind is to create a small snap-on bow thruster that would use the compressed water as a fuel. It would be extremely low thrust and you\u0027d have to set up an on/off toggle. But it would use the FS reverse thrusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly haven\u0027t had time to dig into all the niceties of FS yet. The VTOL mods may be able to do exactly that. I don\u0027t think, however that spinning props and gimbals work together. I\u0027d have to dig into it a bit when I get time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the bitts, I think you mean the blisters, which are the flotation devices. To be honest, I haven\u0027t dug into FS buoyancy either yet. Originally, I set out to make submarines and the blisters were designed to mimic the effect air intakes have, lots of buoyancy. The bitts were originally conceived as submarine ballast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how the story goes. I found this old mod called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/5805-Gaby-s-Submarine-P-O-C-%28Download-Fixed%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGaby\u0027s Submarine Parts\u003C/a\u003E. He used GOBS of monopropellant to sink parts and turn them into submarines. I attempted to duplicate his efforts in a more current version of KSP. While the parts did sink, his method for propulsion (Incredible amounts of thrust) would send any vessel you attached his engines to, on an escape trajectory out of the system... instantly. It was a Kraken moment. So, I began tinkering with things, making an actual resource (Compressed Water) instead of using monopropellant. And another super light resource (designed to mimic intake air) to attempt to act as buoyancy. Then, creating a water compressor mod, etc. While I achieved the same ability to sink parts, I couldn\u0027t overcome the drag caused by the mass needed to sink them. But what I did find out was I could float parts really well without air intakes. So, I made boats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a tad of a long story but, to answer your question, the Bitts and Blisters were thought up long before I even knew how to access FS modules. And while I do plan to play with FS buoyancy, everything has been working pretty well without it so I haven\u0027t had a good excuse to start tinkering with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since I\u0027m already posting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have acquired the secrets of part animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECurrently in testing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Clipper RoRo (Roll-on/Roll-off)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TABLE=width: 900, align: center]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/RoRoTest1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RoRoTest1.jpg\u0022\u003E[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Designed to handle small to mid sized vehicles, the Clipper RoRo Bow will feature a drop deck loading ramp.

Adding a bow thruster or gimballed engines under the waterline, if they\u0027re surface mount, will add even more drag. On an aircraft, drag isn\u0027t a huge issue. On a ship, it\u0027s like an anchor. So, I have to be very careful the number of non-flotation items (small volume) that I add. FS Buoyancy may fix that and FS has been around long enough that I\u0027m pretty sure that someone would pick up the reigns should it\u0027s dev drop it. But, I\u0027ve seen so many mods vanish that I\u0027m hoping to stay pretty independent.

The next update to the Maritime Pack will be out sometime tomorrow. Before I release it, here\u0027s a brief sketch of what to expect from the RoRo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completed testing tonite and I took it to a physical extreme. I built a 16.5 ton rover with a really odd shape. While the weight wasn\u0027t a huge issue, trying to get that long nosed thing aboard the RoRo was a challenge all in itself. I kept ramming it into the ramp, flipping it over, shoving the ship around, etc. So, I devised a technique or two that you should take a look at before you attempt to load your first really heavy vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If it weights more than the boat, run the nose aground and put on some compressed water. I\u0027ll give you a lower waterline. Any time there\u0027s more weight above the water line than below it, you\u0027ve got to work harder to keep things balanced. Consider adding outriggers or moving the blisters onto the sides of the ship at or just below the planned waterline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Any time two vehicles collide, including driving up a ramp, things start to wobble around. One really helpful trick that works is to convert the davit into a windlass mount. I mounted 4 KAS winches on the nose of the RoRo on the davit. Two with anchors and two with harpoons. Harpoons don\u0027t work in water but, when you run the nose of the RoRo aground, harpoon the beach. It\u0027ll keep the ship from wanting to move backward when you drive up the ramp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make sure any docking is done prior to pulling off the beach. Docking on land causes some crazy physics. Also, make sure that whatever docking method you use, (KAS pipes or docking ports) that you have the docking connector on the center of mass of the vehicle you\u0027re transporting. If you dock on the end, the other end will sink through the hull of the boat, if it\u0027s heavy enough. If you\u0027ve been playing a while, you already know that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some pics of the final test, delivering this ugly, heavy vehicle to the island runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck back tomorrow evening US time for the new release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/RoRoTest4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RoRoTest4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/RoRoTest5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RoRoTest5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/RoRoTest6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RoRoTest6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll note I had on some compressed water.

The last \u0027rework\u0027 the texture didn\u0027t unwrap correctly and I was too tired/lazy to fix it before the release. So, the Yacht gets a minor texture update, which I\u0027m still not overjoyed with, but it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/lights.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lights.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T05:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you get the boats into the water though without having to build something to move it to the water?

If I had to drive every test boat to the water, this mod probably wouldn\u0027t even be released yet and I may have even given up in frustration before getting started. Before I became a modder, I did a lot of challenges. I participated and I created and almost without fail, hyperedit was considered cheating. When playing the game for fun, I\u0027d have to agree. When using the game to create mods, it\u0027s a huge time saver. So I\u0027m guessing, one of the big things that will keep a lot of people from using this mod is getting the boat to water.

Just pay the rental fee and we\u0027ll slap some glue on it and you adhere it to the bottom of your Clipper. And don\u0027t worry about picking them up when you\u0027re done. We\u0027re sure some tree-hugging Kerbal will complain about all the trash on the beach and when we promptly ignore them, they\u0027ll form a community action group and clean them all up.
