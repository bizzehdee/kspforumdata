Eh, doable with a bit of practice. Getting back? Easy, yay airbrakes!. Landing? Have fun with that... plane\u0027s unstable when low on fuel, you have no choice but to land at ridiculous speeds (very little wing surface), the plane does cartwheels if you try to use the airbrakes to help with landing, etc, etc. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:30:53Z","Content":"Ah.
