It was occurring after I used HullCam (in particular the Ordan telescope) and after I had loaded a different ship without any cameras. Did some testing and figured out what caused it: I left the telescope zoomed in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re zoomed in sufficiently and jump to the map view, planet textures will flicker. Zoom back out and they go back to normal. The aerocam doesn\u0027t zoom enough to do that, but the Ordan (and the Cacteye mod telescope) do this. So, if you get flickering in map view, make sure you\u0027ve zoomed out all the way before you jump away from the ship or you\u0027ll be stuck with it until you restart!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T17:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the models and idea of cameras, I just wish it would show the camera view in a window rather than changing the screen view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T02:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt says your working on a camera that can move eventually?
