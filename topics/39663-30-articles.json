Clipping the boosters in is something any person can do from within the VAB, with stock parts and configs, with stock gizmos. What you are doing to the boosters is altering their performance to suit your craft. What you have done is literally no different than using a modded booster with more fuel. That modded booster may not load in a stock game, but it would never be considered stock even if it did.

No mods required. File is saved, and usable by anyone. No editing necessary. Heck in the Editor you can even empty out the fuel with the slider and return it to pre-edit levels. The extra mass is accounted for by the game physics. One still has to design proper booster placement since now with the extra fuel (represented by the empty fuselages) they are heavier. It\u0027s a design trick to get around a stock KSP limitation until Squad pushes out booster extensions. Only the CoM suffers since it doesn\u0027t change. I think for boosters at least, that\u0027s a legitimate compromise. Of course, editing to give more fuel than the model would support, is cheating, but if your model intends for it via empty tanks or fuselages of any kind, then it\u0027s not really cheating.
