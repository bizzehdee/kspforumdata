Like a barometer\u0027s pressure display or a motor\u0027s RPM or a servo\u0027s angle or a cockpit\u0027s radar altitude being used to control the thrust limiter on a rocket engine or something. Maybe even going nuts and allowing advanced tweakables to turn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E of a wing surface or prop blade or something into an axis group. Even Wheel stress or a part\u0027s\u00A0overheat level or similar\u00A0could be useful in certain situations as an axis group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-03T11:21:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2020 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T17:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI very much agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine if the scientific instruments were actually useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thermometer could turn on and off a bank of drills when they begin to overheat, or deploy solar panels when the sun hits it. Landing gear could auto-deploy at altitude. A barometer would be required for parachutes to auto-deploy. The seismic accelerometer could trigger aborts. Maybe the atmospheric scanner could be repurposed as an angle-of-attack sensor to use as a rudimentary glide angle autopilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlocking the ability to use most part outputs to trigger action groups like you suggest could literally be a game changer - especially with the robotic parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Challyss","CreatedById":189162,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-18T04:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that\u0027s so likely to be a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd.... there are mods for that.
