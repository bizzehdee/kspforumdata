They would compete for high achievement contracts like getting to orbit, exploring x celestial body, building base or station on x, and if they completed one of these contracts first, the rewards for them would decrease significantly. Their rockets wouldn\u0027t really need to appear in the game, but it would be cool if permanent stuff like satellites, base, or stations, would appear when they completed a related contract. The rate at which they complete contacts would preferably be fair and semi-randomized depending on the players progress (They can\u0027t get to jool if the player hasn\u0027t gotten to the mun yet) and the difficult settings, but fast enough to encourage doing multiple flights at once. It would also be nice if this mod, if someone makes, would alter contract a little to fit the concept a bit better and have support for other mods, like remote tech, mission controller, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if someone has already made a mod like this or suggested it, I didn\u0027t find anything relating to this while searching the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T01:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would require some form of AI programming.
