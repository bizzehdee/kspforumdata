Below 70, there\u0027s a very good chance of being captured by the atmosphere into a surface descent, unless you know for sure that you have enough speed going in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my rules of thumb are 80 for a little braking, 70 for a lot of braking, roughly. Of course, if you start from something low like 100x100, even 80 will probably schedule an appointment with the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
