Iwe been able to import most of squads models into blender with it but its far from bug free. A few things to remember is to always have the .mu referenced textures in the same folder as the .mu. sometimes squad has renamed or removed some textures from the folder even tho they are still referenced by the .mu. this confuses the mu importer. What you can do is open the .mu in notepad\u002B\u002B and eather remove the texture reference or just create a blank texture with that name in the folder(youll find it in the last few lines in the mu).

It\u0027s also possible the Poodle is pressure fed (like SPS, indeed any of the AJ10 line). Incredibly important for these, however, would be if you could vastly extend the nozzle lengths; vacuum engines have far larger nozzles than sea-level engines for their thrust (consider the Apollo SPS\u0027s nozzle: at 90kN it was twice as wide at the base as the H-1 which developed over ten times that thrust). The 909\u0027s nozzle should end up probably a full 1.25m wide (and the Poodle a full 2.5m wide), though maintaining the narrow throats...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh excellent, thanks.
