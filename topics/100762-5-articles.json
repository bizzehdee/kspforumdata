If you close the window and open it again it fixes itself.\n\nI\u0027ll work on fixes once I get my other mods working in 1.1\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-22T05:18:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2016 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T09:53:03Z","Content":"[@JPLRepo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/114736-jplrepo/) thanks for the reply.  The non-existing Kerbals are neither Dead nor Missing.\n\nI just now discovered, they were formerly Tourists.

Calmy, Gerisa, and Jebcas (all formerly Tourists) have similar bios.  However, in the Astronaut Complex, none of these appear as Available/Assigned/Missing.\n\nHere\u0027s one from a contract I have not yet accepted.  So, should not be created at all.  Listed by RM as a Scientist.\n\n    KERBAL  \n\n        {  \n\n            name = Cordon Kerman  \n\n            gender = Male  \n\n            type = Unowned  \n\n            trait = Scientist  \n\n            brave = 0.7340253  \n\n            dumb = 0.1801908  \n\n            badS = False  \n\n            tour = False  \n\n            state = Assigned  \n\n            ToD = 0  \n\n            idx = -1  \n\n            CAREER\\_LOG  \n\n            {  \n\n                flight = 0  \n\n            }  \n\n            FLIGHT\\_LOG  \n\n            {  \n\n                flight = 0  \n\n            }  \n\n        }\n\nHere\u0027s the creation from the contract:\n\n            RMKerbal  \n\n            {  \n\n                lastUpdate = 18120067.2998191  \n\n                Name = Cordon Kerman  \n\n                status = Assigned  \n\n                type = Unowned  \n\n                vesselID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000  \n\n                VesselName =   \n\nFinally, in RM, all these non-existent Kerbals have yellow-colored font, indicating Assigned, but they are Available.\n\nBottom line:  Roster Manager is CORRECT by listing them, but KSP is INCORRECT by changing them from Tourists to Pilot/Engineer/Scientist.  I\u0027ll log that as a bug in the Squad Bug Tracker; I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll ignore it or call it intentional.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-22T10:03:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2016 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13**"}]}
