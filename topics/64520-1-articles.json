So after a few abortive attempts at Blender which resulted in the kind of design that should be drowned at birth, I decided to draw on a napkin at work(aren\u0027t those always the best designs?).\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/czKnzF7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022czKnzF7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea would be to keep a very low part count, so ideally it will consist of only 6-8 parts i.e. Fuselage,right and left winglets ,docking port,two oms engines. The OMS engines would be R.C.S fueled so they can share the same internal R.C.S. tanks as the thrusters. The shuttle will seat 2 Kerbals in a tandem configuration with hopefully RPM displays(2), as a place holder the MK2 cockpit IVA could be used as config is similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle, when fueled would weigh in at around 1.8 tonnes and due to it\u0027s size will fit in a 2.5m fairing which makes it much easier to launch especially for FAR uses.

Many plans for \u0022lifeboat\u0022 style mini-lifting bodies don\u0027t, because if its a lifeboat, it\u0027ll only be used once. It\u0027s up to you, obviously, but would cut your part count (and difficulty) substantially. Maybe at least while you get a test-version up for people to use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Weka was hard to integrate into other things. It couldn\u0027t be stack mounted, which means it doesn\u0027t fit in the subassembly manager... And for my money, any parts that can be mixed-and-matched with other mods are great. So I would say, make the body somewhat capsule-like. It can do double duty as a capsule for larger space planes, or a standard docking port on the back can complete your idea for a mini-shuttle. (Not necessarily needing to make a docking port saves you some effort too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Weka was so easy to fly. Please, even if you\u0027re using a textureless, ugly, half finished model, start play testing soon, so that the engines fire in line with the center of mass, the RCS is balanced and manouvers correctly, etc...
