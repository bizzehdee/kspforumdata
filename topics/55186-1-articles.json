Meaning Kerbin in space and nothing else, maybe the sun and mun just so there is something for orbits. I feel like this could help modders out with testing certain parts and video makers could probably benefit from this a lot as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to run KSP in the unity editor? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I really am asking for is a Unity Editor file of KSP (or at least Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is way out in left field and unreasonable (or just wrong to do) be nice in letting me know, and forgive my ignorance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Marcuzzi\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Marcuzzi","CreatedById":77137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T20:36:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPatience Marcuzzi, one of these nibbles will turn into a bite.

I guess I was attempting to ask for a non detailed super basic version. Like a sphere around another sphere with no detail (or even color). This would be for the modders, figuring out GPS, grid maps and such systems may become easier. Then transfer what is learned to KSP itself. I could be way off though.

I was just thinking that not loading ALL of KSP and it\u0027s extras might eliminate some of the head scratching at the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no modder but I have tried a few times and having something like I suggested would have been helpful.
