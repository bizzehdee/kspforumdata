It didn\u0027t actually significantly affect my design constraints, it just increased my build time. The way I design, I eliminate torque from thrust if at all possible. The reason I include reaction wheel modules (and I do still use the boxsat reaction wheel module sometimes) is to have an agile craft that is easy to reorient. So what I so when building with boxsat is to simply place other parts on the craft in places to as precisely counteract the mass imbalance as possible. This means that the only real effect of the stack node offset is to add 20 or 30 seconds to the time to place one or two parts on my satellite, and make me re-do that any time I change my satellite design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, it\u0027s annoying instead of interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T22:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi love this mod just 1 little request would it be possible to get a little more angle on the hinged dish it seems to point down rather than straight or angled back reason I ask is i build small science and communication landers and the dish angles down instead of pointing back a bit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Eh4PByL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Eh4PByL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-25T22:32:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2015 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Virtualgenius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Salanmander","CreatedById":108636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T15:00:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey need (well, \u0022need\u0022...from the same perspective as they should point up) to point towards the little knob at the top of the post, because that\u0027s the receiver.
