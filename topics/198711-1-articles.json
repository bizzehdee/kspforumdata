My problem is that I can load my worlds (albeit slowly) and open the launchpad and set a target in map view, but the moment I try engaging the autopilot in MechJeb (or pausing the game\u2014that seems to cause the same problem) the game freezes and I have to force close it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running it from Steam with the \u003Cem\u003E-force-glcore\u003C/em\u003E launch option so the game doesn\u0027t run out of memory (I have 16gb RAM and my PC\u0027s specs should not be a bottleneck).\u00A0 I\u0027ve attached my Player.log, KSP.log, and a video with the replication steps here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z8024cpf160fjlq/AABq_k5UnXyunaHYc75tk_cKa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/z8024cpf160fjlq/AABq_k5UnXyunaHYc75tk_cKa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E. (Note that the video has like entire minutes of nothing happening; this was actually during the loading screens. Sorry for the choppy video. It didn\u0027t look that bad from my end.) I\u0027m trying to launch Raidernick\u0027s Luna 13 into Earth orbit at the lunar plane of orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m confused because this worked before (about a month ago) without major issues, but trying it now the game pretty much always freezes up. Even funnier is that the \u003Cem\u003Eone time\u003C/em\u003E I record my screen to show it, it actually doesn\u0027t freeze the first time around! It did freeze when I disengaged and re-engaged the autpilot though, so the problem really is still there. I know I\u0027m not running out of RAM or anything because when I open the task manager nothing is excessively full (the RAM sits around 70% full when the game is running).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d really appreciate it if you guys could give me a hand with getting my game functional again. I know \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E works for the people who use it so I\u0027m kinda sad that it doesn\u0027t seem to be working for me..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
