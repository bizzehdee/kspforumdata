I use a MacBook Pro and have installed a control panel extension called \u003Ca href=\u0022magicprefs.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMagic Prefs\u003C/a\u003E. It lets you define what you want the middle mouse button click to be, and more generally lets you configure your trackpad/mouse in all sorts of interesting ways. Personally, I\u0027ve set up a triple-click (3 fingered click) to function as a middle-click. Another similar software product is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.boastr.net\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBetter Touch Tool\u003C/a\u003E and there are probably more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also read on an Apple forum that [command]-click is supposed to work like a center mouse button, but it was a very old post so I don\u0027t know if it still does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T17:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes thank you!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
