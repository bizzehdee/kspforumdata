I managed to land on Mun after many tries only to discover that the decoupler on top did nothing but go \u0022poof\u0022. The rover didn\u0027t separate. I had put the decoupler on the rover so that doesn\u0027t seem to work. But I can\u0027t see how to attach a decoupler to the top of the command pod either. Any help on these things would be greatly appreciated because I\u0027ve spent days on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother: is it possible to have two saves (not subassemblies) in the VAB at once and join them up?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T00:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your decoupler went *poof* then it separated. Since your vessel was probably built from the command pod, the pod is the \u0022root\u0022 item and when you disconnect, it is what you control. You need to switch vessels (square bracket right or left) to control the part that you discarded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(edit: if it really failed to separate, then perhaps during the build you clipped it into another part (happens all the time) or you missed the connection node and connected it to the part lying under the decoupler (this can also happen)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the VAB, it\u0027s a bit tricky. Yes you can build a rover, for example, and save it then start building your main rocket as a new item. Then click \u0022load\u0022 and select your pre-saved rover but click \u0022merge\u0022 instead. The rover will appear as a floating, unconnected part, and you can add it to your main rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that the nodes for connecting this \u0022merged\u0022 entity are much more restrictive than if you simply had an ordinary part floating around your build. You really need to experiment to see what will or will not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-20T00:19:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2015 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackBush","CreatedById":149535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T01:01:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s great, thanks!
