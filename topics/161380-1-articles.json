So I mounted them to the fuselage (which spread the load over multiple connections) and then offset them\u00A0to look like they where under the wing and that worked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to try (although it\u0027s an even more hacky solution) is to use the debug menu and use hack gravity to reduce the gravity, and then gradually increase it back to normal once the physics has loaded. \u00A0That might get you loaded on the runway ok, but doesn\u0027t really answer the underlying problem of why it\u0027s exploding in the first place. A plane should be able to take a reasonably rough landing so you might have to re think how the weight is spread over the wheels. But at least with the hack gravity to help during loading,\u00A0you can try taking off and landing again with normal gravity and see if it can withstand a landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-01T03:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the original question: long ago, there were problems with craft sometimes spawning partly below the surface of Kerbin, and exploding. \u00A0A little starting offset into the air is the kludge that fixed that problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the rest -\u00A0my planes never explode on physics start. \u00A0Can we see a pic of the problem craft?
