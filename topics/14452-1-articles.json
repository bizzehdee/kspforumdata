The problem is about three minutes into the flight the middle engines stop firing, but the outer ones continue. I\\\u0027ve placed pumps in various places to try and supply the central ones to no avail. It doesn\\\u0027t matter too much (it gets into orbit fine) but the problem still niggles me. Do any of you have any suggestions? I don\\\u0027t know why each engine won\\\u0027t use the four tanks above it when I take all the pipes away - they seem to insist on transferring fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mu2Sf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mu2Sf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jRBfS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jRBfS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2rdTG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222rdTG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the .craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?hucoyt9qv7hut79\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?hucoyt9qv7hut79\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, sorry if the answer is painfully obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-17T00:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot obvious, no. Even though fuel tanks aren\\\u0027t marked as crossfeed-capable, they will feed fuel from parent tanks to child tanks (i.e. in the order you attached the tanks) if they are connected to each other. So, the middle ones stop firing because all the engines are draining from the center tanks at first and those run out quickly, but only the outer engines can drain from the outer tanks (and fuel pipes won\\\u0027t fix things because the game doesn\\\u0027t allow circular flows). You\\\u0027ll have to put something that doesn\\\u0027t feed fuel between the inner and outer columns, for example a structural pylon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-17T00:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Efrom parent tanks to child tanks \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIs \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003E why this happens?
