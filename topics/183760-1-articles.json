Its just clutter to show every ground station, and already found anomaly. I suggest that if an anomaly is Known, a \u0022K\u0022 should be displayed instead of a \u0022?\u0022. Known anomalies would be the space center (and alternate launch sites \u002B ground stations if enabled), and those anomalies which have already triggered the \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 rewards - clearly KSP is already tracking which ones are known and which aren\u0027t\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2) When discovered, an icon should be added to the map, the current method of spamming waypoints is less than ideal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3) Increase detection chance to 100%. Currently starting with the early probes that have a 6% chance per day of detecting an anomaly requires that you fly over an area (and click refresh) 11 times (once per game-day, clicking multiple times per game-day is no help) to have a 50% chance of detecting it. This is a tedious click fest. Instead the higher level probe cores should give greater precision. Suppose early probe cores locate the anomaly to somewhere within 20km, and higher level ones will locate it to within 500m... or something like that. Perhaps modified by the FOV, and orbital height, so if you launch an early probe into a low orbit that passes over the anomaly detected from high orbit, you can refine its position\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#4) Give rewards once the tech tree is finished. AFAIK, every body with a solid surface has one of these. Finding the ones on Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus when you have only 1000 science point tech left to unlock makes them rather large rewards... But suppose you finish the tech tree before arriving at duna, and locate one there... rewards: nothing. I would propose that after the tech tree is complete, you gain 1000 science points, modified by whatever strategies you have in place (such as science to funding, or science to Rep).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout changes, I think this feature will continue to be neglected by the playerbase because its simply far too much babysitting of a probe and clicking, to wait for an RNG to show you an anomaly (that you then have to sort out if its one that you already found), just to unlock one tech, when getting science from biomes on Mun and Minmus is less of a grind and more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xurkitree","CreatedById":187694,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-15T08:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would prefer a more ScanSat system in place - if you leave a probe core to scan the surface, it eventually compiles a rough map of anomalies.

When an anomaly is detected, it would roll an RNG twice: once for a direction (in degrees), and once for a distance (from 0-0.5 km). So say it rolls 91 degrees and 0.35 km: For a probe with an accuracy rating of 1, the waypoint would actually be placed 350 meters due east (91 degrees compass heading) of the actual anomaly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an early probe with an accuracy rating of 0.1, the distance would be divided by the accuracy rating: 350 meters / 0.1 = 3.5 km: A really bad probe with an accuracy rating of 0.05 would be off by 7km... and could be off by as much as 10km, or \u0022right on the money\u0022 depending on the RNG roll. So the worst Early probe would give you a roughly 10km search radius for the anomaly, and a late probe drops this down to 500 meters (perhaps 500 meters should be changed to 1 km... numbers open to tweaking).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could further see modifying this by orbital height as a % of the low/high space boundary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for kerbin, that border is 250km. A probe at 250km would have its error multiplied by 250/250 = 1... Whereas a probe orbiting at 500 km would have its margin of error doubled (500/250), and a probe that detects the anomaly from a low-ish orbit of 125 km would have its error margin halved... so using the numbers above, an early probe detecting an anomaly from an 80km orbit would have a maximum error of 80/250* 0.5km /0.05 = 3.2 km. I would give such an early probe a fairly narrow view range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo early on, you could put a probe into high orbit to view the entire surface of kerbin at once (lets say with its FOV, that happens at 500km), and your maximum error is 20km, which could make a search from the surface quite hard.... so you launch a 2nd probe to pass over that area from low orbit, and get a pretty good fix on the location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAgreed on giving them rewards as well, although I feel like you should have to visit them to get the rewards (were you already implying this?).
