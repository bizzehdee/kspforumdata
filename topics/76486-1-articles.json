And while it used to be standard procedure to just automatically do a tonsillectomy any time someone had it, at least in the US, by the late 1980s, that was no longer the case--when I had it back then, the doctor explained that it was now recognized that the tonsils had an important purpose (they help catch things falling down the esophagus that could cause infections) and that tonsillitis was actually them doing their job properly by keeping an infection from getting further into the gastrointestinal tract. So, instead of a tonsillectomy, he prescribed bedrest, lots of fluids (which were about all I could swallow at the time, anyway), and antibiotics to help fight the infection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill have my tonsils today, as a result...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T14:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs rdfox noted, all that means is inflammation.
