Similar in function to a warp drive. It has two speeds only. Lightspeed and a lightyear per hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe catch is how the ST drive works... it will translate indefnitely without refueling UNLESS you are within a 100 kilometer range of a mass that has more mass than your vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrust me, that is generally not a good thing, since the only way to stop translating would be to leave your starship. With shuttles or escape pods, which would be stranded in deep space while the starship continues merrily chugging along translating/warping space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you start translation across space the direction you translate/warp to will be the same direction as your current trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, if you are orbiting Earth and turn on translation then to viewers you will appear to shoot out of orbit at lightspeed, even though you are moving space... not your ship. If you went out at max translation (LY per hour) they would just see you gone in a blink.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nResults: Careful planning is required, since you need to know the trajectories and speeds of target destinations BEFORE you arrive. Otherwise you will travel indefinitely at warp, leaving with you with two options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Adjust your warp speed to lightspeed when passing through solar systems and hope a mass greater than your vessel\u0027s mass drops you out of warp. But space is BIG, and the radius to mass lock (drop out of warp) your warp drive is relatively small (100 kilometers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Abandon ship inside a solar system while warping near a planet at lightspeed. Your starship is gone but maybe you can make it with shuttlecraft to this alien planet over there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain question for discussion: Without FTL sensors... how in the world do you navigate to places you have not been before? Assuming you have not sent ships to scout ahead of you. You are the scout!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek new resources for your civilization, discover new worlds and cosmic phenomena, and boldly go where no human has gone before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus question: Where do you choose to go? You have a total of 3 solar systems to explore before returning to Earth, alternately you can trade one solar system visit to explore cosmic phenomena (black holes, novas, pulsars etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-29T07:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave multiple of those highly impractical drives and dump them as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-29T07:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223762920\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585467146\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave multiple of those highly impractical drives and dump them as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould work actually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarp staging... who knew LOL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am still wondering if any of you are witty enough to figure a way to acomplish single stage warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing it in the home solar system is straightforward enough\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight years away with light lag coming into play?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-29T07:43:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2020 07:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-29T07:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetach the drive, it stops warping because the rest of the ship is bigger than the drive, the ship stops warping because it doesn\u0027t have the drive, then come back and pick it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-29T07:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223762922\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585467823\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetach the drive, it stops warping because the rest of the ship is bigger than the drive, the ship stops warping because it doesn\u0027t have the drive, then come back and pick it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClever.

Which way is the ship accelerating? And you can\u0027t say \u0022same direction as the ship moving.\u0022 If you\u0027re riding a bike due North and I\u0027m passing you by on a car going faster, you\u0027re going North relative to a person standing on a sidewalk, and you\u0027re moving south relative to the car. Would accelerating in the same direction be accelerating North or South? We can still talk about bike speeding up or slowing down in absolute quantities, because we take motion relative to the ground for granted.\u00A0You don\u0027t have that in space. Just within Solar System the planets are moving fast enough to make that relevant as I\u0027ve illustrated above. Are you accelerating in direction you\u0027re moving\u00A0relative to planet you\u0027re departing or planet you\u0027re arriving at? Because that can be almost exactly opposite directions.

These engines operate in two modes, one where the propellant is heated by the reactor and expanded through a nozzle (achieves high efficiency) and one where the hot propellant has oxygen injected to burn it and provide additional thrust (higher thrust but much lower efficiency).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, if you increase the molecular weight of the propellant of a nuclear thermal engine, you lose efficiency but gain thrust. NERVA was an engine in the 50\u0027s that used hydrogen at ~950 Isp and had a thrust to weight ratio of 5, however a much more modern study into the technology predicted that with new methods and materials we could build hydrogen-fueled NTRs with thrust to weight ratio around 20 to 30 and slightly improved Isp compared to NERVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing methane as a propellant in an NTR engine that achieves 1000 Isp using hydrogen gets you ~600 Isp, which still makes it much more efficient than a hydrolox chemical engine. It also increases the mass flow considerably, so an engine that achieves 25 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E using hydrogen may achieve 50 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or more using methane. This is comparable with an average chemical engine, while still performing much better in terms of Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, an after-burning NTR can\u0027t get as efficient as a chemical engine using the same propellants, simply because the NTR cannot achieve the same chamber pressures as a chemical engine. After-burning mode is tailored towards increasing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E significantly in order to get off the pad and fight gravity losses quickly, until such time in the flight profile that it can be shut off and the remainder of the delta V be supplied without using any oxidizer. Using an after-burning design makes more sense if your primary mode supplies a very low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, like NERVA did. However, if your NTR can achieve 20 or 30 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E using hydrogen, and comparable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E as a chemical engine when using methane, and the entire time gets you an Isp roughly two to three times higher, then a bimodal methane-hydrogen NTR makes more sense IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, after-burning NTRs are an old idea brought about to give nuclear thermal engines a high enough thrust to weight ratio that they could be useful during all phases of launch, and not only as upper stages. However, improvements in materials and nuclear science in the decades since NERVA suggest that nuclear thermal engines can achieve useful thrust-to-weight ratio for launch without afterburners, and that a bimodal engine that can switch in flight from using methane to using hydrogen would be superior to any after-burning NTR of any propellant combination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\nRead More\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022padding:4px 0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#878a8c;font-size:24px;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#787c7e;font-size:12px;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;\u0022\u003E\n39\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#878a8c;font-size:20px;padding:4px 0px;text-align:center;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#787c7e;font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EReply\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-30T02:27:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2020 02:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-30T04:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223763274\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585533852\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForget the trajectory thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint starship\u0027s nose in the direction you want to translate and translate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile translating you go in a linear path, lightspeed or a lightyear per hour are your options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat works.

You feel the workout (gravity) but you\u00A0go nowhere. Until you drop out of warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeat little trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem with this approach is that you continue increasing ship\u0027s momentum. First of all, it means you have to keep increasing your warp/translation speed, which might require energy or could even saturate. Second, once you drop out, you will have all that momentum, so now you\u0027re not at rest anymore, unless you spent equal amount of time \u0022slowing down\u0022. That\u0027s inconvenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s a way to fix this. Suppose, you didn\u0027t have warp, but did have that\u00A0thruster that you can burn \u0022for free\u0022 for a constant 1g. You could put your ship into a circular trajectory, using your engines to accelerate towards the center constantly. It\u0027s just like being parked on a very large rotating station, minus the station.\u00A0You\u0027re still rotating the ship, but you don\u0027t need counterweights or moving parts. But now, with warp/translation you can do even better. Using translation you can keep your ship put while it\u0027s momentum keeps turning in a circle. So effectively, instead of translating along a line, you\u0027re translating along the circle at a constant rate. It does mean that the ship still needs to rotate to point its engine in different directions, but if effective orbit you are compensating for would have been hundreds of kilometers in diameter, the rotation of the ship can be very, very slow. Say, one revolution per day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-30T22:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223763704\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585602937\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem with this approach is that you continue increasing ship\u0027s momentum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally?
