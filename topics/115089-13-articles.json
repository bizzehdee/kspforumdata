KER would have solved those SRB choices but as Slashy figures there are only a few permutations due to your engine variety.  TWR for me was the first item I looked at.\n\nWelcome to the clan, Caithloki. Ugh!\n\nJust to let everyone know the Caveman Challenge 1.0.5 will continue on a new thread.  The first thing I need to do is finish the challenge in 1.0.5\n\nMy laptop was having thermal issues.  **[I fixed it using a hammer and copper](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127146-satellite-p300-thermal-solution/#comment-2311495)**\n\n![t5RcJcX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/t5RcJcX.jpg)\n\nI am running another test and if all goes well then it looks as if I will play KSP tomorrow![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-07T04:30:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2015 04:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T22:49:44Z","Content":"Jetski,\n\n Congratulations on successfully completing the Caveman Challenge!\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T05:02:40Z","Content":"After having a glorious binge on KSP, I completed the Caveman Challenge 1.0.5 today.  The **[album](http://imgur.com/a/MCp3D)** will also be posted in the new KSP Caveman Challenge 1.0.5 thread.\n\nI was trying to figure a way to verify the challenge entrant.  The mission summary or the science archives  indicate what was done to earn the 1188 science and can readily indicate a successful applicant.\n\nAlso I am thinking of keeping the original badge.\n\n![caveman_zpsuxvcg0eo.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Caveman%20challenge/caveman_zpsuxvcg0eo.jpg)\n\nHope that I can maintain this challenge properly.
