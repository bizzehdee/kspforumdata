Are you willing to post your failure for criticism? How are we to believe it\u0027s game error and not user error? I help at least one person a week who admits they didn\u0027t know the game as well as they thought. I\u0027m not saying this is you... but would you be willing to share your work?

Yeah, it should be faster to get to your final iteration in 1.0, but saying you can\u0027t \u0022just build\u0022 an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and have it work is a bit of a stretch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery craft has it\u0027s own challenges. Add to that KSP2 will always feel different than KSP1. You can build a large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and have it work. Especially if you know the parts and game well (that is to say you know it well enough in its current state).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bigger issue for me is large vessels and the part lag. At 400 parts, doesn\u0027t matter what parts they are for me, the game starts to lag seriously; every iteration from that point (for now in Early Access) is an effort in trying to make the best choices to reduce the number of iterations before launch. It just takes too long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-05T20:19:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try and post a screenshot on this thread when I am finished.\u00A0 I do not like to post half-built or broken things.\u00A0 Further, I have not posted the \u0022cheatbirds\u0022 craft files in the past because they require mods to function correctly.\u00A0 My mods edit the game files directly and those cannot be ethically posted so I would need to direct someone on modding the files manually which I do not mind doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood question on why I need 80 ton wings - why are the default wings that heavy?\u00A0 Every time I try to make a \u0022large\u0022 wing larger than you can make with the \u0022small\u0022 wing they turn out very heavy.\u00A0 Though like I said modding the density was the key.\u00A0 I tried to keep the game balance the same by modding the density of the small wings also but their initial weight is kept lower.\u00A0 Now the same large wings weigh about 6-7 tons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as failing, by that standard everything I have made is a failure.\u00A0 I have a certain visual standard and look that I go for that as just as important as anything else.\u00A0 In terms of performance I also push for 50k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E but I have had to settle for less since we have such bad technology right now.\u00A0 For instance this Thunderbird Bomber with wings as wide as the runway has 33K \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E (modded).\u00A0 You only need like 3K \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to qualify for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E status.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the subject of struts that is a tradeoff you make when you spend less time building a creation.\u00A0 Sometimes less struts is better than more struts.\u00A0 When you focus time on deciding exactly which strut is necessary or not you can trim the design down.\u00A0 I cannot imagine a 400 part design could not afford to lose a strut here or there.\u00A0 This Thunderbird Bomber is around 80 tons dry and 220 full with just around 160 parts and is quite huge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have completed some initial flight and orbital tests for this bomber.\u00A0 I am now proceeding to make a multi mission module for the rear of the bomber that will hold extra fuel and engines for a vertical launch.\u00A0 Then will come integration of 2 probe units and the vehicle will officially become a mission and go off to Jool.\u00A0 The mothership bomber should have plenty of fuel to dip down into Laythe\u0027s atmoshere and look around for itself if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I have wrote an essay already I will include some thoughts I had while building this bomber.\u00A0 Sometimes the wing control surfaces are worth very little.\u00A0 The amount of flex and vehicle destruction they were causing was remarkable with this flying wing design.\u00A0 I have resorted to setting the outer wing controls to be toggleable to allow more control at lower speeds and to be turned off near max-q to keep from destroying the vehicle.\u00A0 I was having to make a gross tradeoff between vehicle stability and vehicle maneuverability.\u00A0 It seemed an infinite number of struts was going to be required until I did the aforementioned toggle and limited the main inner wing to 7.5% authority, and added 10-20 of the largest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E units from 0 before.\u00A0 These \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E units thankfully took some of the wing loading off the vehicle making the partially \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E-induced aeroelastic flutter hopefully manageable.\u00A0 I am also using modded small nuclear engines which lack gimbals making the previous issues with wing loading worse.\u00A0 The woes of truly large vehicles.\u00A0 It was however good to see no need to invert any flight controls this time either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter thinking about it I suppose a large craft could be made with 5 tries or less.\u00A0 Cockpit, fuel tank, large wings with struts top and bottom and engines balanced with weight and aero and of course landing gear.\u00A0 That would be a challenge all in itself but I do not make ugly stuff so am not interested personally.\u00A0 Would they be able to place just the right amount of struts at just the right place?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socraticat","CreatedById":176118,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-07T12:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI
