When you\u0027ve got a cast of green bobble-heads it\u0027s never going to be a super-serious drama, but I think I\u0027d want something more than a silly comedy. After all a space program, even a Kerbal Space Program, is a pretty impressive undertaking. Probably it would end up being a kid-friendly CG animation, with some humour and some good action and a bit of tension, and of course an inspiring message that space is awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T14:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about where the Kerbals \u003Cem\u003Ecame \u003C/em\u003Efrom in the first place? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//shameless self-plug\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T14:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything as long as it doesn\u0027t invoke Rule #34.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerboman","CreatedById":53253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T14:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about a Grand Tour?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T14:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy favorite idea would be the birth of the space program, fill in more backstory and more \u0022day in the life\u0022 type stuff, show us what kerbals are like when they aren\u0027t working on space\u003Cp\u003E*snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother shameless plug alert but that\u0027s pretty much what my fan works story covers - see my signature for details.
