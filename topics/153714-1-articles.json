However on arrival at the location on the Mun of the pair, I found I had a slight issue, in that the debris part to be recovered was a command seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I knew this was an un-grab-able part, but I gave it a go, maneuvering my vehicle over the top of it, then activating the grabber and raising the landing gear to drop on top of it, but as expected the grabber unit do not latch on to the command seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wfsvsww.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wfsvsww.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than sending another vehicle up with a cargo bay that opens at ground level, then using a kerbal to nudge it slowly into it (not really a dependable solution for a contract) I can\u0027t see any way of satisfying the contract requirement of bringing the part back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my questions would be 1. Am I correct in thinking that command seats are not grab-able and 2. If so, has anyone had contracts that required the recovery of other seemingly impossible to recover items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually a 3rd question would be if I\u0027m just being an idiot and forgetting something obvious as a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW...
