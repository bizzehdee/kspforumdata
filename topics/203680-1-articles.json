Both planets can give you a gravity assist, Eve giving the bigger nudge as its\u00A0gravity is much higher, and with a bit of planning you can set yourself up to encounter Kerbin- or go somewhere else, an Eve slingshot can be used to get closer to Moho or Jool depending on how you do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing directly (or even indirectly with an Eve gravity assist) to\u00A0Moho requires a lot of fuel, Dres is tiny and Eeloo is too far away, ignore them for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the distance, Jool is also a good target- it\u2019s quite a bit further away so you\u2019ll need really good communications to get any data from it, but it\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E is HUGE and the moons are perfect to get gravity assists, allowing you to capture into orbit of Jool without using any fuel at all if you time your encounters with Laythe and Tylo right.

If you want to grab a lot of science, you could send down a lander or even rest your probe down on the surface no problem. The trouble with Eve and Gilly is that without a large lander, it is practically impossible to return from Eve\u0027s surface due to it\u0027s gravity and it\u0027s atmosphere, and Gilly\u0027s orbit makes it tricky to reach for a beginner at interplanetary mechanics, and hard to get a close encounter with on a hyperbolic trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna on the other hand, is also about the same distance from Kerbin as Eve is, and it also has a moon, Ike. Ike is much larger than Gilly is, so most likely you\u0027ll need a dedicated lander if you want to land on it in the future. Ike\u0027s large size and proximity to Duna makes it easy to swing by if you just want to fly by. Duna also has an atmosphere, but it\u0027s thin and Duna is smaller than Kerbin, so if you budget correctly, a Mun lander with parachutes for the descent will actually work as a Duna lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool, which happens to be the very first planet I visited, is quite a distance away from Kerbin, so if you go there you\u0027ll need advanced communications.
