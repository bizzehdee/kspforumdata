However mun and minmus look pretty much the same all over so unless you have a map printed up, you\u0027ll have to switch back and forth between the game and an online map to make sure you get to the right spot when doing science experiments. I feel like there should be something in-game where you can scan a planet (like kethane) and locate biomes that way. This will also apply to all other planets/moons when they get biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisWill","CreatedById":77045,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T21:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should probably be posted in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuggestions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biff Space","CreatedById":110793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T21:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wrote a small mod which does this - the name of the biome is displayed, and you can add biomes that you\u0027ve already taken science from to a list.
