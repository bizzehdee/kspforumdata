It\u0027s all in the 2nd post of the ModuleManager thread. The first gets everything that doesn\u0027t have it at all, the 2nd one gets everything that has the tag, but a false condition. Now I haven\u0027t tested it, but this is what it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your Python, what I\u0027m saying is throughout the RO folder are multiple *.cfg files. Within those files are a ton of @PART[*] and some new parts as well PART{***}. The way KSP works is every part has a name. So initially somewhere there is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPART\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Ename = whatchamacallit\u003Cbr\u003Eblah, blah, blah\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen elsewhere that part is edited via ModuleManager like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[whatchamacallit]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Eblah, blah, blah\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m asking you, is in your Python code, did you account for the fact that while there should only be one PART{***} (first code example)...there are numerous places where in different *.cfg files, and could be multiple within the same file a ModuleManager edit like the 2nd code example. Does your Python code just see PART{} or @PART[]{} and then insert \u0022RSSROEnabled = True\u0022 because if so...then by the time ModuleManager gets done a part could have 12 different entries of \u0022RSSROEnabled = True\u0022, instead of the one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
