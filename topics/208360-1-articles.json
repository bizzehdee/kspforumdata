Its because the engine has to add to the kinetic energy of the car, same is true for planes and guns. Only exception I think of is rockets as they carry the reaction mass with them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I\u0027m not sure how this work out for an true reaction less system like an solar sail, obviously if you start getting relativistic you get less energy from the photons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor stuff like an coil gun you would need to increase power to keep acceleration constant down the track.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-30T15:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u2019t space but\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/05/world/iter-nuclear-fusion-climate-intl-cnnphotos/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/05/world/iter-nuclear-fusion-climate-intl-cnnphotos/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe world has been trying to master this limitless clean energy source since the 1930s. \u003Cstrong\u003ENow we\u2019re closer than ever.\u003C/strong\u003E\u201D [Emphasis added]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-31T15:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost every early-XX article on genetics, cybernetics, and continent drift topics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And other astrobiology books of same author, a professional astronomer in civilian life.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www-nkj-ru.translate.goog/archive/articles/40252/?_x_tr_sl=auto\u0026amp;_x_tr_tl=en\u0026amp;_x_tr_hl=ru\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www-nkj-ru.translate.goog/archive/articles/40252/?_x_tr_sl=auto\u0026amp;_x_tr_tl=en\u0026amp;_x_tr_hl=ru\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Can\u0027t bring the direct links for copyright-copywrong reasons.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benzman","CreatedById":82512,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-31T19:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a book called \u0027Life on Mars\u0027 published in 1965 and one called \u0027There Is life on Mars\u0027 published in 1955.\u00A0 I get childish amusement by having them side by side on my bookshelf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
