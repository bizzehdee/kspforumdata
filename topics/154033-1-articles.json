I\u0027ve installed Realism Overhaul with some Mods. And the Problem is when I go Eva the whole game Freeze.

Hopefully you can find wich mod causes the Problem.

MechJeb has a\u00A0functionality to\u00A0lock all keyboard inputs when hovering over a MechJeb window. So if you happen to hover mouse over a MechJeb window while pressing or even after you just pressed the EVA button.\u00A0Then your keyboard inputs are locked. They can be unlocked in the input locks section of debug menu.\u00A0To avoid input locks: move Mechjeb windows away from the EVA button,\u00A0hold your mouse cursor still for couple seconds after pressing the EVA button to avoid hovering over a mechjeb window.
