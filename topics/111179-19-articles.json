So far I\u0027ve been searching for my mobile Internet USB so I can have decent download/upload speeds for my files. I may also be able to remake Tyrok with 89% chanches to work. Too bad that by custom Notepad\u002B\u002B like code editor on my tablet broke because of a stupid Android update... oh well... backto coding!\n\nAlso, to fix Tyrok, deleting the entire ocean definition is a good start. Here\u0027s what you should put instead on it: \n\n    [FONT=monospace]Ocean{    oceanColor = #2E8ECB //Hex color. Just a green example that you can change to red for proper \u0022lava\u0022. }\n\nOh and don\u0027t delete the hazardousOceans thing as it would render lava characteristics deleted. Cheers!\n\nAlso, is the last attemps you had to fix it, the ocean was too low so it was under the moon\u0027s surface. Try to mess around with the offset paramiter in the hightmap PQS mod.

It\u0027d orbit equatorially, yet far away\n\nI think Yof should have a less poo-colored/more-yellowy texture. I recommend the Jool texture I made for New Kerbol ([link here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HappyFaceIndustries/NewKerbol/master/GameData/NewKerbol/PluginData/Scaled/Jool_color.png))\n\nMysterio\u0027s rings should be closer to the planet, and smaller. I also don\u0027t think that Tyrok should be interior to the rings, like it is now (or was, when I last looked)\n\nIn general, we should make a large effort to make the planets seem less spaceenginey by using procedural coloring, height based, or otherwise.\n\nI also noticed that a lot of the planets are based off of the [Kopernicus FullCustomPlanet](https://github.com/BryceSchroeder/Kopernicus/blob/master/Distribution/KopernicusExamples/FullCustomPlanet/KopernicusPlanet.cfg) example config, which is bad because that config is packed with unnecessary PQSMods, Material properties, etc. Also, neat configs are better than messy ones ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nFlat oceans:\n\n    PQS{    Mods    {        FlattenOcean        {            oceanRadius = -2000  //set this to the minimum height you want, usually 0 for non-ocean planets, or a negative for ocean planets            order = ???  //make sure this comes after the height map stuff        }    }}\n\nTyrok:\n\nIf it\u0027s okay with you guys, then I\u0027ll redo Tyrok\u0027s config to remove the Laythe template dependency and make the oceans better. I also want to give it a more subtle glowing ocean effect (once that plugin is fully working) to emphasize the fact that it has lava.\n\nBUILTIN/\\_\\_\\_ textures:\n\nYou know how you can use KSP\u0027s builtin textures in Kopernicus by using BUILTIN/*texturename*? Well I wrote a quick plugin to export all of the textures\u0027 names into a text file, so we can use them ([link here](https://gist.github.com/HappyFaceIndustries/bf569377299bc2b17441))\n\nYou\u0027ll have to sort through all of the UI stuff though, but there is some pretty great stuff in there.\n\nI also made a small plugin so you can view these textures ingame, which I\u0027ll try to upload later today or tomorrow.\n\nMore Stuff:\n\nI just finished up some school stuff, so I\u0027ll have much more free time to work on this starting tommorow. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEven more stuff:\n\nI\u0027m almost done with the next version of BetterTimeWarp, which will make it much more Kopernicus-friendly.
