Granted I don\u0027t usually use AM powered Thermal Nozzles as I don\u0027t have upgraded AM reactors yet. MJ definitely has no issue with most maneuvers using either of these powered by Fusion or Antimatter Initiated Reactors, provided I don\u0027t have a tiny power supply for the plasma thrusters...MJ doesn\u0027t like low thrust engines. I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027re not using too little power given you mentioned AM reactors. I will note that MJ has trouble \u003Cem\u003Elanding\u003C/em\u003E using Thermal Nozzles even with Fusion/AIR power if the TWR is stupidly high. Always a good idea to be able to switch Thermal Nozzles to a low thrust propellant in those situations, or use the Utility section to limit the thrust/acceleration. Even then, I usually use the Translatron for final descent/landing, paired with changes to thrust/acceleration limiting to keep the ship from accelerating too hard and swapping to positive vertical speed...\u003Cp\u003EFor plasma thrusters, I limit thrust to ~99% depending on my power source to ensure that the ship and any antimatter tanks or fusion reactors will have enough power at all times. Other than that, as long as the TWR around Kerbin is at least in the first decimal place (0.1-0.9\u002B), MJ can handle any maneuver I plan and place a node for. I also prefer not to mount the plasma thrusters radially so they don\u0027t fight over power and potentially have asymmetric thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-05T19:16:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2014 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Einarr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parokki","CreatedById":39644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T19:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing around with the ISRU functions and the bit about water electrolysis creating more oxygen then hydrogen is turning into a real problem for me.
