(Our Chief Engineer was especially incensed that the junior engineers\u0027 escape tower designs *worked*.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe paper, headlined \u0022Armed Camp\u0022, requested a design with four \u0027modules\u0027 to be propelled at high speed for transferring kinetic energy from one ship to another. The purpose of the energy transfer was stated to be for \u0022High pressure concentrated on a small area for the purpose of rapidly disassembling spacecraft.\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount to be paid for the test was enough to fund the build of a kinetic energy transfer module (hereafter KETM) separation test fixture, several sets of four KETMs for testing, one vehicle to receive the energy transfer and one vehicle to deliver the final set of four KETMs to orbit and rendezvous with the receiver vehicle (hereafter RV) - with enough left over for a massive barbecue and luau for the entire staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KETM carrier vehicle (hereafter CV) launch to a 75KM orbit was uneventful, AARP having learned from its previous vehicles how to build a rocket that will stay together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first launch of the RV was not uneventful, during SRB separation the Rockomax 64 tank inexplicably exploded. The upper stage was lit and the vehicle very nearly made it to orbit then was allowed to crash into the ocean. A replacement was quickly assembled, with the addition of Sepratrons to pry the boosters away. The luau had to be canceled but the barbeque was still a go for lunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous was made within 3KM by the RV then closed to 200 meters by the CV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETargeting was aligned, RCS had to be disabled to avoid a constant wobble from the autopilot tracking. The first KETM was separated and successfully transferred energy, causing the RV to drift farther away. The second and third KETMs also made successful energy transfers as the range extended to 300 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CV experienced significant excursion in pitch and/or yaw as each KETM was separated and was slow to realign tracking unless RCS was enabled. This increased the duration between KETM separations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA complete telemetry check of the RV showed zero signs of disassembly or any damage or malfunction. By the time the check was finished, the range had increased to over 400 meters. The fourth KETM made a clean miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RV and CV were both deorbited and destroyed per the details of the \u0022Armed Camp\u0022 paper.

The missile was just a probe core, the smallest 1.25m tank, and a 909. And an interesting thing happened. I expected the thing would fly right towards the target and try to stop at the last second, thereby perhaps burning the target with its engine exhaust. But MJ decided the thing didn\u0027t have enough fine control for this, so did something totally unexpected. It zig-zagged towards the target, continually passing it going and coming, but each pass inching closer and closer to it. The interesting thing was that it kept passing the target at 5-10m /s and then spinning around at the ends of the passes. Eventually, they just barely scraped paint and MJ said it had accomplished the mission. But this gave me an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I built something rather bigger with 8 long girders sticking out radially, with big trusses pointing fore and aft on their outer ends. And I did the same thing with it. What I was hoping for was eventually clubbing the target to death or at least out of orbit, as the big outriggers hit the target on the back-and-forth passes and also when the missile swapped ends each time it wanted to do another pass. And all the while, the outriggers would keep the missile\u0027s core from coming within the 0.1m rendezvous distance, thus keeping the party going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the missile did in fact hammer the target unmercifully, knocking it all over the place. And after sending the target spinning, the missile would go chase it down and start bashing it again. Sadly, it never hit it hard enough to do any damage. Nor did any of these fisticuffs have any noticeable effect on their orbits. Maybe over a LONG time, and purely by chance, the missile might have repeatedly knocked the target lower and lower, but more likely is that it hits the target in a different direction each time, thus all changes canceling out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it seems to me that today\u0027s MJ is incapable of a fire-and-forget kinetic kill.
