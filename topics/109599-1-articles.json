These issues usually occur after around a half-hour to an hour of gameplay, and then all occur together in quick succession. Mods do make them slightly more common, but it still happens regularly in Vanilla. The only way I have found to solve them so far is to restart the game, which, in mid atmospheric flight is not an option. I run an extremely powerful iMac desktop. I\u0027m not sure of the specifics, because I\u0027m just not that kind of buyer, but I can tell you that other than these glitches, I\u0027ve always been able to run pretty much any game at max quality at 40-60 FPS. No one else on the internet that I\u0027ve seen, after hours of searching, seems to have these issues. Seriously, PLEASE HELP. It\u0027s practically impossible to play this game with these bugs, since I have minor OCD. It\u0027s bad enough that these make the game nearly impossible to play when this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: 1.0.2 seems to not have fixed these glitches but at least made them much more uncommon.

Sometimes data gets corrupted silently, but a reinstall should fix this, which you\u0027ve done. If you had a bad sector on the other hand, that would not result in silent corruption, as most modern hard drives are very good at detecting the problem and throwing an error to the application, simply refusing to read/write to that sector. So without further diagnostics, I wouldn\u0027t jump to replacing your hard drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t already, try running on absolute lowest graphics settings. Sometimes an overheating graphics card can cause some strange issues. If it works better with lower settings, then you might want to open it up and make sure you clean dust out of any fans/heatsinks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso run a memory diagnostic tool. Sometimes a bad memory module will cause silent corruption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t, make sure you update your graphics drivers.
