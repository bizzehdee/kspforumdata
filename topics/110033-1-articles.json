It\u0027s almost all glommed onto something else. Thus, having a significant amount of free oxygen in an atmosphere requires some other reaction going on at a large scale to create a surplus of O2 over what\u0027s constantly combining with nearly everything else. And about the only source of such a reacion is biological. A significant amount of oxygen in an atmosphere therefore probably means lots of life. So from that perspective, Laythe is almost certainly crawling with photosynthesizing microbes (or at least the ocean is full of them). Of course, in the KSP universe, the nuclear strong and weak forces are radically different than our own, so Ksp \u0022oxygen\u0022 cannot be exactly the same thing as our oxygen. But it seems to work in a similar manner, so I think it\u0027s safe to say Laythe is totally infested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, there\u0027s a bit of irony in this.
