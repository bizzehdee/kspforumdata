Some math is involved. Thankfully, it\u0027s not that complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of simplicity some factors have been left out. Most importantly drag and passive lift. This guide mainly applies to fairly aerodynamic crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, figure out your planes mass, thrust and steerable lift at takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteerable lift meaning the lift of wings you are able to flap.

That\u0027s it, really. If trying to incorporate thrust too... well, technically any equation with the three interacting can be used as a guide if the interaction between the three is clear, and you have some experimentally determined guides of values that are good or bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking a relationship like \u003Cem\u003E(l*t)/m\u003C/em\u003E would be sufficient to show the relationship between the three. Zero thrust means zero takeoff. Logical. Zero lift also means zero takeoff. Also logical (well, almost; if we define it as controllable lift, it can takeoff with zero controllable lift, but it\u0027s not easy to do, and it will not be able to be controlled very well if at all). The heavier you get, the more lift and thrust you need to take off. I think this one is logical as far as I can see. I don\u0027t know any useful numbers for it, but I can get some for you. To a point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, this does not take into account where the controllable lift is (nose, tail, middle, etc.) or its orientation (e.g., a rudder wouldn\u0027t really contribute much to the takeoff part of things). But still, a useful guide. Well, let\u0027s see... One of my favourite planes that is capable of taking off before half the runway is gone, and then going vertical and flying upside down immediately has these values:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust: 150.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 6.99\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControllable Lift: 2.8 (I\u0027ve ignored the control surfaces on the rudder here.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlug those numbers into \u003Cem\u003E(l*t)/m\u003C/em\u003E gives...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.8*150/6.99 == 60.09\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this formula, higher number gives a better chance of takeoff. This thing can takeoff with practically no trouble, so I\u0027d say a 60 is well into the realm of takeoff being ridiculously easy. However... not sure how it\u0027d go on something with a ton of engines... Might wanna give that a try, if you would.

On the runway this can have the same effect - with the back wheels braced against the runway a turning force will lift the nose up rather than rotate about the centre of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust determines the speed you need to take off. We have speed = thrust/weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s horizontal speed and only holds as long as your engine is horizontal, for lift off speed the formula is something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(horizontal thrust component / weight) * (lift \u002B vertical thrust component)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second half depends on angle, and the angle depends on both how the wings are mounted and the front lift/rotation force of the machine (as well as weight and distance from pivot of course).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T16:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis topic is missing the most important ingreedient in regards to runway takeoff.

If we want to factor in the angle of attack of the wings, it\u0027s gonna get too complicated, really.

Minor revisions, fine, but if you have to rework it every update, what good is it for newbies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to angle of attack, well... assuming that the angle of attack of your wings is either all the same, or you\u0027ve taken an average of the angle of attack of all your wings (and control surfaces, if you\u0027ve altered their angles as well), I\u0027m thinking... perhaps...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(l*t)/(m*tan(a))\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably not a perfect equation by any means... and having a 90 degree angle of attack will give an undefined. But then, a plane with a 90 degree angle of attack is either going straight up like a rocket (thus having a zero angle of attack, as it\u0027s angle relative to airflow, which is the reverse of the velocity vector for now in KSP, as it does not simulate wind) or not going anywhere... or just going to spin uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NuclearWarfare","CreatedById":42325,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T05:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it depends.
