Still, I thought I\u0027d point it out since I didn\u0027t see it anywhere.\n\nI\u0027m using a laptop, and when KSP\u0027s running, the machine runs warmer and the fan kicks in. This is how I noticed that even when KSP is paused, the laptop stays warm. I can click on the \u0022battery\u0022 symbol on the top bar, and it gives me a list of the apps using significant energy. KSP statys on the list, even when it\u0027s paused! \n\nIt\u0027s as if it continually redrew the same screen while paused, or something like that.\n\nSo now you see why it\u0027s not urgent. Still, it\u0027d be nice if KSP calmed down when paused, so the fan turns off and we collectively save a small amount of energy."},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:24:27Z","Content":"Yeah I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s exactly what happens: the same frame is just rendered continuously until you unpause.\n\nIt\u0027s unlikely that Squad will do anything about it, given that they have not done any optimization passes onto the game and probably won\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:31:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s exactly what happens: the same frame is just rendered continuously until you unpause.\n\u003E It\u0027s unlikely that Squad will do anything about it, given that they have not done any optimization passes onto the game and probably won\u0027t.\n\nNot true about optimization.

If you no longer want the game to take up any computer resources, close it. While saving a frame and drawing it rather than redrawing the entire scene would be more processor-friendly, the memory resources would still be taken up, unless you want a load screen whenever you unpause. As such, close the game to get back your resources."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:21:25Z","Content":"I\u0027m not 100% certain how the fan process works; but the CPU or GPU basically is saying (either direct connection or through the OS) \u0022I am burning up, turn on the fan unless you want me to fry\u0022\n\nThe longer the CPU/GPU remains \u0022hot\u0022 the shorter the lifespan is; so even if it isn\u0027t actively doing something but is near critical temperature, it is better to cool it down than to just shut it down."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:40:43Z","Content":"How efficient would a water cooled computer be?\n\nCause I kind of want one...."},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:55:02Z","Content":"Games generally have very little interest in Modern computing.

Still, unless you are either running crazy high end CPU/GPU or have lots of money floating around, it doesnt make any sense from a price perspective (and its just as prone to failure as fans are not to mention leaks are messy).\n\nAnyways, while any and all optimization is welcome, this one particular thing isnt exactly on my priority list as i very rarely keep KSP open when im not actively playing (same with my computer for that matter, its not that bad to just turn it off when unused)."},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T17:20:43Z","Content":"And that\u0027s the problem: most game development studios *do* have lots of money floating around, so their development machines all have GTX 4756408970s with whatever state-of-the-art technology you get from building a gaming rig. \n\nConsequently, many of these studios do little to improve conditions for low-end card users since they don\u0027t suffer from the same grievances."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T09:12:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Water cooling (friend has it) is neat, as you can get a quieter system that gets better cooling at the same time (with large enough heat sink atop rig its possible to not use any fans at all).
