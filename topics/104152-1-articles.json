I did figure out what was causing it though. This guide is for Windows 8 only. For some reason, McAfee didn\u0027t find it, but you need to go to Control Panel and delete the program it is in (I\u0027m pretty sure it was called You are awesome), as well as any other programs that you have downloaded recently. Then, open Google Chrome (which still had the ads on it for me), and go to the menu (the button with three lines on top of each other). Once you open the menu, click on More Tools, then Extensions. Delete the You are awesome plugin (you may or may not see this, the only data I have is from my computer), which will be enabled for both regular and Incognito mode. Delete any other plugins that you have installed recently. I hope that this helps.
