It\u0027s a combination of factors, but this is why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI swear. The Mun in all my saves for 0.22 is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEVIL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. Yes, I haven\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Esuccessfully\u003C/em\u003E sent manned craft to orbit the Mun, but it doesn\u0027t mean I haven\u0027t tried. In fact, though it will show I have only sent a mere probe to the Mun to orbit it (Still unsure when the Mun will open wide and eat it),it does not count the many, many unsuccessful missions/expeditions I have sent. The Mun. It\u0027s evil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what expeditions have I sent?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunshot-1 - The vessel, which was an large lander docked to a habitat module docked to a CM, attempted to land, but smashed into the Mun at 500m/s after the lander engine was destroyed by a collision with the CM, tearing apart the craft and leaving no means for the CM to enter orbit (I deorbited, undocked, and was supposed to get into orbit again). No survivors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunshot-2 - The vessel landed on the Mun, flipping over. When trying to get it back up, the descent module was seperated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunshot-3 - Rescue mission for Munshot-2. It landed, flipped over, but was close enough (10KM) for the Munshot-2 astronauts to reach it. Then, upon attempting takeoff, the craft\u0027s descent module exploded, propelling the habitat module into the air, where it hit the Mun at 56.41 m/s, killing everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunshot-4 - Landed and flipped over at a relatively flat area in a crater. Swallowed by the hell kraken after Tom let go of the handles of the lander habitat, no survivors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn total, the first four missions for the Munshot program cost the lives of nine kerbolnauts. So, I think that the Mun probably isn\u0027t well built for my ships, so I decide to go to the Mun in a Mars Direct Style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar ERV-1 - Launched a ERV to the Mun. ERV flipped over the descent and blew up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar Habitat-1 - Launched soon after ERV-1. After ERV-1 blew up, I thought, \u0022Hey, no worries, I\u0027ll launch another one. But I have to land this one first.\u0022. Space kraken came. No survivors. All four astronauts lost without remains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then give up on the Munar Manned Missions, (They cost the lives of 13 Kerbolnauts) to focus on my manned mission to Eve, and so, those who want to study the Mun are left with probes. So, they decide to send a robotic lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft lands, but flips over (Ok, this is why you don\u0027t use LT-1 legs on the Mun),loses it\u0027s battery and solar panels, and only manages to transmit a meager amount of data before it get\u0027s shutdown from lack of power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second robotic lander is sent. After landing, it works fine. And then, one day, when switching to it, the solar array it has suddenly flies off into different directions. Craft dies from lack of battery, an joins the spacecraft \u0022graveyard\u0022 I have on the Mun. After this, the scientists at the agency working on something related to the Mun are sent to other projects, and the \u0027Center of Munar Study\u0027 is shutdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still up there, taunting me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pigbear","CreatedById":68791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T23:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eadd landing legs attached to struts and no special things.
