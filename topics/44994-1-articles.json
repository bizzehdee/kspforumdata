If you have seen it, or haven\u0027t and can infer what happens by reading this post, you know what ultimately happens at the end of the movie. I think I may have come up with a more practical solution to the situation the crew faced. I\u0027m by no means an expert on Hollywood nukes, but I have a possible solution to the situation. The solution relies on basic electronic circuits. Since there was still a hard wired way to detonate it, that is the way that got used in the movie after they defused it earlier in the plot. Wouldn\u0027t it have been possible to wire an RC (as in resistor- capacitor) circuit. In other words, its a very simple timer. The only two things you need are a resistor and a capacitor. The resistor and capacitors could be found on board the rover they left behind. Lets say that for some reason, they couldn\u0027t get a resistor or capacitor (damned surface mounted hardware.) They could easily make their own. The resistor would be the easiest; just a long piece of wire or metal. The capacitor would be a little harder, but still doable (albeit, somewhat disgusting.) Using a waste bag, water bottle, ect. as a containment device, use the natural occurring salt in urine to form an electrolytic. Then seal the container with two copper (or any other metal) leads. The leads would terminate inside the bottle attached to a piece of foil (their in space, so their bound to have a bit of that somewhere.) The foil acts as electrodes (I think that\u0027s the technical term for them.) The resistor is then wired to the capacitor which are then wired to a battery (once again, they are bound to have one somewhere.) The way it works is this. Electric current flows through the resistor, losing both current and voltage. That decreased current takes a longer time to charge the capacitor. Once the capacitor is charged, it discharges across the electrolytic and sends electricity into the bomb to detonate it. Meanwhile, the ENTIRE crew hops in the spacecraft and flees the blast zone with all due haste. Then they can watch the fireworks for a few minutes before returning home as heroes. I\u0027m not an electrical or nuclear engineer, but provided they had enough voltage from the battery, I think this would work. If it would, this winds up as another case of Hollywood dramatizing stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone tell me if I may be right or wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T15:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the level of science displayed by \u003Cem\u003EArmageddon\u003C/em\u003E, electricity is magic.
