The two cogs that are driven by the jets are intertwined so that they stay in sync. On their shafts is a single extra tooth that will grab and drag the pendulum to simulate it. Off of one of the main drive cogs it drives a smaller shaft to transfer the motion to the front of the clock, where we then drive yet another cog that is our clock\u0027s hand. Through a little No Offset Limits magic we have a clock hand that\u0027s low in part count and complexity. Because there\u0027s already enough that can go wrong and jam. Something like 8 possible points of contention for the cogs to get stuck and no longer mesh...

Because a pendulum\u0027s phase is (nearly) the same whether it is making large or small swings, if the weight is correctly adjusted the pendulum will swing once a second (or once every half-second, or whatever). The wound-up spring drives the clock, and if it could it would drive the hands round very quickly when the spring is tightly wound then more slowly as it unwinds - but every time it pushes the mechanism on, it finds something stuck to the top of the pendulum\u0027s in the way, and it has to wait for the pendulum to swing to the opposite position before it can push the hands a little further round - only to get stuck on the pendulum again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines in this clock, I infer, fill the role of the spring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T18:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Redshift OTF\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Redshift OTF\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah changing the front small cog to 4 and the bigger cog on the same shaft to 12 helped but it seems the 2 teeth that control the pendulum movement get stuck to the teeth on the pendulum cogs.
