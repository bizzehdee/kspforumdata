Done some science.. And it won\u0027t transmit at all. I\u0027ve only got MechJeb and StageRecovery mods installed. I cannot transmit the collected /data/ from my MPL back to Kerbin. The current crew of the base is a pilot, engineer, and scientist (fresh off the boat ones). The base has plenty of power and four solar panels to keep providing more, it has /four/ DTS-M1 comm arrays on it. It refuses to transmit data. What have I done wrong, here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you extend the comms arrays on their own?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kershu5","CreatedById":143297,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t seem to be able to anymore.
