As the moons orbited the barycenter, the moon closer to the host planet would have a greater force of gravity acting on it than the outer one, so (as I said) unless they are really far away from the planet where the difference is small, I doubt it would be stable for more than a few million to a few tens of millions of years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T14:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t 2 moons of nearly identical mass orbiting each other be able to orbit another body?
