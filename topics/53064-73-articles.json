For example, if you had it at 24 hours, your spacecraft would drift by ~1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0/day, so in a month, it would be 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that it\u0027s easiest to follow real life examples. Build a launcher that can *just* get the satellite to GTO (for this, you need approximately 12km/s) and then let the spacecraft itself circularize (1.5km/s). Also, if you want to change your inclination (e.g. you are launching from Cape Canaveral), add some fuel to that too. The most efficient way to do that is to burn to GTO at ascending/descending node with equatorial plane, and then perform a GEO insertion burn \u002B plane change burn at once. You can calculate the amount by doing a vector difference between the velocity vectors of the 2 orbits (initial \u002B desired). Which is, basically, a basic trigonometric math. I will spare you the calculations, but the result is 1833m/s to circularize and change plane at once (GTO = 250x35786km orbit). If you instead wanted to first circularize and then perform a plane change (you are not burning at AN/DN), it will be much more expensive - 1.5km/s for circularization and 1.5km/s more for inclination change, so 3km/s total.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T14:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely possible without MJ, I did it.
