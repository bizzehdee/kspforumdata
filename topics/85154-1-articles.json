We know Hugo also did some new Mk3 Parts but i don\u0027t know if they will actually also come with 0.25 and i don\u0027t know if they\u0027ll include a cargo bay. (anybody heard anything?) So soon we will have a methode of bringing at least 1.25m payloads into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you want to build a bigger spaceplane, but without Mod-Parts. like the big Astroliners seen on Youtube.
