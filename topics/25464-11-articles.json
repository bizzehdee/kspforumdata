But also not kidding...since our story actually started with Desdin on Eve. The boys at KSC recently sent him a new mobile base (a duplicate flight article of the Laythe Base 2, but refitted for Eve). It\u0027s so much easier to go to Eve than to Jool... the Nuclear Tug only used the fuel from its rear drop tank to get the ship into Eve orbit and positioned for the drop to Desdin. Below we see the base entering Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ss9HVOw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ss9HVOw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new base was needed because of changes in the terrain on Eve that made the lake Desdin was camped near disappear... and that was a shock to him when he woke up from a couple-week-long meditation trance, let me tell you. It was also just time to send Desdin some more consumables, improved recycling systems, and new scientific equipment. Below, the base settles to the surface of Eve on its landing legs (to protect the wheels). These were the hefty old-style legs...not the mushy ones the contractor provided KSC in the most recent order. After landing, the legs were retracted, and the base drove down to the lakeshore of the largest remaining lake in the region.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jlcrl4a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jlcrl4a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesdin hopped into his Fido rover and sped the 89 kilometers to his new lakeshore residence. It\u0027s also closer to the highest elevation mountains in the region (which is important because whatever caused the lakes to disappear also caused the slumping of the previous high-elevation site that was to eventually be used to drop a lander to return Desdin to Kerbin, should he ever desire to leave Eve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ElkHELS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ElkHELS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the whole point of this is that Desdin has been spending a lot more time being active on Eve and less time in his meditation trances... and part of his regular set of experiments is to observe Kerbol. Thus it was Desdin who first spotted the unusually large outbreak of sunspot activity, and he was able to warn Kerbal Space Center about this in a timely fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YtpYcbl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YtpYcbl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we can see from the diagram below, Eve was located on the opposite side of Kerbol from Jool and Kerbin, and this allowed Desdin to give KSC a heads up about the developing magnetic anomaly two days before the superspot region rotated into view from Kerbin. Kerbol rotates with a period of 5 (Earth) days, in case you are wondering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3HO35R1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223HO35R1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EMinmus\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys at KSC sent out warnings about increased activity on Kerbol to its deep space explorers in the Jool system, but their more immediate concern when the growing superspot region came into view was for the six astronauts on Minmus moonbase. Commander Nedmy Kerman was ordered to perform an emergency evacuation of the moonbase and return all crew to Kerbin in the minimum possible time, using any fuel needed and expending equipment as required. Below, the crew scrambled onto the ladders of the Fido Mini 2 for the 2.7 km dash to the Landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/97WbNwr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002297WbNwr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: For this exercise, I gave myself a time limit in which I had to return the crew to beneath Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere before a hail of high energy particles would come sleeting into the Kerbin system to impinge on the hulls of their ships, screeching to a halt and dumping energy in the form of Bremsstrahlung X-rays that would rip to tatters all sorts of important organic molecules inside our jolly little kerbals. As you may know, it typically takes about two days to go from Minmus to Kerbin... but I figured that with some delays in recognizing the danger posed by the expanding superspot region, and delays caused by bureaucratic intertia, I gave myself a deadline of 12 hours. And if some cute little kerbals had to be fried dead in the interest of making an exciting narrative for our Jool mission, then so be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhoa! Once they knew I was serious, the moonbase crew headed off to the Landers. Oh, look: an ancient RCS-powered rover...how quaint. But that baby can move on the frozen lake flats of Minmus, and it got the crew to the Landers in a matter of minutes. The Landers were located away from the moonbase to decrease lag...er...to decrease the danger of landing accidents damaging the moonbase...but Mission Controllers may want to re-think that policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i8tzXIs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i8tzXIs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jR2ZFrk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jR2ZFrk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst into Moon Lander 1 were Merfred, Rodgan, and Dilger Kerman. And here we see why I\u0027m actually fairly confident I may be able to save our little green explorers from the approaching storm of ionization radiation: These general purpose Moon Landers were designed to work on both Minmus AND the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with capacity to spare, so they have a metric shipload of fuel on board: three Rockomax X200-16 tanks, currently filled to 89% capacity. Oh how the Press scoffed at the wastefulness of using such overpowered landers on Minmus.... but this excess fuel is the only thing that might save our kerbals\u0027 bacon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aPotJ7y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aPotJ7y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Moon Lander 1 lifts off. There was no leisurely boosting into orbit and plotting an efficient Trans-Kerbol-Injection maneuver. Merfred just pointed the ship somewhat left of Kerbin and kicked the Poodle up to full power. \u0022Somewhat left\u0022 was to kill off Minmus\u0027s orbital velocity...but most of the fuel was burned heading right at Kerbin...or slightly to the side of it for an atmospheric entry with a targeted periapsis of around 23 km. And all the fuel was burned, except for 100 units or so, in case a course correction was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I46zEHv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I46zEHv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Tbi8ke4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tbi8ke4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship streaked away from Minmus with a speed of over 3200 m/s at engine cutoff, as the angry face of Kerbol watched on. As soon as I had the Moon Lander 1 on course, Nedmy, Milski, and Rodmy Kerman repeated the maneuver in Moon Lander 2, leaving Minmus at about the same velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9SsTDwm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229SsTDwm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Moon Lander 1 plummeting toward Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The speed was over 4,000 m/s before entry... but the Mk1-2 capsule has shown it can stand up to faster speeds than that on some interplanetary returns I\u0027ve done. The side tanks were separated, and then the center tank was dropped, and all the parts put on a nice show of reentry flames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Psvtb4o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Psvtb4o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ybUrnDG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ybUrnDG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule landed safely in some foothills.

I was planning on replacing these old Landers with new, more efficient models, but I don\u0027t think those would have gotten the crews back in such a short time. Maybe Minmus Moonbase will get a single high-speed escape ship that\u0027s kept close to the base, and smaller, more efficient landers for the regular duty of shuttling passengers between the surface and orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qzHaRKu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qzHaRKu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fbCNtie.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fbCNtie.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter studying the superspot region for another day, the kerbol-astronomers predicted there might be some magnitude 5 eruptions, so the warning was passed on to the explorers in the Jool system. So the sudden spreading of the superspot region and massive ejections of magnitude 9 or 10 sort of took them by surprise. As Kerbin was lashed by the initial bursts of high energy particles, wreaking havoc with radio communications and power grids, the boys at KSC tried to send a warning to the Vall Expedition. Use all the antennas! Redline the transmitters! But would the warning get through?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EVall\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich, of course, takes us up to the end of the last episode, when our heroines on Vall did indeed receive the warning. The safest place to be in the Jool system if a huge coronal mass ejection hits is on Laythe, under its 0.8-bar atmosphere. Laythe is located deep in Jool\u0027s radiation belts, to be sure, but unlike the surfaces of the Jovian moons such as Io and Europa in our solar system, which have negligible atmospheres, the surface of Laythe is protected by its surprisingly thick atmosphere that can stop the high energy electrons, protons, and small numbers of heavier nuclei in their tracks. But can our heroines reach the safety of Laythe\u0027s surface in time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s discuss the time limit I set for myself before our valiant Vall explorers would become irradiated corpses. Coronal Mass Ejections from our Sun travel at an averge speed of 500 km/s...but they can be as fast as 3,000 km/s. Yes, that\u0027s KILOMETERS per second. The distance from Kerbin to Jool can be found using all the other wonderful data about the Kerbol system in the Kerbal Celestials section of the Wiki (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Celestials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Celestials\u003C/a\u003E), and it works out that a super-high-speed ejection could cross that distance in a little over 5 hours. Looks grim. But the superspot region (currently spewing bursts of high energy particles at Kerbin) won\u0027t be pointed at Jool until Kerbin rotates another 26 degrees...and that takes 8.33 hours. So...over 13 hours total. But I\u0027ve said the superspot region is spreading...so knock off a bit for that. Let\u0027s call it 12 hours until irradiation hell time. That was enough time for our boys on Minmus... but I often spend DAYS dicking around getting ships to encounter moons after an aerocapture at Jool. But 12 hours it is. The die is cast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ck30yHK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ck30yHK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Emi!

Good luck, Hawk.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirty minutes after the clock started ticking, Emilynn fired the engines of the Vall Lander and headed for space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jZKiZkD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jZKiZkD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oZDu7uT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oZDu7uT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the plot showing the liftoff and rendezvous maneuver. The solid trajectory shows the result of the initial burn that placed the Lander\u0027s apoapsis on the 165 km orbit of the Vall Station. Then the maneuver node was added and tweaked to get the intercept shown (0.2 km separation). At the intercept point, Emilynn burned to match velocities with the Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2nV7Q9x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222nV7Q9x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was not one of those nice, sedate docking maneuvers. Instead it was: blast toward the Station at what would normally be considered unsafe speeds...brake...use RCS fuel like it\u0027s going out of style...and slam the ships together at over twice the speed I normally use. The result? Emilynn had the ships docked 43.5 minutes after zero time. And remember: 30 minutes of that was spent sitting on the ground waiting for the Station to pass overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QLtp1ez.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QLtp1ez.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mU0AQLa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mU0AQLa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Chickadee, we are docked.

Is this as fast as you\u0027ve got? How about if I burn retrograde and KEEP burning retrograde until I start heading the other direction and meet Laythe coming around the other way.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022That\u0027s a crazy idea, Hawk. But Aldner already thought of it and ran the figures. It would be faster, and your ship would barely have enough fuel to do it, but the aerocapture at Laythe would smash you at over 80 Gs.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Roger, Jaymak. I\u0027ll go your way. Can we cut some time on the other side burning toward Laythe? This maneuver will leave me with lots of fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022It wouldn\u0027t save a lot of time, and the aerocapture would get worse.

This is what you get if you do a very long retrograde burn at Vall that brings the ship to a complete stop and heads off in the retrograde direction around Jool. The fully fueled Nuclear Tug has enough delta-V to handle this with a little fuel to spare for course corrections and some orbital maneuvers at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7nR2C5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k7nR2C5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, thanks to the power of f5/f9 replay, we see the Vall Station making the big retrograde burn. This is a very long burn (almost 26 minutes), and you can see from the orbit plot that the ship has to start firing well before the maneuver node, and its trajectory deviates a long way from the original 165 km orbit, dropping to a periapsis of 73 km before pulling away from Vall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7Pw0jhK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227Pw0jhK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4VR2yMp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224VR2yMp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kicker, of course, comes when the ship reaches Laythe, which is orbiting around Jool in the opposite direction, so that they meet head-on at over 7,300 m/s. You can see in the second image that the G meter is pegged. When I was plotting the aerobraking, MechJeb was listing maximum expected G forces between 60 and 100 Gs. That might seem like nothing to you guys who regularly come burning into the Jool system at interplanetary speeds with a direct aerobraking at Laythe, but it makes me cringe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PvDUpQi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PvDUpQi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mWnYLoo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mWnYLoo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, below we see the capsule containing the alternate timeline Hellou (or maybe containing Hellou-flavored jam) descending onto Laythe.
