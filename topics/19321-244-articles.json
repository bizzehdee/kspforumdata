The flight characteristics in general are nothing short of abysmal at this point. Using SAS to bring it to heel only illustrates the fact that a screw came loose somewhere.

No problem, I thought, since it\u0027s worked so often in the past. On the runway, I raised the flaps, went to full throttle, and never touched the flightstick.
