I\u0027m having issues with my design. Please give me the reasons this sucks. As you can see, at power, even with 2 of 3 engines off I have stability issues. Lander has fuel tank on it still, was going to use all of it before getting rid of it. This assumes I ever make it anywhere. Are my issues because i\u0027ve attached parts with engines with docking ports? Oh yeah, I\u0027m using stock parts only.
