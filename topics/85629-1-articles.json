Just genuine fast velocity. The reason for this effect is time dilation. However, we will never travel like this, because even as travel time becomes instant, the energy required to perform that travel becomes infinite. It is extremely impractical to go for a pure velocity approach. Even if current estimates of the energy required to operate an Alcubierre warp drive range around \u0022a ball of antimatter the size of Jupiter\u0022, that is still downright cheap compared what it takes to push even a tiny probe anywhere near the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould humans ever travel faster than light, they will do it by cheating their way around the speed limit, not by reaching it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dbmorpher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dbmorpher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo the question is: should we send a mission as soon as possible or wait until more convenient technology becomes available?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested in all things space development, I highly recommend following this weekly youtube show: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/spacevidcast/videos\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/spacevidcast/videos\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I forget which, but one of the episodes broadcast in 2014 so far discussed this exact question in detail.
