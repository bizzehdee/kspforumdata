Kerbal Space Programme might be very well suited: Improved IVA, an ego-perspective for EVA, and we should have another killer-app for VR.

Oculus Rift excels at situating you in some sort of virtual reality, so you could imagine it being excellent while actually flying the craft, landing, etc. (And yes, absolutely excellent in E:D!) I can imagine trying to dock, looking around my craft to see just how well I line up, etc. The HoloLens is about placing virtual elements so they appear to be part of the existing real world, so you could imagine it being excellent in applications that benefit from the use of your hands, say, the VAB/SPH. I like the idea of building KSP rockets on my office floor, like I\u0027m a kid again with my big box of Legos. Both sound exciting."},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:37:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E First person POV is in a capsule, with modern day technology you would probably be looking at a flat screen CC image.

I printed and cutout the parts to make cardboard to make sure my note 4 fits well enough, which it seems to, now I just need to order the lenses and magnets and modify it just a bit to fit the tabs so it all goes together smoothly.\n\nI imagine controlling the camera wouldn\u0027t be too complicated with the right driver/interface. I think the toughest thing would be getting the video from the PC onto the screen of the phone.
