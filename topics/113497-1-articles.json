Oculus Rift excels at situating you in some sort of virtual reality, so you could imagine it being excellent while actually flying the craft, landing, etc. (And yes, absolutely excellent in E:D!) I can imagine trying to dock, looking around my craft to see just how well I line up, etc. The HoloLens is about placing virtual elements so they appear to be part of the existing real world, so you could imagine it being excellent in applications that benefit from the use of your hands, say, the VAB/SPH. I like the idea of building KSP rockets on my office floor, like I\u0027m a kid again with my big box of Legos.
