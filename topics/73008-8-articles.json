I had originally used your wings, but they kept shredding in FAR as soon as I got the nose to start lifting off the runway. It wasn\u0027t an extreme angle, either... just a few degrees.

Things I would like to see added, hmm ... IVAs are always awesome, and you\u0027re already on that. Obviously that\u0027s going to take a while. Someone else already suggested a 0.625/1.25/0.625 adapter, which I agree would be handy and fit nicely with the shape of the fuselage. Airbrakes have also already been suggested. 5-way aerodynamic-looking RCS thrusters would be nice, as they work well with the bilateral symmetry of the SPH. Maybe some bigger landing gear, the stock ones work well enough but have fairly low ground clearance, and look a little undersized on bigger planes. An integrated fin\u002Bcontrol surface (like the Delta Deluxe) might be nice, but the small delta wing \u002B smallest elevon works well enough for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe half-size version of the Mk2 Fuselage should probably be renamed the Mk2 Fuselage Short to match the Mk2 Fuselage LFO Short (currently it\u0027s just called the \u0022Mk2 Fuselage\u0022, same as the full-size version).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T20:47:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
