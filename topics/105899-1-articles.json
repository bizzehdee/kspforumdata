The problem I found was that after I gout out of the atmo the craft became uncontrollable. It would rapidly spin up in a single direction, usually clockwise on the axis. And because I had not SAS I could not control it. Once I got back into the atmo and released the chutes, I started pressing buttons. Turning off both reaction wheels stopped the spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question, is this intended behavior? Did squad give reaction wheels a passive rotational force when not under SAS control. This could explain some of the crashes I have had launching as something just starts pulling the ship sideways and the drag is not the source (I have drag lines going a lot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: This I did not know but I was pressing Alt when using QWEASD. Apparently, holding alt then adjusting your direction sets a little slider some where. Tap Alt-E and your craft will start adding rotation on your long axis. Use Alt-W and it will set that rotation to accelerate. That was something painful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T08:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SyberSmoke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFigured out the issue...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor future reference (maybe someone else coming across this post), this feature is called \u0022trim\u0022, and you can zero out all trim by pressing Alt\u002BX.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor future reference (maybe someone else coming across this post), this feature is called \u0022trim\u0022, and you can zero out all trim by pressing Alt\u002BX.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that gets me is there is no indicator of the current trim setting.
