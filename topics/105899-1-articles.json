The problem I found was that after I gout out of the atmo the craft became uncontrollable. It would rapidly spin up in a single direction, usually clockwise on the axis. And because I had not SAS I could not control it. Once I got back into the atmo and released the chutes, I started pressing buttons. Turning off both reaction wheels stopped the spin.\n\nSo the question, is this intended behavior? Did squad give reaction wheels a passive rotational force when not under SAS control. This could explain some of the crashes I have had launching as something just starts pulling the ship sideways and the drag is not the source (I have drag lines going a lot).\n\nEdit: This I did not know but I was pressing Alt when using QWEASD. Apparently, holding alt then adjusting your direction sets a little slider some where. Tap Alt-E and your craft will start adding rotation on your long axis. Use Alt-W and it will set that rotation to accelerate. That was something painful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T08:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SyberSmoke**\n  \nFigured out the issue..."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:23:34Z","Content":"For future reference (maybe someone else coming across this post), this feature is called \u0022trim\u0022, and you can zero out all trim by pressing Alt\u002BX."},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:19:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For future reference (maybe someone else coming across this post), this feature is called \u0022trim\u0022, and you can zero out all trim by pressing Alt\u002BX.\n\nThe thing that gets me is there is no indicator of the current trim setting.
