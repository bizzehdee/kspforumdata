The stranded ship is set as target and I right clicked on it so its informations are always displayed in map view. I tried hitting F4 but it does nothing either in map view or not. All the other F keys worked so they are not lock out somehow and I tried putting a secondary key to \u0022Show/hide Vessel Labels\u0022\u00A0that also did not work. I did managed to complete the mission by staying in map view until about 100m separation and then just eyeballing the distance, but that might not always work... Maybe it\u0027s just me, but for a game about realistic orbital maneuvers, I feel like eyeballing distance (especially for a beginner) should be avoided!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone can help me with this!

It might be a bug in the training mission alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you see if the target square shows up during regular game-play? Probably the easiest place to check is to see if the reticle shows up for separated boosters that drop away from you after launch. Be sure to press the F4 toggle if they still don\u0027t show in a regular game, just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes though the camera view while in orbit makes it difficult to scan the whole sky around you because of the narrow field of view. You may simply not be looking in the right direction. I find it helps to zoom out the camera so that you can see more of the sky as you look around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-30T20:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2020 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RockBenn","CreatedById":203660,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-30T22:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146104\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@HvP\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just tried a sandbox mission and yes the droped stages were marked and the F4 toggle worked just fine!
