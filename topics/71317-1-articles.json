KSP is more than capable of doing so, and, seeing what they\u0027ve done before, I think the devs could do a really nice job giving a few planets some clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see the addition of clouds someday.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T17:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the reason that Squad isn\u0027t in a hurry is that rbray has done an amazing job with it, so they\u0027ll focus their resources elsewhere updating the base code in ways modders cannot or must do so clumsily. Those of us that want awesome clouds can easily get them now, so no reason for Squad to be in a super hurry to add it to the stock install.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T17:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see.
