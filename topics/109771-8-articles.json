(So I can go mine metal and ship it back to KSC to sell)\n\nThus I ran into the following problem from the moment I began:\n\nThe Fischer-Topsch process engine suffers from a weird glitch. When attempting to place it, it seems to have a tweakscale \u0027menu\u0027 pop up in its tweakable list, but is broken. And when I connect the unit to a node on a vehicle I\u0027m building, it acts as if I released it into empty space, then when I reclick to move it and place it properly, it grabs both the process unit, as well as the vehicle, and won\u0027t allow me to release them without \u0027dumping\u0027 them into the parts list again, scrapping everything.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what the cause is. I found the file containing the three process reactors using that model. (Side Note: The other two models have no glitched tweakable menus, and can be placed.)\n\nI noted in the part cfgs that there were scaling values commented out. I tried uncommenting and fully deleting them, and then I noticed the name in the part can\u0027t agree on spelling. There\u0027s an instance of Fischer as well as Fisher used in several places. I\u0027m unsure if that\u0027s intentional or an error. And if an error, which format is intended for use. \u0027Fisher\u0027 is shorter, which might make sense for button-action names, but losing a single \u0027c\u0027 out of the name doesn\u0027t really seem to work for shortening things.\n\nBelow is the cfg code right from the latest Github grab.\n\n    @PART[ISRU]{    @name = RealISRU_FischerTropschReaction//    mesh = ISRU.mu//    scale = 1    @title = Fischer-Tropsch Processor    @manufacturer = Kerbodyne    @description =     @mass = 2.0    @maxTemp = 2000 // = 3500    !MODULE[ModuleResourceConverter],* {}    MODULE    {        name = ModuleResourceConverter        ConverterName = Fisher-Tropsch Process        StartActionName = Start Fisher-Tropsch Process        StopActionName = Stop Fisher-Tropsch Process        AutoShutdown = false        GeneratesHeat = true        UseSpecialistBonus = false        INPUT_RESOURCE        {            ResourceName = Hydrogen            Ratio = 1        }        INPUT_RESOURCE        {            ResourceName = CarbonMonoxide            Ratio = 0.959370985216787        }        OUTPUT_RESOURCE        {            ResourceName = Kerosene            Ratio = 0.000667013128209099            DumpExcess = false        }        OUTPUT_RESOURCE        {            ResourceName = Water            Ratio = 0.000694171868542514            DumpExcess = false        }    }}\n\nAs far as I can tell, aside from individualized data and the commented-out lines, the code is identical in syntax to the other two functional parts. I\u0027d like to hand-patch this if I can. Does anyone know if there\u0027s anything wrong in this code, or if I might need to go look in another file specifically for this?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWait, I see something.

(Fischer Tropsch process looks like a nightmare, but I know that FAR just treats things as solid shapes.)\n\nAltogether with a huge VTOL aircraft, I got them on site in the northern desert 450 km west of KSC to set up a base. (Took a few runs). Overall, things are a bit part intensive, especially if you\u0027re trying to get the big equipment transferred to a site. All the parts needed in the vehicles murdered physics time and I was running at a 1/4 time ratio from the mess. I might suggest adding \u0027combined cycle\u0027 process parts in which it simply requires anticipated base resources and spits out the products. (In the case of Kerosene, an electricity / water / atmosphere input that assumes to grab the required CO or CO2, and spitting out the Kerosene, water, and Oxygen byproducts.)\n\nAnother thing to add is some kind of byproduct disposal system. Like a vent or waste valve part. While making best use of all the mid-process products is an idea, if not preferred method, the manufacturing of fuel products leaves you with a massive supply surplus that shuts the processes down when tanks are full. So an \u0027overflow vent\u0027 for excess products that can be configured for say, dumping all the excess oxygen or water from the kerosene manufacturing \n\nAlso, the \u0027value\u0027 of carbon monoxide is absurd. For my cracker truck, I could have just spawned it, ran it, filled up the CO tank, and recovered it for a 200,000 fund profit. Not sure what it\u0027s set to right now, only that it\u0027s absurd.
