I got a ship into orbit, returned to the space centre to \u0022save\u0022 my progress, then decided to fool around in orbit for a while. Once I ran out of fuel, I wanted to rewind my game, but the rewind button was disabled! I couldn\u0027t figure out why. I was double-checking that my throttle was zeroed and I wasn\u0027t time accelerating or anything, and then I went online to see if a bug was reported. I was very surprised to discover that this is by design; in my opinion, rewinding should \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E be an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I noticed another thread suggesting that the rewind feature was \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E forgiving. If you want a \u0022hardcore\u0022 mode that removes rewinding -- and presumably quicksaves -- that\u0027s cool, but as long as rewinding is in the game, it should be consistent.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T08:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022rewind\u0022 option is a reload of your last persistence save, placing you either the moment before, or the moment after you hit the \u0022launch\u0022 button.
