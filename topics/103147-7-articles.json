The engine nacelle will often torque a bit under load once you deactivate the strut. And with IR any part at the end of a moving IR contraption can clip through the main vessel. If the quantum strut clips inside of the part you are aimed at it, it may not \u0022hit\u0022 or connect on your toggle AG.\n\nThe trick here is check where the quantum strut hits in both VTOIL and normal flight modes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. And allow for some flex here. Also do everything you can to connect the nacelles to the heaviest part of the ship. This will be the most stable option. So as far as flex, imagine where the quantum strut will be after IR flexes under the weight of the ship. And when flying your ship, try to avoid any aggressive maneuvers unless quantum struts are locked. Another trick I have used is use a B9 light or any light really and tweak the color to something like red / blue anything obvious. And then only assign that light to a toggle AG along with Q-struts. This will give you a visual sign the struts are toggled on or off.\n\nHopefully that helps, I need to buy a good headset so I can do tutorials on youtibe.
