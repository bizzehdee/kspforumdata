Right when it came off the launch pad it left a trail of smoke and disappeared(It took no more than 1 second for us to completely lose track of it), ....ing awesome right. So we search for I\u0027d say about 40 minutes with no luck, now i decide to launch my rocket because I am determined to show my brother who\u0027s the better rocket builder. I launch my rocket and SWOOSH, it climbs to the sky at a slight angle right above my head and then cuts to the left until it\u0027s almost out of sight.

My only experience with rockets is KSP and a few videos from real life and a couple model rockets I got for my birthday. One day I decided i would make my own rocket and I figured an Airhogs Titan glider would be a good body. I went out and I wasn\u0027t really up to date with the rocket sizing and grabbed a pack with the highest letter and number. Some tape and wires later I launched a rocket with two c6-5s on it. I had always figured they were still pretty small. One of the model rockets I got was actually an Alpha 3 and I\u0027ve recovered it a few times after launching it from an acreage. I enjoy the stuff you can buy and throw together in a few hours but I don\u0027t think any will come close to modifying a 10$ foam plane into a rocket that flies over 300m powered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T17:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re not large, but they pack a serious punch.
