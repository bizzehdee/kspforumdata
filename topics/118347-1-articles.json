I have tried to switch the controls back to the way they were before 1.0 and now they\u0027re completely knackered. so I guess what I\u0027m asking in short is: How do I change them back to the way they were pre 1.0?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany help with this will be greatly appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
