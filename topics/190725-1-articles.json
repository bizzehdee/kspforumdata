For instance, let\u0027s consider a pair of canards tasked to output, say... a pitching moment. They will have to produce a certain amount of torque in order to form that pitching moment. Because of flow turbulence and the dynamic response of the whole aircraft, we need to measure the difference between the input and the (actual) moment created and feed it to a controller that in turn generates a correction, hence forming a closed-loop control system. Basically, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not hesitate to correct me, btw, as automatic control is not my primary field of interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is achievable with kOS because the programming language offers quite a lot of flexibility, but I would like to try this without using any mod. As far as I know, there exists no such thing in the robotic parts pack and despite being rather handy, the KAL-1000 controller doesn\u0027t seem to be able of automatic control, but merely stores predefined commands. It can act (automatically) but does not react.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone found a way to achieve control nonetheless?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T02:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobot parts are too floppy to that kind of job, they will fail at high speeds (in atmo).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerburettor","CreatedById":194580,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T22:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup. I haven\u0027t really tested them but it looks like most of these actuators will break down under the weight of a big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u0026gt; 100 T). One of the big hinges holds remarkably well though. I stuck my front landing gear to it (the medium sized) as any bigger landing gear does not have the ability to steer. I made it fold and unfold multiple times and so far it hasn\u0027t let me down. But I think I will resort to mods. The level of detail I want to give my model airplane will be too far a stretch for stock KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
