The story behind it (I\u0027m sure a few are wondering) is as follows: My dad is a pilot for delta airlines. About 10 years ago he was the first officer of a flight (where he was going neither of us can remember), anyways as passengers boarded he noticed Mr. Armstrong enter and sit in first class. I was about 12 at this time and loved space flight and astronomy, etc. My dad knowing this, he, during the flight, went back into first class and introduced himself to Neil. He explained how much his son (me) would be jealous about meeting him. Neil proceeded to ask what my name was and ask for one of my dad\u0027s business cards. He then wrote \u0022To Nathan, good luck\u0022 and signed it. My dad was tickled pink due to the fact that Neil had publicly stopped signing autographs years ago. My dad later explained how sad it was that no one else in first class knew who he was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T06:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuild a hollow Saturn v replica.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow put it in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T07:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think if you were able to get a panorama of the moon\u0027s surface (though that frame seems a bit short) I think it would look great.
