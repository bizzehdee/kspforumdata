What!!?","CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T01:51:33Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T01:51:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo on my Mun landing mission, everything went smoothly. Even the actual landing part. But it was on the way home that I noticed something. I had to EVA my kerbal to get some science. All of a sudden Dodon gets flung away ( this NEEDS to be fixed, kerbals aren\u0027t complete idiots) AND he imparted rotation to the craft. The craft was rotating and I actually almost raged. That rarely happens, especially for KSP. I chased it and just kept getting batted around. I finally decided to use the time warp button to stop the rotation. But then I saw it start rotating again. That\u0027s when I realized that the reaction reals are applying torque WHEN THERE\u0027S NO PILOT. This shouldn\u0027t be a feature, especially with the new SAS in kerbals thing. It almost ruined my mission. I did get the guy back in to the pod and I stopped the trim. But, Squad, why would this be here? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, has this ruined any of your missions?

Perhaps you accidentally set the trim while activating physical warp. mod \u002B x will reset the trim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft responding to trim without a pilot is probably a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T02:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETorque isn\u0027t specific to pilots.
