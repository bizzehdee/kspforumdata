Apparently the constantly rotating coordinate system is used to determine their direction, thus Jepediah looked as if he were drunk when marching from the base to the pole. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When standing precisely on the pole, he falls over, and the camera jolts violently, sometimes even briefly looking out from unter the terrain. Jepediah actually stands about half a meter away from the pole on the images, and the flag itself is about a Kerbal foot away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Due to the rotating coordinate system, it was extremely tedius to plant the flag this close to the pole, as Jepediah would always turn around by a quite unpredictable amount, often planting the flag further away from the pole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T09:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 09:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mephane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T23:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, but one thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJEPEDIAH!?!?!?!?!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrobug","CreatedById":1542,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T00:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is such a well done mission, I\u0027m in awe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that flag.
