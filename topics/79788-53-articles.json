I just put a \u003Cem\u003EFine Print\u003C/em\u003E-ed Scansat mapper into a 100km polar orbit around the Mun. As well as netting me a bucket of cash and science for the satellite contract, it also let me get a full topo map of the Mun, which I radioed in to fulfil a \u0022science from around the Mun\u0022 contract for more loot and science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly cost about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A140,000, and it has enough juice left to go repeat the job around Minmus when it\u0027s done. Those lightweight satellite payloads are much easier to fling about than a full Kerballed capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if you could easily see the orbital parameters before choosing to accept it, though. And a few more low-orbit missions might not be a bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-19T12:33:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2014 12:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
