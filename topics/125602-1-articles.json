Slide it to max, then stick a stayputnik on a hammer and launch it, it should explode at some point, if it does not simply add a decoupler and another hammer with fins then launch at an angle. Jot down the time that things go explody. Then slide it all the way back and repeat. Or just wait for someone smarter than me to come along :p\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T23:33:22Z","Content":"\nI will try this out on a pod.
