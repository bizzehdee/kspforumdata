Out of all my pictures this video is my favorite. Probably because of the audio.. that was a nice night. And it was my first endeavor into astrophotography. I just took a small SLR and stood as still as I could. The seeing that night was perfect. It was the shadow of one of the moons that made me take the video. I couldn\u0027t tell you which one it was casting the shadow. The bright yellow one is obviously Io. My favorite of the four Galilean moons. I mean to registax this video once I get back into the hobby.. there are a lot of clear frames I could use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
