Long time lurker.\u00A0So ive been flying 20-30 part ships for about 2 years now due to my low fps. Cant really get past duna on account of that. I have scoured these forums and have done every combination of graphic settings and tweaks, but regardless of what I do my frame rate is usually stuck around 12 fps max is about 25. Every thing I have read points to a cpu issue, due to the game engine, but I figured I might as well ask before I stop playing all together.\u00A0Maybe you guys see something I have missed. Heres my specs,\u003Cstrong\u003E amd fx 4350 4.2 cpu, msi 970 gfx, 12gb ram, ksp runs on my ssd.\u003C/strong\u003E Here are things I have tried. EVERY possible combination of graphic settings with no results, changing settings in nvida control panel for ksp with no results, running the game in opengl with maybe 10 fps improvement (maxes at 25 on small craft),and \u00A0messed around with the cpu affinity for ksp with no results which I have read is pointless. The only thing that had a positive impact was changing the max physics delta slider to .03 which did give me a boost to about 33\u00A0fps in some instances, but usually dropped back down on landing maneuvers or take off. This is a definitely a cpu issue, correct? Any thoughts on ways I can improve this? Any input appreciated!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scifi6546","CreatedById":130550,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T01:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would try to install new drivers/os\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T01:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShouldn\u0027t be that low with that machine- is there a power saving mode in the OS to look into?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T01:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 years, have you always had this problem?

The game is, and always has been, CPU bottlenecked. Its not a matter of your GPU, or of ram, or of CPU cores amount. It always has been of max CPU processing speed. and unfortunately, KSP has been and keeps on being limited by its CPU clocking speed. U5 might bring some help with that, but KSP has always been limited by the max clock speed of single core CPUs, because the physics library of the unity engine is not thread safe on U4. U5 brings thread safety to the balance, but requires the physics calculations to be spread out manually across multiple frames, and this may not be an easy task. So all we can do for now is suck it up and wait for it to get better. Trust me, I\u0027m running clean installs of the game on intel i7-4790, GTX 960M, and 16Gb of ram, and still getting 8fps on launch usually.
