That\u0027s it; that\u0027s all the data we have. \n\nIt\u0027s easy to overinterpret these two numbers, when they\u0027re hyped up in this crazy way.\n\nThe other numbers are pure guesses. The density is a generic figure for rocky planets; the mass and surface gravity are derived from that (\u002B measured diameter) The temperature is a WAG. It\u0027s a simple toy radiative balance, like this one:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law#Temperature_of_the_Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law#Temperature_of_the_Earth)\n\nNo atmosphere is guessed at. We have no knowledge about the surface albedo, so that\u0027s a WAG as well (arbitrarily set equal to earth\u0027s albedo, 0.3).\n\nFun fact: if you calculate the ESI of Venus, using only the data available for 452b, the figure\u0027s about 0.95 (since all the knowledge about the greenhouse gets discarded). You can easily calculate this,\n\n[http://phl.upr.edu/projects/earth-similarity-index-esi](http://phl.upr.edu/projects/earth-similarity-index-esi)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T14:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T14:01:23Z","Content":"This is obviously an attempt at making this NASA\u0027s department more popular, to get more budget.
