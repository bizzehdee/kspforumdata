According to science you need more force to move an object of more mass which is just a given. So if you had a 50 ton space station orbiting Kerbin at 3000m/s it would sustain a steady orbit at its given altitude with the velocity it has right? Well what if you then took 30 tons off that station? Now the station weights in at only 20 tons, would it speed up because it still has the same amount of energy but less mass to move? Therefore it has energy to spare which it then puts into more speed increasing the orbit size?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not know if this is how orbits work or not but it made sense in my head at least, because if you remove weight from an object orbiting a body it still has the same amount of energy to push it on the orbital path it has to use it somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7499275\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tuguley","CreatedById":43744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T21:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour velocity will remain the same, just the energy of the main station would decrease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 30t chunk that falls off, will store that extra energy.

A satellite that started out in a elliptical orbit will get more elliptical if it\u0027s near periapsis and more circular if it\u0027s near apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the mass difference is big enough the system would also send some satellites out of the system. It\u0027d start with highly eccentric orbits with the sats near periapsis. But as you remove more mass even orbits that started out circular would eventually escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EGod I hope this is modeled in Planetary Annihilation.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T20:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AfailingHORSE\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AfailingHORSE\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGod I hope this is modeled in Planetary Annihilation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t tell me you spent $90 on that backwards priced, early-access game.
