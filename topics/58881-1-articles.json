His name was Jebediah \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem was, there was only one of him. Command knew that for their program to continue to be successful, they had to find a way to take the essence of Jeb and put it in to every flight system, every computer, every rocket and space plane. Cloning was not a concept that was understood by Kerbals, so they devised a new idea. Using scanning brainwave technology (and several invasive implants), Jebediah could sit comfortably in his big chair at Command and control spacecraft from afar, using the power of his mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this technology he helped land the first Kerbal on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XQV5uCql.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XQV5uCql.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EzjSvnJl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EzjSvnJl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis worked for a while, but still Jeb could only control one vessel at a time. So Command stepped in again, and compiled all of the data gathered from every flight controlled by Jeb.

Unable to scramble a mission to take the probe back to find out what went wrong, it simply carried out it\u0027s program, and burned for Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though he was surrounded by his colleges, Jeb felt cold and alone, saddened by the mission\u0027s failure. He fell in to a deep depression, had his brain probes removed, and quit his job at KSC. Over the course of the following month, Jeb dreamed of the stars. Every night the clearest and most vivid dreams of Kerbol and the infinite void taunted him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch jarred the feeble AI\u0027s systems, causing it to re-calibrate its sensors to the last known good configuration, Jeb\u0027s brainwave patterns. So harmoniously tuned was the probe that as it got caught in Eve\u0027s gravitational field Jeb lost his balance and fell in his apartment. Jeb shrugged it off as another case of the spins from drinking too much and passed out without giving it a second thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat night Jeb\u0027s dreams were different. His mind was filled with a great purple haze. As he tried to focus through the haze so did the probe, activating its sensors and extending its antennae. Soon, the haze cleared, and images of Eve filled Jeb\u0027s dream. He awoke in a blaze, taking notes and making calculations as his morning koffee brewed. Though he was still unaware of the connection, he knew we has now obsessed with Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2DSftj1l.png\u0022 alt=\u00222DSftj1l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-05T18:19:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2014 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KeithStone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jug head","CreatedById":84157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T03:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDun dun dun will jeb go to eve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KeithStone","CreatedById":71277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T18:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPart 1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Window of Opportunity\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonths passed. Kerbal Space Command ran numerous tests on new mechjeb autopilots and they all seemed to perform flawlessly. Confident in their work, they began to use the new mechjeb pods to assist in bringing up parts for a space station, and constructed it in orbit. The system seemed to work as designed, and KSC deemed their first probe\u0027s failure on comms systems or faulty wiring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah spent his time in wonder. Drawing plans for probes that could visit Eve\u0027s surface or mine Gilley for metal or kethane. He struggled with ways to get around Eve\u0027s immense gravity and thick atmosphere. His house filled with drawings, plans, calculations, and charts, but he knew it was foolhardy to think he could return to KSC with them.

The mechjeb, however, started to receive a signal from Eve. The encrypted transmission went unnoticed by ground control, and overrode the Landcaster\u0027s control and navigation functions. It locked the doors to the docking port and main hatch, and started draining the fuel from the station\u0027s toroidal stockpile.

I\u0027m going to keep this simple since we don\u0027t know a lot yet. The Landcaster just drained the orbital station of fuel, disengaged the docking port, and burned for Eve.
