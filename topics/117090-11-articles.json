Also, it helps to reduce the thrust on the SRBs to ~50% (1-minute duration).

No limitations or special treatment for textures. End caps get texture swapped at the same time as main tank segments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Likely will end up using existing texture switch, as there really is no cleaner way to do it; its just going to require 100\u002B lines per texture to define all the texture-mesh combinations; no way around it that I can see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E07.)

Data regarding resource volumes will be included in the map and density pulled from GameDatabase \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Alternatively, use a custom .cfg file to define resource volumes? IMHO these -REALLY- need to be defined in the game somewhere universal; preferably as part of the resource definition; otherwise you end up with the silly situation we have now (multiple volume units being used; 1l, 5l, 10l, 0.5l; its chaos)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.) Completely -remove- unused meshes after flight state is initialized (cannot swap length in flight, no need to store all the extra data). -Might- offer a slight optimization in memory use and object tracking overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Late additions--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.) Allow limiting main-tank variant availability by tech-tree-node; tank sizes can be unlocked by specific tech-tree nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.) Multi-attach node support for end-caps. Includes multi-orientation nodes. Want a 3-way hub on top of your tank and a flat adapter at the bottom? Sure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything obvious that I am missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill likely start on the prep work for this today -- adapting ResourceSwitch to accomodate multiple active tanks and fixing up the current MeshSwitch modules to make use of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent intent is to have this finished up and usable for this weekends\u0027 release.

However, as animations are attached to models/meshes, this should still be doable using traditional animation modules. As long as the animated part were always present (e.g. was a non-changable end-cap), there should be no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMini-Variants\u003C/strong\u003E - I\u0027m contemplating allowing swapping of fuel types of the end-caps separately from the main tank. That would be about as complex as is going to get though; adding any more \u0027optional mesh variant\u0027 type stuff would require explicit coding per-variant-type due to the whole height-offset needed for sub-models (such as end-caps).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECOM Offset\u003C/strong\u003E - Maybe. Will likely just ignore end-caps/nosecones for COM though. If I really wanted to go this route I would figure out the proper COM offset for the fuel in the tank (e.g. a LH2/O2 tank will be heavier on whichever end has the O2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConverter Module\u003C/strong\u003E - Likely not. Would require custom coding of the converter module to allow it to be disabled, custom coding of support for module switching, and add additional complexity to the config setup; and stock plugin code is mostly non-adaptable for these purposes (too many non-overridable methods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPassenger Sections\u003C/strong\u003E - -Might- be workable. Will give it some thought. The main problem would be swapping of the internal space definition (or removal if no passenger section); no idea if this is possible on-the-fly / at runtime. At the very least it would already be possible to define a crew count and internal space in the config that is applicable to all tanks, you would just be responsible for making sure the crew compartment was present in -all- of your models (e.g. I don\u0027t think it will be possible to have a single fuel tank part that has both crewed and non-crewed variants, or that has multiple IVA choices).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntegrated Docking Ports\u003C/strong\u003E - See the bit on converters above; even less possible with docking ports due to how tightly locked-down stock code is. Most importantly, there is no way to disable a docking port/module... so while I could properly move/position the transforms and model, I could not -remove- it. So, all of the fuel tanks would need the integrated docking port. Would already be possible to do this (always present docking ports) given planned code/layout - just build the docking port(s) into a single-non-swappable end-cap for the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional Node Groups\u003C/strong\u003E - I guess I don\u0027t see the point for a fuel tank? It has a top node, a bottom node, and a surface attach node. Adding anything else would really be going beyond the scope of a fuel tank. Would also greatly increase the complexity of the config setup (and plugin coding). I might be willing to look into adding multi-node support for each \u0027end\u0027 of the tank though. I can think of at least one use-case that I would possibly implement in the future (multi-tank cores; e.g. triple-tank core; would require multiple top and bottom nodes). Could also potentially be a case for an end-cap that is a multidirectional hub. Hmm... will see if I can get this worked in without too much overhead/complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027m trying to make a highly customizable -fuel- tank module, not the ultimate part-mesh-resource-texture-module-switch. I really -would- like to be able to create such a module (and would incorporate many of your ideas), but there are too many stock KSP/engine limitations that I cannot cleanly work around (such as runtime removal or disabling of PartModules).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VenomousRequiem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VenomousRequiem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a testing version of the texture switch stuff in the Drop Box folder?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope; as I have to update it manually, I will only be doing it when I do new releases.

Some notes on what I\u0027ve discovered:\u003Cp\u003E1) Drag cubes for variable parts are a major question. There is a way to dynamically re-render them. If you\u0027re only working with cylindrical (or anything right prism-like), then it might be possible to just scale certain numbers in the drag cube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Some animations, for instance, those on cargo bays, use multiple drag cubes (interpolating between them). This is even more difficult to support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If animations are supported, the same animation would need to be triggered across multiple models, which might require a bit of extra code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I don\u0027t know when/where Unity calculates MOI. Variable length parts seem to work fine for Procedural Parts so it might not be an issue but worth asking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) IVAs make crewed variants difficult - it might be possible to switch out the IVAs though\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) I\u0027ve already written a plugin, based on the work of snoj and bac9, which allows switching of resources, meshes, and nodes, and drawing resource amounts, tank masses, and tank costs from central definitions. You can find it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.

Yep, its pretty easy to recalc the drag-cube for a non-animated / simple part. Its pretty much DragCubeSystem.RenderDragCube(part). No point in rescaling them when re-rendering them properly is so easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Aye, animations are tricky, and the drag-cubes for animated parts even more so. Is one of the main reasons that I was questioning requests for animations on a fuel tank. Currently I have no plans to include animation support in the custom fuel tank module (or any other module-swapping support). At a time when stock supports run-time disabling of partModules I will revisit this. Would love to dynamically add/remove the modules as needed, but it is not cleanly possible in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) I believe it treats the part as if mass were evenly distributed across the render bounds. Haven\u0027t dug into it much, but it hasn\u0027t seemed to be needed to mess with it so far (if its even possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Aye. I\u0027m also not sure if \u0027crewCapacity\u0027 is a persistent variable that is saved out in the persistence file for a part; would hate to accidentally vent someones crew when KSP re-initializes the part with 0 crew capacity before my module could \u0027fix\u0027 it. Should still be possible with the caveats I had posted above -- the crew compartment would need to always be present in the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) Sounds interesting, and right in line with some of what I am trying to accomplish. Will certainly take a look at it.

Lets see what the KSP 1.05 / SSME looks/performs like; supposed to be optimal for building kerbalized shuttles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that -should- be able to be fixed. Best part, it can be done entirely in the config! Move the attach node downward, move the bottomY of the upper fairing portion down by the same amount, and move the top and bottomY of the lower fairing down by the same amount, and finally adjust down the bottomY of the side-panel fairings to line up with the bottomY of the top fairing portion. You are more than welcome to have a go at it if you would like. Will add it to the issues list though and mark it for this week, so I should be able to have it for next update. Will only apply to newly built vessels; already constructed vessels would end up with some messed up looking fairings (but would be otherwise perfectly functional).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022riocrokite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022riocrokite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethis is a part-o-bonanza !

Hopefully it should help out with vessel part count a bit in the end. Adapters at least are a good thing for me; I always skip them on my craft due to them being an unecessary/function-less part (unless I actually need the length). Thankfully most of these are quick/easy parts that shouldn\u0027t take me too long to get done acceptably. Hoping to wrap up all the fuel tanks/adapters stuff this week (as well as a bit more work on some of the other unfinished stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, hearing of KSP 1.05 makes me sad. It is a good thing that they are releasing what they can as it is available, but the (mod) community -really- needs 64bit support. And I was (almost) looking forward to being able to finally do a bit more complex GUI work (have been holding off in favor of the new unified GUI system, have a few planned parts/features that will need more GUI than can be done with stock right-click stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
