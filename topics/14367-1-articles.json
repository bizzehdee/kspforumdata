What if you had to plan your entire mission from the \\\u0027control room\\\u0027 and then \\\u0027program\\\u0027 the on-board computer to execute maneuvers in a set sequence and at an exact time?

You would have to think ahead and plan for every action the craft needs to take during the flight, get the sequence right and the timing as well. For total realism, once you planned your flight and programmed your computer, you\\\u0027d just initiate the launch and then sit back and watch the execution to see if you messed up or not. Did you forget to circularise or orbit? Did you mistime the injection? Did you choose a bad landing spot? When things go wrong, you can jump in and fix it but that would be kinda cheating right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I\\\u0027ve done - geek zone only from here on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve downloaded autohot key which is a free program that lets you \\\u0027script\\\u0027 keyboard commands. You can automate a whole range of manual keyboard commands so that the computer presses the right key at the right time without anyone being at the keyboard. I\\\u0027ve used this program to \\\u0027fly\\\u0027 my craft. I\\\u0027ve designed a script that presses the space bar to launch. 125 seconds later it presses the space bar again to separate my bottom stage. At 17:00 it executes a Mun injection burn without me pressing a key.

I\\\u0027ll include a log of my failed missions as I attempt to plan the perfect flight profile. This isn\\\u0027t about having the script do it all for me, it\\\u0027s about me trying to plan out an entire mission from beginning to end - like they did in the old days, fire the rocket, cross your fingers and hope you thought of every last detail because if I didn\\\u0027t, that rocket is splashing down!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T13:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMission profile: To deliver a flag of my nationality to the Mun and to return to Kerbin without loss of life (counter-intuitive, I know).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission parameters: The mission is to be flown with zero intervention, that is, to be pre-programmed from launch to touchdown using key-press scripts and mission timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) engage mechjeb with preset parameters.
