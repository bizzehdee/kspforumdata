But I\u0027ve just stated incorporating docking into my game (thank you Fine Print for giving me a reason). The translation keys I find to be very confusing. However I can EVA kerbals like a champ. Is there a way to make translation be the EVA keys? Or is there something more fundamental that I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T05:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, there is a docking mode which causes the staging button (space bar default) to switch between translation and rotation. It\u0027s one of the little buttons down on the lower left. This has a problem of accidental staging if you don\u0027t switch it an think you have though. This is just personal opinion, but you should train yourself to use IJKL. Really once you have the rotation lined up, you don\u0027t need WSAD at all, so you can move your left hand over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T05:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can remap the controls to whatever keys you\u0027d like by going to the sub-pages of the settings screens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T06:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are using RCS to move around, try hitting \u0027V\u0027 to cycle between camera views to chase view.
