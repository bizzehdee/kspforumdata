I created a new career game and unlocked serval parts already. Still, I have no idea how to use them properly. I\u0027ve watched a few videos, but the good tutorials are very scarce. I\u0027ve read the Wikia page. I\u0027ve tried it a bit but for some reasons I can\u0027t do anything with that mod that would be worth it. I know it\u0027s a great mod with great possibilities, but seriously the best I can do is rocket that has virtually no delta v and can gain about 1 m/s every few seconds. I can\u0027t launch anything using Interstellar parts; I can only use them on my last stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can either help me or give me a link to an actual good tutorial?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEngines/thrusters can use different types of fuel, yet I can only manage to use LFO or Liquid and they are far from efficient.

I get it that reactors generate energy. How is this energy used I have no idea and why is it even useful to have them considering I get 1 m/s per second acceleration, I have no idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI know that you can attach an electric power generator to your reactor.
