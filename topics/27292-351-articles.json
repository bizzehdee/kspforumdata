Tried to keep the cost down by making the rocket rather cheap. First I figured out the cheapest tanks by fuel volume: the X200-32, then the FL-T100 (can\u0027t remember if I checked the Kerbodyne ones... According to the wiki, they are all 2600, regardless of size, which is still more costly by fuel volume than the X200-32, but cheaper than the FL-T100). The LFB is a cheap launch rocket: if you subtract the fuel cost (as two X200-32 tanks), you end up with an engine for 700, which is cheaper than the LV-909.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, either the wiki is wrong, or my game has a bad price assignment on the lander can. Just to check, is it over 1000? Wiki says \u0022no\u0022, but I think my game says \u0022actually over 3000\u0022, so I went with the command pod Mk1, which is cheapest.

Also got rid of several of the struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LFB/X200-32 lifter core also provided the burn to get an encounter, though not enough remained to get the Mun orbit. I also burned from there directly to landing, cutting the crasher stage loose very near the ground with over a full FL-T100 left. That\u0027s why the version after had one cut out - and with the mass reductions, it still had over a full FL-T100 in it when cut free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/zGAY8K.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zGAY8K.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt landed fine, and the return was also fine, though I needed to use almost half of the monopropellant to bring the Kerbin periapse into atmosphere.
