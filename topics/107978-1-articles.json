Many sites [list the project as a \u0022replica\u0022](http://www.archaeology.org/news/3265-150505-alexandria-lighthouse-replica) so I believe the plan is to be pretty historically accurate.

From then until the completion of the Washington Monument (capped in 1884) the world\u0027s tallest buildings were churches or cathedrals. Later, the Eiffel Tower and, still later, some radio masts and television towers were the world\u0027s tallest structures.\n\u003E \n\u003E **However, though all of these are structures, some are not buildings in the sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied**. It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term \u0022building\u0022 is generally understood to mean when determining what is the world\u0027s tallest building. The non-profit international organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings, defines \u0022building\u0022 as \u0022structure that is designed for residential, business or manufacturing purposes\u0022 that \u0022has floors\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E Tall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground: their lower areas are regularly occupied, but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which aren\u0027t. Whether a church or cathedral is a \u0022building\u0022 or merely a \u0022structure\u0022 for the purposes of determining the title of \u0022world\u0027s tallest building\u0022 is a **subjective matter of definition.**\n\n![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) :P ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) :P maybe you are right, maybe I am, still really cool that this is happening.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Will they be using the original techniques?\n\nI know nothing else other than what I\u0027ve shared here.
