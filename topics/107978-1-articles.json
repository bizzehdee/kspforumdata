From then until the completion of the Washington Monument (capped in 1884) the world\u0027s tallest buildings were churches or cathedrals.

It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term \u0022building\u0022 is generally understood to mean when determining what is the world\u0027s tallest building. The non-profit international organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings, defines \u0022building\u0022 as \u0022structure that is designed for residential, business or manufacturing purposes\u0022 that \u0022has floors\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground: their lower areas are regularly occupied, but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which aren\u0027t.
