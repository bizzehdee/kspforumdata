I launched a probe to Duna with a ISAMapsat module and a Kethane scanner to scan ahead for my station and refueler I was sending behind it, about 30 Kerbal days between launches. My probe had completed it scans of Duna and had been moved to orbit Duna\u0027s moon, Ike, to begin scanning there as well. Enter stage left, my station is now approaching Duna encounter and I begin the deceleration burn to attain orbit. As planned, I missed Ike in the maneuver but plowed right through my orbiting probe, destroying both ships in the process. I guess it really is a small world after all! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately I have learned from past mistakes to quicksave before performing a maneuver so I was able to recover from this interesting little encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T23:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was very ... lucky for you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T23:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrap man.
