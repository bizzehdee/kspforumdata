So far I have been greatly enjoying the 1.0; however I have recently encountered a problem. I have always been a big base builder and enjoy setting up stations and bases at every body I visit. I know that I can keep the stations and bases empty however I do not enjoy doing so and I tend to keep them at least 60% full. However, the new update has made this impractical due the exorbitant costs of new crew members (Three new members and I am already low of funds). Simple question: Is there a setting I can change, a mod I can install or a cheat I can use to work around this issue for me? My dream plan would be to establish a 100 crew base on Laythe (I am a long way off however!) Thank you, please help."},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T20:40:37Z","Content":"Neither a mod nor a cheat, but kerbals that you rescue from wherever via contracts becomes part of your roster.
