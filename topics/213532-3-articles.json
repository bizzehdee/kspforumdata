Maybe even \u0026gt;60, but I\u0027m not sure. On the space center screen, and when launching and landing or looking at a celestial body from orbit for any other reason, you\u0027ll tank to between 20 and 30 FPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s for 1080p. On 720p you might barely approach 30 FPS in some, but not all of those bad situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReason is the 6GB VRAM on your video card, and KSP2 using an extremely performance intensive way to render planet surfaces at the moment. This chokes out any video card with 6 GB or lower, especially on 1080p and up, regardless of what graphics settings you choose. I\u0027ve got a 1060 6GB, same VRAM but slower GPU, and that GPU isn\u0027t even being fully loaded because the card is desperately out of memory at all times. Your card has a fair amount more memory bandwidth, which will definitely help alleviate some symptoms, but it won\u0027t change the fact that the VRAM is too small for the game to run well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you can do what I\u0027m doing - plan an upgrade in the next months - or hold off on buying the game until a few more patches have gone down the road. Performance already improved a bit going from initial release to the first patch. Intercept Games are also already trialing a replacement for the planetary surface renderer, but I would be surprised if it came out before summer. Such fundamental revamps take time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour CPU and memory are fine.

A 3060 non-Ti with its 12GB will run that game better than a more expensive 3060 Ti, or even a 3070, with their 8! And that\u0027s not an outlier, but merely one example among a growing series of recent and upcoming PC releases where currently available video cards will run out of VRAM long before they run out of raw rendering power. Nvidia has been sitting on essentially the same VRAM setup for the past five years, with only a few outliers like the aforementioned 3060 12GB, and minor increases here and there. The 4070 series finally got bumped up from 8 to 12 GB, but only because there was a excrementsstorm after Nvidia originally tried to release the card that now became the 4070 Ti under a 4080 name. With 12GB, if you can imagine that. And still, most gaming hardware review outlets agree that in their testing, they found cases where the 4070 Ti already can\u0027t use its GPU power because it runs out of VRAM. With \u003Cem\u003Etoday\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E games. Nevermind the future. And nevermind the 4060 series, where even the Ti variant looks to be getting only 8GB. Like the 3060 Ti before it.

Not just KSP2. Heck, if KSP2 can remain at the current 8GB for 1080p and 10GB for 1440p recommendations by the time it releases in two years or so, it\u0027ll be considered downright \u003Cem\u003Efrugal\u003C/em\u003E compared to its contemporaries. And even then, slap another 4 to 6 GB on top for if you want to run any graphics mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd why should Nvidia care? They do have a 24 GB card for sale if you really want one! Step right up and buy, only two thousand bucks!

The market runner up is sitting on a single compelling new-generation product, which just so happens to also be the maximum price, maximum margin, luxury halo item in their lineup, plus another card that\u0027s intentionally positioned so poorly on the market that its whole purpose is upselling the customer to the aforementioned halo card, and just refuses to release anything else.
