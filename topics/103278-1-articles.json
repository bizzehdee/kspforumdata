I had an issue where games loaded slowly because I had them installed on an external hard drive which was very slow. Made one game unplayable. I never noticed the issue because it only happened in online games for some reason.\n\nKSP could be experiencing a similar issue."},{"CreatedByName":"theperson0719","CreatedById":76705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T02:21:56Z","Content":"KSP is installed on the C:/ drive.
