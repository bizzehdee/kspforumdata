The second planet though, is \u0022strangely purple\u0022 and has a thick atmosphere. The third planet is what scientists have been dreaming for for years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrahe-45-C has a breathable atmosphere with the same thickness as Earth\u0027s atmosphere. It also apparently is in the habitable zone, and contains liquid oceans. However, it is 10x smaller than Earth. \u0022This is groundbreaking. No planet has been so similar to Earth, but at such a miniscule size,\u0022 Linus de Vringen, the director of the Brahe program said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the planets are a different story. The fourth planet is a red rocky planet with thin atmosphere, and the fifth planet is a large green gas giant with many moons. There is also a smaller icy dwarf planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlans are already being created to send a probe to this star system, using the ITS-FTL\u002B launch vehicle from SpaceX. Scientists are all looking for what\u0027s next, because this could be very exciting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
