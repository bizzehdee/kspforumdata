I got a good design I like. So I then build a rocket to get it there. All of my launches ended the same way. The rocket would start tilting west. Then it would start tilting north a few seconds later. ASAS, Retraction Wheels, and RCS are not enough to keep it straight, even with me pushing the buttons to point it the other direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it might be an aerodynamics issue. In the VAB, I enable the two buttons for center of mass and center of lift. The center of gravity is slightly off center to the right of the center of mass. The center of thrust is off center to the left of the center of mass, and pointing slightly to the left. I use symmetry mode when building rockets, and this was no exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the rover itself might\u0027ve been the problem. I built a small rocket with the rover to see if the effects stayed. The rocket flew pretty straight. I removed the rover completely from the problematic rocket. SAS and RCS were enough to keep it straight, so I disabled them. When I did, the rocket did pretty much what it had been doing, but to a lesser extreme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to see if it\u0027d make a difference, I added 6 multiconnection ports (each with mass 1.6) and the only thing that changed was the center of mass. I didn\u0027t fly it, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post the craft files tomorrow, but what are your first thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-03T16:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2014 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by deltalambdamu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T04:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures (or a craft file) would definitely help in troubleshooting. Pictures are usually preferred, especially if you have any mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when putting a rover on top of a rocket, it\u0027s pretty common for it to be out of balance. While the rover was built in the SPH with symmetry, it will still generally be asymmetric in the up/down direction. When you then strap it on top of a rocket, it can cause problems. The other thing is that if you put all that mass on top of a rocket, it will sometimes cause it to want to flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you really need is for the Center of Thrust (the pink marker) to be directly in line with the Center of Mass (the yellow marker).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I know you said you have reaction wheels and RCS, but you may want to consider adding fins to the bottom.

Shifted centers of mass, lift and thrust can cause all sorts of problems. I am curious how this can happen though. Are you using any procedural parts mods? I have experienced things with procedural wings and symmetry where the center of lift will go slightly left or right for apparently no good reason. I click the part, remove it and reattach it and the problem apparently solves itself. I blame a bug in the mod. Are you using any aerodynamic rules changer mods? Ferram Aerospace can cause all sorts of stuff to act differently than it does in the stock game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using 3-way symmetry? Are all your engines of the same type? Are all your fuel tanks the same mass? The last question may hold the cause of the off center mass. If you right clicked a fuel tank and dragged one of the sliders down by accident and didn\u0027t realize you had done it, that would throw off your weight distribution and possibly your engine burn times depending on your design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Claw beat me to this suggestion by one minute LOL!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, try adding fins to the bottom.
