Use a laser to ablate part of the debris, which causes a little thrust and a change of orbit. If you did it right, the new orbit will have a lower apoapsis and decay rapidly. If your laser is powerful enough, you don\u0027t even need to focus and aim precisely, and you can \u0027sweep\u0027 a number of debris at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas most space debris is just that, debris, bits and pieces of rocket fairings, spent stages, stuff like that, utterly useless to have a solution like yours that require something to be attached to it in just the right spot that something else can latch on to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only are there many thousands of bits already up there that don\u0027t have that attachment, and as Idobox points out the accuracy required would be insane (remember those pieces are tumbling out of control as is), but adding those things to everything launched in the future would be prohibitively expensive.
