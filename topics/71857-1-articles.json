I did have some flipouts, but that was more to do with me doing attitude control manouvers at high speed and with physics warp on. Probably also doesn\u0027t help that the center of drag is so far forward, but that\u0027s what all the yaw control is for. I did recover from all the flipouts and bad (and somewhat intoxicated) piloting will not stop me from declaring this mission a success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to have lost the craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...whoops\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
