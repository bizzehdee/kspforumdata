This will take time though since I am still trying to fix the issues here, if anyone wants to beat me too it they are very welcome, like I said before the VesselManager.cs in my source code contains all the orbital manipulations, for Remote Tech the only thing that would need to be changed would be to fix the Semi Major axis, eccentricity and inclination to a fixed (input) value from the user, all other values could automatically update whenever, this would (if active on all vessels in a network) completely reduce the floating point drift errors that eventually cause precise geostationary orbits to move out of alignment. So it would solve alot of remote tech issues!

I believe that if only there was a way to access the games \u0027orbital calculator\u0027 and effect changes here rather than beyond, changes such as decay would be as smooth as an asteroid passing through the Kerbin system, sadly it is the position forcing (which causes a save to the persistence file every time individually rather than in bulk) that causes the lag spikes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The lag is what has caused me to loose focus on this mod since it is pretty much unavoidable, it all depends on whether the end user wants a smooth system where each vessel appears to visually decay (necessary for time warp without causing large jumps) or if the user doesn\u0027t mind the decay only occurring on each auto save/day update or whatever. I know how annoying it is, I have devised a system of updating the vessels at intervals equal to the number of vessels in orbit, this means that if you have say 3 vessels, every 3 seconds there will be an update (with only a minor drop in frames) and if you have 200 vessels there will be an update every 3 and a half minutes that causes a big lag spike for a few seconds, I am unsure how well this will work though. I have not lost interest in this mod I am simply waiting for a good idea to come along that will make it more playable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything being said, eventually I will create a version 1.1.0 which will fix the issues in StationKeeping (vessel fuel transfer between decouplers) and the lag in the station keeping menu) and will maybe switch to a bulk process rather than individual decay processes which causes continuous lag. Of course the switch to Unity 5 will almost certainly effect this mod and as such Orbital Decay may become impossible in the future. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E This mod is just a mess at the moment, I will probably rebuild the entire code for the 1.1.0 release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadLeo","CreatedById":107972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T19:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that I use Scansat and Remote Tech, therefore having a huge number of satellites everywhere, putting a big load on the calc your mod does, as you said. If you could set it to the player to decide whether to update its vessels orbits and when, it could avoid lag in crucial gameplay moments. For instance, if I could say to the mod to update all my vessels orbits right on the KSC screen, when I\u0027m not flying anything and can wait a minute or two with lag, and then have the mod to sleep until I manually update it again or for a pre-programmed time, then that would be fine to me.

I have come up with three methods of lag busting decay (the third being the most recent inspiration!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Batch adjust all vessel orbits at a rate determined by the current number of vessels (the current method -not popular!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Adjust vessel orbits only on a scene load, autosave and exit. (Smoother but no nice decays visible in timewarp, this would also cause issues with the Resource Handling code)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor 3. Retain method 1 for the map and tracking station views (smooth decays visible) and retain method 2 for everything else except the active vessel (which would decay normally). This would require some coding to remember temporary positions but it may be much less straining on the system (since heavy lag doesnt effect the TrackingStation that much, although some issues with the map view may occour (maybe only use method 1 for vessels inside the SOI of the map view target reference body? - still wouldnt be that great for Kerbin views since you\u0027re more likely to have a set of satellites in Kerbin SOI than anywhere else! - but... if they are station keeping then they would be skipped by the decay code anyway... hmmm \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes! Work is going to recontinue upon release of 1.1, although if there is no update by the beggining of December I will update this to a 1.0.4 to implement method 3, I will also fix the irritating UI, GUI Icon and unneccessary menu lag issues that have popped up! Bad Leo has also mentioned some good points which I shall include if method 3 fails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, my priorities lie with my Contract Packs and plugins right now rather than Orbital Decay simply because I do not want to invest time into a system that may break within two KSP updates (1.0.5 and 1.1)! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhitecat \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T06:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen waiting for a mod like this!
