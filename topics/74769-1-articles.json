In an effort to add some fresh competition to the group I issued the \u0022GopherCraft Great Space Challenge!\u0022 We are all pretty new to KSP but this should still be a fun challenge to play and enjoy watching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Play Kerbal Space Program in Career Mode without any mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Record our gameplay \u0026amp; keep track of time (Using the in game clock/calendar to help with this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. We can edit, cut video as needed but post in game calendar timestamps or date/time updates in our videos for competitive tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. First player to land on the mun, walk on the surface of the mun \u0026amp; successfully return their mission crew to Kerbin in the shortest amount of time wins. Only the crew from your succesful mun mission must be returned to win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Players are allowed to play the tutorials as much as they want to increase game ability during this contest but must only use one career save for competition purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Post at least one video per week during the contest time. Posting a successful video before everyone else doesn\u0027t necessarily make you a winner, the time/date in-game will be the deciding factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Begin posting videos as soon/as often as we like but need to post our first video by the 16th of June 2014 and at least one video each week after. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Quicksaves are allowed but only to load if game crashes or freaks. Player\u0027s poor design or implementation doesn\u0027t get them a do over. You mess up, you leave it in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Players: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoti Garbidis \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/scotigarbidis\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/scotigarbidis\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGopherBoy \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/g0pherb0y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/g0pherb0y\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasketMC \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/nathanpelton\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/nathanpelton\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPikerize \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/pikerize\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/pikerize\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
