Generally if you make a multi-stage rocket that can lift off from Eve, it will be able to make it to Kerbin orbit with staging inhibited and by transferring upper stage fuel into the lower stages, effectively making it an SSTO. Then you can refuel it and send it to Eve, and it can perform its intended staging there. This is really the only use I can think of for this technique.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T16:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thomas988\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thomas988\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWait, did I read that correctly?

Scott Manley even had a video on it a couple years ago. You have 2 tanks separated some distance apart by structure and only enough fuel for 1 tank. You start the ship rotating in pitch or yaw. As the empty tank rotates towards the direction you wish to move, you pump fuel into it. This moves the ship\u0027s COM in the desired direction of travel. Because physics treats the ship as a point at its COM location, you have effectively moved the ship by however much you just moved its COM. Repeat pumping from full tank to empty tank as the empty tank rotates toward the desired direction. It doesn\u0027t provide much thrust but if you have patience, you can actually make a significant maneuver this way for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
