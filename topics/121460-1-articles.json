Pol can be done with a jetpack, and Ike is close enough to the sun for the ion lander to land without depleting its batteries. Only Vall, Tylo, and Laythe will use a full tank.

The LF lander landed on Bop and they returned to low Tylo orbit to meet the mothership, using up 3/4 of a tank of Xenon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u0027re gonna make it! The mothership has some 3500 dV left, enough to go to Eeloo and then head home.
