My Minmus rover recently had a near-fatal tumble because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde on my rovers, so that if it flips, it will point itself right and level itself, and I just need to roll it wheels down. Well, I was driving up a very tall mountain, pretty fast, and when I crossed 3km altitude, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E switched to \u0027orbit\u0027, with Prograde somewhere far off. The rover immediately turned to the new direction, and rapid turns at that speed are definitely not advisable. Never mind it fought me when I wanted to turn it so that it doesn\u0027t land sideways. Took me a while to notice what happened; I switched to Surface manually literally at the last possible moment, barely managing to save it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
