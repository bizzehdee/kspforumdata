Too bad I have not been able to a hold of his books by now. I\u0027ll see to remedy that asap. Meanwhile, here are my opinions on Mars Direct:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Mars Direct sounds as a solid plan, better than most, semi direct more so, regarding safety. There are some hurdles along the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Unfortunately, it seems it is to late for quick and dirty development of an STS derived vehicle, suc as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIRECT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJupiter of the DIRECT\u003C/a\u003E proposal, so we are probably stuck with SLS and/or something new, and hopefully cheaper. Up to two or three docking launches might be acceptable: one for Earth departure stage, one for trans-Martian habitat and Mars orbit insertion stage and the third just for the crew. With a bigger launch vehicle, you might get all that launched on one really superheavy launch vehicle such as an SLS BlockII was planed.. (not sure if they still have Block II in the foreseeable future). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Sabateur converter has not been tested in Martian atmosphere. It should require a dedicated robotic mission to be done. The part I am most concerned about is supplying enough empty tanks to the converter as well as landing a large volume of liquid hydrogen without rupturing the tank. ~8 tons or about 85 cubic meters! Alternative is an automated system for extracting water from Mars surface and supplying it to the converter which will extract H2 and O2 from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The mission design calls for a 50-100 kW reactor that should work in Martian atmosphere. AFAIK we do not have a working design for such a machine. OTOH, even with a 25kWe reactor on Mars the mission should be doable, while a smaller design, such as a modified Topaz II with a decent turbine or a Stirling engine might work for a prototype. I do not know enough thermodynamics to judge whether cooling at such low atmospheric pressure should pose a significant problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The heaviest payload that we have landed on Mars is ~1 ton. How do we land a 20t habitat and a huge Mars Return Vehicle in the same weight class but with a huge volume and height? There might be some significant challenges to developing a heat shield and parachutes for that. There might be some merit in propulsive landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Radiation. That is a big scarecrow, or as Zubrin would say: \u0022a dragon to be slayed\u0022. We do not need much more than several long term missions beyond the Van Allen belts to prove and IMPROVE our knowledge about radiation shielding both from cosmic rays and solar flares. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Life support. We need high efficiency to keep the mission weight down. That is especially important for O2 and H2O. Food should not be an issue as it is routinely packed to high nutrition/weight ratio. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Doublecheck everything to see if that fits into mass limits of a 20-30ton landing habitat and MAV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Methane engines. No, seriously, liquid methane engines have never been in serial production, so if you want them to be reliable, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther challenges include selection and development of rovers, making a choice of Habitat\u002BRover or just a bigass rover, (re)development of NERVas, choice of fuel for EDS depending on the mission architecture (any docking/orbital assembly operation will most certainly be better done with hypergorlics, and a single launch mission would be doable with hydrolox. There is a big mass penalty for hypergorlics. ); building a global survey and navigation network, testing a tether system for artificial gravity to confirm mass and reliability etc. Oh, and one more problem: wee need vehicles with long term storage capability in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum it up, you need several precursor missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 or 2 - sabateur converter, tanks and reactor test on mars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Mars landing mission with heavy, bulky payloads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethane engine testing and development, HLV, and a small station in high Earth orbit with several crews staying up for 6-24 months at a time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am certain that all that should be doable within a decade provided sufficient motivation and financing. HLV might be a problem that could only be solved in a CCDEV way.

It\u0027s Humanity\u0027s effort to keep 7 humans alive in space. It took a huge effort and decades of international cooperation to build, yet it needs regular maintenance and logistics flight just to keep those 7 people alive. To make a self-sufficient colony, you would need thousands of people, something on the scale of 150 times the effort that was needed to build the ISS. And you need the resources to fling all that infrastructure not just to 400km above us, but to another freaking planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd who is going to pay for a self-sufficient colony on Mars ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Elon Musk ?

It was interestign to see the VHS video of its first presentation. Really puts into perspective how old this plan is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I\u0027ve always liked it, but with a big grain of salt. Basically, Zubrin\u0027s margin are so razor-tight, and his mass assumptions so optimistic, that I seriously doubt it is realistic. With a bigger booster and doubling most mass figures? Maybe. I still think the ERV to return to Earth is going to be a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E tight space to spend month on the way back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I think it\u0027s biggest merit is to show that you don\u0027t really need a \u0022Battlestar Gallactica\u0022 approach, with thousands of tonnes launched to LEO in order to get going. Basically, what you really need is the capability to put 20-50mT payloads on a Mars-bound trajectory, and preposition supplies every launch window. In fact, the thing I like the most about it is that is form a true exploration campaign, with a cadence of regular missions that increase the amount of hardware on the ground every two years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how would I do it? Well, I would launch bigger payloads for starters. A standard of 100mT would probably do, I think you can put in there either a Hab \u002B lander, or a surface hab \u002B ISRU unit (to produce fuel for ascent, that would prove itself before a crewed mission leaves of course). Capturing into a highly elliptical orbit on Mars, delta-v requirements for the orbit-orbit leg of the mission are reasonable, going down to Mars from there is only a matter of using the atmosphere to slow you down, and going back up you can use locally produced fuel. That way you absolutely slash the total delta-v budget for the trip, and still each leg of the trip is within the realm of what a single-stage reusable vehicle could do. Ok, maybe the Earth-Mars leg asks for nukes, but if you make your departure from L2, even chemical engines should be able to do it in a single stage. In any case, even disposable chemical transfer stages would do. You have to launch twice as many? Great, more business to lower the price per kg to low earth orbit... \u003Cem\u003Eand it will still be cheaper than developing the monster rocket that can do the mission in less launches\u003C/em\u003E. That is a mighty important point, imagine the mass that could have been lofted to LEO for what SLS has eaten to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way the whole infrastructure is reusable, and all you have to do to keep on going with the missions is to lift up new payloads and fuel each time to your initial staging point.... with a variety of rockets allowing international cooperation to share the costs. And minimal development costs, mostly for the Mars-dedicated hardwre. Also, note that you can prove the whole orbital thing with a flight to Mars orbit (or an asteroid) before you develop the surface elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat NASA should do if they were serious about going to Mars is to develop the long-stay interplanetary Habs that they need to make the trip, and the transfer stages to push them around. Instead, they are following the incredibly expensive ion route, that even in the best of cases won\u0027t really solve anything (ion engines don\u0027t cut the travel time because their thrust is tiny, and they don\u0027t really cut weight either because their powerplants are huge, the only thing that they do well for human spaceflight is to burn a lot of money). If they really wanted to develop the engine that would open the solar system to humans, they would be working of nuclear engines: high isp, high thrust propulsion that allow single stages to... anywhere? It can certainly allows a round trip to Mars in a single stage. In any case, for Mars you don\u0027t really need either, the delta-v budget is really not much over what a lunar flight entails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the \u0022dragons\u0022 along the way (i.e: radiation and microgravity), there I completely concur with Zubrin: they have been blown completely out of proportion, and are not really show-stoppers... unless you want political justifications to not go. Landing big payloads on Mars is bit of a tougher nut to crack, but F9 actually shows that supersonic retro-propulsion is not an impossible technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is to start building the things you really need, if you want to do this. An ISRU demonstrator, use it for a sample return mission. Big transfer stages, test them by launching a probe to the outer solar system faster than it could have gotten there otherwise (extra points if you recover it by slowing it down after it accelerates and releases the payload). Long duration habitats, initially test them in LEO where rescue is immediate, then move to cislunar space, then out to NEOs, doing awesome crewed missions with a decent science component along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the things NASA would be doing, if they where seriously thinking about gong to Mars. And they don\u0027t even need a much bigger budget that what developing SLS and ORION takes right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Instead of the ERV being used for going from Mars to Earth, you could use the ERV to go to a mothership in orbit.\u003Cp\u003EBut if you ask me? I think going anywhere besides Earth Orbit and the Moon is going to take a multi-stage transfer stage, unless it\u0027s nuclear. Just look at the average amount of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efood\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E per year one person needs. It\u0027s about a metric ton unless you want to ration it. If you get light astronauts you might be able to get nearly half that. But that\u0027s per year. How many years for a round-trip Mars mission? 3 to 5 years? That\u0027s a few tons of just the food per person on your voyage. That could translate to a heck of a lot of tons of propellant on your transfer stage. Then you have an entire habitat, with everything that entails. Plus space radiation, micro gravity, and all that jazz. While they are blown out of proportion, they are things that need to be worked on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I say the BG way is the best way. If you\u0027re going to do it, why not just full blown conquer the place? It\u0027s not the most friendly environment, but neither was, well, quite a few places on Earth. And the BG way has it\u0027s advantages: If one ship has a problem, the others can help. You\u0027re not alone anymore. And if you make it so each ship is operating at 3/4 capacity, then quite a few ships could break down and the crew could be saved within minutes. And then maybe the problem can be diagnosed and they can repair it with a supply ship? Sure it\u0027s big. But in the long run, it increases success and makes the journey not so scary anymore knowing you have other crews just a few hundred meters away (if they hold formation... which they should).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars DIRECT is a plan for, well, something not so grand. And if your transfer vessel screws up there\u0027s no one to save you. DIRECT is just another solution to a problem at hand. There are many, and DIRECT shouldn\u0027t be considered a savior when it comes to going to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much \u002B1. But mind you, you don\u0027t really need a huge transfer stage to move large payloads: you just need a lot of small ones, and then you use a bunch of them together, or you launch a small armada in every window. That way you don\u0027t have to develop a monster launcher, and you actually amortize you initial development investment sooner.

Man that is huge... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of ways to go about doing a lot of things. Do you mean using a bunch of smaller transfer stages strapped together to act as a big one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s another thing: Why is payload per launch so important? I mean, for the cost of one SLS launch you could launch almost the same payload with other launch vehicles, all in one year. So, maybe payload per year is better? In that case, SLS would be about 70 tonnes/yr, (the average person eats about that much mass of food in his/her whole lifetime, woah!). If we used the average estimates for SLS launch costs, or about 2.75 billion US dollars per launch (wikipedia data), and assuming one launch per year at 70 tonnes per launch... Then you could launch about 7 DIVHs for that cost. That\u0027s 201 tonnes/yr! Of course, this is dependent on future data, which we don\u0027t have. And I doubt the DIVH facilities are able to handle that much use. But what if the money used for developing SLS was used instead to allow the much more economical option of revamping the logistics to allow for almost 7 DIVH launches per year? We would be on Mars in a decade, by my estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
