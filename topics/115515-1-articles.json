It tends to tumble a little bit on re-entry once it slows down to around 400ms but recovers pretty easily. Save at least 10 mono for final approach just incase the nose dips down a little (it\u0027s *slightly* nose heavy if you land with something in the cargo bay, and empty LOX tanks in the back).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T00:40:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 12:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**"}]}
