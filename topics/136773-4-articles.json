The density at earths orbit is 1E9kg/4pi*150000000000^2 = 3.5E-15 per square meter transient or 2.4E-20/cubic meter. Why I throw out this trivia is that a craft traveling at 0.2c, the solar winds are all but a static drag force. So if the sail was 4 square meters, and travel 60,000,000 meters per second it would encounter 5.76x 10-12 kg of protons/second which would deflect around the sail as it built up positive charge (more so than the payload because of its size). The differential energy is 1.8E15/kg therefore the and if we assumed that in deflection 10% of the photons energy was transferred, then we would see an energy in the form of sun facing force on the sail of\u00A0 1036 joules/second (basically a kilowatt). The work done per unit time is F*d and interaction distance is 60,000,000 then the force 17 micronewtons per kilogram mass, and so if the whole device weights a gram its 17 ma of acceleration which declines at the k * SQRT(d\u003Csub\u003Esun\u003C/sub\u003E/150,000,000,000) .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom line is that the device will turn, the convex surface of the sail will face the sun, because there is gas density all the way to \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003EC, it will stay facing the sun, any signal it sends will be sent away from the sun. The only way to stop this is to charge the sail so that it bottom is negatively charge and top is positively charged, since the sail is decelerating and the payload is not the sail would fall into the center of the payload and the sail would collapse around the payload reducing the force. To prevent this the payload would need to be positively charged to push it away from the sail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey transmit only\u00A0in one direction, so is not a connection link. \u00A0You can not sent info or ask anything.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe normal distance between sails will be neptune to earth distance, but they should be able to transmit 5 times that distance\u00A0in case something happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey want to keep this project between the 100 billion margin, if you need 1000 times that power, it will also increase a lot that budget to the point that the \u00A0government and investors will just said \u0022no\u0022.

And alternative is to move a nuclear based ship into Interstellar space (IOW no orbit relative to the sun) with a huge antenna, very low frequency signals (long wave, of low power can transmit almost perfectly between heliopauses), and a very high gain antenna could be made a mile wide with widely separated wires, you could potentially receive such weak signals. The problem with such a receiver is that you would have to have an active cooling system that was very close to absolute zero. The other problem, data transmission would be in baud, like 20 baud or so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way to do the is set up tracking arrays with lasers in elliptical orbits that have the same periods as Earth, then you can repeatedly accelerate a larger craft and you are not bound by the limits of earth tracking. In addition since velocity is lower you would have less of a challenge with the solar wind. One way to create a huge antenna is ro roll out wire (like the wind sail in the other post) and rotate the wires, using a tether pull the ends toward the center, These wires could be .01 mm in length made of memory material that assumes a certain shape, again the frequency so low that the great distance of the wires would reflect the signal in the desired direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way is this, create a extra-heliopause ship that sends out sorted poly-chromatic light, telling the ships were they are relative to the center. The ships when launched retract their sails to slightly alter velocity. The first ships leave their sails out, the last ships retract their sails, They steer using their sails to the center of the light path based on the wavelength of light they detect, once at the center they search out other ships, which then can send signals out in parallel each ship sharing data with the next and each ship gathering its own bit of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you launched millions you could actually have them build a robot that then collects other ships that build an antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T17:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222515005\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136773\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460720261\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(speaking from the big underground cave i currently digging for no particular reason)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you recreating \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/KO25JYAaJC0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T20:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107380-pb666/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022107380\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107380-pb666/\u0022\u003E@PB666\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Lets start from the base that solar wind produce 5000 times less pressure over 1m2 mag sail than photons\u00A0(1360w/m2 normal irradiance at earth orbit)\u00A0over 1m2 solar sail,\u00A0a normal sail if is not designed\u00A0to work like a magsail, the charge is not the same,\u00A0\u00A0would not do much.. the force and effect is negligible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe benefics with electric sails is area, they are also very good to kill relativistic speeds, not so much low speeds, a craft traveling at 0.95c, it may take few days to brake to 0.5c without propellant.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is why I consider a good idea to include some charge wires in a normal sail, so even if is not enough to brake, your time in the system increase.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout your concave shape concern due pressure, you dont need to transmit inside the solar system, and shape will be easy to control if you add some contraction rings over the sail, that it will contact when a electrical current is applied.
