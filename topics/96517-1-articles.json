So, for instance, you have a container part. In this part you would then only be able to place part X, Y or Z. Can that be done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In a completely separate situation: it it possible to, when a certain part is placed inside a container part, to update (change the appearance of) \u003Cem\u003Epart of\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003Ethe whole\u003C/em\u003E container part? Removing the item would revert that update again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally either would be done without a plug-in, but if needs be, plug-ins can be discussed. In that case I would be most interested to find out what it would take to realize something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T04:14:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo in title.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T03:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t recall ever seeing something like this done with stock nor can I imagine how it would be done with stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith firespitter you can make a part switch meshs, textures, and fuel capacities in the VAB editor via a tweak-able menu but I don\u0027t think firespitter presently has the ability to do this based on whats attached to a part.

Think of a container with a couple of inserts, with different options for every different container type. I am hoping to figure out a way to have the parts sort themselves out without requiring the player to select the right variation of part, as some containers will need to adapt to make everything fit for that combination. Invariably people are going to select the wrong ones if you leave it to them, making everything all broken and silly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo think of something along the lines of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Big container: insert X, Y and Z.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Medium container: insert Y and Z.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Small container: insert Z.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might even want to go as far as to allow multiple small inserts to be fitted into a large container, but I do not think this will be really useful or necessary.

I do realize I do not have that many options here and that I am asking for a weird combination of freedom and limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I can come up with something else. If all else fails, I might just make regular parts with offset attachment nodes, so that they only fit in the bay right one way. That would not really solve the mounting problem, but maybe some smart use of clipping or obscuring one part with another might help out there. If people choose to stuff other things in there its their choice. Using multiple smaller parts instead of one bigger one is not really a priority, as I see that being used only so often, though that could even be done with a couple of extra nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T17:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T18:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a question-- Doesn\u0027t \u0022Universal Storage\u0022 do something similar to this?
