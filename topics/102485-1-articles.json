Then I exited map mode and my stages weren\u0027t there.

If I click Resources, they won\u0027t show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis flight is also manned, but the Kerbal\u0027s facecam is gone from the bottom-right corner too. If I click on the crew hatch, it\u0027ll show his name but won\u0027t give me the option to EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the buttons on the pause menu work, I can edit my settings from the pause menu and stuff. I\u0027m assuming Revert Flight works too but I don\u0027t want to click it since, well, it\u0027ll revert my flight. F5 shows no quicksave note on the side, but for all I know it could be quicksaving without telling me. I don\u0027t want to reload my last quicksave since it was before this flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way I can fix this without quitting the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: This has happened in the Debug menu, dunno if it really means anything:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6sylQu5.png\u0022 alt=\u00226sylQu5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume this would have started happening just the IVA facecam disappeared, but it started glitching a bit before that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T23:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T23:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, perhaps with the full log file, the error will be more clear \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E you can read this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow To Get Support\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T00:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Malah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Malah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello, perhaps with the full log file, the error will be more clear \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E you can read this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow To Get Support\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up trying to quicksave (the debug menu made it look like it was at least doing \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E), and then reloaded the save.
