I put a version checker into my plugin after I saw most streamers on twitch running 2, 3, sometimes even 5 version old copies of my plugin, which was causing severe bugs. It kinda upset me, cause I\u0027d already lost vessels to some of those bugs, and I hated that I was ruining people\u0027s twitch streaming. I\u0027d, at that point, seen several mods with built in update checks, and so I made the assumption that users where fine with that. I quickly added opt-in functionality to it as soon as I got feedback on how apparently wrong I was, but even with me backpedaling on that and adding privacy policies and such, it felt like nothing I could do was good enough. The latest addon rules already have me worried, as by a strict reading of the rules, I literally cannot have an update check and still comply with them. I use KerbalStuff for my update check, and therefore it\u0027s web traffic logs are outside of my control, and I can\u0027t access the data in them or verify that a user\u0027s IP has been removed. And yes, there are people that say that even an IP address is private data.

The first, was the Morrowind community out at the official Elder Scrolls forums. At the time, great bunch of people. Most of them were adult who modded Morrowind with the mindset \u0022I mod for my own game and character first, then I share to the community.\u0022 There were no privacy concerns because the game, at first, did not allow it. We were limited to scripts that were part of the game engine, and the possibilities were very limited. When Morrowind Script Extender came out, we gained the ability to make function calls directly to the game engine and bypass Bethesda\u0027s restrictive API. It was a time of much cooperation and innovation. In fact, many of the mods for Morrowind were later incorporated as features for both Oblivion and Skyrim. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came Oblivion, and then came the main stream crowd. This was about the time that the Elder Scrolls Nexus was slowly becoming the center of the Elder Scrolls mod community. As the first couple of years passed, the demographics of the modding community changed. We began to see more and more younger people come into the scene. A lot of these people, were very talented. In fact, these people were some of the most talented people I have met in regards to modding. But, there came another crowd that was much more demanding. They\u0027re weren\u0027t modders, they were spoilt children who had never been spanked growing up, and I\u0027m not talking about simply minors either. An issue would come up with a mod, and all the mod author would hear is about how their mod broke someone\u0027s game, or about how their mod sucked, etc... Eventually, one of the more prestigious modders who had been around the community for years, got up and left the Nexus with a rant. She had grown tired of the bullcrap, and had enough of it. She pulled the download links for her mods as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tell this story to make a point here, as I see this community heading in a similar direction because of the privacy bit. Yes, we have a controversy. And yes, people are butting heads over this. But we need to be careful, as I personally feel as if through our concern for privacy, we may have alienated a very prestigious modder(s) on this forum simply because of lot of people went about expressing their fully legitimate concerns in the wrong way. I realize this may have not been some people\u0027s intentions, as tactfulness is a trait born of experience more than other sources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also my opinion that since Squad has made an official policy, the controversy needs to die; lets bury the dead horse and move on before the community is split further.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-25T05:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2014 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Raven.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T06:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a suggestion that may quell some of the insecurities about all this; firstly I am only speaking of version checking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if there were a single mod doing this, that all other mods interfaced with in order to get the feature of version checking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis singular mod would be open source, publicly managed, and offer support for vetted hosting services such as KerbalStuff, Curse if possible, Github Releases, Majiir.net, and any others that come into existence.

By having a singular mod that is interfaced with via internal... things (ran out of big words), most mods would be able to do away with all of their network-accessing code so that if you ran such a series of scripted searches on the source, they wouldn\u0027t ping on the radar. It would be reasonably easy to say with reasonable faith whether a mod accesses the internet or not; saying what it does is more difficult especially in large codebases, but the central mod would not be large, and ideally it would have really good comments explaining everything so even people who don\u0027t know C# or .net could look at it, follow the comments, and understand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T06:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022togfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022togfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere can I see this official policy?
