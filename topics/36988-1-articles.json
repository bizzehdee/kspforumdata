I have the spelling of maybe a feeble child so, please forgive me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an idea for a new design challenge that will use an extremely detailed point system determine the winning designs (More on why this is different later) of launch vehicles with the emphisis of multipurpose useage and a very different cargo area specification. The rules would be simple, its the scoring that presents the challanege! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle must deliver the cargo to a stable circular orbit around kerbin of between 450,000 and 455,000 feet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cargo must not be used nor damaged in ANY WAY.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...End...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about damage to the launch vehicle? Umm... That was ment to happen!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats right, the point of the challange is just to deliver cargo, anything goes as long as the cargo is in an orbit, and untouched!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the twist. The points!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I want to know if you would like me to spend time developing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**warning this idea is undevloped and in depth, which is why i\u0027m asking if there is interest BEFORE balancing the following rambalings**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point system would boil down into two factors. Multiplyers and raw score. The \u0022Raw Score\u0022 would be some computation of Cost of ship(Taking into account any parts SAFELY returned!) vs. payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe multiplyers were where the design part of the challange would come in. I would attempt to give certian features a point system, that would be multiplied by the raw score to determine winners. A very small part of what I had in mind was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for each different sized docking port on launch vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for each radious size of cargo bay (I.E. 1 large fuel tank = \u002B.5(Yeah, its supposted to bee a fraction =D), 2 tanks radious=1, so on)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for length of cargo bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe multiplication is what makes the design part so fun, thats the multipurpose part. Deliver a massivly wide thin payload, stupidly long payload, whatever. The point system is what would take into account all the smaller design details and allocate a score. So you delivered a smaller mass payload, but your cargo bay had space for 3 large stations, or 8 smaller sized moduels, or 25 probes. and thus your multipler was huge because your vehicle was that multipurpose!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastely keep it fun, and kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you launch 1 PAYLOAD into space. Thats it. Your rocket design is flawless and cannot be disputed. Your rocket works and your score payload proves it, so if the buyer blows up? \u0022Pilot error.\u0022 Runs out of fuel? \u0022Should have bought the extended model.\u0022 But the rocket can\u0027t deliver my payload!? \u0022Sounds like a case of didn\u0027t buy insurance\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thats it, I know its very vauge at the moment but thats because I would really have to sit down and crunch numbers to balance all the ideas and I just reeally don\u0027t want to do it if this challange is boring to others so yeah, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
