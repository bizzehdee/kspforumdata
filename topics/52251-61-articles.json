It was a given that I\u0027d use it wherever possible. For Laythe, I came up with a simple spaceplane. For Tylo, I tried to somehow attach more thrust to my rover, however, this wouldn\u0027t work. Eventually, I put the rover on top of a high-thrust contraption: it would only work as a lander in that configuration, but that solution was still more lightweight, overall, than bringing an entire lander from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interplanetary transfer vessel was much larger than strictly necessary; mostly because I came up with the kicker stage idea only very late in the design phase. The first mission plan assumed that I\u0027d go to Jool on the LV-Ns and would carry much more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the mission went up in one launch, the Laythe Flyer joined it under it\u0027s own power. I had to replace the kicker due to technical difficulties; otherwise, nothing remarkable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the kicker stage, getting to Jool was a short, high-TWR burn; only a very small correction was necessary after the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately after entering Jool SOI, the whole assembly was split up: the Laythe Flyer (plus a LVN-equipped tank a.k.a. small tug) went to Laythe, the Labrover (plus a plain tank, not quite full) went to Vall, while the tanker went to Tylo. Each would do its own aerobraking, under the assumption that, given the different target orbits, they\u0027d arrive at intervals of hours or days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t quite work out that way. I had barely enough time to switch between the two landers, a theme that would repeat itself plenty of times. For some reason or other, there could be several Kerbin days of waiting, and then a lot of maneuvers for different vessels happening all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Laythe flyer got to its destination easy enough; likewise, getting the tanker to Tylo was no problem. But Vall was elusive: I couldn\u0027t set up a nice encounter without brushing up against Laythe or Tylo. IIRC I even spent over a hundred m/s on avoiding the worst encounters that would have tossed me into Jool or out of the system -- I felt like a ball in a pinball machine. Then I just took the next encounter that came up (at a steep angle), and I paid for the capture with tremenduous amounts of delta-V. The mission would have failed there, if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that I had arrived at Jool with much more fuel than expected; so much, in fact, that the tanker was 100% full when the mission split up, and both landers were carrying around some fuel they\u0027d never need. Only that in the case of the Vall lander, it turned out to be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen/if I do that again (Vall turned out to be a nice place, after all), I\u0027ll get to Laythe or Tylo first, then transfer to Vall -- that\u0027s a lot easier and bound to be cheaper, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landings themselves went off without a hitch; the following transfers to Tylo were surprisingly cheap. The Laythe lander managed to enter an orbit that was very similar to that of the tanker; the rover wasn\u0027t quite as lucky. Still, the meet-up at Tylo went over well (though again, I managed to do it such that the maneuvers happened almost at the same time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo Landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-lowered periapsis in several increments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-started burn perhaps five minutes before touchdown\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-nukes only at first, pitching so I\u0027d drop no faster than 5-10m/sec. (starting at 10 degrees)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-when 50 degree pitch was no longer enough, I started the Skippers. Was still going about 1700m/s then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-couldn\u0027t land on my own. Eventually I merely slowed down to ~200m/s, then passed control to mechjeb to do the actual landing. Can\u0027t say that Mechjeb executed the job gracefully (just look at how the lander legs pierce the ground), but it set me down without damaging the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas a horribly close call, I used nearly all my available fuel. There were some reserves stowed away in the lander legs \u0026amp;c., but A) that was meant for the ascent and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E not readily accessible without pumping around or opening some valves. The amount of accessible fuel I *did* have was supposed to be plenty, but in the end it wasn\u0027t enough ( I believe; at any rate I was busy pumping fuel while mechjeb handled the landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the ascent, I had (checking in the VAB): 700m/s @TWR4 from the skippers, 45seconds (~400m/s) @TWR1 from the additional Nervas, then 4400m/s @0.6TWR from the lander itself. That seemed to be too little to get anywhere, but turned out to be wholly sufficient: the Skippers kicked me high enough so that the Nervas had a few minutes\u0027 time to turn the parabola into an actual orbit. However, the original plan had called for 1500m/s from the skippers, and sacrificing the small tug was a measure of last resort).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at the tanker, I found that I had exactly the minimum fuel to continue the mission: all the extra I had when I entered the system was gone, spent on Vall and Tylo. I had hoped that I could park the Laythe Flyer \u002B Tug as a small fuel depot in the Jool system, but in the event I couldn\u0027t even afford to de-orbit them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the mission went over without a hitch, and quickly as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop: getting to Bop, ~700m/s. Landing and getting back to 50km orbit, 1200m/s. 2800m/s left in the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol: Taking it\u0027s time (two Pol Orbits), the tanker got there with comparatively little delta-v, under 400m/s. Capture at Pol was the most expensive part at ~250m/s. I spent another 20m/s on making a circular 100km orbit. The Rover, coming from Bop, required a little more (mostly for the plane change) and circularised with 2280m/s left -- so I could land right away, no need to meet with the tanker just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn: Delta-V calculators don\u0027t like my ship, but I should have had about 2900m/s. One straightforward 1300m/s burn would take me back to Kerbin; that seemed safe enough, so I didn\u0027t even look around for any gravity assists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpending about 800m/s shortly before hitting Kerbins atmosphere makes for a much gentler aerobrake (which still had to be rather harsh, as I was coming home at an inopportune moment: the Mun was just in the right place to grab me. I tried to stay clear of it\u0027s SOI as I had no patience for dealing with the fall-out of an encounter. Two more rounds of aerobraking after that until I settled in a nice 120x120km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kicker stage (yes, it\u0027s still around) is docked to the interplanetary transfer vessel. Mostly because in the next step, the tanker comes by to pick up the crew; with the kicker stage present, he can deliver a full load of fuel at the same time (the Jool-5 remnant couldn\u0027t hold half of it). Crew boards tanker and rides home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStatistics:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Which game versions did you use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 2.4, Career mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What mods did you use, if any?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb *and* Kerbal engineer (both hat trouble giving me correct dV info), kOS computers, Lazor docking cam, select_root, and 1-2 more VAB mods (in stock, it would have been impossible to assemble this as one lauch).

It was a given that I\u0027d use it wherever possible. For Laythe, I came up with a simple spaceplane. For Tylo, I tried to somehow attach more thrust to my rover, however, this wouldn\u0027t work. Eventually, I put the rover on top of a high-thrust contraption: it would only work as a lander in that configuration, but that solution was still more lightweight, overall, than bringing an entire lander from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interplanetary transfer vessel was much larger than strictly necessary; mostly because I came up with the kicker stage idea only very late in the design phase. The first mission plan assumed that I\u0027d go to Jool on the LV-Ns and would carry much more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the mission went up in one launch, the Laythe Flyer joined it under it\u0027s own power. I had to replace the kicker due to technical difficulties; otherwise, nothing remarkable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the kicker stage, getting to Jool was a short, high-TWR burn; only a very small correction was necessary after the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately after entering Jool SOI, the whole assembly was split up: the Laythe Flyer (plus a LVN-equipped tank a.k.a. small tug) went to Laythe, the Labrover (plus a plain tank, not quite full) went to Vall, while the tanker went to Tylo. Each would do its own aerobraking, under the assumption that, given the different target orbits, they\u0027d arrive at intervals of hours or days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t quite work out that way. I had barely enough time to switch between the two landers, a theme that would repeat itself plenty of times. For some reason or other, there could be several Kerbin days of waiting, and then a lot of maneuvers for different vessels happening all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Laythe flyer got to its destination easy enough; likewise, getting the tanker to Tylo was no problem. But Vall was elusive: I couldn\u0027t set up a nice encounter without brushing up against Laythe or Tylo. IIRC I even spent over a hundred m/s on avoiding the worst encounters that would have tossed me into Jool or out of the system -- I felt like a ball in a pinball machine. Then I just took the next encounter that came up (at a steep angle), and I paid for the capture with tremenduous amounts of delta-V. The mission would have failed there, if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that I had arrived at Jool with much more fuel than expected; so much, in fact, that the tanker was 100% full when the mission split up, and both landers were carrying around some fuel they\u0027d never need. Only that in the case of the Vall lander, it turned out to be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen/if I do that again (Vall turned out to be a nice place, after all), I\u0027ll get to Laythe or Tylo first, then transfer to Vall -- that\u0027s a lot easier and bound to be cheaper, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landings themselves went off without a hitch; the following transfers to Tylo were surprisingly cheap. The Laythe lander managed to enter an orbit that was very similar to that of the tanker; the rover wasn\u0027t quite as lucky. Still, the meet-up at Tylo went over well (though again, I managed to do it such that the maneuvers happened almost at the same time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo Landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-lowered periapsis in several increments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-started burn perhaps five minutes before touchdown\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-nukes only at first, pitching so I\u0027d drop no faster than 5-10m/sec. (starting at 10 degrees)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-when 50 degree pitch was no longer enough, I started the Skippers. Was still going about 1700m/s then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-couldn\u0027t land on my own. Eventually I merely slowed down to ~200m/s, then passed control to mechjeb to do the actual landing. Can\u0027t say that Mechjeb executed the job gracefully (just look at how the lander legs pierce the ground), but it set me down without damaging the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas a horribly close call, I used nearly all my available fuel. There were some reserves stowed away in the lander legs \u0026amp;c., but A) that was meant for the ascent and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E not readily accessible without pumping around or opening some valves. The amount of accessible fuel I *did* have was supposed to be plenty, but in the end it wasn\u0027t enough ( I believe; at any rate I was busy pumping fuel while mechjeb handled the landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the ascent, I had (checking in the VAB): 700m/s @TWR4 from the skippers, 45seconds (~400m/s) @TWR1 from the additional Nervas, then 4400m/s @0.6TWR from the lander itself. That seemed to be too little to get anywhere, but turned out to be wholly sufficient: the Skippers kicked me high enough so that the Nervas had a few minutes\u0027 time to turn the parabola into an actual orbit. However, the original plan had called for 1500m/s from the skippers, and sacrificing the small tug was a measure of last resort).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at the tanker, I found that I had exactly the minimum fuel to continue the mission: all the extra I had when I entered the system was gone, spent on Vall and Tylo. I had hoped that I could park the Laythe Flyer \u002B Tug as a small fuel depot in the Jool system, but in the event I couldn\u0027t even afford to de-orbit them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the mission went over without a hitch, and quickly as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop: getting to Bop, ~700m/s. Landing and getting back to 50km orbit, 1200m/s. 2800m/s left in the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol: Taking it\u0027s time (two Pol Orbits), the tanker got there with comparatively little delta-v, under 400m/s. Capture at Pol was the most expensive part at ~250m/s. I spent another 20m/s on making a circular 100km orbit. The Rover, coming from Bop, required a little more (mostly for the plane change) and circularised with 2280m/s left -- so I could land right away, no need to meet with the tanker just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn: Delta-V calculators don\u0027t like my ship, but I should have had about 2900m/s. One straightforward 1300m/s burn would take me back to Kerbin; that seemed safe enough, so I didn\u0027t even look around for any gravity assists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpending about 800m/s shortly before hitting Kerbins atmosphere makes for a much gentler aerobrake (which still had to be rather harsh, as I was coming home at an inopportune moment: the Mun was just in the right place to grab me. I tried to stay clear of it\u0027s SOI as I had no patience for dealing with the fall-out of an encounter. Two more rounds of aerobraking after that until I settled in a nice 120x120km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kicker stage (yes, it\u0027s still around) is docked to the interplanetary transfer vessel. Mostly because in the next step, the tanker comes by to pick up the crew; with the kicker stage present, he can deliver a full load of fuel at the same time (the Jool-5 remnant couldn\u0027t hold half of it). Crew boards tanker and rides home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStatistics:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Which game versions did you use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 2.4, Career mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What mods did you use, if any?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb *and* Kerbal engineer (both hat trouble giving me correct dV info), kOS computers, Lazor docking cam, select_root, and 1-2 more VAB mods (in stock, it would have been impossible to assemble this as one lauch).
