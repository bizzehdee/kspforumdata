The way the windows angle to allow for downwards viewing at the base but bevel the bottom leading edge is a nice idea. Seeing as in KSP we can\u0027t leave the seats in IVA and press our faces up to the glass like the real Apollo astronauts we are limited to the FOV from the seat positions. Also I think the multiple smaller window panes looks more... intuitive with regards to what we see on existing real life examples that have larger, flat faces for viewing and the rounded corners help protray that. It\u0027s nice to see an example of what the feedback has generally been suggesting in the flesh so to speak so that it can also be reviewed from a design standpoint. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EEDIT: I also think it\u0027s worth mentioning that the window panes also look more believable on this mockup as they have strong AO on the sunken edges near the housing structure suggesting that they are recessed quite a lot into the frame.

Far from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever a couple of things seem a bit off about the new design. The first of which is that it doesn\u0027t really look like the top of a vehicle anymore, more like something suitable for the middle of a stack. The reason for this would be the uniform width of it, as opposed to the original\u0027s distinct lip at its base. This uniformity even extends to the texturing, which is pretty uniform in brightness/colour, up its sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orginal had a clearer \u0022right way up\u0022 look to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other issue is the layout of the windows, especially when illuminated, which seem unnaturally cut into a rectangular area. I think it would have been better to have the lower row of three windows be inset slightly, forming a very wide based T shape. Possibly even removing the two smallest windows altogether, as this would look more natural.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a positive note I really like the Bare version of the pod for rovers etc. I can see that part showing up in a lot of screenshots (looking forward to using it myself). It doesn\u0027t have the issue regarding the windows, due to the square cut frontal profile of the pod. This gives a better reason for the shape of the window area, and so feels natural, plus the side windows extends the shape beyond that rectangle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xurkitree","CreatedById":187694,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-03T12:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOMG I love the new design!

i really love the squareness of the rover/capital ship variant (there are way to damn many circular things in stock KSP, yes i KNOW its \u0022realistic\u0022 but realism doesnt make starships look good imo), i do agree with the window issues, that frame looks super squish and not something that can actually handly any sort of pressure differential (sci-fi or not, there are some basic fundamentals that make sense to have).\u00A0 Even the inline starfighter cockpit is believeable since its a curved rounded window that could at least in theory be a decent pressure vessel, but popsicle stick frame with no rounded corners would be (outside of super alloys used on capital ships in some of the less plausible sci-fi) completely unpractical from a structural element (and im a

actually like the look of), most of those are non-square windows that are imo cooler looking, very slight corner rounding, and overall look great inside and out.\u00A0 Not sure if its possible, but id
