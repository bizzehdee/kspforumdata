There are new Youtubers and people that will make new videos, you just need to find them and move on with the old guys. I remember when the likes of Scott Manley, kurtjmac, Robbaz, the \u0022old guys\u0022 that we all used to love, used to upload new videos so quickly it seemed like there were just hours between them, but nowadays I only follow Robbaz and he only seems to do one or two a month. \n\nAnd remember that this game doesn\u0027t really have a lot in terms of objectives, as compared to other games, so it isn\u0027t like you can easily make massive 15\u002B part series like you could do with other types of games or even multiplayer games (as evidenced by the multitude of series involving GMod Prop Hunt and other GMod gamemodes). You mainly have to come up with the ideas yourself, but for the average gaming youtuber who bases their income (or a majority thereof) off of Youtube there isn\u0027t enough time in the day to come up with an idea and execute it, and the fact that it takes loads of time to do things in KSP doesn\u0027t help. \n\nIt\u0027s a great game to make video series of, if you\u0027ve got the right mentality and time schedule, but for the majority of Youtubers it doesn\u0027t seem feasible or reasonable to make a lot of KSP videos on a consistent basis. For a small Youtuber who doesn\u0027t have a lot of ongoing series or anything to lose, then it\u0027s a great game, but to the big Youtuber who has multiple series that have to be accounted and time budgeted for, has to keep a consistent schedule, and get their entire income from Youtube, then it seems like too big a risk to take for them."},{"CreatedByName":"MrWalrus123","CreatedById":119099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:30:22Z","Content":"At least we still have Scott"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T12:50:36Z","Content":"I see this.\n\n![L17Ec.jpg](http://i.snag.gy/L17Ec.jpg)\n\nObviously, v1.0. caused the huge spike in the graph.

Just say farewell to the old and explore the new.\n\nI\u0027ll buy into that. People seem to easily overlook how open-ended KSP really is; it doesn\u0027t suffer from \u0027level bloat\u0027 or \u0027demigod crowding\u0027, where a multiplayer game fills up with experts or highly skilled, highly levelled players that leave noobs feeling like everything they do has been thought of and that they\u0027re walking down well-trodden paths with no truly \u0027new\u0027 adventures to chase. In KSP, you choose what problems you solve and how you solve them. That freedom itself is inviting and empowering to the new player.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m actually waiting for the frantic pace of alpha/beta development to *slow down* before I really get back into KSP.\n\u003E The result of my play is usually .craft files I want to release publicly, but that was difficult in the past when a major new update would come along every two months or so breaking everything old and changing things up.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once official development really slows down, only then can I see myself diving back in.\n\nYep; if they slow down the release rate, modders will become more confident in their work, and hopefully we\u0027ll see more compatibility and stability as a result.\n\nI\u0027m new myself; after watching passively for several months, I\u0027m on board with 1.0. A lot of people have laid the groundwork, and I fully plan to start my own episode line out of my own knowledge of science, technology, aviation, and aerospace (I\u0027m a decently good simulator pilot too; Watch out Scott Manley!) after a few dry runs. The party\u0027s hardly over; its moving outdoors. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"}]}
