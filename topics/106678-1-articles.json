There are new Youtubers and people that will make new videos, you just need to find them and move on with the old guys. I remember when the likes of Scott Manley, kurtjmac, Robbaz, the \u0022old guys\u0022 that we all used to love, used to upload new videos so quickly it seemed like there were just hours between them, but nowadays I only follow Robbaz and he only seems to do one or two a month. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember that this game doesn\u0027t really have a lot in terms of objectives, as compared to other games, so it isn\u0027t like you can easily make massive 15\u002B part series like you could do with other types of games or even multiplayer games (as evidenced by the multitude of series involving GMod Prop Hunt and other GMod gamemodes). You mainly have to come up with the ideas yourself, but for the average gaming youtuber who bases their income (or a majority thereof) off of Youtube there isn\u0027t enough time in the day to come up with an idea and execute it, and the fact that it takes loads of time to do things in KSP doesn\u0027t help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a great game to make video series of, if you\u0027ve got the right mentality and time schedule, but for the majority of Youtubers it doesn\u0027t seem feasible or reasonable to make a lot of KSP videos on a consistent basis. For a small Youtuber who doesn\u0027t have a lot of ongoing series or anything to lose, then it\u0027s a great game, but to the big Youtuber who has multiple series that have to be accounted and time budgeted for, has to keep a consistent schedule, and get their entire income from Youtube, then it seems like too big a risk to take for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWalrus123","CreatedById":119099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt least we still have Scott\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T12:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.snag.gy/L17Ec.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L17Ec.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, v1.0. caused the huge spike in the graph.
