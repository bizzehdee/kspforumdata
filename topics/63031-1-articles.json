I have been playing KSP for awhile and had an awesome Idea for a cinematic. So, I put in the time and effort and got it together. Its called \u0022Per Aspera Ad Astra\u0022 or when translated \u0022Through Hardship to the Stars\u0022 which I feel is so much like the feeling I get when I play KSP. The audio is from the Sagan Series on youtube. I hope you guys enjoy this! Subscribe for more coming soon!
