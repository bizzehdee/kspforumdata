The parts are configured to allow 72-way rotation (5 degree gradations if you hold shift) right now. What\u0027s missing is placement. Move a part with angle snapping around a large object, and it jumps in 15 degree increments. Without angle snapping on at some level, it\u0027s impossible to precisely place matching parts. Keep 15 degrees as the default, but allow us a button to change it to 5 or 10 (or 30 or 45) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
