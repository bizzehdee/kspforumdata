Not many people did that at the time. His 2 twins really liked the fact that he built rockets. Val once said to him: \u003Ci\u003ELater when im a big girl, i want to go on one of your rockets to the moon! (In Russian)\u00A0\u003C/i\u003EAlexander feels like he wants to make their dreams come true, so he did that. He had no official rockets back then. But then he found out about the land called Ameschland, where he could launch and make bigger rockets because they would land in the middle of Greenland and not in Moskow). But before that, Jeb and Valentina needed to play at\u00A0their favourite tree they call \u003Ci\u003EThe Papa Bear Tree)\u00A0\u003C/i\u003EThey love that thing, even though Valentina fell of the highest point of the tree 23 times. But Alexander is kind of happy that his kids are true badasses. Alexander heard that his brother who was seperated from him at birth is moving there too, with the whole family. But the wife of Alexander is staying in Russia, she works at a clothing store, and everybody loves her there, so they have to divorce. So, back to the rockets, Alexander plans on building a big rocket, that is 2 meters high (his avarege height is 10 centimeters). But he cant do that alone, thats why John and Marie want to work with him in the Space Program. But the moving has been delayed, because Valentina fell off that stupid tree again. \u003Ci\u003EFacepalm\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;line-height:38.4px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cu\u003EFun Facts!\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlexander is an analog of Sergei Korolev and John an analog of Wernher von Braun!
