Since its official release I just want to sit down and have a long, proper and thorough playthrough.

Came up halfway through me making the reply. You also seem to be confusing high drag with excessive body lift. The former is the cause of the \u0026lt;1.0 soup. The latter was caused when increasing drag because \u003Cem\u003Epeople complained about the low drag\u003C/em\u003E in 1.0.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nothing to do with any kind of soupy atmosphere, and I\u0027m fairly sure the body lift values are already being looked at.
