I am not talking here about the little contracts, like testing some part or rescuing a Kerbal from orbit around Kerbin. No, I\u0027m talking about the big, interplanetary contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a very good example: a contract requesting a flag on Duna. Now, a ship to go that far, with Kerbals on board, science, rover and a return vehicle (you don\u0027t want to send a hundred minimalistic, cheap missions to explore a planet in tiny fractions; you go big on the first try and take everything with you), costs around 700 000 (grossly speaking). So let\u0027s take a look at what you get from the contract: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288519575\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288519575\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E178500 and the status of Prestige is: TRIVIAL. Now how can an interplanetary ride be TRIVIAL?! And how can you get 1/7 of the value of the mission when you complete the task? Even after landing back on Kerbin and retrieving a couple of parts from the space ship, you won\u0027t come close to the amount it takes to launch the ship in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s take a look at the numbers after completing the task: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288519699\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288519699\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, the numbers from the contract\u0027s description, don\u0027t match with the numbers after completing it. You get more reputation, but even less cash than promised. This might be another bug entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, if you are going for big contracts, difficult missions, you loose a lot of cash and must basically run your space program with a huge deficit. It is very hard to get some real profit out of these kind of missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately for me, I have already Kerbals stationed on almost every planet (was planning to return them all at once, but now, I\u0027m rethinking the hole thing). So I can do the tasks and cash in without any cost, only profit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the update, I got 3 contracts like the one above, requesting me to plant a flag on Duna. I did this 3 times with the same Kerbals left there from the first mission. It\u0027s the only way to farm some real money, until I can launch some serious ships towards other planets. My biggest ships (that can carry huge payloads everywhere in the system) cost around 1,5 million to launch (including orbital refueling).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am kindly asking the developers to adjust the values of the rewards and the prestige status of the contracts accordingly. Interplanetary missions are the hardest and should bring the most money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I read about an idea in some thread, that recommended periodical funding from the \u0022Kerbal government\u0022, so that you would get a constant amount of cash without needing to launch new ships; it would help towards a more balanced game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Now that debris or probes out of focus are automatically removed at the 2,3km (I think) distance cap, it is very hard or impossible to retrieve parts during a launch or suborbital flight.
