I think it\u0027s related to satellite missions. Here\u0027s what happened prior to the bug showing up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI accepted a contract to put a satellite into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I went into the VAB and noticed that hitting the Load Craft button did nothing. I presumed this was as designed as part of accepting the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a ship consisting of a launcher, a crewed Mk. I pod, and a simple satellite attached to the top of the pod via 1m decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWent up, got into the specified orbit, and released the satellite. Unfortunately the decoupler force sent it flying off into oblivion at a very high speed. So I deorbited the manned portion of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still unable to load any saved ships, I suppose because the contract isn\u0027t complete. Also, on the launch pad I can only select vehicles with a probe core. So I canceled the contract and figured I\u0027d come back to it later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I am still unable to load saved vessels or launch ones without probe cores. I tried terminating the wayward probe core in the tracking station and successfully completing a second satellite contract in hopes of jarring the system, to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I\u0027m on the totally wrong track, it would seem it isn\u0027t recognizing when a satellite contract has been abandoned and is not returning the VAB to an \u0022unrestricted\u0022 mode...and unless there\u0027s a way to resolve it in the persistence file, I fear this career is totally unsalvagable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yh87l4ky5mfeb36/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPersist File\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Seems I was.
