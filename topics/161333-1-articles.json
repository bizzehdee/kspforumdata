I\u0027m not crazy. Below is a more simplified example of a different ship I made for the purpose of figuring this out. Just a command pod with a liquid engine on the bottom to bump it away from the pad (apparently the timers don\u0027t start until after you leave the pad; makes sense).

I\u0027m using KSP v1.3 and TAC v0.13.2.0 downloaded from Curse. I did a completely fresh install from Steam and installed only TAC and I am still seeing the same issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter running this experiment a few more times I\u0027ve noticed that I was getting a different amount of EC leftover every time. After investigating more it\u00A0seems like it might be a problem with time warping. When I did the pad experiment warping at 50x then the EC ran out at the proper time. When I warp at 100x or\u00A01000x then I still have EC left when the TAC LS timer runs out.\u00A0It almost seems like it might be a KSP issue where it isn\u0027t displaying or warping\u00A0the EC properly; the TAC electricity always takes the same amount of time to run out regardless of warp speed (~2hr 21min).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW I did this in a fresh sandbox mode on the new install so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything weird with the save file.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nsbrown93","CreatedById":178324,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-01T00:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm.
