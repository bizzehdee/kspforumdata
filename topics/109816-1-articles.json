Something like described here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121752-science-progression-using-contracts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121752-science-progression-using-contracts\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, what I\u0027d also like to see, is the different levels of buildings and skills of our Kerbals come into play in Science mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Missions: add a minor amount of Science Points. (they already do in Career Mode, so why not in Science Mode?). These would be the most common missions on the list, the \u0022fillers\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Building levels: unlocked through missions as well. So you want more Kerbals on your roster? Then do missions to improve your Astronaut Complex. Missions with building upgrades would be less common than the \u0022science point\u0022 missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Science Progression unlocks, as described in the thread I linked above. Not as common as the science point rewards, but more common than building upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of missions can be made similar to the ones we already have. Maybe introduce a new mission type as well, which requires the player to perform a mission in a newly built ship with a pricetag under some predetermined amount, even if finances are not an issue, the parts value can still be used as a validation statistic for mission success.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T08:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also would like to have more progress in the science mode.

It might even be possible to have both: everything unlockable through science points, but on rare occasions some mission rewarding an unlock, which may or may not be already accessible through science points (depending how far you progressed). That could result in fun weirdness, like someone who just broke the first 2 tiers of the tech tree finding a mission that rewards Nuclear Propulsion, encouraging him to experiment and try to get that thing to work without all the parts he or she normally has available at that stage. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It\u0027s what initially drew me to KSP: the potential to find unconventional solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barking Sands","CreatedById":143433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is almost starting to sound like a request for a mod to add these elements to a science mode game (which would be a topic for the \u0022General Add-on Affairs\u0022 forum). Replacing funds with science points sounds pretty interesting; I\u0027m guessing building and launching vehicles doesn\u0027t have any cost or only costs 1 science per 10,000ish funds.

Not exactly what you\u0027re looking for, but it\u0027s a little similar in that it\u0027s a way to produce a custom career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested, I have a career save pack including an experimental (WIP) \u0022Vulcan Funeral Affairs\u0022 career.
