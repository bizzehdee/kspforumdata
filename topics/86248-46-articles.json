Thanks... I\u0026#39;m hoping to at least hit my fourth dark green bar before the changeover. I remember the excitement I felt when I got my first dark green bar... it only took me about six months to earn it! The second bar - only a year :shock: . The third bar, about six weeks... \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know the points really mean nothing, and as I have shared before on other threads, it actually kept me interested in the forum in the early days since I felt I really didn\u0026#39;t have (and really still don\u0026#39;t) anything really meaningful to offer the community. Because of the job I have, I cannot spend a lot of time making mods like I did for other games. I don\u0026#39;t have the patience to \u0022create\u0022 missions or concepts as such as ZooNamedGames has done with his vision of recreating the early days of NASA missions. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wish they would do SOMETHING rather than a green dot with a number, but I am not the one making the final decisions.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T16:01:10Z","Content":"\nGot mine, thank you!

This archive will be available to a link which we will post on the new forums.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe love to see people work together to build craft and such, and as long as the roleplay element is remove from the Rocket Builder company threads there\u0026#39;s nothing stopping you from posting these collaborative threads in the new Spacecraft Exchange forum.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Almost all data will be preserved[B][SIZE=4] including reputation[/SIZE][/B], custom user titles and signatures.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough the new forum does not support BB-code for new posts, it will convert existing posts which contain BB-code automatically.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome links may be broken during the transfer, but I\u0026#39;m looking into how we can avoid this. IPB itself may have a solution as well in the form of support for mod_rewrite. It\u0026#39;s being looked into.
