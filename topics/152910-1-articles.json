Earth and Potentially Super-Earth type planets can form from collisional accretion of smaller Moon-Mars size bodies after the gas dissipation. In fact, one theory of the solar system postulates that the current terrestrial planets formed from remnant material after an earlier generation of super-earths spiraled into the Sun after Jupiter and Saturn\u0027s migration disrupted the inner solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think many bodies will get to 5 earth masses when forming late, but if Earth and Venus did than it is not beyond possibility to have somewhat larger bodies. These would not have to worry about hydrogen capture at any rate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just that where the solar system formed was somewhat rare in gases, but rich in rocks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo possibly unlikely, to very unlikely, but not completely impossible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MichaelPoole","CreatedById":152964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T20:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222933997\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152910\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485356842\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297559\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002278stonewobble\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, 78stonewobble said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just that where the solar system formed was somewhat rare in gases, but rich in rocks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo possibly unlikely, to very unlikely, but not completely impossible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it is very unlikely at all considering we already discovered such a planet.
