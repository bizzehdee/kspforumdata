The Mother ship is going to need some adjusting also for better control because I\u0027m losing a lot of fuel fighting with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan for now is to get into orbit around the Mun and be able to undock from the Mother Ship, Land on the Mun for research and science then return to the Mother Ship. Future plans would be to return to Kerbin Orbit for refueling at a Space Station. I am also considering using another Launcher, this one was my first pick during the testing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/594783056388709678/57AABC9374DD80AE3866A9C029870A2EF94C11CD/\u0022 alt=\u002257AABC9374DD80AE3866A9C029870A2EF94C11CD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/594783056388724140/5048E391DCF4FDFD16A07DEF1C513C42888C251B/\u0022 alt=\u00225048E391DCF4FDFD16A07DEF1C513C42888C251B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/594783056295412293/6DA6DD0445B28F390D16222926380E8B30F3C6FA/\u0022 alt=\u00226DA6DD0445B28F390D16222926380E8B30F3C6FA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
