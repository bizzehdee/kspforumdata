Been playing KSP since 0.17, though didn\u0027t enjoy it until some time into 0.18. I suck with rockets, but give me enough time and I\u0027ll get anywhere with purpose built spaceplanes. I love mods, and I\u0027m slowly learning how to make stuff for KSP (so far just by config bashing, but I\u0027ll get there eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, I\u0027m new. I showed up a few days or weeks or something after the forums came back up, mostly just poking around when I realized that there was KSP discussion. One of the threads at the time, the one that drew me in, was referring to something like \u0022Have you ever had an accidental orbital collision?\u0022 and I\u0027d literally just had one. I\u0027d flown my shuttle into orbit, dumped my spent fuel can, and sent said spent gas tank hurtling into my space station. I\u0027ve filled orbits with debris, and I\u0027ve created fields of green on Minmus with stranded Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you\u0027ve read this far, just call me Mad.

It exploded about 4000 meters up, but that\u0027s cause I\u0027m not good with rockets. I can build many spaceplane variations, even built an SSTO that gets to my station, docks to a fuel can, refuels, then takes off, carrying the Rockomax Jumbo-64 under the belly, but my roughest time in Career mode? Having to launch rockets to get plane parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the forum has also inspired me to be a little more active in the KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T16:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is it possible that you can\u0027t build rockets, yet you can go anywhere with spaceplanes?
