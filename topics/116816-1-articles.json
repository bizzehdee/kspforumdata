I don\u0027t see that option coming up when I right click on it.

When you perform an experiment, keep the data, and bring it to the MPL (or have the experiments attached to it) it will present you with a data value. The MPL has a data storage capacity of 500, meaning that you can transfer up to 500 data into the MPL for processing. You then must make sure it has at least one scientist on board and click \u0022Start Research\u0022 to begin actually turning this \u0022data\u0022 into science we can spend on tech. You\u0027ll notice that you\u0027re shown a \u0022sci per day\u0022 number which will be higher the closer you are to the maxium 500 data load. The data will start to be consumed over time as the lab produces science. To then retrieve this science, you must have an antenna to transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
