It takes between 15 and 25 seconds to run each BEFORE, FOR, and AFTER check for each mod. The log file shows this happening after the initial part load, and then the compilation sequence takes place. Actually, after looking at it, MM seems to be applying patches before the [PASS] sequence on each mod. I have run a copy of 2.3.1 on the same set of mods, in the same directory, and it loads many times faster. I\u0027m not sure if there is a particular plugin causing this behavior, because I am not experienced enough to be able to know every abnormality in the log, but something is definitely different between 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 when applied to the same mod set, which seems to affect load time. I will post the logs later, as I need to do more testing to confirm the anomaly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real reason I wanted to respond, is to mention something about logic when patching mods. After developing my first plugin, I have realized how beneficial it is to have a plugin derived method, which you write, when you apply patches. MM is amazing of course, but it seems there are many things that are just beyond the scope of what it is even supposed to do. Personally, I have realized for what I ultimately aim to accomplish, I just have to tough it out and write a comprehensive plugin, which parses parts, and does conditional calculations to modify them. It will take much more time and troubleshooting, than simply being content to spend the time to look at specific mods, and adjust values in a CFG file manually, but it is ultimately much more adaptable.
