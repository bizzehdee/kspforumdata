But to date I have not been able to get a spaceplane to work. When ever I attempt to fly one it rolls down the runway just fine until I bring the nose up. At that point the aircraft rolls wildly and smashes into the runway. This happen with all aircraft, even stock. How do I fix this? I normally use a joystick and I also have a pretty laggy computer.

Some folks swear by straight up and down landing gear versus angled off of a circular fuselage to prevent random explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally use angled landing gear and place my rear set of gear right behind my CoM. Therefore, when I go to pull up, my plane actually lifts off versus having to ride out the entirety of the runway. (Note this is something that is trialed and errored until you get it right for your plane) This means that my plane is not over speeding which I believe causes the physics of ksp to randomly throw one wing higher than the other, which then begins to resonate within the craft and everything blows up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at the design of one of my SSTO Space Planes, maybe it\u0027ll give you some tips on how to place your landing gear or at least some reference for an example that does work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...-SSTO-20-OK%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...-SSTO-20-OK%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not where I can fix the action group #1, it seems you should bind #1(or w/e you choose) to LV-N Toggle Motor. Not sure why, but that action group didn\u0027t survive the upload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso while in the spaceplane hanger, lower your craft until one of your gear begins to go inside the floor. Use that as a \u0022ruler\u0022 to place your other gear at appropriate heights. I find that a level craft is a happy craft, at least during takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cal\u0026#039;Mihe","CreatedById":65567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T15:51:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have too much roll authority, even slight movements or jiggling could send the plane rolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoll authority depends on how many ailerons you have and how far away from the centerline they are placed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the big ailerons, try switching them out for the small ones, or if you have multiple, try taking some ailerons away or moving them closer to the centerline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is able to run down the runway completly without issues, then it doesn\u0027t seem like its a landing gear issue. If it was, then you\u0027d have the plane yawing all over the place while still on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKinda curious that it happens with all the planes though, I know at least the Albatross is roll stable. I would second switching on ASAS and letting the plane take off on its own, see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
