I can\u0027t recall if I applied it to one of the stock heatshields or one included with the SpaceY mod, but that\u0027s how I got the 10m heatshield I used with a lander using a Behemoth 10m tank as a base. It worked, though there was no ablation. Total landed mass was about 125 tonnes back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
