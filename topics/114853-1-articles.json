The only mod I\u0027m using is KerbalEngineer Redux, which I will try removing when I get the chance.\n\nFor me, the bug started when I docked to a strange vessel -- I had a little probe built onto my science station attached by clamp-o-tron, Jr., but I built it wrong so when I decoupled the clamp-o-tron the probe stayed stuck and wouldn\u0027t separate. Then later I added a docking port to the science station by bringing up a claw adapter, with claw on one end and clamp-o-tron, Jr. on the other end, attaching it to the stuck-on probe of my vessel.\n\nNow, whenever I try to dock or undock, the game goes nuts. As I cross some invisible boundary of a couple Km distance, either entering or leaving, or if I enter time acceleration inside the bubble together, whichever vessel does \\*not\\* have the focus gets wildly shaken (small vessels survive ok, large ones come apart), both vessels get locked together (distance won\u0027t change no matter what, engine burn stops affecting orbit) and this locked together orbit starts slowly moving away from Kerbin without changing shape. Stays circular but just moves away. If I wasn\u0027t accelerating before, and I do time acceleration, I get the same message, \u0022cannot warp while under acceleration\u0022.\n\nNigeth, is any of this similar to your buggy save?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunk of Cheese","CreatedById":113948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T22:48:25Z","Content":"Does your craft have a klaw?\n\nHere is a thread describing what looks exactly like my version of this problem, and a fix:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100286-BUST-Claw-Frozen-Stuck-Orbits-Breaking-Infinite-Acceleration](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100286-BUST-Claw-Frozen-Stuck-Orbits-Breaking-Infinite-Acceleration)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-4-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-4b-2-1-Aug-15%29?p=2115007\u0026viewfull=1#post2115007](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-4-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-4b-2-1-Aug-15%29?p=2115007\u0026viewfull=1#post2115007)"}]}
