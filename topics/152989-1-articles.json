It will not throttle. It is all or nothing. When I right click on it, I can\u0027t change the trust either, it is stuck at 100%, so I am thinking it is not a keyboard issue. It is a basic LV-T45. The only mod I have is MechJeb, but it is not enabled. Is there some way I can get control of the engine again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T19:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I solved it myself.
