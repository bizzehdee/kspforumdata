I decided to send the spacestation to orbit, then dock with the lander, so when I reach duna I can land and still have some fuel in my station, that way I hit 2 birds with one rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not the problem.. the problem is I don\u0027t have enough fuel to carry that weight to duna, So i must launch a refueler to dock with the lander and refuel the Jumbo tank, I launched , and when docking my spacecraft ( refueler ) was shaking so bad! even with RCS and ASAS, I tried everything I could to dock, but a success.. I docked, then in all of a sudden the refueler shaked HARD and wipped the tank that would refuel the Jumbo tank. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ewhat caused this ?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Answered! thanks for the answer Dynamo!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T15:05:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MrPopcup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dynamo","CreatedById":16626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T13:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the description here seems kind of vague to me, i think that you\u0027re getting the post docking wobbles here. If you noticed that the SAS and/or RCS were still engaged after docking, that may have been what caused your issue. Your SAS and RCS gets confused when you dock larger ships together, as the \u0022impact\u0022 of docking can throw off your ship, causing the RCS to go into a frenzy to get back to the heading you wanted it to stay at. The violent shaking that follows can tear apart more fragile ships. When docking these ships then, it is advisable to turn off BOTH SAS and RCS as soon as you dock, and cancel the gyration with time warp.

It was really hard to dock them.. I used your advise ( Turn off ASAS and RCS ) and it worked like charm! now I have a spacestation around duna and a kethane miner! yay!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: Excuse me, english is my 3rd language and I was in a hurry when I wrote that.. you can count in that i\u0027m also very fast in typing.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
