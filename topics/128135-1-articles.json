STA3 : Call to Arms v1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have never heard of it, it is a mod for a space RTS called Sins of a Solar Empire : Rebellion. I haven\u0027t played the vanilla version, I only bought the game to play this mod after seeing some cool play throughs. The developers have done an amazing job of adding loads of detailed ship textures as well as creating lots of new ships for the Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians and Borg to balance out the ship varieties the Federation have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are fan of Star Trek games, (and I there haven\u0027t been any for a while), then I would recommend you check it out, especially if you like massive fleet battles! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
