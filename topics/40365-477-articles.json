Firespitter is apparently not compatable with .25, and being a noob I have no clue what implications that has. There is no texture for the 1.25m Thermal engine (Its completely white), the Large Argon tank while physically occupying space appears extremely small, making for large awkward gaps. The thermal engines don\u0027t seem to work properly, as I can only switch them between Thermal vacuum (Which doesn\u0027t work) and monopropellant, which after an entire runway got me up to 26m/s. There is also no FX when the engine is on, so the mod is pretty much broken for me. Hoping for fixes and insight if I installed it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T20:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Woodstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Woodstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOUCH I tried to think about it!
