I made it so when you start climbing with 20 degrees it adjusts its own climbing degree as it goes up so you don\u0027t have to touch anything and micromanage and it reaches 120km orbit in about 9 real life minutes. This one can carry 2 tons easy, 3 tons if you push it. Tho you can always remove the clampotron and crew cabin modules and get 3 more tons of capacity making it go up to 6 tons. Now pay attention how the cargo bay and point of mass is aligned perfectly so any cargo that you can take wouldn\u0027t effect the planes stability. Another thing is notice how the wings are swept upwards and that causes the lifting point to go over the mass point which is great for stability. Always have your mass point a bit forward and under the point of lift. Align your point of mass and point of thrust horizantally for the space part of your ascent. This is not needed that badly for the atmosphere part since your ailerons will be able to compansate but it still is good to have your thrust aligned always. I use external fuel tanks for this design. You do not have to ditch them if you wanna cut down on the cost but that would save 100 more liquid fuel for the atomic engine when you reach orbit and total cost is about 1k dollars empty so yeah... Another thing is always make sure your plane is stable at every stage of the flight. I have seen so many people complaining about their planes flipping out and getting into flat spin when they reenter atmosphere. This is caused by fuel getting consumed and point of mass shifting. Make sure your plane is always stable at every part of the flight as the fuel gets consumed.\n\nAnother thing is you need to lock unnecessary options from your ailerons. Like tail(rudder) is only for yaw and wing tip(ailerons) are only for roll while middle(elevators) are for pitch. You can always use pitch on your tail by adding 2 controll surfaces(elevators) to sides but spaceplanes with no tail works better. You can always use action keys to create flaps. Notice how i use flaps while reentring and landing. Well that is about it i guess hope this helps mate.\n\nKeep in mind this is not actually an optimized craft i bet a more experienced player could make it to orbit with even more liquid fuel left for the nuke. I just like it fast and don\u0027t like to micromanage much thats all.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

And as i said again this is not an optimised plane at all i just like fast stuff. I see some people creating great ssto planes and have guides how to ascend with them. Most veterans claim they climb the first part of atmosphere going 100m/s for fuel saving... Then it takes 25 minutes to reach orbit which i just don\u0027t like. The same reason why i don\u0027t like nuke or ion engines. If there was a viable physical fast forward sure it would work great but right now it\u0027s just a pain to use. I find SSTO rockets alot easier. Allready made one that can go to minmus without droping anything and has everything needed for mining.

After getting above 35 km, you basically want to pitch down to the horizon, and **throttle back** so the apoapsis stays ~1 minute in front of you and not further ahead. Drag losses above 45km get very minimal, so a long low power burn is much more efficient. Maybe even equip your craft with a LV-909, as this engine has the best performance/weight ratio for the required delta-V, and probably sufficient thrust to perform this long low power burn (except when you\u0027re building a really heavy SSTO you might want multiple LV-909\u0027s).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T22:50:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris\\_2**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T02:43:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a somewhat simple cargo SSTO plane I made:\n\u003E [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot94.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot94.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Carries ~9 tons of cargo to a 75x75km orbit, with enough fuel left to deorbit and fly around in air for a while.

The centre of mass is way in the back, the centre of lift is even further back, and nowhere near the centre of mass. Yet it flies so very well... I don\u0027t understand.

This completely shakes the very foundations on what I have been trying to base my plane designs on.\n\nOften my SSTO\u0027s are similar.\n\nIt seems to help keep the nose forward. When your center of lift is behind your mass it also means your drag is higher there and your plane will not flip around as easily when under very high thrust.\n\nSometimes it\u0027s a struggle to keep the nose up like this. If lift is too far back then it\u0027s too hard to keep the nose up. \n\nIt can also cause problems when gliding back in for a landing. My SSTO\u0027s usually have a terrible glide profile. I usually glide in nosed down at about 10 degrees then pull up at last moment which barely levels me out for a hard landing on my wheels.\n\nSo there\u0027s definitely a disadvantage of having the lift that far back. Often when I\u0027ve tried moving it forward towards CoM then my plane never stabilizes while descending and just flails around all the way to it\u0027s death because I can\u0027t get the nose to stay forward or even prograde."},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T05:48:27Z","Content":"Center of lift and drag way towards the back helps keep stability as your fuel drains and your center of mass moves back.

This completely shakes the very foundations on what I have been trying to base my plane designs on.\n\nThe CoM is fairly far back on purpose. I tried to align it with the middle of the cargo bay, that way the plane would have similar flight characteristics if a lighter payload was substituted or after the payload is released. (Protip: Ore containers are dense when filled, if a plane can get to orbit with the bay full of ore it should be able to get there with any other payload that fits.)\n\nAs for stability, it\u0027s less important how far ahead/back the CoL and CoM are than how they are positioned relative to each other.

Their horrid TWR makes them challenging to get to orbit with. Their efficiency only breaks even if you regularly fly past minmus. However they remain popular because they allow for oxidizer free designs.\n\nRapiers are hands down the best space plane engine. They have the best hypersonic performance and also double as a rocket. The only other practical aerobic engine for a space plane is the turbo jet. The turbo jet has better trans-sonic performance than the rapier. That means you need fewer of them for you aerobic profile (rapiers are drag limited, turbos are speed/altitude limited). In exchange you need dedicated anaerobic engines and more rocket dV to orbit. All said, you want about .7-.8 TWR and 2Km/s (conservatively) on rockets for a comfortable accent.\n\nA NASA modeled shuttle is a real undertaking. A few hours of research will show you how a rocket without radial symmetry is a challenge. 3 stages with radically different thrust vectors, mass centers, and lift vectors. I\u0027d instead advise a Kerbal shuttle: build a jet (basic fine) with an OMS, point vertical, add moar boosters (symmetrically of course).\n\nKeep in mind, jets and wings are dead weight in space. Shuttles are about making the part that returns to surface worth more. Space plane SSTOs make that portion worth more still by using the air as a free oxidizer."},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:15:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I struggled with getting any useful payload at all at first.
