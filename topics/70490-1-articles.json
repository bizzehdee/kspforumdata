It had disastrous consequences, wiping out the entire satellite network, leaving entire continents without power for weeks, and, worst of all, it created large radioactive belts around Kerbin (that people named \u0022Van Kallen\u0022) meaning that until new science was researched, kerbalkind would be stuck in LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s what they did. They sent unmanned probes to other worlds, collecting as much science as possible from Jool and its moons, Eve and Dres. Using this new science, they got more funds from the government to research better, more safer technologies. After a couple of months, they launched the core of the first geostationary space station: Qwetmee. Initially, the public was skeptical about the project, because it could endanger the crew and even them. Also, the letter \u0022Kwuh\u0022 was abolished in 20 KD, so people were not sure how to pronounce the name. However, after a brief lecture on the letter \u0022kwuh\u0022, the public began to like this new letter, eventually replacing the letter \u0022c\u0022. Nowadays it is only used in writing old names and words borrowed from the Krussians. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, the core of Qwetmee was launched! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y7YWJCW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y7YWJCW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt didn\u0027t go too well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second launch however, was a complete success! The bad news is that there are no on orbit photographs of Qwetmee. Shame, too... Looked quite nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second module to be launched was an experimental scientific research lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ueOBjav.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ueOBjav.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third module was an observation module, to do !!!SCIENCE!!! with the Sun. It was nicknamed Oopsy, because that would be the first thing you\u0027d say if you detected an incoming solar flare/storm. It was noted however that the crew would use much ruder words, but this was not taken into consideration when the module was given a designation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KffD9EH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KffD9EH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQwetmee did OK, but one day... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi35XQjFV_A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi35XQjFV_A\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: KSC, Kerlorf here. We have just woken up and we are receiving a ridiculously large amount of radiation. If we don\u0027t leave in the next half hour we\u0027re not going to make it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC: Roger. Our sensors indicate that as well... Pack your stuff and get into the escape pod. Stand-by. We\u0027ll let you know if you are go for abort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: OK, I\u0027ll tell the crew. Guys! Pack you\u0027re things, we\u0027re leaving! We\u0027ve gotta go now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: But Kerlorf! Look!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: I don\u0027t have time now! Clean up your quarter! Fredvin, you do the same!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFREDVIN: But...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Shut up! If we stay here any longer we\u0027ll die!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: But Kerlorf! We\u0027ve got incoming debris!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Shu-- What?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: I detected it as soon as I woke up. I looked out the window and saw some twinkling stars. And it\u0027s broad daylight outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Oh dammit... Will it impact?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: It\u0027s too small and too far away, I can\u0027t run any calculations. But the chances ar---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFREDVIN: It already has. I went to the Science lab to get my research equipment but when I got there there was a two centimetre hole in the wall. That\u0027s how the radiation\u0027s getting in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Qesus Krist! We\u0027re standing in its path... Wait. From where \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E this debris coming from? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: I can\u0027t tell, but our best choice is from the Mim rescue mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFREDVIN: When Shepcal and the lads got stranded in Munar orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: Yup. But here\u0027s a question: why aren\u0027t the alarms doing anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Well, the radiation alarm is already going off, but the radiation level\u0027s so high that it\u0027s causing everything to cease function. So are the other alarms. Anyway, we\u0027re wasting air and time. Get to the escape pod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back on Kerbin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: It\u0027s too high. They\u0027re contaminated. We can\u0027t bring them back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHEPNEY: Pff... Kod... I just... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: It\u0027s not your fault. They went up there knowing the risk that they might not come back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHEPNEY: What, so it\u0027s their fault that they went up there in the first place?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Shep, calm down! This won\u0027t solve anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHEPNEY: But what are we gonna tell them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll ask their status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESonney turns to the monitor and turns the radio on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Qwetmee, Sonney here. What\u0027s your status?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: Chaotic, to say the least. We\u0027ve been hit by a piece of debris from what we assume to be from Mim, making a hole in the lab. We\u0027re not quite sure if the entire debris field will hit us, but better safe than sorry. Are we go for abort and re-entry? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Roger... Stand-by. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: Oh come ON!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESonney turns the radio off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Did you hear that? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHEPNEY: I\u0027m not sure if I should be happy or sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: It\u0027s the only thing to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESonney turns on the intercom and his voice is heard across Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Lads, I\u0027d like a go-no go for abort. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole room spits out just two words: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALL: NO GO!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHEPNEY: There you have it. We have to tell them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: But how? How will we tell their families? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHEPNEY: I\u0027ll contact the FSA (Federal Security Agency). You just tell them that it was a fun ride, but it must come to an end. Say that... I dunno! Just say the truth! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: I think I know what to say. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESonny turns the radio on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Qwetmee this is KSC. We have some not-so-good news for you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Oh Kod... How long have we got?? Tell my wife and kids I love them!! Oh Kod, oh Kod, oh Kod...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: You are no-go for abort. The escape pod is already contaminated. Even if you were to leave now, you\u0027re still contaminated beyond cure. We\u0027re not sure if the debris field will hit you or not, but it won\u0027t matter. Kerlorf, I\u0027m so sorry, but... You guys aren\u0027t going home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerlorf started crying. Having heard him, Dogee and Fredvin stopped transporting supplies into the escape pod. They had understood why he was crying. Dogee spoke in a quiet voice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOGEE: Put Charon on the line. While you\u0027re at it put Jessika and Krystol on too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFredvin looked out the window. They had company. Oxygen was now down to 30%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFREDVIN: KSC, this is Fredvin. Visual of the Mim debris field confirmed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: Hey KSC... Do we have permission to go out for a sneaky EVA? You know? \u0027Cos... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESONNEY: Be my guest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew of Qwetmee smiled at each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey used explosive decompression to get out. They weren\u0027t exactly planning on going back inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERLORF: I don\u0027t care... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDebris struck Qwetmee. Spinning at a phenomenal rate, pieces flung off of it into the distance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDogee was the first to go. He was hit by the remains of the science lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerlorf followed soon after. He was struck by the remains of a solar panel while looking at mother Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFredvin was the last one to leave. He saw his friends die and, knowing that comms were down, there was nobody to talk to. He shut his eyes, took a deep breath, after which he opened his helmet, killing him instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir bodies are still there to this very day, but with literally no chance of recovery. A national day of mourning was held the following day. The official reason though was just \u0022DEBRIS STRIKE\u0022 and not because of radiation. Well, it wasn\u0027t technically a lie, because it was the debris strike that caused the radiation to get in. But still, the audio transcripts weren\u0027t published to keep the program going. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Maxinimal Space Agency lost lives and money because of Qwetmee. They launched a little satellite (Qwetmee 2) to replace the station. They needed a comeback. They needed something big. They needed a manned mission to Duna. It was the only way to gain public interest. There were already plans for such a mission, but it involved nuclear reactors, and after the recent incident, it wasn\u0027t worth the risk. They came up with a mission that was around twice as big as Qwetmee, could land on Duna and Ike, and could leave a part of it in Duna orbit for a potential future space station. They came up with the most ambitious, expensive and impressive mission ever designed. They came up with Redder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-25T18:12:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2014 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Maxilica\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
