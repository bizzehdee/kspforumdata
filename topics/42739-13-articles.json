Right now the zoom seems to affect the entire viewport, so the Sun and background stars also become larger. This really shouldn\u0027t happen because they are too far away for the meager zoom levels on such a camera to make any difference. I think a better solution would be to actually move the game camera itself out ahead of the craft, if that\u0027s possible. That should bring the close objects closer (like the surface of a planet) but leave the background stars looking much the same. Basically, I\u0027m looking for the same effect you get zooming in and out in the Tracking Station or Map screen. Planets get big and small but the background stays the same\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rubber Ducky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rubber Ducky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUm, that\u0027s not actually how it works... ?

Rubber Ducky is partially correct but he\u0027s only taking into account relatively close objects. Stars are nowhere near close to the camera. They should not grow bigger.

Now, if those stars were as far from the camera as Kerbin is, then their apparent size would grow the same as Kerbin. But they are not. Not even close. Since they are many light years away, zooming closer to Kerbin won\u0027t have any affect at all on their size or brightness.

Anyways, hopefully this is possible to do to make zoomed in images more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hrm, so in making this image I\u0027ve realized my original thought about making the camera behave like the tracking station won\u0027t work. The zoomed image does do one thing properly that the tracking station camera movement does not - it makes the stars further apart. But since the skybox is a static image.... craaap \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E You\u0027d have to break the skybox static image into individual star images set against a black skybox and have the star billboards move apart as you zoomed in... ok, I don\u0027t see this happening anytime soon.
