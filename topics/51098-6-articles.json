I, like TheSaint, spent several years babysitting nuclear reactors for the US Navy and currently work on fusion energy research. I have worn a radiation dosimeter for over a decade of my professional life. (I am wearing one as I type these words.) I stated far upthread that there are legitimate concerns about nuclear energy production that don\u0027t directly have to do with radiation exposure to people: nuclear plants are difficult and expensive to operate and maintain. They chew through materials and generate copious amounts of radioactive waste: not just spent fuel, but also water samples, air filters, valve parts, treatment chemicals, paint chips, etc etc etc. They require specialized materials and specialized designs, which makes building them and maintaining them expensive and difficult. It is easy to make a mistake with catastrophic consequences. In my Navy time I personally was either on watch for or assisted with clean up for: an unisolable feed leak in the steam system, a major chloride accident, rapid over-pressurization of a steam generator pressure vessel at low temperature because of a stuck relief, a feed loss that resulted in unbalanced neutron flux in the core, a main engine catastrophic failure and several other more minor casualties. All of these had the potential to cause core damage and/or high radiation exposure to personnel and/or loss of life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the radiation hazard isn\u0027t trivial. We look at accidents, but the Hanford site in Washington state is in the middle of a decades-long, multi-billion dollar clean-up. Lethal radiation doses have been found in ground soil there due to leaking storage tanks. Thousands of people have filed suit against the government because of an increase in thyroid cancer incidence likely due to the release of radioactive iodine isotopes. We who are radiation workers don\u0027t get lethal doses, but it\u0027s because we\u0027re very careful about radiation, not blase. There are large portions of the building I work in that will absolutely give you a lethal dose if you stand there when the machine is activated. And we have thick shield walls, a complicated series of locks, and double and triple-check personnel sweeps to make sure that doesn\u0027t happen. And we\u0027re a fusion facility, without the long-lived isotopes, super-heated and high-pressure fluids, and decay heat problems you have at a fission plant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd what side is \u0022my side\u0022, exactly?

I, like TheSaint, spent several years babysitting nuclear reactors for the US Navy and currently work on fusion energy research. I have worn a radiation dosimeter for over a decade of my professional life. (I am wearing one as I type these words.) I stated far upthread that there are legitimate concerns about nuclear energy production that don\u0027t directly have to do with radiation exposure to people: nuclear plants are difficult and expensive to operate and maintain. They chew through materials and generate copious amounts of radioactive waste: not just spent fuel, but also water samples, air filters, valve parts, treatment chemicals, paint chips, etc etc etc. They require specialized materials and specialized designs, which makes building them and maintaining them expensive and difficult. It is easy to make a mistake with catastrophic consequences. In my Navy time I personally was either on watch for or assisted with clean up for: an unisolable feed leak in the steam system, a major chloride accident, rapid over-pressurization of a steam generator pressure vessel at low temperature because of a stuck relief, a feed loss that resulted in unbalanced neutron flux in the core, a main engine catastrophic failure and several other more minor casualties. All of these had the potential to cause core damage and/or high radiation exposure to personnel and/or loss of life. \u003Cp\u003EAnd the radiation hazard isn\u0027t trivial. We look at accidents, but the Hanford site in Washington state is in the middle of a decades-long, multi-billion dollar clean-up. Lethal radiation doses have been found in ground soil there due to leaking storage tanks. Thousands of people have filed suit against the government because of an increase in thyroid cancer incidence likely due to the release of radioactive iodine isotopes. We who are radiation workers don\u0027t get lethal doses, but it\u0027s because we\u0027re very careful about radiation, not blase. There are large portions of the building I work in that will absolutely give you a lethal dose if you stand there when the machine is activated. And we have thick shield walls, a complicated series of locks, and double and triple-check personnel sweeps to make sure that doesn\u0027t happen. And we\u0027re a fusion facility, without the long-lived isotopes, super-heated and high-pressure fluids, and decay heat problems you have at a fission plant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait wait wait wait...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t see something fishy about your second paragraph?

Reprocessing does carry some risk of nuclear proliferation, as the reprocessing equipment can be used for enriching uranium. However, France has already demonstrated that reprocessing is a perfectly viable option, and the risk of proliferation is low, especially if undertaken by countries already in possession of nuclear weapons. Generation IV fast reactors are also capable of burning spent fuel without reprocessing. By implementing these reactors, we could skip reprocessing entirely, and some of them (breeder reactors) could even reprocess fuel on their own for use in themselves or other nuclear plants. There is still the issue of the (much smaller) volume of unusable waste.

There have been very few serious accidents concerning nuclear power. Both Chernobyl and, to a lesser extent, Fukashima, were as a result of lax safety standards. Chernobyl had far too many problems in reactor design, crew training, and operating procedures to list here. All design issues related to Chernobyl have been corrected in modern reactors, and crew training and operating procedures are much safer (and should be enforced more stringently by regulatory bodies). Fukashima had a fundamental flaw in that it\u0027s backup generators were vulnerable to flooding. This design flaw had been previously noted, but no attention was made to correct it. If tighter regulation enforcement is enacted, accidents of that scale can be prevented. Furthermore, the newest generation of reactors are much safer. Many Gen IV designs are \u0022passively safe\u0022, meaning they have no danger of melting down even during a loss-of-coolant accident such as what happened in Fukashima.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMining dangers:\u003C/strong\u003E Uranium mining is a dangerous operation. However, by reprocessing old uranium and using fast reactors that burn nuclear waste, the amount of needed uranium drops sharply. While mining uranium will likely never be 100% safe, the much lower volume needed compared to coal means that the dangers are drastically reduced. Furthermore, uranium can be recovered from seawater in small amounts. The amount recoverable isn\u0027t favorable in the current climate, but if we start to reuse most of the fuel rather than discarding it, it could be a viable way to get fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProliferation:\u003C/strong\u003E This is another big issue.
