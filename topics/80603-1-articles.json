The most efficient way to rendezvous with the station is to burn prograde at over the equator/inclination node to get your apoapsis as high as possible without leaving the SoI. Make your inclination change up at the apoapsis (it\u0027s much cheaper because your orbital velocity is lower). Then just fall back down to the altitude of your station and rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider it a learning exercise \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E Making big inclination changes are efficient at the apoapses of highly eccentric orbits is frequently done to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
