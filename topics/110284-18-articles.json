With both Snacks and TAC-LS, the greenhouse will produce Food/Snacks after 90 days, with time reduced if you have a skilled scientist in the module. With Snacks, you can produce Snacks from Ore in the Doc Commercial Science Lab, which is exactly how Snacks itself works, but it\u0027s (hopefully) cheaper to use the greenhouse. With TAC-LS, the Watney Chemistry Lab can split water to produce Oxygen. The Pigpen can clean your WasteWater and turn Waste into Organics for the greenhouse, while the greenhouse consumes CarbonDioxide as it grows Food. The system is not 100% closed loop with either Snacks or TAC-LS; you\u0027ll need to drill for resources to get the inputs you need, but you\u0027ll have no dependencies on Kerbin other than the kerbals that provide efficiency bonuses and who set everything up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the three difficulty levels mentioned above for life support, I have no plans to add in USI-LS at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Kosmos","CreatedById":7632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T22:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Angel-125\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Angel-125\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReleasing a Ponderosa from the muncrete slab is not something I considered and not recommended if you have other parts attached to the habitat.

It is based upon NASA\u0027s real-world Multi-mission Modular Space Exploration vehicle (MMSEV). Just like the NASA vehicle, the Buffalo can be configured as a rover, but it doesn\u0027t stop there. (Coming Soon!) The Buffalo can become an asteroid exploration craft, a munar lander, a cargo hauler, and more. This initial offering provides the components needed to build the \u0022space truck\u0022 version of the Buffalo; future versions will offer in-space functionality. The best thing is that the Buffalo can be assembled by an engineer via KIS, and the vehicle is sized to fit into a standard 3.75m cargo bay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Buffalo components include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuffalo Command Cab:\u003C/strong\u003E A command pod that seats two kerbals, with Stock IVA and ASET Props/Avionics-based IVA (highly recommended).
