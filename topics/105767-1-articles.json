So after lots of trial and error, I\u0027ll resort to ask for some help trying to capture myself in orbits around Duna \u0026amp; Eve (Probably every other planet too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve set up two missions, one to Duna, one to Eve to land a small probe. For the first mission to Duna, I followed the tutorials and used the mechjeb interplanetary porkchop maneauver planner to setup my burn to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQue a few hundred days later, I arrive in the Duna system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut where the tutorial mentions that aerobraking can be thrilling with speeds up to 2km/s, my probe happily dives to Duna at a good 8km/s. Even skimming the surface at just I ended up needing to go down to about 5km above the surface to slow down sufficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve just about the same story, as my probe plunges towards the planet, it goes along at 8km/s, if not closer to 9km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve dipped into the atmosphere to about 90km altitude, but with little effect on my speed, or my final orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d go lower, but I understand that doing so would most likely result in rapid unplanned disassembly due to the thick atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong in my captures to get these speeds? Usually I leave notes of my missions, but unfortunately, I don\u0027t have anymore notes about my escape burn from Kerbin. An earlier safe did show my Duna Probe cruising in a Kerbol orbit towards Duna at 14,5km/s (If that helps.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks for any feedback !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are... really high speeds.
