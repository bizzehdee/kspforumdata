The Skylab II can only really launch by itself to LLO, as Block IB capacity to TLI is 37.8 T. I\u0027m not sure about the fairing, as SLS payload fairing lengths are still nominal, but proposed BA-2100 launches use a 10 meter fairing many times longer than the H2 tank of an SLS EUS. And the baseline used for this by NASA\u00A0is a Block IB, using a normal EUS.
