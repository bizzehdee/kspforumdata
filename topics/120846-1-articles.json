If it rises above the CoM (the point your machine is basically rotating around) it might overpower your control authority. After breaking the sound barrier those forces multiply and a lot of draggy stuff at the top of your rocket will make the CoP jump upwards. That\u0027s why it is generally better to follow the golden rule and add draggy stuff at the bottom (fins) and heavy stuff at the top (well fueled upper stages). The problem with the CoP is that there\u0027s no tool telling you where it is because it mostly relies on the shape and direction of your rocket.

The thing is, even with two of them (160 units of RCS fuel), not much in the way of delta-v to make deviations as I intended. I found a mod that helps with that and thrust in general, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewindows_x_seven: I don\u0027t turn 90 degrees in a split second.
