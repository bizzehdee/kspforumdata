If it\u0027s too big for a plasmid then just do a few rounds of selection based on the hydroxylase expression or to be more precise you\u0027d want to select solely based on growth speed in a growth medium with polyethylene as limiting factor since it\u0027s uncertain which other factors contribute to effectiveness of energy source usage. Either way you could let it loose on the patch where it would have a competitive edge due to being more effective at consuming the available energy source. The only thing it could do compared to a wild strain is drop the plasmid or be outcompeted by other strains if there\u0027s better energy sources available. Once the polyethylene is consumed in an area the modified strain will die out and return to normal levels. Any chances of random mutations are exactly the same than with any other wild bacteria in the region. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever there\u0027s big chance that it wouldn\u0027t be such a huge successs, ecological systems are unpredictable and if using polyethylene as competitive advantage would be a good idea, there would most likely already be a plankton species exploiting it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
