How does this work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some other questions, some people get so much science in just 3 flights. I\u0027ve done more than 6 flights now and some exploration on the ground. I \u0027\u0027recovered\u0027\u0027 most of the times instead of transmitting. I think I got around 25 science every time, but that\u0027s it. How do I get more science done easily?
