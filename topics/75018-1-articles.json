It\u0027s risky, exciting and dangerous. We might do our best to keep our crews safe and ensure they get back home... but sometimes the worst happen. It can be because we made a mistake, or the Kraken decided to strike that particular craft/mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start with the story of \u003Cstrong\u003EEdgee Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was part of the LR-Dragon Dres Mission with Dudfal and Hanfurt. Their goal was to reach Dres, land there and get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding had been tricky already, with a poorly designed ship, too high and with a narrow landing section. This lead to many \u0022landing simulations\u0022 (read quicksaves/quickloads) until a flat terrain could be found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving managed to land at the bottom of a crater, Hanfurt was the first to leave the ship to plant a flag. He named the place Castor Crater and claimed it in the name of science and kerbalkind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdgee would be the next one to set foot outside the pod. And he decided to go explore the next-door crater. It took him almost half his jetpack fuel and he finished on foot to save some for the trip back, but he reached the bottom of that second crater and named it Pollux (not very original but whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was 10km from the ship and the sun was setting down when he took off. At first, everything went fine. He passed the edge separating the 2 craters and commenced his descent. Unfortunately, with the sun now setting in his back, he was in the dark and couldn\u0027t tell how high above the ground he was. He could only tell how fast he was going down. He did his best, trying to keep it at about 10m/s... But all of a sudden, he impacted the ground and died instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdgee Kerman, you were a true hero, as reckless as Jeb, and you will be missed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-14T15:28:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2014 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alephzorg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alephzorg","CreatedById":2383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T11:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould a mod please edit the title to \u0022Let\u0027s mourn our Kerbals together\u0022 please?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T12:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do that on your own \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E just hit \u0022Edit\u0022, \u0022Go Advanced\u0022 and then edit the title from there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T12:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to mourn the loss of Jeb.... again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb died because I forgot to quicksave before flipping him over and breakdancing on the Mun in a prototype wheel-less rover.

It had been more than 6 years since they had set off from KSC, and they were so very lonely.
