Building bigger, more elaborate, space stations and bases will give you higher rewards. With this, putting a rover on the mun *may* not be as lucrative as adding another module to your space station. So I had a thought to push people to do more. Expectations exist outside of the contracts system and are a permanent negative modifier where you can have one expectation at a time from the State and one expectation from the Public. An expectation may be where the public *expects* you to have a rover on the mun (if you do not already have one). So while you do not have a rover on the moon they are upset and have a negative modifier until you fulfill that expectation. It won\u0027t be crippling but it will be something you want to resolve.

Two superpowers - the United States of Kirba (USK) and The Union of Soviet Socialist Kerbals (USSK)- were locked in an escalating political conflict (The Kold War) and began looking to the skies as the new stage for their displays of power and domination. Shortly before the launch of the first rocket, a little known Kerbal by the name of Jebediah Kerman, adrift with fledgling dreams of being the first Kerbal in space, happened to be passing by a meeting between government officials as he remarked \u0027how great it would be to be nice to Kerbals for a change\u0027. Little was he aware of the gravity of his words, touching the leaders with his innocent Kerbality. A deal was made, resources were pooled, and a new site for launches was proposed at the equator, making life much easier for everyone.
