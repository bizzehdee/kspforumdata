Building bigger, more elaborate, space stations and bases will give you higher rewards. With this, putting a rover on the mun \\*may\\* not be as lucrative as adding another module to your space station. So I had a thought to push people to do more. Expectations exist outside of the contracts system and are a permanent negative modifier where you can have one expectation at a time from the State and one expectation from the Public. An expectation may be where the public \\*expects\\* you to have a rover on the mun (if you do not already have one). So while you do not have a rover on the moon they are upset and have a negative modifier until you fulfill that expectation. It won\u0027t be crippling but it will be something you want to resolve.
