Including the rail of the current ship. When you do an orbital maneuvre, the future ones are shown in brown. And you still see your current Ap and Pe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, with the target indicators, it\u0027s not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You dont see target Ap/Pe \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Ascending and Decending nodes show in green. It\u0027s not really an attribute of the target but rather a mix of the two. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The main issue I have is that you dont see Ascending and decending nodes if you plan a maneuvre for it. It seems to already change to what it will be post maneuvre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Does intersections show in red and brown?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Pick the colours and stick to it. Current vessel=blue, target = green, common attributes (intercepts, asc/desc) = yellow. Adjustments/predictions can maybe done in dotted lines or lighter colours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Allow you to decided whether Ascending and descending node should be shown at all, only planned ones (while planning) or both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Option to show intercepts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Option to show target Ap/Pe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make the current ship BLUE and the target ship GREEN on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Also on the selection thingy on top of the page on the map, allow you to set whether target and curernt ship should be shown. e.g. if I have 15 satellites and I have two satellites to dock, I may want to show no satellites at all and only target and current ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I can never remember which intersect point is red and which is brown. Why not name as you do with other icons? I1, I2 sounds good to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there\u0027s a mod for it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe someone wants to build a mod for it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there\u0027s a keyboard combo to achieve all of this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
