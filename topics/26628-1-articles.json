Anyways, my MBA runs KSP ok, but it only runs without lag on tiny rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E. I am thinking about getting a better computer, and I want a laptop so it is portable and I can take it with me on trips and stuff. So, a new 13\u0022 MacBook Pro with a 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel i7 that can TurboBoost up to 3.6 GHz that has a 4MB L3 cache, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel HD 4000 graphics card would probably run KSP great, right? I\u0027m not very sure, but I figured that the forums might be a good place to check before I buy anything. I might end up building my own PC and get it to run Mac OS X, since I like OS X better than Windows and Linux, but I would prefer to buy a computer rather than build my own.

The specs you list seem good enough apart from the graphics card. I really, really recommend you look for a laptop that has a dedicated graphics card (ATI or NVidia) and if you do decide to look for something else than Apple you\u0027ll probably find that a similar laptop with Windows and a dedicated graphics card costs about half the price on that Macbook.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leonov","CreatedById":51498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T13:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOS X is acctully a Unix BSD system, so switching to a Linux Distro would be fairly straight foreward.
