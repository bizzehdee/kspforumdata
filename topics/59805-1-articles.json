A way to get in to the building, bonus points for things that look like drills or by blowing a hole in using a stack separator, etc.). However, as it stands the challenge has no scoring and isnt terribly difficult. I think the premise could be cool, but you will need to add a bit more to make it interesting, difficult, or otherwise scoreable. How many launches do I get, can I use mods, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to read the challenge guidelines posted \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24898-Challenge-Submission-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E.
