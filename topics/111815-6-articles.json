I didn\u0027t find anything with this mod in it though. I\u0027ll look again at some other time.\n\nThat super-massive colony ship looks really interesting. I really like the idea of having one of those colonies built on the inside of a rotating tube. Like this:\n\n![nasa\u002Bspace\u002Bcolony\u002Bmoon.jpg](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mp0rD0cgDf0/UKOaKh2a9wI/AAAAAAAAIys/Z4nTSwlF48Y/s640/nasa\u002Bspace\u002Bcolony\u002Bmoon.jpg)\n\nAlrightman: It would be better to have it displayed in whole kerbals, but I don\u0027t think the game engine allows it. I just think of the whole numbers being fully-grown kerbals, and decimals being kerbal children (they must exist, right?)."}]}
