SpaceX started development of a 5:1 configuration so there is obviously some room for variance.

I assume the primary driver here is the relative masses of the two stages: you want your launch vehicle to have a T/W ratio of nearly 2:1 at launch, but you want your second stage to be roughly one fifth the mass of your first stage and have closer to a 1:1 T/W ratio at separation, suggesting a nearly 10:1 thrust ratio...pretty close to Falcon 9.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other considerations?

One of the first factors being the vehicle mission. A vehicle designed to be reusable will have different parameters than one that will be entirely disposable. For instance a reusable vehicle that intends to propulsively land will require an amount of delta V to perform the landing that is no longer used towards the orbit system. Different missions will also have different trajectories that may require more or less thrust on the upper stage compared to lower stage. Different feed systems will vary the mass ratios as will different geometries. Upper stage engines may also have extended nozzles and even without them will have substantially different effective velocities than those used in the low atmosphere. There are a lot of different other factors as well. You can compare what various companies use but ultimately it will be a case by case basis what will work best and it may simply come down to what is convenient or good enough rather than what is optimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least for a disposable system you can estimate stage mass ratios with the following.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003Ex=[1:100];\u003Cbr\u003E\ny=zeros(1,100);\u003Cbr\u003E\nc=1;\u003Cbr\u003E\n% Mass Fractions\u003Cbr\u003E\nnuL=0.07;\u003Cbr\u003E\nnuU=0.07;\u003Cbr\u003E\n% Effective Velocity\u003Cbr\u003E\nEVL=3400;\u003Cbr\u003E\nEVU=3550;\u003Cbr\u003E\n% Total Rocket Mass\u003Cbr\u003E\nMt = 1920;\u003Cbr\u003E\n% Payload Mass\u003Cbr\u003E\nMp = 80;\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor c=1:100\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 % Lower Stage Mass\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Ml=Mt*x(c)/100;\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 % Upper Stage Mass\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Mu=Mt*(100-x(c))/100;\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 % Delta U estimation\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 delU = EVL*log((Ml\u002BMu\u002BMp)/(nuL*Ml\u002BMu\u002BMp))\u002BEVU*log((Mu\u002BMp)/(Mu*nuU\u002BMp));\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 y(c) = delU;\u003Cbr\u003E\nend\u003Cbr\u003E\nplot(x,y)\u003Cbr\u003E\ntitle(\u0027Delta U Estimation\u0027);\u003Cbr\u003E\nxlabel(\u0027Percentage First Stage of Total Vehicle Mass\u0027);\u003Cbr\u003E\nylabel(\u0027Delta U\u0027)\u003Cbr\u003E\ngrid on\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T14:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222541245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138161\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461686338\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere does the 5:1 ratio come from?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was an earlier design for a Falcon that was eventually scrapped. \u00A0Generally 3:1 seems closer to the ideal (and KSP seems to agree with building a test rocket out of a Mark 1-2 capsule, Rokomax-16 fuel tanks, and reliant engines (rocket wasn\u0027t flown due to iffy overall construction, but had \u0026gt;4000 m/s delta-v).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads to the question of would a three-stage \u0022falcon [ultra]-heavy\u0022 work better with a 9 (or presumably 12, but 9 is obviously available):3:1 stage setting. \u00A0 Presumably the chance of recovering the middle stage is too low to bother with (and designing the current \u0022heavy\u0022 is also\u00A0easier than shoving a middle stage in). \u00A0Without cross-feeding, I\u0027m less sure (but I have even less confidence of landing a higher stage. \u00A0Personally, I\u0027d strap some COTS (commercial off the shelf) SRBs to the [unrecoverable] second stage for more delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
