Sadly I can\u0027t undock a module. When I press undock, nothing happens.\n\nThe module itself is just a part, I used the astroid grabber to connect a ship to it from the other end. This worked before with moving modules.\n\nAfter googling I found out you need to change some stuff in the save file. I tried disabling the crossfeed to allow me to find the part in the save file but it\u0027s not saving this change. So I can\u0027t search for this.. I also tried searching for the name but could not find it in the file.\n\nAny tips? I can\u0027t do anything. Removing the module it connects to is not possible. It would mean I would have to take apart my entire station to replace it.."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T05:15:11Z","Content":"I see you\u0027ve posted in my main docking thread, and I responded there. I\u0027m more than happy to help you in there, to keep things from being less confusing. So in that case, I will close this thread for now...Unless you would rather it stay open.
