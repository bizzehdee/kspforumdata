I tried last year, and saw something that annoyed me, and stopped. A friend likes the show, and I gave it another chance, only to see that utter nonsense. It wasn\u0027t dramatic license, it was awful. It\u0027s nice to see that the creator didn\u0027t like it, but they should have reshot it, frankly. Maybe next year I\u0027ll watch again.
