the title says, when you hit the quickload button it saves and names it something like \u0027quickload\u0027 THEN it loads the quicksave. this way if your like me and sometimes go\u00A0days with out quick saving and then at 2am hit the quick load button and find yourself not even on the mun yet, you can just reload your save instead of throwing your computer out the
