It seems the only place to get one is from an existing vessel. If I try instantiating one directly none of the fields are initialized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to create a tool to let you place maneuver nodes on the orbit of the body you are currently orbiting. Once you have done this it can solve for an ejection burn that will have the desired effect. This would allow you to plan interplanetary transfers more efficiently and accurately than waiting for a launch window and guessing, since you can factor in eccentricity and inclination by adjusting the maneuver, without the high sensitivity of adjusting the node in your own orbit. The idea is similar to the TransX plugin for Orbiter, where you specify your transfer from one planet to another then it tells you how to do the ejection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I can see no way to create a node that is on the planet\u0027s orbit, instead of your own. I have examined the MechJeb source code, but it only creates maneuver nodes along your own orbit, so it can use Vessel.PatchedConicSolver. I think it would also work to create a dummy vessel that is positioned at the center of the planet and has the same velocity (as long as it doesn\u0027t blow up), but I have the same problem of not being able to create an instance of Vessel from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T23:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a Unity API Reference page: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.AddComponent.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.AddComponent.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust add a Vessel component to the body you\u0027re orbiting, \u003Cem\u003Eet voila\u003C/em\u003E!
