How does the definition of solid objects work in KSP? It seems like there are at least two different surfaces for Pol, one that is used visually and another one that blew up your ship (and that Mechjeb seems to be looking for).\n\nI dunno. Last time I was at Pol, MJ was looking for the visible surface, saying how high above it the ship way (which agreed with the altimeter) and then BOOM. Ship collided with Pol about 1500m up. \n\nThere\u0027s a sort of mountain range running E-W just south of the equator on 1 side of Pol. The north side of this is one of the most dangerous places to land, although there are others, all near large mountains. It\u0027s like the collider and the surface mesh are misaligned.\n\nNOTE: Pol is the worst in this regard but isn\u0027t alone. Gilly also has the same problem in places."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:28:54Z","Content":"Yeah, I have seen this on Gilly too.\n\nMan, do I hate Gilly. There is almost no gravity, plus you can\u0027t timewarp below 6km, so unless you turn around and burn down to the surface it takes forever to land there. And then the landings are bugged on top of all that!"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:34:08Z","Content":"What does the radar altimeter say how high are you?"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:36:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What does the radar altimeter say how high are you?\n\nI wasn\u0027t in IVA, don\u0027t know what the reading was, but that\u0027s a spiffy idea you\u0027ve got there.
