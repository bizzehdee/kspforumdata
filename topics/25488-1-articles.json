Right now I have a maneuver node set at its current apogee (or apoapsis, if you prefer) that requires a delta-v of just under 7k m/s. that will put the periapsis beneath the sun at something like 12million meters. Not sure if I have the fuel for that (in fact I\u0027m highly doubtful) so I\u0027m curious how low the perigee should be in order to ensure the sun will catch the probe and \u0022sink\u0022 into the sun. Anyone know how low the periapsis should be in order to cause this effect?
