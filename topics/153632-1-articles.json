Looking at them up close, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re supposed to be like that. Obviously this isn\u0027t the biggest deal in the world, but I would like to play the game the way it was intended to be played.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xn2sPhn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xn2sPhn.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Graphics card I am using is :\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNVIDIA\u00A0GeForce 840 M\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently not running any mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
