The example I just tripped up on was on BobCat\u0027s Orion capsule (in the American Pack). His parachute system accurately simulates the Orion parachutes, i.e. braking chutes that deploy at high altitude, then these are cut and 3 main parachutes deploy at lower altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make this system work right in some cases (low altitude aborts) you have to cut the braking chutes manually. The issue at hand is there are 2 sets of chutes using the standard parachute module. Both have a \u0027Deploy\u0027 and a \u0027Cut Chute\u0027 action in the Action Groups menu. It\u0027s *complete* guess-work trying to figure out which is which because there\u0027s nothing differentiating between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this mod developers not understanding the workings of the system fair enough. Point me to the info to solve it and I\u0027ll pass it on. If, however, this is a shortcoming with Squad\u0027s system it would be better id there was a way to label the module you are activating so for e.g.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the .cfg:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleParachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E actionLabel = \u0022Main\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleParachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E actionLabel = \u0022Brake\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the Action Group menu for the part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Deploy (Main)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Cut Chute (Main)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Deploy (Brake)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Cut Chute (Brake)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough this isn\u0027t a perfect example, the point is fairly valid I think. I\u0027ve seen several mods where there\u0027s a lot of confusion as to what action does what or what an action group actually does at all. It might be nice if any Action Group action could be labelled via the .cfg file to have a human-friendly name to differentiate it or describe it better. I HAVE seen some mods (cBBp\u0027s Dragon Rider for one) that have custom descriptions but these are for animations not things like parachutes, so don\u0027t use the standard modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T09:31:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MDBenson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
