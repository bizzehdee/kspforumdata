The deconstruction of the opposition, is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. To overlook this phase of overturning is to forget the conflictual and subordinating structure of opposition.[5]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T15:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I guess you should reference all movement in relation to the centre of the universe.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFalse, the universe has no center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach point of the universe is the center of the universe..
