I want to create a visual element 100% by code, that could be dragable, but nothing more. Just like a visual guide to help constructing crafts in VAB/SPH. If it is not possible, can someone point me in the right direction on how to make it? Im triying to learn how to make plugins for KSP, and my experience with unity is 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T18:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the best hint for you is, that you as a beginner should look for mods who do what you try to accomplish. There are a bunch of procedural mods out there, though that might be a little bit to complex. There also recently was someone who wanted to display a CoM marker in flight, what might be an easier start. No idea where or if his stuff is [already], though. Anyway, you most likely end up building a model at runtime, just like those procedural mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T18:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt should be entirely possible to create an object using Unity primatives \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.CreatePrimitive.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.CreatePrimitive.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lttito","CreatedById":49289,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T22:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info.
