I like to use stupid numbers of SRBs with parachutes and separating motors and struts, fancy external fuel tanks that get repeated, that sort of thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the only way to edit all of them at once is if I limit myself to the built-in radial symmetry; I edit 1 SRB and the other 5 SRB groups update around my main rocket. But if I add a second layer of SRBs or something, so that I have 1 central rocket, 6 SRBs, and 12 secondary SRBs, I can\u0027t edit the entire secondary SRB pile at once. Symmetry will allow me to do 6 at a time, then I must duplicate my changes either by copypasting and realigning, or re-doing what I did step-by-step. I also can\u0027t update my secondary SRB subassembly on other rockets without ripping and replacing, and hoping I get my alignment just so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to have the option of referring back to a \u0022master\u0022 subassembly when building, such that changes to an instance of this subassembly affect \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E instances of the sub on my current rocket. If I update the stored sub in the parts browser, and load another rocket or plane that uses the subassembly I updated, I want to have the option to \u0022swap out\u0022 the older instances for the new ones. I would still keep the existing every-part-unique relationship going too, so I could break the link between a referenced sub and my selected instance whenever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand there are mods available that combine groups of parts into a single part, but that unfortunately makes them a \u003Cem\u003Esingle\u003C/em\u003E part; ie, they can\u0027t flex, break, heat up independently, that sort of thing. It\u0027s fun when things fall apart, but it isn\u0027t fun tediously redoing the same build steps over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I could instance groups of parts and maintain that link to the master subassembly, I could test and optimize with the freedom to have more than one active design, I could spend more of my time making fancy designs instead of reworking the same things, I could pretend to have little Kerbal corporations independently building and delivering contraptions, etc. It makes building a bit more engaging and approachable, without losing any of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould this help anyone else? Is this planned?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T21:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea, it\u0027s certainly got potential to be useful.
