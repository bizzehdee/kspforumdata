They lost touch with the craft after going on EVA (happens often ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ) And I can never get the Kerbals back on the craft, I have difficulty with orienting them without navball etc.\n\n\\* Orbit and land unmanned probe on the mun, sorta, probe lost some parts during landing bit it is working ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (Remote Tech).\n\n\\* Orbit and crash unmanned probe on minmus (Remote Tech).\n\n\\* Build a 4 satellite constellation orbiting on 0/45/90/135 degrees orbits around kerbin at an altitude of 60Mm (outside minmus orbit, Remote Tech) capable of communicating with probes up to 50 Gm away.\n\n\\* Do a controlled launch to another planet! Duna for a flyby mission. The ship has more than 2000m/s left which is enough for a burn to Valit (Kerbolplus) after passing Duna soi while still ending with 1200m/s and in range of my comnetwork ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) .\n\n\\* Build a plane that actually flies in a controllable matter.\n\n\\* Flew the plane to the island airfield, landed but overshot the runway, managed to fulfill the airfield contract.\n\n\\* As a bonus I managed to return with the plane to KSP and land it in one piece! Just not on the runway though. Have to work on my targeting although I parked it in front of the rocket launch site ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n\\* Flew the plane to the pyramids and landed on an uphill slope. When I released the brakes (stupid me) again after standstill it rolled back though and crashed anyway, Kerbal was alive!\n\n\\*Kill only 3 Kerbals sofar and 2 tourists. Normally deaths would be 10-20 by now.\n\nAnd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\\* I launched a Kerbal to the Mun and landed the craft flawlessly on first ever try (manned craft, unmanned tried before but never 100%)! Then had an EVA. Did science. Planted my 1st flag anywhere ever! Then I managed to return the Kerbal and craft to Kerbin. First entered orbit even and unintentionally landed at 1km from the pyramids ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) with 600 m/s. With 54,000 funds my most expensive construct ever!\n\nI am not spamming science btw. So I am relatively low tech. Only a few 90 science nodes unlocked and 2 beyond for antenna\u0027s for long range capability. Future first tries will be docking, re-entering craft after loosing contact (kerbal on EVA), flyby of Eve and Moho. landing probe on other planet.\n\nAll in all I am very very excited. And I will not download 1.03 as I am afraid it will break this brilliant save! LOL"}]}
