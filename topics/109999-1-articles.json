How did you get to KSP 1.0","CreatedByName":"Ival70","CreatedById":75336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:44:31Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Ival70","CreatedById":75336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:44:31Z","Content":"I had made a thread asking whether Youtubers influenced the decision for people to get the game, and that made me wonder. When did you first hear about KSP, when did you get KSP, how active have you been since you got KSP, essentially, what is the story that got you here today to 1.0?\n\nI suppose I\u0027ll start with my own.\n\nI originally heard about KSP from a friend (who had the game since 0.7.3) who described it as \u0022a game where you use rocket parts to design rockets and watch a simulation of their performance.\u0022 To which I replied; \u0022That sounds really stupid and boring, and unrealistic\u0022. Luckily for me, he eventually got around to actually showing me it, at which point I downloaded it immediately (this was in 2011, back when the game was free). I don\u0027t remember which version it was, though the atmosphere only extended to 35,000m or something.\n\nI updated the game once in a blue moon, usually after several updates had been available, and each time I (now regretfully) deleted any previous version. Eventually the 13.3 demo came out, which I played for a few weeks, then mostly stopped playing the game. A couple of weeks after 1.8.3, I heard about the update and got the new demo, and made a forum account which I only made a couple of posts, and either forgot the username and password, or it was washed down the drain in the forum april shower.\n\nI managed to actively play the demo (squeezing out every last drop of content) until June (I made airplanes, rovers, SSTO\u0027s, submarines, even replicas), at which point I decided that KSP had come far along enough that I was confident that they would finish the game (I procrastinated), and bought myself a full copy for 20$. Shortly after I made a new forum account, and in the years since, I have enjoyed being active in the community, following the progression of KSP.\n\nSince then I have made at least 10 people buy them game, and I only wish I had bought it earlier (and hadn\u0027t deleted every version before 1.8.3). While I knew a lot of the mechanics to playing the game (how to get into orbit, change periapsis, etc.), the visual concepts, and hands on approach of KSP has vastly increased my fundamental understanding of how space works. Now hopefully, my all of our KSP stories will continue for a long time, with many more updates to come. \n\nThank you Squad for making something this awesome!"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:57:41Z","Content":"I got KSP shortly after it came to steam.

I pirated the game yes, and I bought it for the full $40 on steam less than a week later. It was THAT good.

I can\u0027t recall how long ago that was. I bought KSP back at .14 (it may have been .13.3). It is hard to remember that far back, but I think it was the first updated after the Mun was added that I bought it (or maybe it was the 2nd update after the Mun?). I\u0027ve been active playing it all along from when I bought it. At worst there might have been a month or two where I didn\u0027t get any play time for personal reasons, but I\u0027d guess I probably average at least 30hrs a month over the last 2 1/2 or 3 years now. Some weeks I might put in 20hrs in a week, others I just might not have the time to play at all.\n\nAs it stands I don\u0027t think he plays it much anymore. As it stands KSP is pretty much the only game I ever play. It is a combination of being addictive enough along with being a father of 3 and a job that sucks up too much of my time as well as some other hobbies that are a time suck (home brewing beer, yeah, that sucks up a lot of time).\n\nI am super excited about possible Multiplayer, especially if it is multiplayer with personal server persistance (like Minecraft). Especially if it will be possible to do multi with Career mode at some point. My son is a huge KSP nut and my younger son plays a little here and there. I could probably even suck my brother-in-law back in at some point. To me the possibilities with multi are nearly endless, especially with resource gathering (I mine and refine fuel and then deliver it to my son\u0027s interplanetary ship as an example).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T13:28:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lazarus1024**"}]}
