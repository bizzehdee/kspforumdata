I love the small form factor (especially for \u0022nuclear\u0022 probes - so useful!), but sometimes I have to go bigger. Especially for longer journeys, a low-thrust monoprop engine\u0027s not going to do the trick for me. I need a high-thrust, low-consumption alternative (late science is fine)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking, \u0022how cool would it be to mod in an engine design for probes like the warp ship from Star Trek: First Contact?\u0022 I started looking at modding resources, but found that a lot of it\u0027s out of date. I don\u0027t have time this week to look into it further, but I plan on asking around the community this weekend, if I can find a spare moment, for more info on how to get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the interim, I figured \u0022why not post it to the community, anyway?!\u0022 I would love to be involved, but my wheelhouse - as a software dev - is obviously more on the programming side (with 2D art being something in which I still dabble, but a study of proper 3D techniques being a bit beyond my grasp at the moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I love the flexibility offered by TweakScale, I\u0027d love to see an integration of that (and maybe the fuel tank mod that adds the tank GUI to the menu). Integration with other mods (Karbonite, open resource, etc.) would just be a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think, fellow Kerbonauts?
