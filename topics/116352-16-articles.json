Due to the latter\u0027s biplane configuration, it has high drag but massive lift, and it uses its low stall speed but high turn rate to get inside of other craft (as its turn radius is and can remain small); faster planes \u0022waste time\u0022 decelerating to optimal turning speeds, whereas the Double Down does not.\n\u003E The GAU-8 is probably too effective for its point value; because it uses 30mm rounds, even a single hit will destroy something, and given its high fire rate, anything caught in its weapon arc will be subjected to immediate vaporization, which is why the Double Down can end battles so quickly.\n\nMy plane was able to turn at about the same rate as the Double Down, but in a wider arc. I suspect if I\u0027d dialled down the top speed, it could have been closer, gun allowing.\n\nI\u0027d keep the point values to something like a budget allowing either:\n\n- a Vulcan and 6 missiles, \n\n- 2 Vulcans or one GAU and 3 missiles, \n\n- or 2 GAU and no missiles.\n\n30mm ammo could alternatively be more expensive.

Mods allowed (there are other BD based weapon mods, are they balanced?), all weapons open. Planes and anything else you can control using the AI. The only limit would be part count. The winner is the last one with something left still with propulsion and under control/controllable. For practical purposes, 1v1 is advised at the point of launch.\n\n- **Top Gun AI Pro:** A FAR based version of the fighter challenge. A few select mods would be allowed (e.g. Pwings, Quiztech), the goal being to produce gorgeous and very effective planes. This is for the plane designers who want to take it to the next level.\n\n- **Joint Strike Fighter AI:** A series of challenges to find the best allround airframe, based on the Top Gun ruleset. I envision three rounds:\n\n\\*Air-to-air (v the same plane, probably a 3v2 scenario to push the designs to cope in an outnumbered scenario), \n\n\\*Air-to-ground (testing their ability to take out ground defences and survive Goalkeepers and SAM missiles), and \n\n\\* Interceptor (scramble and defend the KSC from incoming bombers, on a set flightpath targetting probes with weapon managers placed on the KSC, testing their ability to launch and attain altitude then take out large, turreted bombers).\n\nPoints would be awarded for each round depending on value and number of targets destroyed, losses and damage sustained. The only changes allowed between rounds would be AI settings, weapon loadout (hard points would need to be the same in all rounds, so give those careful thought), and fuel levels.\n\nThis one may take some improvements in the AI to pull off, Guard range being the biggest limitation at the moment.\n\n- **Duck Hunt AI:** Use the Air Race features in Kerbal Konstructs to time a plane in taking out a series of targets, placed on the ground (or floating in the air) in series which the plane will follow in order. Mountains would make it extra challenging. I recall this being a challenge a very long time ago, using balloons. Now we can do it with AI.\n\n- **Top Gun VTOL AI:** A variant of the fighter format, but especially for VTOLs. An arena lacking a runway would be perfect. I\u0027ll let you figure out how to do VTOL take-off using the AI. It can be done ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027d perhaps consider this and a few select mods, as stock currently has very restricted VTOL engine options: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-3-0-1-0-4-Continued/page25](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-3-0-1-0-4-Continued/page25)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T22:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T00:03:13Z","Content":"I updated the OP and included my last post on more tournament formats."},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T16:45:09Z","Content":"Hmmm, about an official ruleset..
