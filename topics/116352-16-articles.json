Mods allowed (there are other BD based weapon mods, are they balanced?), all weapons open. Planes and anything else you can control using the AI. The only limit would be part count. The winner is the last one with something left still with propulsion and under control/controllable. For practical purposes, 1v1 is advised at the point of launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ETop Gun AI Pro:\u003C/strong\u003E A FAR based version of the fighter challenge. A few select mods would be allowed (e.g. Pwings, Quiztech), the goal being to produce gorgeous and very effective planes. This is for the plane designers who want to take it to the next level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EJoint Strike Fighter AI:\u003C/strong\u003E A series of challenges to find the best allround airframe, based on the Top Gun ruleset. I envision three rounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Air-to-air (v the same plane, probably a 3v2 scenario to push the designs to cope in an outnumbered scenario), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Air-to-ground (testing their ability to take out ground defences and survive Goalkeepers and SAM missiles), and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Interceptor (scramble and defend the KSC from incoming bombers, on a set flightpath targetting probes with weapon managers placed on the KSC, testing their ability to launch and attain altitude then take out large, turreted bombers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoints would be awarded for each round depending on value and number of targets destroyed, losses and damage sustained. The only changes allowed between rounds would be AI settings, weapon loadout (hard points would need to be the same in all rounds, so give those careful thought), and fuel levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one may take some improvements in the AI to pull off, Guard range being the biggest limitation at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EDuck Hunt AI:\u003C/strong\u003E Use the Air Race features in Kerbal Konstructs to time a plane in taking out a series of targets, placed on the ground (or floating in the air) in series which the plane will follow in order.
