For Mods I use the CKAN Program. My Problem is, that Mechjeb 2.5.3 doesn\u0027t show all menues in the Science Mode (I know that you have to unlock it in carreer mode). The Mechjeb Menue is on my right Screen and when I click on it, buttons like docking are not there. I Installed the Toolbar 1.7.9 to use docking. When I Install the toolbar, it says incompatible with KSP 1.0.4, but sometimes it will work for one flight, but then I have to reinstall the toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Problem is, that I want to use the Mecheb menue, but there is never a docking button. Only with the toolbar I can use this button (sometimes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone help me with this prolem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stratochief66","CreatedById":59541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T00:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that in science and career mode, more complex functionality of MechJeb is unlocked through the tech nodes.
