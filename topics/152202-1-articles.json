The idea was to collect 2 sets of data, one to turn in and one to send up to a lab. The problem is, When these containers collect data, they first check other science containers and then won\u0027t collect from the experments because they already have a copy. So the data just goes back and forth. They need to check containers last. They do seem to not check crew modules until after experments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
