The goat next to her mostly kept to itself, eschewing the in-flight meal for the worn vinyl and stained foam padding of the seat next to the chicken. Having tried the in-flight meal, Valentina wondered if perhaps the goat was on to something. The chicken, however...\n\nIt had spent the entire flight looking back over its seat, eyeing her suspiciously. How this was even physically possible, she still wasn\u0027t quite sure, but wasn\u0027t about to go questioning the chicken over it, either. It seemed more than a bit... shifty. \n\nIgnoring the peering poultry for the moment and turning back to the window, she looked out over the checkerboard pattern of farmland and jungle far below. It didn\u0027t make any *sense*. It didn\u0027t make any sense at *all*. Why on Kerbin would...\n\nShe had read the letter in the envelope. Then read it again. And again. And *again*. Then she had tried to transliterate it, wondering if perhaps it wasn\u0027t someone\u0027s idea of a bad joke, substituting those odd Eastern letters for proper Keryllic ones into what *looked* like words, but was really just unpronounceable gibberish. *F\u0424\u042F P\u0426TI\u0419S S\u0414\u041A\u0417!*\n\nIt just didn\u0027t make any *sense!* A space center. In *Cerima*. Even *that* sounded like the setup to a bad joke. And this space center was assembling in orbit the largest spacecraft the world had ever known. \n\nOnly, the world *didn\u0027t* know about it. No one did, save for a relatively small cadre of personnel that Valentina was, somehow, now a part of. Apparently the Kommissar had been sending people for years, since the early days of the space program. Scientists. Engineers. Technicians. People she had known, who suddenly \u0022disappeared.\u0022 But no pilots. Never any pilots. \n\nUntil her. \n\nOther agencies around the world had been doing the same. Often without even knowing it. All shrouded under the umbrella of a secret program by the Layland-Wutani Corporation to land on every body in the solar system. And along the way, to scout sites for future interplanetary colonies. The outer moons of Jool were of specific interest. \n\nAnd orchestrating it all from the shadows, was her old friend Edmund Kerman. She had pieced the rest together for herself. Edmund was corrupted by that... that *thing*. Shadowstained, the Kommissar had called him. And with all his \u0022friends\u0022 and contacts, Edmund was in the perfect position to spread that stain into all sorts of positions of power. For all she knew, *everyone* was... infected. Maybe even the Kommissar. \n\nHe *was* a part of it, after all. A *significant* part, using his office to direct people and materials, ostensibly at the behest of the Imperium itself. And somehow he had gotten her on the roster to fly the next assembly mission. But *that* didn\u0027t make any sense! His orders, once she got there, were unambiguous. \n\nWhatever the cost, destroy the ship. By any means necessary. \n\nValentina sighed as she looked out the window. The squares of farmland had abruptly ended, and now nothing but pristine jungle stretched off in every direction. She still couldn\u0027t quite see the border from this angle. Someone had told her she couldn\u0027t miss it. Somewhere out there, was Cerima. It was madness. \n\nThe plane hit a bump, and she felt a great disturbance... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror, and then... just cried. She feared something terrible had happened, far, far away. \n\nFor now, she pushed the thought away. What she had been through on the M\u00FCn still haunted her. She had to tell *some*one, but... not just *any*one. Someone. Someone very specific. She just wished she knew *who*. And why had Chadvey\u0027s voice\u2014\n\n\u0022Hullo, lass!\u0022\n\n\u0022GAH!\u0022 said Valentina. \n\n\u0022BUH-GOK!\u0022 said the chicken. \n\n\u0022WAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\u0022 said the goat.\n\nValentina looked around frantically, but it was only the same motley crew of passengers and livestock that had been there before. The chicken, however, was eyeing her even *more* suspiciously. Then where\u2014?\n\n\u0022Ah\u0027m in yer head, lass.\u0022\n\n\u0022My head? Why\u2014\u0022 the chicken narrowed an eye at her, \u0022why are you in my head?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well Ah don\u0027t really know, presumably Ah\u0027m just a repressed subconscious manifestation again. Ah really should have finished that degree, but th\u0027 professor was quite batty.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... I can *hear* you... and people are staring,\u0022 she stuck her tongue out at the chicken. \n\n\u0022Hmm, well that is rather concerning. Near as Ah can tell, it\u0027s either a sign of the impending collapse of your entire psyche, or that mayo was a wee bit off.\u0022\n\nShe frowned down at her empty plate. Even the goat hadn\u0027t touched the tuna salad. It had happily eaten the plate, though. \n\n\u0022WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!\u0022 agreed the goat.\n\n\u0022But why is it... you?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, Ah suppose your subconscious is an excellent judge of character, with impeccable taste!\u0022\n\nShe rolled her eyes, \u0022so, why are you... manifesting?\u0022\n\n\u0022Probably to convey a message such that you won\u0027t miss it. Be *very* careful here, lass. Something about this whole mess stinks. And Ah dunna mean the pigs in 7D.\u0022\n\nOh, so *that\u0027s* what that was, \u0022what... should I do?\u0022\n\n\u0022Continue on as the big fellow said, play the part. But grow eyes in the back of yer head and dunna trust *anyone*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Not... not even you?\u0022\n\n\u0022*Especially* not me.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... if you are me, does that meant I cannot even trust myself?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, Ah... Er... That is... Blast it, now you\u0027ve gone and given me a bloody existential crisis, and that\u0027s a very serious things for an incorporeal manifestation. Ah\u0027ll have t\u0027 get back to you on that.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wait, Chadvey... *Chadvey!!*\u0022 the chicken jumped, then started giving her the eye with its *other* eye.\n\n\u0022WAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!\u0022 said the goat.\n\n*Atendantes de cabina, por favor tomen sus asientos para aterrizaje. Y cuidado con los huevos.*\n\nValentina grunted, folding her arms as the plane dropped a wing and her view of the ground disappeared. She was getting very tired of wondering if *now*, she had finally gone mad. But... that did keep her mind occupied against... other things. Just look at it as another mission. She had a job to do, same as any other. She could put on a smile and look confident in front of news cameras, these people couldn\u0027t be *that* different.\n\n...could they?\n\nThe chicken seemed to disagree. \n\n\u0022Oh, and one more thing.\u0022\n\n\u0022GAH!\u0022 said Valentina. \n\n\u0022BUH-GOK!\u0022 said the chicken. \n\n\u0022WAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\u0022 said the goat.\n\n\u0022What\u2014\u0022 the chicken eyed her back and forth, \u0022what is it now? I thought you were busy having a crisis.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, Ah am, but as long as Ah\u0027m getting all existential anyway, Ah\u0027m supposed t\u0027 pass this on: *ahem*, \u0027luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. The product of mass and acceleration will be with you, *always*.\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022What...\u0022 she blinked. The chicken blinked. The goat stared. \u0022What is that supposed to mean?\u0022\n\n\u0022He says, you\u0027ll know, when it\u0027s time.\u0022\n\n\u0022He? Who he? There are more of you in there?? In... here?\u0022 Valentina put a hand to her face, \u0022I really have gone mad this time, haven\u0027t I?\u0022\n\n\u0022He says you\u0027ll know that too. Also, bring a towel. A towel!? Now why in the bloody green blazes would she need...\u0022\n\n\u0022Chadvey? ***Chadvey??***\u0022 but he was gone. They. Whatever. The chicken was staring so hard it nearly fell over the seatback. Valentina sighed and rubbed at her temples.\n\nThe little airliner rolled level again, parallel with the nearby border. *Luminous beings are we...* Now why did that seem to make her feel better? Not thinking much of it, she glanced out the window, and what she saw there took her breath away. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022buhGOKWAAAAAAAAAAAAHOINKOINKMOOOOOOOOBAAAAAAAAA!\u0022\n\nValentina waved feathers and fur out of her face as she finally made it to the door. Apparently livestock had deboarding priority. At the foot of the air stair, the chicken still glared at her. It raised two talons to its eyes before pointing them at her. \n\n\u0022Buh. Gok!\u0022 then it scurried off.\n\nRolling her eyes again, she took in the thick jungle air. It was amazingly refreshing after being crammed in that airplane for hours. By now, she had spent enough time near the equator that the weather no longer bothered here. There was even a nice breeze blowing in from the east, and\u2014\n\n\u0022Miss... Miss Valentina!\u0022\n\nFrowning, Valentina started down the stairs toward the caller... then had to stop as a tank rattled and squeaked past. She recognized it. Older Ussari model. The turret shell was made from a single steel casting. *This* turret was scarred by a series of parallel, slightly jagged gouges. They almost looked like\u2014\n\n\u0022Ah, Miss Valentina, pleasure to meet you!\u0022 said a rotund, rather damp Kerbal dressed in expensive white fabric that had no place in the jungle. He paused wiping his bald head with a silken handkerchief just long enough to offer her a hand, \u0022Reginald Montgomery Keswick Kerman the Third, at your service!\u0022 Her diplomatic skills were immediately tested as she struggled to maintain a smile with her hand squishing in his.\n\nAbout this time, a platoon of soldiers in full combat gear came marching past, chanting the most peculiar cadence as they did. \n\n*\u0022Esta es la historia...\u0022\u0022De una se\u00F1ora encantadora!\u0022\u0022Quien estaba criando a...\u0022Tres ni\u00F1as muy encantadoras!\u0022\u0022Todas ellas tenian cabellos de oro...\u0022\u0022Como su madre!\u0022\u0022La m\u00E1s joven lo...\u0022\u0022Tenia en rizos!\u0022*\n\nShe watched them go, then realized the sweaty Kerbal was talking again. He had been too busy wiping his brow to notice her attention sway. \n\n\u0022Bother this heat! I do beg your pardon, ma\u0027am, welcome to the Democratic Plantain Republic of Andacam\u00EDa. *\u00A1Viva Filipe!\u0022*\n\nShe blinked, \u0022Felipe?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, no, it\u0027s *\u00A1Felipe!*,\u0022 he said, mopping his brow, \u0022do mind how you say it. They don\u0027t much care what else we do around here but they\u0027re rather particular about that. Or, more formally, Generalissimo Presidente Felipe Pablo Diego Jos\u00E9 Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Mar\u00EDa de los Remedios Cipriano de la Sant\u00EDsima Trinidad Ruiz y Arroz y Frijoles.\u0022 He pointed across the concrete to a large mural on the side of a building; a grinning fellow looking very sure of himself behind his dark sunglasses, head dramatically cocked, in a white uniform with *huge* golden epaulettes on his shoulders, a wide-brimmed hat even wider than any Ussari cover, chomping on a thick cigar. \n\nThe mural, above the enormous artillery piece. Looking around the sprawling complex, Valentina saw such murals were all *over* the place. Along with tanks, jeeps, howitzers... A row of sleek fighters laden with stores lined the runway, helicopters off to one side... All of them middle-aged but very capable-looking Ussari surplus. And then there was the gargantuan tracked... *thing* in the middle. She had no idea what it was. Some sort of transport, perhaps, bristling with repurposed tank turrets.\n\nShe raised an eye... bulge at Reginald as he wiped his brow, \u0022*democratic*, you say?\u0022\n\n\u0022Quite so, quite so,\u0022 he wrung the overwhelmed scrap of cloth out, \u0022Andacamia has a long and proud tradition of *one Kerb, one vote*. *\u00A1Felipe!* is the Kerb, and *\u00A1Felipe!* has the vote. He\u0027s won every election in a landslide for the past twenty or thirty years.\u0022\n\nHer eye... bulged a little higher. \n\n\u0022You see, when one shares the world\u0027s longest border with the world\u0027s most *un*stable place, one learns a thing or two about stability for oneself. Officially, the national motto is \u0027*\u00A1Viva Felipe!*,\u0027 but unofficially it\u0027s \u0027*si non confectus, non reficiat*.\u0027\u0022\n\nHer other eye... bulge went up. \n\n\u0022\u0027If it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it.\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022I see,\u0022 Valentina said flatly, then gestured to the massive collection of military hardware surrounding them, \u0022so all this is not to keep populace in line?\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, heavens no!\u0022 Reginald drew the rag across his bald pate again, \u0022the locals are actually quite fond of their benevolent dictator. The trains are always on time.\u0022\n\n\u0022And what about *that?!*\u0022 she pointed to what she had seen from the air. It was a Wall. Not merely a *wall*, but most undoubtedly a *Wall*. It stretched to both horizons, which was quite easy to see, since the structure had to be at least a *hundred meters* high. The only thing taller was the jungle beyond. \n\nReginald wiped his head, \u0022that? That\u0027s not to keep the locals in. Or even to keep the Cerimans out. It\u0027s... well, it\u0027s for the local fauna, you see.\u0022\n\nBefore the question could reach Valentina\u0027s lips, a subtle tremor rumbled through the ground. Then again. And again. In a nearby rain puddle, ripples danced back and forth. Then higher. And higher. Thunder seemed to rumble in the distance. \n\n*\u0022\u00A1\u00C1ndale, muchachos!\u0022* someone cried out, and like a startled flock of birds, the entire base was instantly in motion. \n\n*\u0022\u00A1Arriba, arriba!\u0022*\n\n*\u0022\u00A1Av\u00EDspate!\u0022*\n\n*\u0022\u00A1El podor de la chancla!\u0022*\n\n*\u0022\u00A1Pilas, ojo!\u0022*\n\n*\u0022\u00A1Te sueno la cara!\u0022*\n\n*\u0022\u00A1Aguas!\u0022*\n\n*\u0022\u00A1Tu madre siesta con mi perro!\u0022*\n\nSoldiers ran this way and that, darting behind cover or crewing weapons. Rifle bots slid home, tank turrets whined, cannon breeches clanged shut. Every barrel, muzzle, laser, and crosshairs turned on the Wall. The whole facility grew disquietingly... quiet.\n\nThen came the sound of splintering wood. Deep in the jungle, great clouds of screaming birds suddenly took to the sky. Trees, meters thick, whipped back and forth like mere blades of grass. \n\nAnd punctuating it all, *THUD. THUD. THUD. **THUD**.*\n\nThe chaos ebbed, and for a moment, all was quiet again. Then Valentina clapped her hands to her ears against an aural onslaught beyond anything she\u0027d heard before. *Sound* didn\u0027t do it justice, is was as if all the cells in her body were suddenly vibrating at every frequency in the spectrum at once. The assault seemed to slip past her clenched fingers, bore through her eardrums, wrap its talons around the base of her spine and wrench it back and forth like the treetops a moment ago. \n\nThen it happened again. \n\nAnd *again*.\n\nA pause came, or she\u0027d gone completely deaf. Now the very *ground* seemed to be pulled out from under her feet. She stumbled, swayed, caught herself; and turned an awestruck eye to the Wall. \n\n***BOOM!***\n\nThe concrete seemed to rise and fall in waves. \n\n***BOOM!***\n\nDust was squeezed out of the joints between blocks, rising to the sky as if trying to escape itself. \n\n***BOOM!***\n\nThe whole world teetered back and forth. A hideous crackling sound wafted over the base. A single chunk of cement came cascading down the Wall\u0027s canted face, exploding against the pavement in a cloud that belied its size. \n\nNo one moved. No one breathed. Fingers hovered, quivering, over triggers. \n\nAt length, the horrid sound returned; but more muted, now, and with the distinct timbre of a thing that had just, unexpectedly, encountered a material quite a bit harder than its own head. \n\nThe trees snapped back and forth again as the thing crashed back off into the jungle, now nursing the world\u0027s biggest headache. \n\n*\u0022Todo claro!\u0022*\n\nAnd just like that, the sprawling facility was right back as it was, with marching troops and rattling tanks passing this way and that. \n\n*\u0022Esta es la historia...\u0022*  \n*\u0022De un hombre se llama Brady!\u0022*\n\nValentina grabbed a squishy handful of Reginald\u0027s shirt (and instantly regretted it), \u0022*what on Kerbin was that?!*\u0022\n\nHe looked at her soberly, wiping his head, \u0022the locals call it, \u0027el Grande Muerte.\u0027 Although I much prefer the Ceriman name, which roughly translates to, \u0027don\u0027t even bother running, you\u0027re already boned.\u0027\u0022\n\nShe blinked, \u0022wait, you speak Ceriman?\u0022\n\n\u0022Speak it? Oh, *heavens* no! I\u0027d prefer *not* to get assaulted just enquiring after the loo. *No one* around here *speaks* Ceriman, it\u0027s against regulations. But I can understand it well enough,\u0022 he grinned, and wiped his face. \n\nFeeling another headache coming on, Valentina rubbed at her temples, \u0022I am sorry, *who* are you, again?\u0022\n\n\u0022Reginald Montgomery Keswick\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, yes,\u0022 she waved a hand, \u0022but how do you know *me?* *Why* do you know me?\u0022\n\n\u0022Hmm? Oh, *bother* this heat!\u0022 he mopped at his brow again, \u0022terribly sorry, I am the corporate liaison from Layland-Wutani. The Company wanted me to escort you back to the Hole personally. Brilliant spot, I must say, faking your own death in such a fitting manner. I\u0027m due to attend the funeral next week on the Company\u0027s behalf, I\u0027m certain it will be spectacular. Not a dry eye in the house!\u0022 He beamed with a smile that was anything but dry. \n\n\u0022The\u2014?\u0022 Valentina\u0027s question was cut off as a Wilhelm scream drew her attention back toward the plane. She turned just in time to see a baggage handler arc gracefully through the air.\n\n\u0022AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOHOOOOHOOOEY!\u0022 *splat \u0022estoy bien!\u0022*\n\nA smack filled the heavy jungle air as Valentina\u0027s hand met her face, \u0022excuse me one moment please.\u0022 \n\nShe quickly located the source of the commotion, \u0022Igor... it is not nice to *throw* people,\u0022 she scolded, and then: \u0022but your distance is improving.\u0022\n\nIgor scowled, but put down the terrified gate agent, who quickly found somewhere else to be. \n\nReturning to the round, sweaty Kerbal, she handled the introduction, \u0022Mister, um, Kerman, this is my, er, associate, Igor.\u0022\n\nReginald gaped up in the typical fashion, his dripping face forgotten for the moment, \u0022my word...\u0022\n\nIt was a short moment. \u0022Yes, well, I suppose the pilot shall have to make some adjustments to the weight and balance sheet,\u0022 he mumbled as he wiped his gleaming head.\n\n\u0022Is it long flight?\u0022 Valentina asked. \n\n\u0022Typically around an hour, depending,\u0022 he wrung his handkerchief out and continued, \u0022bother this heat.\u0022\n\n\u0022Depending on what?\u0022\n\n\u0022On whether or not we get shot down,\u0022 wipe, wipe, wipe.\n\nNow it was Valentina\u0027s turn to gape in bewilderment. Igor rumbled disconcertingly. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s Cerima beyond that Wall,\u0022 he pointed, before returning to blotting, \u0022even the friendlies are unfriendly. That\u0027s why we have *that* for moving the heftier stages.\u0022 He nodded toward the huge armored *thing* she\u0027d seen earlier, sending a few drops of sweat flying. Looking closer, she could see the scars and patches covering its metallic flank. \n\n\u0022But, that\u0027s enough of that talk! Stiff upper lip and all that rot!\u0022 Reginald gave a bright, drippy... and just slightly forced smile, \u0022shall we go meet the flight crew?\u0022\n\nAcross the concrete apron, there was, of course, a Converter waiting. Next to a pair of Ceriman gunships. And Reginald seemed to be sweating just a bit more. \n\nSpecial thanks to [@vsully](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129549-vsully/) for the only foreign-language text in the story *not* horribly butchered. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) Any actual linguistic errors are entirely my own.
