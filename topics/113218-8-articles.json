I love that aspect of the game. I would, however, radically change Career mode, to the point that it might turn off a lot of people. Please bare with me. I like me some Sandbox gaming, but honestly, a scripted story with set goals can be very fun too. I wish for a KSP \u0022Story\u0022 mode would actually give missions that need to be accomplished to progress an overarching story... that is the discovery of a Stargate like thing at the edge of space!\n\nThe campaign should be roughly aligned with the discovery of new technology. At first, you are doing simple things like reaching orbit, putting satelites, etc. But, as you start exploring the planets, you can really unlock the secrets of those planets. This is where the idea of Outer Wilds comes in. It\u0027s sandbox, but there is still obviously something behind the scenes going on. As the career progresses you might find, say, a cave in Minmus. To enter the cave, you have to build a rover that allows you to move into the cave and explore it. Within it, you discover some ancient artifact or whatever that\u0027s a map to something on Duna. Doesn\u0027t have to be something like that, but it should lead you in that way. Obviously, at no point should you be stopped from diverging from the \u0022story mode\u0022; you can do as you please. In some ways, I want there to be soft \u0022[broken bridges](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge)\u0022 of sorts to encourage the players to continue the story mode... I mean, that\u0027s why you are playing story mode as opposed to the other modes, but it should in no way lock you into it. Kinda like what The Long Dark wants to do with it\u0027s story mode eventually. \n\nI\u0027ve never really developed the idea too much, but it\u0027s always been of interest to me."},{"CreatedByName":"Defenestrator47","CreatedById":145983,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T06:40:33Z","Content":"So okay.  Its page 8 and this is not likely to be read by a lot of folks, but after putting in a few hundred hours, what I\u0027d want out of KSP 2.0 is:   A complete refactoring and reimagining of how rockets are built, using a list of parts from the build menus. It\u0027s late and I\u0027m up on Insomnia and I don\u0027t have pictures to illustrate what I mean, but I\u0027ll do my best.\n\nSo what we have now is a list of predefined shapes.  Fuel tanks, structural elements, braces, pylons, wings, etc.  Each comes from a different menu, and has predefined roles in building rockets and SSTOs and rovers and aaaaaall the other stuff we can build.  And it is great.  But it is also limited.\n\nIn my vision of KSP 2.0, shapes would not be tied to function - for instance, you\u0027d have cylinders, cubes, pyramids, cones...lots of different shapes.  Theyd be empty, allowing you to come up with whatever shape of craft you desire, using a snap and tweak sytem much like the current one.  Once the desired form is created, an \u0027outer skin\u0027 would be created, which you could then fill with fuel tanks, machinery, electrics, gyros, science (SCIENCE!), crew spaces and command center, and all the other googahs and gizmos and widgets that make a mission happen.  A center of mass/lift indicator would help with placement.  Varying tech levels would give more variety and late-game increasing capability.  Engines would still be placed in much the same way as now, or if someone thinks up a better way for them, do that instead.\n\nThis came about from reading the back and forth on the forums from the \u0027clipping/no-clipping\u0027 camps about balance vs. \u0027but it looks so cool like this!\u0027.  If the form is not tied to the function, we could create cool looking AND balanced vehicles (only so much internal volume to play with).  Add in some form of procedural texturing, to make a unified look for each vessel, with varied texture sets and even community-mod texture sets.  Add in the ability to say \u0027this is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, put re-entry ablation plating on surfaces that will face into the descent/aerobraking.\u0027  Have what direction that is be user-defined, even.  Put a \u0027in-hangar flight simulator\u0027 to help define this.\n\nThe game would also feature a wider range of parts of all types.  More cockpits, more wings, or something like a procedural wing generator, because the way wings are built of structural wings and slants right now is awkward, frustrating, and requires lots of strut-bracing to really work.  More lights.  A functional in-atmosphere autopilot that can hold consistant altitude and course and speed.  More arrangements of landing gear, including side-drop, front and rear drop, more fixed gear types, skids...\n\nThat\u0027s basically it.  Mostly the \u0027build a vehicle shape, then fill it with useful components\u0027 design goal is what I want.  The rest is icing."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T11:05:42Z","Content":"Why is everyone trying to come up with an idea for a new game based on \u0022KSP \u002B some other game \u002B multuplayer sequel\u0022?\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be cool to have something that would be more of a prequel to the current game? I would love to play a game where you build aircraft, test them and it tells the story of how the Kerbal Space Program emerged from something like Kerbal Aircraft Program? I think that would be way more interesting than having the same game, except with more space stuff. You can do that with mods and/or by simply buying some other game that already has the features (Elite, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E Online and other space games like that).

In my opinion KSP have developed years to wrong direction while it have grown in the commercial success.\n\nBut I hope that the success of KSP encourages game developers to make many space flight games which are specialized to different things. And there will be also a nerdy micromanagement game for professional engineers and students. A game which try to be as realistic simulation as practically possible and not to become famous or be easy for all. There should be procedurally generated 3D planets, N-body trajectories for crafts, challenging aerodynamics and hundreds of micromanagement things to be taken into account. And lots of exploration to do.\n\nOrbital like flight mechanics combined with possibility to build physically well modeled crafts and some progression in resources and exploration would be nice.
