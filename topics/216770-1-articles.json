I want that functionality, clicking a button on the UI with the mouse is not the best idea. I should be able to do so at a keystroke. Now it doesn\u0027t have to be tied to Escape like it was in KSP1, though I think that makes sense. But, my keyboards all have a Pause key... it kind of makes sense for it to be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-22T08:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt; or ,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-23T11:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224275759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216770\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682150444\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/22/2023 at 9:00 AM, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt; or ,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat works, but if you are warping at the time it\u0027s a few key presses.\u00A0 Or two if you press / then \u0026lt;.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do agree though, having it tied to Esc is more\u00A0 intuitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvelynThe Dragon","CreatedById":227182,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-23T20:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224275759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216770\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682150444\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/22/2023 at 1:00 AM, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt; or ,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to go try it, and yes, it works, but I really don\u0027t like that it is neither explained anywhere I recall seeing, and is tied to the same key as that used to reduce the time warp factor.

As was pointed out, reducing timewarp with the [\u0026lt; ,] key until time is paused effectively does pause the game for you, but probably not the internal server and time potentially passing for other players in development builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it\u0027d be good to have at least a configurable pause button that immediately sets your timewarp to paused mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
