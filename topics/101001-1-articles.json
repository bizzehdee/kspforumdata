That distance check is currently being performed so the new approach should just not affect the performance, not that much as to be considerable.\n\nNow it is the time for mods to enable/disable or change the way the ships/parts are included in the physic calculation list. I can think of some of these:\n\n- high profile gaming pcs can have more physics if they have the power for that, it is their choice.\n\n- enable physics for vessels on atmosphere (or just parts of them) i.e. those having parachutes.\n\n- disable physics (even if within the bubble) on vessels when they are controlled by other player or AI (e.g. multiplayer instances), because physics should only be computed once.\n\n- a mod could provide AI to fly vessels while the player is focused on other things in the other side of the kerbol system.\n\nJust an idea.."}]}
