One of the features that are the most interessting for me are new planets. Since i did not read anything about this mod in the forums, did you know this mod. And do you like it? I personally would like to have exactly the real planets in KSP to do the missions NASA doesn\u0027t. So what do you think this mod brings us?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T23:33:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoving download link to unlicensed mod released without source code.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T21:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have it.
