I had seen textures done with this technique before, but wasn\u0027t aware on how to accomplish it. Then someone let me in on the secret in the kspmodders IRC channel. I haven\u0027t seen this particular topic covered in any tutorials, so I thought I\u0027d write one myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose you have a relatively complex symmetrical model.

Even at those sizes, the texture will never be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an alternate method that will result in much higher texture quality by drastically minimizing the number of islands and allowing more space on the UV maps for the remaining islands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, go through your model and remove any components that repeat through out the model. In this case, let\u0027s start with the spheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZHnV0NM.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022ZHnV0NM.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven reducing to only this level offers a great deal of improvement in the UV Map:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MXiS5Rz.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022MXiS5Rz.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, we can go even further by reducing repeated faced within the primitives themselves.

Either resize the island or edit the model. Resize the island is easier, but would result in distortion in the texture, so not desirable. So I cut the faces of the cylinder in half and unwrapped it again. This results in a much better UV map with minimal wasted space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JocK0B9.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022JocK0B9.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, lets give the model a simple texture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CM2DqrI.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022CM2DqrI.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are happy with the texture, it\u0027s time to start rebuilding the model which is remarkably easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, lets duplicate and rotate the faces of the cylinder until we have rebuilt it. For this, I duplicated the entire cylinder, then rotated it 180 on the x axis.
