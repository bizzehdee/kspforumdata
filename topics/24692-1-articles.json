The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power plant is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself.[39] Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive.

Many people put a blind faith in science and progress to solve all of our problems, because that\u0027s how it has always been. However, we can\u0027t simply look back at what we have accomplished over the last 200 years and assume that the party can last forever. 200 years is a blink of an eye when compared to the 200 000 years we\u0027ve been around and the 4.5 billion years the World has existed. In those 200 years, we have changed the face of the Earth forever and burned most of our easily reachable resources. There are no lessons to be learnt from the past, because a situation like this has never existed before, and there is no reason to beleive that life is always going to be so easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can increase productivity and efficiency through science and technology, but there are laws of diminishing returns at work here while our population growth and resource consumption are exponential. The first technological improvements (the agrarian revolution, then the industrial revolution) were cheap and easy, and the gains in productivity were massive. But the more productivity gains you squeeze out of the system, the harder and the more expensive it becomes, until you reach the point where the economical, social, or ecological cost of squeezing exceeds the relative productivity gain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a race going on between technology opening up new horizons and our demand for growth. In a world of finite resources, it is going to take a lot of sustained effort for our productivity curves to keep up with the exponential demand curves. At some point in the future, those curves are going to intersect (if they haven\u0027t already), at which point we start losing the race. At some point, growth is going to have to slow down (it already is in the more developed countries), but our entire civilization is based on infinite growth, which is simply not possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want to survive, we are going to have to go through a serious rethinking of how the economy works, how we share wealth, and how we maintain a decent quality of life. I don\u0027t see how that sort of revolution can happen without a major conflict between those that want a better share of the wealth and resources and those that don\u0027t want to give up their share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-30T10:40:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2013 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LewisTherin","CreatedById":55124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T11:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet\u0027s say that I don\u0027t have a blind faith in Humanity\u0027s ability to get together peacefully and fix all the World\u0027s economical, ecological, and demographic problems.
