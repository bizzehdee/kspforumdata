It\u0027s not just possible warranty issues, it\u0027s things like incompatibility and the chance - \u0027easy\u0027 though a PC build may be - of making a costly mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course you pay to have someone else take those risks and the extra cost can be substantial. Take for example \u003Cem\u003ECustom PC\u003C/em\u003E magazine\u0027s budget gaming build of a Pentium G3258, Z97 motherboard, R9 270X, and 8 GB of memory, and the usual ancilliaries including \u0022OEM\u0022 Windows 7, coming it at \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3550. Going on Dell\u0027s website and looking for a comparable system there, it\u0027s an Alienware X51 specced with an i3-4150 (worse for most games), GTX 750 Ti (worse), and the same 8GB of memory, costing me \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3700. Oh, and I\u0027m only getting a 1-year warranty, if I want a three year warranty it\u0027s an eye-watering \u003Cem\u003Etwo hundred pounds extra\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sure, while it\u0027s in warranty Dell will fix it, great. But once that warranty expires, or if Dell refuse to fix something under it, I know from experience that some Dells use some custom components and they cost far more to replace than the generic parts I\u0027d get from a smaller PC builder or if I did my own build. It\u0027s enough to make me at least wary, considering I expect four to six years out of my computers, with periodic upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the OS and software, sure it might be available cheaper but that\u0027s because it\u0027s got strings attached - specifically it\u0027s only good on the PC it\u0027s sold with. If I buy a retail copy of Windows, which I grant costs a bit more than the \u0022OEM\u0022 versions, I can use that on several computers in sequence or on one continually-upgraded system that goes through a few new motherboards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately there\u0027s a reason many enthusiasts do their own PC builds. It can offer far better value, and that\u0027s worth the exposure to a bit of extra risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValue can also be why companies other than the massive global juggernauts do well. If I shop around I can do *far* better than that Alienware for \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3700, even while sticking to companies with reputations I personally trust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T18:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a good thread to ask this question... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as KSP is concerned, is there likely to be any measurable jump from an i5 2500K @ 4.3GHz, to say a Devil\u0027s Canyon i7 at the best overclock I can get out of it under an AIO water cooler?
