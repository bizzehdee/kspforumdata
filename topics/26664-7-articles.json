Watching videos means nothing if you\u0027re not analyzing them for information that fills in what you\u0027re missing.

Conversely, the higher you are from it, the slower you are going relative to your target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you achieve orbit and your target is behind you, go to a higher orbit and it will catch up, and from there you can decelerate to shrink your orbit to meet it (takes a little practice to know when and where to start the burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the target is ahead of you, assume a lower orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve gotten and reached a rendezvous point, you no longer need the map view. Your navball should be showing \u0022TARGET\u0022 in the top display. If not, click it until it does. You are now looking at your speed \u003Cem\u003Erelative to your target. \u003C/em\u003EThe pink targeting reticules will show you which direction your target is from you, and the yellow velocity vector will show you which direction you are moving \u003Cem\u003Erelative to your target. \u003C/em\u003EPoint your nose directly away from the target (the pink indicator opposite the circular one that looks like a Predator laser sight) and burn until your velocity shows near zero. Then turn back toward your target and burn directly toward it, keeping your velocity under 100m/s. Keep the yellow velocity vector within the pink targeting reticule. If it drifts, you can correct it by remembering these \u0022rules\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen burning toward your target, the yellow velocity vector will be \u0022attracted\u0022 to your current heading (you can \u0022pull\u0022 it upward by aiming your nose above the target and burning a bit)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen burning away from your target, the yellow velocity vector will be \u0022repulsed\u0022 by your current heading (you can \u0022push\u0022 it in a direction by pointing your nose away from it)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe farther away your nose is from the yellow velocity vector, the greater the effect will be on your course when you burn\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re pretty close to your target, say about 1,000 meters, point your nose directly opposite your direction of travel and burn to decelerate.

This will tell you when you should start decelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you approach, your velocity vector will drift. Use RCS translation (IJKL) to \u0022push\u0022 the yellow velocity vector to keep it on the pink targeting reticule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re close enough to see your docking point, right click it and Set As Target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjust your course to match the new targeting reticule\u0027s location with RCS translation again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re within 100 meters, kill most of your forward movement and start moving the camera around to determine your orientation relative to the dock. Get yourself as perfectly perpendicular to the port as you can. It doesn\u0027t matter if your nose isn\u0027t currently pointing right at it; you just want to be sure that when you do get to it, your coming at it dead-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter orienting, go back to using RCS translation to push the ship in-line with the target. The pink targeting reticule will now be dead-center of the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENudge the ship forward toward the port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re very close, kill your forward movement to under 4m/s, and you should end up docking nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all seems very wordy, but if you read through this and experiment a little while, you should start seeing what I\u0027m talking about. Eventually it\u0027ll click into place and you\u0027ll be docking like a pro, I promise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is still really confusing, and if none of the other available YouTube videos are still of any help, let me know. I would be happy to put together a narrated tutorial on how it\u0027s done, along with some pointers on how the various indicators on the navball behave. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerfherde","CreatedById":63692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T19:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand you managed to completely miss my last few posts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T19:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*derp*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies...
