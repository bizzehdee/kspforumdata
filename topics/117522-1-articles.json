And once you get within a couple hundred meters of it during the rescue, you can control the wreckage so can rotate it to the desired orientation (this is Minmus, after all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to actually grab the ship, you might consider building a lander with the Klaw facing down under a small central body that has radially mounted engines spaced wide enough for the target to fit between them, and tall enough for the central body to be slightly above the wreckage when the landing legs are down. Then the mission would go like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Land near the wreckage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Otherwise, as long as it\u0027s in line with your thrust, no problem. The only issue you face here is the latter, and you\u0027ll just have to eyeball that. But Minmus has such low gravity that you can \u0022walk\u0022 landers around on it via torque and RCS, so you can use that for fine adjustment before dropping the Klaw on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the torque with the wreckage may be impossible nowadays: they always come devoid of EC and mono; empty.
