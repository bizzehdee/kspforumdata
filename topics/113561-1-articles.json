You do not care not, because it is hard to foresee who will come out of the woodwork to abuse the data collected.\n\nIn short, large scale data collection is a threat to a truly free and open society. He who yields data, yields power, and power invariably corrupts. This is not a theoretical threath either, it has happened many times before and it will certainly happen again.

Being aware of what is going on, not or selectively sharing your data and voicing your worries to companies and legislators and occasionally making a stand is a good start. \n\nThing is, of everyone blindly accepts what is going on, things will fall apart rather quickly. There has always been a tension between what large institutions want and what is good for the public. Companies and governments have the natural tendency to want more and more, while good civilians have the right (and I would argue duty) to apply the brakes.

A \u0022feature\u0022 that can easily be collecting data on you while appearing benign. Android includes multiple \u0022phone home\u0022 schemes (including sending GPS information), turned on by default and supposedly disabled via menu (or rather, the data gets hidden from you; how do you know?) I also know that the open source community isn\u0027t above this nonsense either, with FileZilla being packaged with spyware and all.

Maybe, maybe not. But the likelihood of such a conversation occurring increases by several fold when done online.
