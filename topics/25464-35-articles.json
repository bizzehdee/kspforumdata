And there\u0027s our problem.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to detail the bug fix, since hopefully you\u0027ll never run into such things in current versions of KSP...but there was a thread in the KSP Forum that explained the problem (one of the two linked ports that wouldn\u0027t undock had incorrect settings) and a few suggestions on how to fix it (which was not especially easy, since you need to track down the ship id numbers and part id numbers of a couple parts...and then edit some changes into place). But I got it fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the port configuration fixed, Kurt could redock the ship to the Station, then undock Tug 1 from the Transfer Hab...then undock Tug 5 from the back of Tug 1...then move Tug 1 off to the side (where it could be re-docked to the Station at a port that balanced another old two-tank Tug on the opposite side)...and then Tug 5 could be slid back in to dock with the Transfer Hab modules.

I have heard some people scoff at the thought of using rovers to explore the very low gravity environment of Pol...but it turned out to work very well...it just takes some getting used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, it\u0027s important to have the rover direction control keys mapped to different keys than the a,s,d,w,q,e attitude control keys. I have the rover keys mapped to i,j,k,l. Having SAS on is important for keeping the rover stable during the inevitable slow-motion bounces from the surface...but you have to use the f key to temporarily deactivate the SAS when making substantial turns -- otherwise the rover makes turns very very slowly and haltingly as the small amount of friction force the wheels generate tries to fight against the SAS when you are turning the rover (and the rover is spending much of its time in little bounces into the \u0027air\u0027 and the wheels aren\u0027t making contact with the surface). Also, you need to press the f key occasionally as you drive over terrain to allow the rover\u0027s wheels to settle to the surface for better contact (otherwise the SAS can keep some of the wheels lifted off of the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it can be faster to turn the rover around using the attitude control keys at low speeds. Using the rover forward/backward (i,k) keys in rapid succession can get the stationary rover to hop into the \u0027air\u0027 a little, during which time the yaw keys (a,d) can be used to turn the rover to a different heading. The Pol Fido has RCS installed, but its attitude can be controlled very well with the torque from the cockpit and single-kerbal lander cabin, so you can save the RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vQY3svN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vQY3svN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles drove East and soon found the Fido had a tendency to sped more time in the \u0027air\u0027 than on the ground, making long gentle leaps at the slightest change in terrain. The gound scatter was set low (only 10%), so he had no difficulty dodging the conical rock formations that dot the surface of Pol using small direction adjustments when the rover was in contact with the ground. The only time he needed to use the RCS to avoid a cone-rock was when he leaped over a hill and didn\u0027t see it coming soon enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2CHaIAz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222CHaIAz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty soon what initially seemed like scary leaps become old hat, and handling really long leaps was easy (the leaps are so slow that there was plenty of time to adjust the attitude of the rover to insure a good touchdown). A kerbal can jump 14 meters on the surface of Pol...so what looks like high leaps over the terrain still result in safe landings. Below, Thompbles pilots the Fido for a flying pass through the goal posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wGfQVec.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wGfQVec.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Thompbles making a leap over a distance of hundreds of meters...and landing was no problem. Stopping the rover was quite time consuming: Slamming on the brakes causes the rover to try to flip chassis-over-tea-kettle, so it might seem prudent to slow down gradually using the k key...but the surface friction is so low that it takes a long time to stop this way. Thompbles found that it was much quicker (if scarier, at first) to just slam on the brakes (which grab amazingly well), being ready for the rover to flip forwards...and just use the attitude control keys to right the rover during the slow-motion bounce. This is a much faster way to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i5rf5gL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i5rf5gL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter driving about 15 km from his landing spot, Thompbles determined that the rover worked well enough that the mission could be continued as planned. He was getting close to the large mountains that ringed the crater containing the Lewis Probe, so he picked out a relatively flat area for Base Camp 1 and called up to Kurt to bring the Base Lander down. Then he started doing some sampling of the wired pointy rock formations while waiting for Kurt to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m8Rt9g8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m8Rt9g8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp in orbit, Kurt moved the Laythe Transfer Ship from the docking port on top of the Pol Base Lander to the docking port on top of the backup Fido rover.

Note that the Base Lander has the same basic design used on Vall and Bop: a two-kerbal command module, a hitchhiker habitat module, and six FL-T400 tanks, each with a Rockomax 48-7S engine on the bottom. This was WAY more engine thrust than is needed around Pol, but the same design was used for consistency (cheaper design and construction costs, no doubt)...and so that it could be used as a backup to rescue kerbals from Vall or Bop if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mTJA2N4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mTJA2N4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was a piece of gluten-free cake in Pol\u0027s low gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iOm0VKC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iOm0VKC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fvN8EE6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fvN8EE6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe de-orbit and landing used about 17.2% of the Base Lander\u0027s fuel.

After leaping over the rim (Thompbles slowed down to about 5 m/s before topping the ridge so they wouldn\u0027t go flying too far), they found that the far face of the rim was even steeper...scary steep! But, again, the Fido seemed to handle the slope without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L2PTgje.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L2PTgje.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce inside the crater, the boys officially named it \u0022Nelemy Crater\u0022 after their good friend, the original explorer of the crater. They drove North along \u0022180 Valley\u0022 that had some interesting sharp creases in its bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LjpEB87.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LjpEB87.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey arrived at the location of the Lewis Probe...but something strange happened in the game at this point: As the rover approached the Probe, I noticed that the Probe was actually floating hundreds of meters above the surface. This was obviously some kind of surface bug. When I switched to the Probe using the bracket key, it was suddenly on the visible surface. That was weird. But I don\u0027t think Nelemy or Thompbles noticed anything odd happening. Perhaps they were distracted by the complete lack of the conical rock formations in this area (which matches Nelemy\u0027s observations here 12 years ago...but which required that I have terrain scattering turned off as I had back in the old days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TIsclnn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TIsclnn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt got off the rover to examine the Lewis PB Probe science package. He cut off several pieces of the probe (pieces of casing, thermal blankets, and the no-longer-functioning 2HOT thermometer sensor) to return them to Kerbin where the scientists could examine them in detail to see what 12 years of exposure on the surface of Pol did to them. Now THERE\u0027s some serious materials exposure SCIENCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5yMzgOM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225yMzgOM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys then headed back toward Base, eventually seeing the conical rock formations again (after a discrete settings change and restart by me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L710DWj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L710DWj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sun was getting quite low in the sky by the time they reached the rim mountains, and the slopes there were already in the dark and required careful driving. They probably shouldn\u0027t have attempted this trip so late in the daylight period. They did not head back South along 180 Valley, but instead angled Southwest in a more direct line toward their Base, figuring that the rover would do fine on the taller (and, as it turned out, less-steep) mountains there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yy7iLcb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Yy7iLcb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen our heros returned to the Base site, strangeness again ensued.

The images below show the motion of Jool in the sky during the 6 days from shortly before sunset to shortly after sunrise. Pol is tidally locked in a 1:1 resonance orbit around Jool, but (just as on Bop) the moon\u0027s eccentric orbit causes Jool to shift its position back and forth across an arc of sky instead of staying in one spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SUf0d0K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SUf0d0K.jpg\u0022\u003E g\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter sunrise on the next Pol day, the boys prepared for their second, much more ambitious expedition: The drive all the way around Pol. Before leaving the Base Lander, they separated the already-used Science Junior module. Because of the tilt of the lander, the Science Jr popped up and over and fell free of the Lander when the separator fired. The lander was left in automatic remote-control mode so that Kurt and Thompbles would be able to call it over to them later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the boys headed East... and ran into cruel annoying bugs with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

The Fido suddenly exploded. I don\u0027t mean it blew into parts. I mean it suddenly exploded violently and vanished. What the hell? I hadn\u0027t hit a cliff or a texture rift or anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I reloaded the quicksave at the Base and started heading East again. Driving along in long loping leaps...and...BLAM! The rover vanishes in a fireball. OK...I was watching carefully that time, and there certainly wasn\u0027t anything that I hit (the rover was actually floating through midair when it exploded, not even touching the terrain at all). Definitely a game bug...and I don\u0027t hold the vagaries of game bugs against my poor kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reload...I carefully drove to the same area...drove slowly along...and..the rover kept going. Huh. So, having apparently gotten beyond the glitchy spot, I cranked up the speed again and settled in for a long, peaceful drive acro...BLAM! OK. That was certainly a different spot, many kilometers beyond the first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. I restarted the game and reloaded to see it that undid the bug. BLAM! Huh. OK...I uninstalled the fancy new Active Texture Management mod. BLAM! Huh. So that wasn\u0027t causing the problem. Below: The rover is driving up on a previously found explosion point at 1 m/s. BLAM! The view jerked back a short distance, and the navball (which did not disappear) changed orientation. I could pan around after the explosion, but there was no sign of any rover parts anywhere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H1v1AaX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H1v1AaX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and below is another test, driving through the same spot after multiple explosions... and no boom.

And...no boom. OK, so whatever invisible death field I\u0027m hitting isn\u0027t very tall. So I smiled in victory as I continued to fly the rover forward down into the shallow valley ahead to set it down gently on...BLAM! The rover exploded in midair. Certainly nowhere near the surface, so I couldn\u0027t be hitting any surface feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qLaIYDb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qLaIYDb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm.

Let\u0027s try using HyperEdit to gently drop the rover into an explosion area. First, HyperEdit\u0027s Ship Lander was acting weird: When I told it to position the ship at an altitude of 1 meter...the ship appeared over a mile above the surface. I don\u0027t think KSP knows where the hell Pol\u0027s surface is located. Then the rover slowly drifted downward at 1 m/s, taking forever, until...BLAM! The rover exploded at 1,578 meters above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gl5GP0r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gl5GP0r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still had two of the small Science Lander Probes in orbit that had separated from the Pol Double ship earlier. These were to be landed at locations in front of the traveling kerbals so that they could stop and gather the SCIENCE from them. So I tried using MechJeb\u0027s Landing Guidence feature to land one of those probes. It was coming in fine, and had already killed its horizontal motion, and was dropping in vertically...when, at over 600 meters above the surface, MechJeb fired the lander\u0027s engines and brought it to a stop...as if it had reached the surface. But, of course, the probe refused to sit motionless in midair in the same way that giant office blocks don\u0027t, and resumed dropping...which seemed to confuse MechJeb, which started gyrating the lander at angles and firing its engine. So, apparently MechJeb was also confused about where the surface was really located. (In the low-gravity ballet stage that is Pol, it was easy for me to quickly disengage MechJeb and guide the Probe down the rest of the way to the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hyuPD1E.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hyuPD1E.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK. So I found no way to stop these random explosions. So I just continued the drive East, stopping every 5 degrees in longitude to quicksave, and just slogged on. BLAM! And when a BLAM happened, I reloaded and drove through the area again, shifting my course around the Spot of Death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h5AhheM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022h5AhheM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this driving to be REALLY nerve wracking. Normally, when you drive a rover along through rough terrain, you automatically mentally brace yourself as the rover approaches a sharp terrain change, or comes in for a landing after a long leap. But there is no way to brace yourself for these invisible Strokes of Death. The rover is just peacefully bouncing along in low gravity bliss...BLAM! It was really getting on my nerves. I wanted to be playing a fun game, not driving a military convoy along a Baghdad highway and suddenly getting killed by a hidden IED. I had to quit after a while. And the next day, when I was driving my car to work, I was holding the driving wheel in a white-knuckled grip expecting sudden explosions. This was not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, I came back and tried again. More nerve-wracking explosions. Below is a Map view that shows the Fido rounding a South-poking spur from the mountains around Nelemy Crater. I didn\u0027t want to go all the way South around the spur, so I headed the rover for a low ridge to the left of the final hill of the spur. This area was death after death after death before I finally was able to get through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nt2u8kV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nt2u8kV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ridge, when I finally was able to reach it, was a weird gnarled thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YUQJkUC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YUQJkUC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, we see the rover driving up the steep slope of the Gnarly Ridge, and then over the top. It exploded shortly thereafter. But the NEXT time...the NEXT time it made it over safely and the Fido was out on a new expanse of rolling hills, which Thompbles named Alsbury Planitia after Alsbury Kerman, a famous test pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wMuo6Pi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wMuo6Pi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the areas in Alsbury Planitia were bright and sunny, and the explosions were less common for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3mF7wMo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223mF7wMo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkirting the spur put Kurt and Thompbles as much as 16 degrees South of the equator, so they headed East-Northeast over Alsbury Planitia toward some dark markings that looked like small depressions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lU6xHUe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lU6xHUe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Kurt wrangles the Fido down into the Low Point depression, having to make several sudden jogs in his course on the way down, for reasons that were not apparent to himself.

The joy of driving along on Pol had already paled for me, so I had switched over to having MechJeb\u0027s Rover Guidence pilot the Fido for me. Happily, there were no mysterious explosions this day. Why did they suddenly stop? I don\u0027t know. Was the terrain model better here? Or is there some other reason for the mysterious disappearance of the land mines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YPtFltt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YPtFltt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of the Base Camp 2 Bowl, the boys were heading East along a new expanse of rolling hills that Thompbles named Yeager Planitia after Yeager Kerman, the first test pilot to successfully fly faster than sound. Their path was mostly straight East at between 3 or 4 degrees South latitude, heading toward the landing site of Lander Probe 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3XFJzl8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223XFJzl8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FWTZrhR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FWTZrhR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip to Lander Probe 2 was blessedly uneventful at 3x time warp.

This mountain range continues on to form the Eastern end of Yeager Planitia, and its massive presence would prevent our heros from easily continuing straight East... So Thompbles decided to veer North over the line of mountains and continue East along the equator toward some high points in the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vgBaWeD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vgBaWeD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w9oVZ15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w9oVZ15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they were over the line of mountains, our brave lads found themselves following a rather rough valley along the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8gflJWC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228gflJWC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, here is where our indomitable explorers encountered their first accident. Passing too quickly over a ridge, the Fido ended up in a long arc down into a valley, and the rover bottomed out when it landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Whoa! Explosion!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022You OK?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Yeah. How\u0027s the rover?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022No warning lights. Hold on while I slowly stop.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turned out that there was no serious damage. The Pol Fido has a structural plate on its underside (to give a nice flat surface for the docking port of the backup Fido that rode underneath it on the Pol Double ship to attach...and to act as underside protection while roving). Apparently the Fido had landed hard enough to explode off that plate...but everything else was OK. So...a little more circumspect driving is probably called for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QrQE0nR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QrQE0nR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while later, the Fido was again approaching the terminator, and with rougher land looming ahead, Thompbles called a halt for the day to set up Base Camp 3 in another bowl. The Western slopes of the bowl were already in shadow, but a flattish are in the bottom was still well lighted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GSgRUQI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GSgRUQI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O64afEp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022O64afEp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles parked the rover and Kurt called the Base Lander over via remote control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Xarwy1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221Xarwy1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lob trajectory of the Base Lander brought it over to the Base Camp 3 location in about 43 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9kIir11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229kIir11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, there was the terrain weirdness that resulted in the Fido floating in midair as the Base Lander landed...but let\u0027s ignore that bug.

The Base Lander had used an additional 14.4% of its original fuel load to make the last hop (the amounts of fuel needed for the hops are getting less as the Lander uses fuel and becomes lighter). It still has 52.8% of its fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HKB5Gs6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HKB5Gs6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter another long Pol-night (they spent about 6 Earth days at Base Camp 3), Kurt got in the cockpit of the Fido and Thompbles climbed on top. Actually, he used his rocket pack. It\u0027s almost always easier to move the kerbals around on Pol using the rocket pack rather than walking. Off to the East they went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9TGKQFx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229TGKQFx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this leg of the expedition driving along the equator, our persistent travelers encountered the two highest points they reached along their route: White Peak (3,383 meters) and Dana Peak (3,400 meters). These are not the highest points on Pol (at least Kerbal Maps says the highest point is at 5,590 meters), and they didn\u0027t even try to find the highest points of these peaks (these were just the elevations they reached along their path following the equator). These peaks were named after test pilots White Kerman and Dana Kerman, famous for making the two highest flights in the early K-15 rocket plane program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WVqzpMO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WVqzpMO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: While coming down from White Peak, Kurt barely leaped the Fido over the cone-rock below, coming close to scraping his nethers (and without the protective plate in place!
