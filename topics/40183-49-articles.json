How do you calculate how many parachutes are needed? MCESettings mentions \u0022parachuteDragPerTon = 70\u0022. Is this it? Parachutes have 500 drag when deployed, so they should handle 7.14 tons, am I right?\u003Cp\u003ECould you perhaps provide me a craft file of a (stock) rocket where auto-recycle works on your system so I can test on mine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for fuel cost, I have 2 career savegames. One has no MCE upgrades, the other has Efficient Fuels, Construction 1 and 2 (plus recycling).
