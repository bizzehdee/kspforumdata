I am working on multiple panel types, sizes and varied textures for building anything from a wooden crate or house if you want all the way through to Sci-Fi ships and stations. I see allot of ships and projects using tons of panels and seeing those same stock textures repeated over and over gets old. These are New Models and not retextured stock models (obviously very easy to make....it\u0027s basically a box!) but will be wanting to go the way of possibly triangles and and varied other geometric shapes as well. I want some feed back!!! if you would be interested in a \u0022Panels Pack\u0022 of this nature leave a post below and maybe even a suggestion or two on what kind of textures you would like to see in the pack.

Which in turn gives me several ideas and suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, regarding textures: Hell yeah! The ones you\u0027ve shown in the pics, I mean. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve always felt the need for a more \u0027sci fi\u0027 option in the game, that\u0027s why I really like the B9 and LLL packs. But both are still a bit plain in certain ways when it comes to textures, so a mod like this could help make things look a bit more interesting. I think the easiest way to go would be to get with Snjo and implement Firespitter\u0027s texture switching capability. This way you can create ONE part for each panel shape (which I\u0027ll address in a moment), and so not using up more memory than necessary while still having the option for MANY different looks, like you said, anything from a wooden box to a \u0027Star Wars\u0027 hull panel. A corollary idea would be the TweakScale plugin, which I believe allows switching between multiple scales of, again, just one \u0027part\u0027 for each physical shape. Anyway, food for thought on that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, sizes. Square is a given, duh, but I\u0027ve also found myself sometimes wanting a ONE-HALF meter by one meter panel, so you might consider doing \u0027fractional size\u0027 versions (i.e. one-third, one-half, etc) of your \u0027base size\u0027 part. Other than squares (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, all the way up to whatever), I suggest things like 1x2, 1x3 and so on. Again, don\u0027t want to have an absurd number of options, but more than just squares will help reduce SHIP part count, IMO. While still discussing rectangles, I\u0027ve always thought it would be nice to have panels sized to \u0027sheathe\u0027 the skeletal struts, both stock sizes and the various addon/mod packs. Just for looks, mainly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I know the THSS pack has panels for this purpose, but they\u0027re so tiny that paneling just one section of strut blows the parts count into the stratosphere. I envision one panel to cover the entire side of a strut, and maybe also a half- or third-length version as well. Again, perhaps the TweakScale option would help here, or maybe even go the full \u0027Procedural\u0027 route, I don\u0027t know. Pros and cons to each method, I guess, and ultimately your decision on how fancy you want to get. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, shapes. The most \u0027modular\u0027 shapes will be squares and triangles, along with their variations, rectangles and hexagons. I suppose if people want to make true spherical shapes you\u0027d have to have a pentagonal panel as well, for the \u0027soccerball\u0027 - err, that\u0027s \u0027football\u0027 to everyone but Americans like me, lol - aficionados out there, but I don\u0027t see that as being particularly useful when paneling a ship or structure. Once more, if a \u0027procedural\u0027 approach were possible, being able to grab any corner (number of corners user defined, natch) of a panel and stretch it into whatever shape one wants would be the ultimate in true modularity, but I don\u0027t know how possible or even desirable that would be. There would have to be a GUI so that one could define shape, size, texture, and probably several other variables I can\u0027t think of right now, which could get complicated kind of quick. So, leaving that out, the only other suggestions would be variations in length/width ratios. For instance, a hexagon that\u0027s \u0027stretched\u0027 to be twice as long as its width, with two short sides at the ends, and four long sides angling towards the middle. I hope that\u0027s clear. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyway, that shape would definitely have as \u0027sci fi\u0027 look, but I don\u0027t know how useful it would be. So again, food for thought there. Mm, also, as a few other modders have done, I suggest making the edge lengths of the panels match. For instance, you can do a hexagon with the length of each side at 1 meter, to match the square panels, OR you can do a hexagon that\u0027s 1 meter across (flats or corners, makes no difference), but you can\u0027t have both. Eek, this post is already too long, I\u0027m sure you get the gist. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, that\u0027s my 2 cents for now.

I mean, let\u0027s say you introduce 10 different panel shapes in your first release, each in 3 different sizes (small, medium, large), and 5 different texture options for each part as well. Blammo, that\u0027s 150 parts added to the SPH/VAB catalogs! Yes, I know, if you use model scale and texture callouts it\u0027s still only 10 parts and 5 textures in MEMORY, but now I\u0027ve just doubled or tripled the number of editor pages I have to wade through in the \u0027structural\u0027 category alone! I think it would be much better to just pick, say, the single \u0027Hex Panel\u0027 part, then scale it with TweakScale and pick the texture I want, and done. But if you don\u0027t want to do the TweakScale thing, it\u0027s still \u0027only\u0027 30 parts, not 150.
