For equatorial orbits, you are normally going to put the objects in orbit the same direction as the planet rotates. At least I do. It seems to be some kind of unwritten rule. The reason for this is any ship launching from the surface wants to orbit this way, because it requires less dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T05:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo need.
