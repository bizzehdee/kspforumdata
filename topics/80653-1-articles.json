I wouldn\u0027t have minded spending some time at the controls, but the bosses say that will come later and they just wanted to make sure I could open the hatch by myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah, my report - I forget what the other planet\u0027s name is, but you know where I went already. It looks remarkably like KSC - I wasn\u0027t actually able to get a soil sample, but there was some stuff on the metal grill that the ship had landed on. Wasn\u0027t sure about the atmosphere, so I kept the helmet on just in case. Return trip uneventful, and the auto-pilot got the ship back to where we started. Where next, guys?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupervisor\u0027s Report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, did no-one brief Jeb on the systems test?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
