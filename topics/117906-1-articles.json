Press R to activate RCS, then use the keys H, N, J, K, L, I to control various thrusters. In particular observe how the prograde and retrograde markers behave: when you accelerate, the prograde marker moves towards the reticle (is getting pulled by it). The opposite happens to the retrograde marker - it\u0027s pushed away. And IJKL just move it up, down, left, right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very useful for docking, as if you manage to overlap the prograde marker with the target marker, you\u0027re on the perfect course to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T07:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mckamx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mckamx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy\u003C/a\u003E for problems with the \u0022pull is more stable\u0022 hypothesis.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs RIC said, the pendulum fallacy is not about the same at all.
