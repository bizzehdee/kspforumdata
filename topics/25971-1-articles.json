Rocket\u0027s guidance is nominal. Engines are at 108% and nominal.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlasting off heavenward, Jeb felt the intense G\u0027s on his body. He loved it, he lived for it, it was his life. These tests were typically done unmanned but Jeb volunteered to do a manned test. The rocket rose to an altitude of 10,000 feet and began its automated gravity turn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OF8EAte.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OF8EAte.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everything seems to be going great KSC. This roller coaster is a blast,\u0022 Jeb said as the sky began to darken as the atmosphere disappeared. He kissed his hand then pressed it against the window of his capsule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright Jeb, we\u0027re going for rotation. RCS looks nominal, rotation is looking nominal.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T6wFpNZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022T6wFpNZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m feeling that rotation.

The capsule shook from the vibrations of the decoupler and both stages seperated as planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everything seems right from here control,\u0022 Jeb relayed to the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QIGbwXM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QIGbwXM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQAWK SQAWK SQAWK! The piercing sound of the master alarm began to go off. Jeb looked at the red light on his control panel. ****! He thought, what now? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, the alarm system just alerted us that something is wrong with the parachute system. We might not be able to open it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb looked at the alarm as the capsule headed back into the atmosphere according to the test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m0fq9Dx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m0fq9Dx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweat dripped from his face. The capsule reached hundreds of meters per second over the ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe closed his eyes tightly as everything went dark inside his mind. As he opened them back up, he looked at the ceiling of his apartment. Sweat drenched his pillow. Humidity was thick at KSC and damn hot. The time on his clock read 0200. Class 217 arrived today at 0500. Every class he\u0027d taught began with nightmares. This one wasn\u0027t any different. Watching over a class of four trainees as they learned one of the most dangerous jobs on Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8hKbBIL.png\u0022 alt=\u00228hKbBIL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb looked over the four men of his class. Each member had earned nearly 10 years in the Kerbin Airforce. But none would be prepared for the intense training Jeb had up his sleeve. Being a Kerbonaut required the best, and only the best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gentlemen,\u0022 Jeb spoke to them. \u0022My name is commander Jebediah Kerman. I\u0027ve served 12 years as a topgun in the KAF. I\u0027ve done another eight in KASA. I\u0027ve flown to the Mun, to Skylab and done more than a year\u0027s worth of time in space. I will teach you to be a Kerbonaut. It is up to you to make the choice to be one. It is dangerous, but I have not lost a man in training yet. I will not lose one this time. If you think you have what it takes, then today you will show me.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb turned around to look at the jet behind him. \u0022This, gentlemen, is the Freyja. It\u0027s the fastest jet I am willing to let you four fly today. You will show me what you have to offer KASA.\u0022 Looking at the formation, Jeb saw a smaller looking Kerbal. He didn\u0027t look confident. Jeb called on him. \u0022You, trainee, what\u0027s your name?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lenzon, commander.\u0022 He spoke quietly, almost so quiet to be indiscernible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ll be the first one up today. Grab your flight suit, and meet me out on the runway in an hour. Everyone else, start studying. You have a long year of training ahead.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e6eFhaT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e6eFhaT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright Lenzon, are you ready in the cockpit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uhh... uhhh, I think so sir. Well, uhhh, I\u0027m not sure I should go right now sir.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nonsense,\u0022 Jeb spoke through his comlink to Lenzon. \u0022You\u0027ll be fine. Just show me what you have and I\u0027ll guide you through the flight. It\u0027ll be a quick flight around KSC.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh... uhhh... okay.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, go ahead and take off.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Freyja roared to life as it bulleted down the runway. Picking up speed, Lenzon lifted the nose off the ground and gained altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FOWdseL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FOWdseL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright Lenzon, you\u0027re going to turn right and make a loop around KSC and land back on the runway. Very simple task.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELenzon turned. He made his way back around KSC, flying by the Mission Control tower and the launch pad. The ocean lay to his left and the runway to his right. Sweat dripped as Lenzon remembered his training in the KAF. He had never flown anything like this. He had only flown small cargo planes. He looked out the side then made pulled on the joystick to turn. The jet instantly answered turning towards the runway. Then, a strong gust of wind and turbulence sent the plane off balance. Lenzon began to spin out of control going too fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Iy86IRS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Iy86IRS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nose pointed towards the ground. Jeb watched in terror as the jet was sent hurling towards the ground. He screamed over the radio to Lenzon. Lenzon blocked everything out of his mind in panic. The screaming was just more noise like the jet flying towards the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lift up the nose, put down the landing gear, something!\u0022 Lenzon saw his imminent death coming and tried pulling up at the last minute, instantaneously letting down the landing gear, but it was too late. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GlXizFw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GlXizFw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb looked on as the explosion thundered in the distance. The first death in all his years as an instructor sank on his soul. He fell to his knees and threw down his headset on to the runway. Class 217 was not going as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ohm Machre","CreatedById":55596,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T01:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E Woah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m liking this already.
