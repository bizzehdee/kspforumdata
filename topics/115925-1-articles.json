I\u0027ve been trying to do the same for Mun bases and I\u0027ve always run into problems. I was hoping for some advice on good designs for rovers and maybe even the base modules themselves that would allow me simple assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I suppose I could just slap wheels on everything, rove parts around the Mun, and connect things on a whim, but I\u0027m looking for something a little more sightly. I\u0027d like to have docking parts on the ends of compartments, and be able to move/connect things with the rover being the only real \u0022wheeled\u0022 device. If the base parts can be elevated on struts, even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the main problems I\u0027m running into are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Getting things to line up in Mun\u0027s gravity, versus Kerbin\u0027s. A Rover that I create and test with a docking port at a certain height on Kerbin doesn\u0027t seem to want to match up as nicely when I do it on the Mun. The wheels and lander legs all seem to sink to different heights depending on where you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sliding things around on the ground without them breaking. Now I suppose the easiest way to alleviate Problem #1 is to just throw my docking port at the very bottom of everything. However, then I just have issues with the Rover/module dragging along the ground and breaking on things. Even when I get the Rover\u0027s body up off the ground, dragging the module itself seems to have issues as well, since there no wheels under the base to pull it along. Which leads to ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I\u0027ve tried designs where I make a \u0022trailer\u0022 with a docking port facing up, that I can slide under a module elevated from landing struts and connect it from the bottom with wheels, but even that has issues. The biggest being, it\u0027s really difficult making a wheeled \u0022trailer\u0022 that can actually fit two docking ports-worth of height under a module and not knock it over or be sturdy enough to support the load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m just curious if anybody has good designs or concepts for their own rover base-assemblers, because mine aren\u0027t really doing the job. And please \u0022Vanilla\u0022 suggestions only. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T21:38:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Excl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I can think of to offer is to might use a Klaw instead.
