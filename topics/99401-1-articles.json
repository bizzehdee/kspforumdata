Hell, I don\u0027t think even Orbiter went into that level of detail - requiring you to determine your position using celestial navigation or GPS or whatnot. I think something like that is a reasonable break from reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, how exactly does pinging the Mun with a laser beam tell you where you are at relative to the datum? By that logic, the system is already broken anyway. Also, I do agree that surface mode should give you the radar altitude anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T11:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBesides, how exactly does pinging the Mun with a laser beam tell you where you are at relative to the datum?

Actually, there\u0027s no big difference if its radio or laser - they both are just electromagnetic waves. So, you can use either to determine how far down the surface is (or your target is), but you cannot tell how far the \u0027baseline\u0027 or \u0027sea level\u0027 are or how far is the planet center. What I mean that it\u0027s only logical to change the altimeter readout from \u0027baseline\u0027 to \u0027surface\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
