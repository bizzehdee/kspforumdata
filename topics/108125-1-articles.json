The suicide burn is efficient (if difficult). Lowering your periapse as much as possible over the selected landing area and cancelling horizontal velocity just over the landing site is also efficient. Probably most people use a little of both. Keep periapse high enough to avoid terrain, and use suicide burn once horizontal velocity has been mostly killed. \n\nThat being said, \u0022efficient\u0022 doesn\u0027t always mean \u0022best\u0022. Best is usually a compromise between brutal efficiency and ease of implementation. Suicide burns are called that for a reason... TWR changes when burning fuel, so calculating a suicide burn accurately requires integration, not something most people are willing to do while plummeting toward the lithosphere... but for small burns at low velocities/altitudes, a guesstimate is usually good enough and errors are kept small so they don\u0027t affect the overall mission very much.\n\nI always come in low and fast, and kill horizontal velocity a bit at a time... just enough to keep from overshooting my target.

I\u0027d say the problem is integrating a complicated ever-changing equation in a very short amount of time. Often only analytical solutions yield the exact answer. Sometimes formulae can be used to get a good approximation, but it\u0027s likely that one doesn\u0027t exist for the various situations in KSP and that instead the only solution is to find a good infinite-sum representation and then add an arbitrary number of terms... though even in that case there are situations where it can be much less accurate. I imagine it is based off of terrain altitude at the predicted landing site (or directly under the ship... which is even worse)... in which case as the terrain changes the estimate will change depending on slope. This makes sense if you think about it, considering that KER can\u0027t possibly keep track of everything all the time, it operates procedurally with limitations on tick time.

The only needed entry is time till burn. Altitude or Duration can be used for context to reckon timing accuracy.

Adjust thrust to zero time til burn timer. Lowering thrust will cause it to decrease. If you overshoot, you can always raise throttle again. The less thrust you use high, the more efficient.\n\n\u003E At some point here you should evaluate the landing zone. If it\u0027s not flat, you may need to take manual control to avoid a RUD.

A TWR higher than .6-.8 (dependant on local gravity) and you will bounce on landing!\n\n\u003E Cut engines at/right before touchdown.\n\n\u003E New SAS fixes this, but you also used to need to cut SAS on landing as well if you followed retrograde. It should now revert to stability control on landing.\n\nIf you want more efficiency, space planes can lithobrake (and survive) if they have suitable vertical translation thrust! Similar to above, but you direct thrust on the vertical vector only to control vertical velocity and let your brakes cancel horizontal velocity after you land. For obvious reasons, this technique has even more limitations on landing site suitability.

This is simply because apparent gravity (that is, actual gravity minus the centripetal acceleration from your horizontal velocity) only begins to exist when you begin to reduce your orbital velocity, apparent gravity is more important than normal gravity for as far as horizontal descents are concerned.\n\nHigh TWRs themselves also come with extra costs, because more TWR means that you have higher engine mass and thus less dV or higher launch costs.

You will continue to burn, but not at full throttle. Since you are angled slightly towards retrograde, then you will be losing horizontal velocity, and therefore can continue to turn closer and closer to vertical.\n\nHere\u0027s the rule of thumb when descending at an angle: The closer your retrograde marker is to vertical, the less horizontal velocity you have. To reduce horizontal velocity, then angle yourself slightly towards retrograde. In other words almost pointing straight up, but slightly eskew towards the retrograde marker. If you need to straighten up quickly, then you can angle yourself past the retrograde marker and burn.\n\nJust like curving your ascent, an efficient descent would usually be curved. On a body with little gravity and no atmosphere, that\u0027s going to be a very low curve.\n\nThis diagram shows the orbiter above, and the lander below, moving right to left. \u0022Throttle maximum thrust\u0022 is where you are cancelling out much of your horizontal velocity.\n\n![powered-descent.jpg](http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/pics/powered-descent.jpg)\n\nIf you look very closely at the bottom left of this diagram, you\u0027ll see how much of the curving is at the very end of the descent just after the \u00227\u0022 marker.\n\n![approach-phase.jpg](http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/pics/approach-phase.jpg)\n\nNot everything about the way moon landers maneuvered was about efficiency. My understanding is the final leg required visual guidance to ensure they hit an ideal landing spot and avoided some dangerous landscape, so they wanted to be flipped up to allow them to have a good visual.\n\nIt would be really cool if they added ability to have audible velocity or altitude measurements, so that you could focus on other aspects of piloting.
