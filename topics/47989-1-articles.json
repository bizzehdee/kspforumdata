I\u0027m just setting up for some practice, where I will hopefully join a fuel tank to a spacecraft with a HubMax on the end of it. I ran into a problem, though: HubMax\u0027s are extremely heavy! I have a small lifter that is capable to taking a small probe to Duna, but it can\u0027t even put my hub in LKO\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022k_angry.gif\u0022\u003E. Should I just attach a docking port to the top of the lifter and dock with that, or try to build a stronger lifter to get the HubMax into LKO?

Firms up that connection - otherwise the Jumbo 64s are wonky as hell and dangerous to stack on top of each other. A few struts between the top of the booster and the payload wouldn\u0027t hurt much either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart at full throttle but watch your gee meter during the ascent. If it climbs out of the green, throttle back a bit; you\u0027ll be making your orbital insertion at about 1/3 throttle. Straight up to 10,000, 090 at 45 degrees to 30,000, 090 at 15 degrees to 50,000, then burn along the horizon on course 090 until your apoapsis is at the desired altitude. When you\u0027re in orbit, deploy the solar panels and let the target vehicle go. Your booster should have enough juice to de-orbit itself, which is why the probe core and batteries are on that piece of hardware (naturally, you\u0027ll need to deorbit the booster before the batteries run out of juice).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatzahMan","CreatedById":82548,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T04:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would redesign your rocket.
