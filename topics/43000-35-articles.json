Not only does this make it more fun to travel around town by whatever means you wish, it also serves a real world purpose. If you reclaim land, but dont have anywhere for the water in the ground to escape, it will bubble up and ruin any possibility of building there. A good example is the man-made province of Flevoland in the Netherlands. The upper part was built first before they realized that.
