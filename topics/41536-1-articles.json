I mostly didn\u0027t take it to keep down size, the one thing I won\u0027t clip is fuel tanks. I really wish they would add some stock small jet fuel tanks. A small ssto only needs like 60 fuel before you hit the rockets, the mk-1 holds 150. That or oxidizer tanks...but they might add that, it\u0027s one of the few things in kspx that hasn\u0027t been made stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T16:56:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 04:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Apatheticjester\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
