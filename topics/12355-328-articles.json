You should probably able to confirm or dispel that theory fairly easily by turning SAS off. If it\u0027s really having to compensate then it\u0027ll get unbalanced very quickly. (warning though, the autopilot/smartass WILL get confused by the lack of reaction wheels so only test by using manual control with SAS off)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond possibility is that the ship just got glitched and if you quicksave / quickload it back in, then it will fix itself. (that happens to me a lot especially with multiple MJ active ships within physics range of each other and even more especially if I\u0027ve switched reference points like docking ports or if I undocked one recently)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird possibility is an old long standing bug where RCS doesn\u0027t want to fire if you hold down one of the translating keys. This is real easy to test for. Zoom in closely on one of the faulty RCS and hold down the key that should activate it in translation. Watch what happens to that port when you \u003Cem\u003Erelease\u003C/em\u003E the key. You may see a puff from it. (might be faint so try tapping the key repeatedly). If you do see a puff on release then quicksave and quickload as above. I know it\u0027s frustrating and it hits me all the time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
