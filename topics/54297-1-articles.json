Take that hypothetical 1 [km] radius asteroid, massing 8.4e\u002B12 [kg] (and let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say hitting at 15 [km/s]). In terms of energy, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s popping in with 9.45e\u002B20 [J]... but just one \u003Cem\u003Eday\u003C/em\u003E worth of sunlight on one hemisphere of the Earth is around 7.6e\u002B21 [J]. So as drastic as this is... it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the equivalent of having two Sun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s in the sky for a total of an hour and a half. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not going to effect the weather, or the global circulation, or the jet stream... at least not for more than a few days to a week at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intensity might be the issue however. If the incoming objects are dropping enough energy to briefly heat the air to incandescence, then you have the potential for this glowing oven-temperature sky to ignite fires... over an entire hemisphere. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E can put out far far FAR more particulates than the original impact would.

There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a lesson there, and it has to do with shock physics (dumping that energy into the ground really doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t result in much destruction... there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a LOT of ground) and thermal physics (the heat pulse in the air is deadly and a distance, and couples energy into an air shock... not so much for ground impacts, er, I mean detonations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the biggest problem in this discussion is what scale of impact we\u0027re talking about. For really large ones (10 [km] scale), the shotgun effect results in a global firestorm that is far more damaging than the \u0022localized\u0022 impact, but those pack so much energy that re-entering ejecta from the main impact are enough to start their own global firestorms.
