Activating chemical release as soon as you cross the 200km mark (InSpaceLow), running the experiment, and then transmitting the data left me with about 15-30 seconds before impact with a fairly shallow approach. This was on MS19b, so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s changed again since then, but there definitely wasn\u0027t too much extra margin to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T21:10:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T21:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doctored my save to start at 200km where InSpaceLow begins and I was finished transmitting with 80km left to impact - 30ish seconds.
