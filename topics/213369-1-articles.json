The issue is that when I go to the tracking station, it only lets me speed up time to 100x because that vehicle is still in low orbit. In KSP1, you could go to the tracking station and go to max fast forward, regardless of where a vehicle is in orbit. This function NEEDS to be brought back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draradech","CreatedById":139656,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T20:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that is a bug. As a workaround for now, go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E and launch another vessel (single pod works). This is now the active vessel (landed) and allows for fast time warp....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
