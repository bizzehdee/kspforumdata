After a bit of testing I can confirm that a save game created in KSP 1.8.x, moved to 1.9.1 and loaded up, then moved back to 1.8.1 and with all references to 1.9.1 changed to 1.8.1 in the persistent.sfs save file, does indeed load up and work as expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fairly sure you can\u0027t go back to 1.7.3 or earlier though due to a change in Unity version that came with 1.8, but I might try that now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: wow, it actually IS possible to go back to 1.7.3 from 1.8.x/1.9.x by editing the save file!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-12T10:00:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2020 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mech_Jeb_42","CreatedById":200785,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-13T14:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome were started in 1.8.1 and some were started in 1.9.
