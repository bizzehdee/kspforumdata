A 6KT ship with a single spherical tank is just not going to cut it, despite the high DV. Hence why you have some pretty large tanks.

How about adding 3.75m octagonal drone core? Interplanetary shipping is a work of many burdens (for provisions, and for emotional inconvinience of crewkerbals, either), and it seems that unmanned interplanetary liner is very very nice idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I wish VTOL Engine have \u0027control from here\u0027 function. (treating the top of VTOL Engine as \u0027forward\u0027) As now, landing with VTOL (especially on the Autopilot mode) is tremendously hard, except when I put a docking port on the top of vessel. (to do \u0027control from here\u0027 at the docking port) But just putting a not-using docking port as purely for an align indicator seems quite strange. VTOL Engine itself having \u0027control from here\u0027 function treating the top of vessel as \u0027forward\u0027 seems to perfect answer of this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T10:37:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pectus Solentis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T11:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENuclear Power Generator\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pectus Solentis","CreatedById":123047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T11:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENuclear Power Generator\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that.
