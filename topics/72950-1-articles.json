This is, again, due to the fact that the plasma has virtually no density without being confined under extreme pressure. It doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s a million degrees hot; if there\u0027s only one gram of mass, then that is enough energy to heat one million grams (one ton) worth of vacuum chamber wall by exactly one degree. The mere act of touching that vacuum chamber wall will drain so much energy from the plasma that the fusion reaction dies instantly, if it isn\u0027t already dead from the loss of pressure before it even reaches the wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you injected a thousand times the intended amount of fuel, the magnetic confinement would simply fail to be able to contain it, and no fusion would happen in the majority of the fuel (and the contamination would likely snuff out the fusion reaction too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the vacuum chamber is breached, air rushes in, disrupts the reaction and instantly saps all heat from the ephemereal plasma, again snuffing everything out instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a fusion reactor can \u003Cem\u003Eim\u003C/em\u003Eplode, because there is a vacuum chamber involved, and implosions can cause quite significant shockwaves too. Technically a major implosion event could wreck a reactor building and (if it is running a neutron-emitting fuel mixture) toss irradiated reactor parts across the surrounding hundred meters. But that scenario is so unlikely, we have a bigger chance to be saved from a planet-killer asteroid impact by a rag-tag team of oil drillers with nuclear warheads. You can probably engineer vacuum chambers with fault lines so that implosion events don\u0027t take the entire chamber at once, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T13:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou don\u0027t use basic hydrogen for nuclear fusion. In fact, none of the various proposed reaction schemes use hydrogen as even one of the two partners. Hydrogen is useless for our purposes.\u003Cp\u003EWhat you use instead is deuterium, and possibly tritium. These things are isotopes of hydrogen (that is, they all have one proton and one electron), but they bring the extra neutrons that are required to form a stable helium core. The makeup of our oceans is thus: 99.985% useless hydrogen, and 0.015% deuterium. Tritium is even rarer, as it\u0027s radioactive and decays by itself, and only forms naturally in really tiny amounts in the upper atmosphere. It can be produced synthetically; for example it shows up in fission reactors through radioactive decay of other elements and by transforming deuterium in the coolant water into tritium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, downsides?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You fuse one incredibly rare element with one even more incredibly rare element\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Which is also radioactive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In a reaction that produces free neutrons, which turns the fusion reactor\u0027s components radioactive themselves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, a more promising option: Helium-3. You can fuse that with deuterium, and get an energy return even greater than that from deuterium\u002Btritium fusion. Also, neither deuterium nor helium-3 is radioactive. And finally, the fusion reaction does not produce spare neutrons, thereby avoiding the irradiation of the reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownsides?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Helium-3 is also disgustingly hard to come by because it is rare on Earth, in contrast to other celestial bodies. It is considered so valuable, in fact, that going to the moon for the express purpose of grinding up 150 million tons of solid rock to produce one ton of helium-3 is considered a profitable prospect once fusion becomes a real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, yeah.

One in every 6400 hydrogen atoms is a deuterium isotope. This means that if you filter an olympic swimming pool for heavy water you can extract a large bathtub full of the stuff. That\u0027s enough to keep a nuclear fusion reactor running for months. The oceans contain enough deuterium to keep us running for millions of years, even if we take into account the exponential power increases of the past centuries. Furthermore, unlike uranium it is very easy to separate deuterium from hydrogen thanks to the large weight difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it is so easy you can do it yourself with some basic equipment: Electrolyse some water and let the hydrogen diffuse through a long pipe. Since hydrogen is twice as light as deuterium it\u0027ll escape way earlier. Of course the yield on this is going to be pretty crappy, but it demonstrates the principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe3 farming on the moon is not worth it by the way, if you want to farm He3 you should go to Saturn. But I recommend you just make it at home, just bombard some tritium with neutrons and you\u0027ll get He3.
