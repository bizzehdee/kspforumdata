This is repeated a bunch of times (like 80 of these tanks) and one group (about 10 tanks) keep messing up and the fuel lines pass through the next tank. It screws up every time I load the ship in VAB, and can be fixed by just deattaching the whole section and reattaching it. Any way to fix this without redoing everything?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T03:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could have your fuel line connections on two separate planes. What I mean by that is have one connection higher on one tank than the other. This way there is some actual line running from one point o tthe next an the nubs are not touching.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
