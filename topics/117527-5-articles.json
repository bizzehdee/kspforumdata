Sometimes the order of the attachment nodes gets goofy when nodes are close together. It\u0027s set to prioritize building downward, so when going upward it can be awkward. Usually it\u0027s best to align the camera so you\u0027re looking edge-on at the attachment point and try to snap it on with the mouse as far from the attachment node as you can get, and it you should be able to get it to light up green and attach. Another thing you can do is attach it somewhere else, and put something inside it on the internal nodes, move it where you want, then remove the thing you put inside.\n\nIt\u0027s just bugs with how KSP\u0027s \u0022snap-to\u0022 works with attachment nodes, and prioritizing the wrong ones."},{"CreatedByName":"jcthemc","CreatedById":158227,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T11:22:14Z","Content":"This has probably been answered before, but what Lithobrake Parachute can i use to safely recover an empty SpaceY S109 Heavy Lift SRB (Empty weight is 6 tons)?\n\nOr, instead of giving this man a fish, Necro, could you tell me how to calculate the amount of Lithobrake parachute i need for x amount of mass?\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nPs.
