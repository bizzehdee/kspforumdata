This is a 1.25m mounting (tank-but) normally, and has what looks like a general-purpose nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep two, tweak it\u0027s mounting size. Mounting plate can be scaled up to a 2.5m or a 3.75m base, each with differing options stemming from those. Note, this doesn\u0027t scale the engine itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep three, tweak no. of engines in cluster. In our example, going up to 2.5m would allow, say, a cluster of 4 engines with bottom node (and interstage fairings) retained, or up to 9 engines with no bottom node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal step, tweak nozzles. So long as you don\u0027t go for maximum number of engines for size of base, it may be possible to select \u0022balanced performance\u0022 or \u0022vacuum tuned\u0022 nozzles for your cluster, which adjust the base engine isp values in atmo and vacuum. Note, maximised engine numbers for a mounting size default to \u0022booster tuned\u0022 nozzles, which a physically the smallest. As these typically don\u0027t have a bottom node, they are typically 1st stage anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe focus in this mod would be to replace the 1.25m and 2.5m engines (excluding the KR-1x2) with modular engine assemblies with the above tweakable parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could use some feedback from modders here, particularly those with plugin experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceLaunchSystem","CreatedById":125698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings already has something like this, but you have to place the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphorim","CreatedById":57249,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless I missed an update, procedural fairings allows for custom interstage fairings, but does not offer adjustable engine performance, part count reduction, or the inherent stability of a single-part engine.
