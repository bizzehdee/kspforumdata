However, the more I play and the more videos I watch of the current release and it\u0027s features, the more I realize I can\u0027t wait any longer. So my question and call for opinions is this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing that I use my console for gaming, I\u0027ve never purchased any games through steam. I have of course done the obligatory download of it a while back and tried some demos, etc. I\u0027m personally leaning towards the squad store for purchase but was just wondering if there are pros and cons on both sides. I realize the steam purchase would sort of \u0022protect\u0022 me from losing an install file, etc but what if (although probably extremely unlikely) steam was down or even ceased to exist? Would I be sol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich way should I go with this purchase?

Steam keeps track of what games you bought and lets you download when required. But so does the KSP store. Simply log in and download again. If I was in your situation I\u0027d go for the KSP store for a very simple reason. I won\u0027t even touch Steam with a 10 foot pole.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut that\u0027s a purely personal reason. There are no other reasons to choose one over the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Now that I think of it there is one significant reason. Playing through Steam can auto-update your game when a new version is released. However this can be seen as both a curse as a blessing. It will always keep your game up to date but since KSP is still a game in development new updates may not be compatible. (Don\u0027t let the 1.x designation fool you, KSP is still very much beta.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd once a save-game is broken it is nearly impossible to restore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-26T13:08:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2016 01:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tex_NL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T13:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, both options result in a \u0027portable\u0027 install, so if you keep a backup copy of the downloaded file, you\u0027ll be able to play even if the internet itself goes down forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-26T13:03:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2016 01:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T13:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d suggest downloading it through Steam.
