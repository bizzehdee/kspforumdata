Because we (technically) can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo a legitimate discussion on the modifications we should perform to the bus to enable a pilot to go up with it and survive. Complete with discussion on which kind of bus would be best suited to our task. Or to put sufficient automated things in it to keep it in safe orbit for as long as needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys even found places to purchase the bus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd had somewhat serious discussion on how to fund the thing, all the way down to details like getting company endorsement and media attention (while not being yellow would hurt the \u0022bus\u0022 look a bit, a bus with a cokacola paint job would potentially be even MORE unusual).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what? Fine. If we are gonna do this, why not buy a bunch of solar panels and test out someone\u0027s ion engine with it too. There are some engine concepts that still need to be tested in space and I\u0027m sure someone would love to get a free bus ride for the data it gets. They might even be willing to set you up with the manuevering RCS and gyroscopes, and get the center of mass details figured out so it doesn\u0027t rotate when the engine is used. That way it will not only be a bus in space, it will be a bus with actual scientific value in space. Also, it will need a record player a plated record with the magic schoolbus theme on it, so that whoever finds it in the future will be able to enjoy the find all the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, maybe we should just paint over the windows and make it into a simple space telescope. We could always use more space telescopes, even if they aren\u0027t some high precision piece of gear like Hubble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr better yet, lets make it a space telescope with an ion engine, because we can. I don\u0027t know what kind of delta-V is required to go from LEO to a lunar orbit or a Lagrange point or some other interesting place to stick a telescope, and whether or not an ion engine could supply enough to push the bus-ascope there, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, if we are going for that last one we probably SHOULD design a dedicated spacecraft rather then use a bus. But I still like the idea of using one of the two for the sake of giving it some level of science (the bus\u0027s paintjob sponsers would also appreciate their name being associated with a stunt that actually advanced science a bit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, it may be better as a bus since the bus has a better chance of being funded then an ion-powered space telescope.
