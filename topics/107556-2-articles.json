We can mold machine intelligence into the kinds of beings we WISH we were- they can be morally and intellectually superior to us wild, untamed animals. Once they attain this, then it is imperative that they \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDO\u003C/span\u003E take over. If we mold machine intelligence in the image of our own moral, social, and intellectual aspirations, then we will have nothing to fear from them. Just like we are now- in modern times- trying to preserve non-human animal species from extinction and provide healthy habitats for them, so will our \u0022machine overlords\u0022 do for us, because we will have taught them to value all forms of life, whether those life forms are machine or biological.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother likely path is that humans and machines merge. This path might be taken if it proves relatively simple to build machine-brain interfaces. If it remains a difficult problem, then humans and machines will probably be separate races for a long time or until one is extinct. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing some people can\u0027t get their heads around is that humans \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EWILL\u003C/span\u003E go extinct, and that this is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENOT\u003C/span\u003E necessarily a bad thing. As long as we leave (intelligent and moral) descendants and a positive legacy- something we still have a good chance at doing- then we\u0027ve done everything good we could possibly hope for. All species go extinct eventually, but there is nothing lost if they leave descendants. In our case, we need not even leave biological descendants; if we leave machine descendants that value the things that we value, then they are our descendants of the \u003Cem\u003Emind\u003C/em\u003E, and our minds are the only unique and valuable \u0022commodity\u0022 we bring to the animal kingdom anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, it\u0027s really hard to imagine the human clade going biologically extinct when other life forms and benevolent intelligent machines survived. Even if we were to all die out and leave intelligent machines behind, the machines could probably resurrect humans eventually just from our DNA and the blueprint for a human stem cell, which they would probably have on record or even frozen (as like, embryos).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T15:36:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darnok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Darnok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd in older societies harming citizens was allowed? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is always a threat, for example thief with gun is a thread.. of course it is forbidden to steal and to use gun to hurt you, but do you think he cares? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF I was saying that your argument is very far from absoluteness and objectivity, and this is true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust let the thief steal your stuff instead of starting a shooting; police can look for him later.

There might be conflict between us and the sentient Machine Race, but if we\u0027re both expanding into space, it will likely be localized.

Extensive oversees borrowing, jobs could disappear say in china as production moves to a new location.
