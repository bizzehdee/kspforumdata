And because I\u0027m such an incurable overdone-infrastructure builder, to me that means a permanent mining/refining rig base[1], a tanker lifter to haul fuel from surface to orbiting fuel depot, and a tanker truck for servicing the tanker lifter from the refinery\u0027s storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that means: a rover. A *big* rover. Built around an orange tank and a 2.5m monoprop, methinks.

The wheelbase of my first design is substantially wider than a Mk 3 cargo bay, and (esp if I launch the thing empty, which seems sensible) its CoM is notably off-center for a vertical rocket launch. Not to mention that the axial attach nodes are kind of inaccessible due to fripperies like the claw, command seat, and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never used rovers. Mostly because of the transport-to-destination issue. And now I\u0027m going to have to design (and transport) two different types.

If you find it easy to dock in deep space then you should be able to dock vertically in a weak gravity field with relative ease too. Maybe you should try it- just fire up sandbox mode or something. Get over your target, kill your transverse velocity. Now, you can go into a hover by keeping your spacecraft vertical and cancelling out gravity with your engines. Minimus has such a low gravity it is easy to do this. If you have 2000 dV on your ship, that\u0027s 2000 m/s / 0.5 m/s^2 = \u003Cstrong\u003E4000 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E of hover time. Unlike what 5thHorseman says, there is absolutely no rush, and you can take your sweet time. You can now control your vertical velocity with either engine thrust or RCS, or a combination of the two. Once you\u0027ve cancelled out gravity, it\u0027s not much harder (or even much different) than docking in deep space; in fact, because you\u0027re always going to be approaching with perfect or near-perfect axial alignment with your docking port, it may even be \u003Cstrong\u003Eeasier\u003C/strong\u003E in some respects than docking in deep space, as the axial part of docking alignment is already taken care of for you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would definitely recommend the docking cone though, even if you can hit the target perfectly. Why- well, sometimes the docking ports won\u0027t catch, and you\u0027ll need to wiggle your ship or take off slightly and settle back down before the docking ports finally latch into each other. The cone keeps the ports aligned during this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T02:37:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T02:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIncorrect. On low gravity worlds like Minimus, your spacecraft can sit in a hover for literally hours if it\u0027s using a LV-N. Maybe only 20 minutes if you\u0027re low on fuel... that is plenty of time to take stock, I would hope! It\u0027s actually quite easy and leisurely.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, it can\u0027t. Unless you have a mod that sets your vertical velocity to 0, in which case we are talking about different things. Yes, with the Vertical Velocity Control mod you can hover for hours. You can go get a cup of coffee while hovering if you so choose. If you\u0027re controlling your ship with the keyboard, though, you\u0027re going to be tapping shift and control the whole time, going up and down as you go. And if you\u0027re not used to doing that (and who is, out of the people who\u0027ve never tried this before?) then it\u0027s a new skill to learn and new muscle memory to train. And the penalty for making a mistake could include the destruction of your base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand what you\u0027re saying. Landing on docking ports is my preferred method to do ISRU. I\u0027ve done it dozens of times and am totally comfortable with it. Not one little bit of that changes how hard it was to learn and perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
