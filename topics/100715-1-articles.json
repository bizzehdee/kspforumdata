Your TWR for that stage starts at 1.07 and that is extremely low. Remember that 1.0 TWR is the bare minimum to move upward at all in Kerbin\u0027s gravity, and 1.07 is not much of an improvement. If you have access to the Mainsail engine I would consider using that instead of a skipper for that stage. Otherwise you would need to come up with an alternate solution that gives you more thrust. Your first stage is fine for thrust, it\u0027s the second one that is the issue I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have plenty of DV to get to orbit, but you are wasting too much of it by fighting against gravity too much. By adding more thrust, you will burn fuel more efficiently. Keep in mind though that adding more thrust will likely also add to the mass of your vessel and that will affect your DV numbers. I would suggest you aim for at least 1.4 or 1.5 TWR for your second stage. I wouldn\u0027t go much higher than 2.0 though as you might start losing efficiency to atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rogerwilco","CreatedById":138633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T18:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Kelderek, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your response, I do not have that engine but I think it is an upgrade.

I\u0027ll walk you through it for this craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay - so the paywad is 17 tonnes to LKO. Go through the steps -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Assume 15% payload fraction. No problem: 17 / 0.15 = 113.33 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Assume 1.65 TWR at launch. Again, no problem: TWR = T/mg, therefore T = TWR*mg = 1.65 * 113.33 * 9.8 = 1832.6 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Assume 22% of the thrust is in the core. 1832.6 * .22 = 403.172 kN. Okay - so for the core, you want a Skipper Engine. The numbers would suggest 62% thrust; I\u0027d set it so the last booster stage gives you a 1.5 TWR my own self.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Divvy the remaining thust among the boosters. Let\u0027s do six. That works out to (1 - 0.22) / 6 = .13, so 13% of the total thrust per booster. So 1832.6 * 0.13 = 238.238. I\u0027d submit you could use a combo of either an LV-T45 and two 24-77 engines (240 kN), or a single LV-T30 with a single 24-77 (235); the first gives you more steering, the second saves you mass you can use for fuel or sundry items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Determine your fuel tank mass - we subtract off the mass of the payload and engines from the theoretical mass, minus two tonnes for sundries (decouplers, sepratrons, maybe a probe core if you want to de-orbit the final stage and batteries to power it, etc.). That comes out to 133.33 - 17 - (A Skipper, 6 LV-T30s and 6 24-77s = 3 \u002B 7.5 \u002B .54 = 11.04) - 2 = 103.29 tonnes. If you divvy that evenly among seven stacks (three booster pairs and the core), that works out to 103.29/7 = 14.756 tonnes per stack. A set of X200-32 fuel tanks at about 80% of their rated capacity should do the trick. Alternatively, stacks consisting of an X200-16, an X200-8 and an FL-T200 will do the trick; myself, I always like the option with the lowest part count).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat oughta do the trick stock. If you want to do a serial-staged rocket, what you can do is shoot for a three-stage booster with 1/6 of the necessary launch delta-V (758.33) in the bottom stage, 1/3 (1516.67) in the middle and 1/2 (2275) in the upper. That\u0027s again assuming the 4550 stock aero figure; if you\u0027re using FAR, you can shoot for 3500 instead and adjust the delta-V per stage accordingly. I\u0027ve also heard in FAR that you can get away with a 1.2 initial TWR per stage; I myself have just started tinkering with FAR, so I can\u0027t confirm that one way or the other. Stock you want 1.5 if you can get it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T20:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you swap to a mainsail as I suggested before, your first stage will have an even higher TWR than the 2.05 you have now. You may want to consider adjusting the thrust on the SRBs down a little, this will increase their burn time and keep your TWR lower for the first stage. I usually shoot for a TWR of 1.6 to 1.7 for the first stage on the launch pad. Changing the thrust on the SRBs will not lower the DV, it will just make them burn longer at lower thrust and that will help prevent you having too much drag from the atmosphere. Do not adjust the mainsail thrust when you add it, leave that at 100%. You shouldn\u0027t need to change much else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding some struts to those SRBs might be a good safety measure though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re miscalculating the amount of dV you need to get back from the Mun.

It will reduce your total delta-V, but you should still have enough because you only need 8000 m/s or so (including a generous safety margin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d actually keep the SRBs at full thrust, but throttle down the Mainsail to keep under terminal velocity. You want to burn the SRBs at max so they run out quickly and you can ditch them at earliest opportunity. These big SRBs tend to burn out right around 10km, which is perfect. After 10 km, max throttle and keep your AP 45 seconds ahead of you until it reaches 90km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lifter is a stage-and-a-half to orbit design. It has lots of heavy fuel in the core stage, but most of the thrust comes from the SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing all stock, so I built a quick mock-up of the rocket to test it. I tried launching the stack without the SRBs. As you can imagine, it didn\u0027t have enough thrust to lift itself off the pad. I experimented with removing some of the fuel from the core stage to see how much I had to burn off to get a decent TWR. The core only produces a satisfactory TWR after the vast majority of the fuel is gone. This makes it a poor contender for use as a first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big problem here is the short burn time of the SRBs. Ideally, to be of best use as a first stage, the SRB should keep burning long enough to lift the stack out of the atmosphere and give it a decent apoapsis. Having done this, the second stage would then be used to circularise into orbit. The Skipper is intended for use as a second stage engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, because the SRB burns too quickly, it burns out before the stack has cleared the denser layers of the atmosphere. This causes two problems. The first is that the high TWR produced by the SRB when it is low on fuel is wasted fighting against terminal velocity. The second is that since the rest of the stack also hasn\u0027t fully cleared the atmosphere, it hasn\u0027t yet accelerated to a significant speed. This means that a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge\u003C/strong\u003E chunk of the deltaV needed to achieve orbit has to come from the rest of the stack after SRB separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to this is to thrust limit the SRBs. As a rule of thumb, I thrust limit my SRBs to 70% (feel free to experiment). By adding moar boosters, but keeping them thrust limited, you can delay their burnout. This means that they keep burning long enough for the stack to clear the noticeably dense and draggy lower layers of the atmosphere. As the SRBs burn off their fuel, the TWR of the stack increases. This means that the stack experiences a few brief and precious moments when the nearly empty SRBs are producing large amounts of thrust, with negligible resistance from the atmosphere to oppose them. If this is done correctly the stack can be placed on a sub-orbital trajectory with an apoapsis at the desired altitude, while already traveling at a significant fraction of orbital velocity. This greatly reduces the work that has to be done by the second stage to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rogerwilco","CreatedById":138633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T23:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, loads of input - thank you so much guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve give me lots of think about.
