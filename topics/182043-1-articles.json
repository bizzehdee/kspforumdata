A few ideas for things to put on them. If you\u0027re playing in science mode then a science lab and solar array. as for placement I usually put my space stations in an orbit high enough to bypass the 50x time warp limit. as for function, In a sandbox save space stations are almost useless, you can have relays but, that\u0027s\u00A0about it.
