I\u0027ve been toying around with ideas for a while now and the most interesting area I would like to look into is (as the topic suggests \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) efficient planet terrain generation. It goes well with my Games Programming course and brings me a step closer to being able to create realistic worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs anyone will know, the first step towards achieving anything like this is research. Would anyone be able to point me towards good books, research papers or websites to help me develop a better understanding of the methods available for achieving such a thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently own a copy of Frank Luna\u0027s \u0022Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 11\u0022 (a book I\u0027d recommend to anyone wishing to get into the field; it\u0027s like gold) which in later chapters looks into terrain generation and tessellation (vital steps towards planet generation), and I\u0027ve been told that Perlin Noise can be used as well to produce decent results. But I want to look into more methods to evaluate the best method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny information or tips aiding my research will be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarLiner","CreatedById":41047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T14:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the thing I know about terrain generation is about Perlin Noise being the most \u0022natural looking\u0022 type of noise for terrain generation, and erosion being a powerful but calculation-heavy effect to add to terrain for realistic worlds.
