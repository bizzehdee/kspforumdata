Engines will no longer consume any fuel if they don\u0027t have enough to run. Before, if an engine consumed 2 types of fuel and one of them runs out, it will continue to consume both at the normal rate even though the engine isn\u0027t running.

You might also want to dump some fuel if you\u0027ve got significantly more than you require, or are going for a glider landing, but it\u0027s not as simple as just burning it away.

Or, if my three stage rocket has fuel left in its second stage on its way to orbit, I can use the second stage to get me the rest of the way. Most of the time, I actually under design my rockets: their either not strong enough, have too little control, don\u0027t have enough fuel, or are too heavy. I was just suggesting that maybe the person had put too much fuel into the spaceplane, or flying too fast too low and wasting fuel fighting the atmosphere, and was putting on more than they needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
