You should be launching at about 1.5, second stages don\u0027t need to start much above 1, and orbital stages can be as low TWR as your patience. Also I would suggest using AV-T1 winglets, or just setting the pitch/yaw/roll response of your winglets to 0 each; gimbals will give you enough control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you are pitching over at about 100m/s, right?

Try selecting the entire rocket (in the VAB) with shift-click, then rotate the whole thing 90-degrees around its vertical axis(i think that\u0027s q/e)... see if the problem changes. If so, there\u0027s an alignment problem somewhere. I\u0027ve had problems with the tri-coupler causing mis-aligned center-of-lift in the past. The best solution in my opinion (and this is what I do) is to go from a single stage to a three-sym stage by using radial decouplers and struts rather than using the tricoupler. Your overall profile should be somewhat sloping, not thin and pencil-like. This design won\u0027t be as tall, and will be much more aerodynamically stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey way I do my turn is straight up to 100m/s or 1km, then pitch east to 80 degrees, but when the velocity vector is at 85 degrees then I just set SAS to follow velocity vector and watchmy time to apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Mod","CreatedById":139998,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelp I figured out one issue.

That\u0027s good except the effect may be so strong you can\u0027t pitchover.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the spontaneous pitchover in a certain direction, do you have \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E non symmetric parts? FAR applies drag to things like OX-STATs that stock doesn\u0027t. If that\u0027s not the issue my next guess is that the tri-coupler is known for not being perfectly symmetric.
