However, through heating the fuel heavily, or clever engine design, Liquid Fuel can approach the efficiency of hydrogen-based fuel. It burns quite readily and cleanly, allowing re-ignition of engines without any regard for residue. It also ignites at low temperature, allowing rather simple ignition systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer - Koxygen - a dense compound of oxygen with some other chemicals (that happen not to affect the burn much, or they affect it positively.) (5kg/unit (liters?) compared to 1.141kg/l for real LOX.) It is moderately croygenic, but less so than pure liquid oxygen, allowing it to be stored with negligible boiloff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid Fuel - Kerbals have not learned the art of making efficient solid fuel. Thus, Solid Fuel on Kerbin is simply advanced black powder.
