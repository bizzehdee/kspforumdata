So, to make it more interesting, it will be a mobile base (dubbed \u0022Kratos\u0022), and a fairly large one at that.\u00A0And, since I find the Elanco challenge to not only be an interesting but even fun challenge, we might as well travel the entire equator while we\u0027re at it!\u00A0Considering that my first interplanetary base has yet to see a return of its crew (five years and counting on Eve!), the number of volunteers for this mission were slim. However, five kerbals stepped up for the challenge: Jeb, Bill, Bob, Zeldine (pilot), and Eribella (scientist).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be committing around an hour or two each day towards this circumnavigation, and will make a post in this thread for each day as a journey log. Since I\u0027ve already completed two days of travel before making this, the next post will start on day three. The truck is equipped with a large fuel cell and four RTGs, so I don\u0027t need to worry about my energy situation while driving, allowing me to drive day and night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDAY 1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the first day starts by landing the Kratos truck on the surface of Duna. I wasn\u0027t confident in my parachute arrangement being able to land the crew safely in the Midlands nor the Highlands, so I aim for one of the canyons near to the equator. The exact landing site, and the eventual end to the circumnavigation, is located at 4\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E14\u002731\u0022N 200\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E55\u002715\u0022E\u00A0and marked with the first of many flags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob and Eribella get to work collecting science from the Lowlands, and later on Jeb drives the Kratos up to the edge of the canyon in order for the crew to gather scientific data of the Dunar Highlands. Turns out that this detour wasn\u0027t needed since the end of the canyon in the west marks the beginning of a large area of Highlands, but this information was unknown at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/HkVsC/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDAY 2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 2 of the journey starts at dusk and continues until nighttime finally falls on Duna. Before leaving the canyon, I found an ore concentration of ~6%, so Bill decides to fill the ore tanks not only to complete a KSC contract but also to ensure that Kratos will have plenty of fuel between now and the next time the crew run across\u00A0ore-rich grounds. Finally, Kratos leaves the canyon and properly starts following the equator within a degree north or south of it. It is decided that the crew want to visit the Ares probe, a lander which was the very first interplanetary mission carried out by the KSC in this career save. This is located at 0\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E37\u00270\u0022S 41\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E49\u002756\u0022E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing learned so far is that this beast doesn\u0027t like sudden changes of slope. Best case scenario is that Kratos flies\u00A0through the air like some sort of monster truck, and worse case is death and destruction. The terrain in the Highlands forces Jeb to an average velocity of 10m/s instead of the 20m/s on the first day, and sometimes 15m/s on flat pieces of land. Later in day 2\u0027s journey, the crew run into what appear to be mountain ranges, forcing the Kratos to traverse the terrain even slower and forcing me to liberally use the quicksave (and reload) feature. The first problem area was the peak where the whole crew get out to stretch their legs; Zeldine isn\u0027t confident in Jeb\u0027s piloting ability, though she also hasn\u0027t been on a mission with him before and thus doesn\u0027t know how much of a BadS he is. So far it seems that only Jeb and Bill have an unfailing sense of joy and happiness, whereas the rest of the crew are uneasy during the rougher parts of the day\u0027s journey. The second difficult spot was right after Zeldine decided to catch a glimpse of the Duna sunset. The Kratos truck doesn\u0027t have enough SAS to correct its angle while in the air, I learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe day ends at the edge of yet another steep slope. However, the crew get a chance to gaze at the stars above the Duna mountains while they set up camp for the night and catch some sleep. Given the number of times I\u0027ve had to reload from quicksaves, driving in the Highlands at night might not be such a smart idea, as I feel I could have made more progress if I was better able to see upcoming slope changes. Alas, the mission started at ~200\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EE and so far ended at ~143\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EE, so progress is being made!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/L9KnP/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"einzelgaenger","CreatedById":155216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T00:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDAY 3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a well-deserved rest, the crew of Kratos witness the thin, wispy dust clouds of the Duna atmosphere. Even during the daylight hours, the sky is still pitch black but lacks stars due to the contrast between the Dunar surface and the sky. They discover that the slope ahead of them is not as steep as previously thought, so Jeb decides to speed down the slope at nearly 20m/s to make up for the lost distance caused by the hazardous terrain encountered on day 2 of the mission. Of course, when cresting the edges of mountains, this caused Kratos to leap through the air for several dozen meters at a time, however Jeb is able to maintain control of the truck (most of the time). Zeldine, for a few brief moments, manages to break a smile despite still being nervous of Jeb\u0027s driving.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt one point, the crew found themselves driving on the edge of yet another steep slope. However, the scenery encountered during this leg of the trip was nothing short of breathtaking. While most of the crew decided to take a break within the truck, Eribella got out to get a better view of the rolling hills below. And, of course, to plant a marker flag for the Elcano Challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral kilometers later, Jeb\u0027s efforts for making up for lost time caused wheel damage for the second time in this journey (the first being near the end of day 2). Bill stepped out of the capsule to inspect the damage, repair it, and then yell at Jeb for causing it. However, to be fair, despite the average cruising speeds of 20-25m/s for this leg of the journey, there were few reloads from quicksaves, especially after hitting the Midlands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb, exhausted from driving, decided that he\u0027ll plant a marker flag a few kilometers away from the repair site. However, while trying to return to the inside of Kratos, he tripped and discovered how soft and (relatively) comfortable the Midlands ground was due to its thick coating of dust. He took a short nap before Bill drags him inside. Accordingly, Zeldine took over driving for\u00A0the rest of today\u0027s trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 3 ends around 135\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EE, better progress than days 1 or 2 individually.

Made another two hour trek through the Dunar Midlands, though it was mostly uneventful, which doesn\u0027t make for much of a good story. I\u0027ve noticed that the science lab\u0027s chairs are oriented upside-down relative to the ground, so I\u0027m surprised Bill and Eribella haven\u0027t suffered from redout yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the terrain consisted of smooth, rolling dunes, so driving at speed wasn\u0027t too difficult and as a result quicksave reloads were not needed much at all. However, one artifact seemingly common on KSP surfaces showed up when one of the \u0022terrain tiles\u0022 (or whatever they\u0027re called) didn\u0027t line up exactly with the rest of the ground.

Yay! (Not really...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypical progress for the past few days has been around 15\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0W per day, though today\u0027s progress was closer to 10\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0due to a variety of factors. A major part of this was having to deal with steep slopes once again; Jeb and Zeldine need to be careful when the downwards slope exceeds 13\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E, as the Kratos truck has a hard time slowing down either by brakes or reverse power in such an environment. Combined with any sharp changed in slope (such as 14\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0to \u0026lt;8\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E) and the vehicle has a tendency of breaking the front-most pair of wheels and sending the truck in a cartwheel as a result. Average speeds today once again when back down to 15m/s. However, on a shallow downwards slope Kratos was able to reach a maximum speed of nearly 30m/s, though this resulted in a reload once an even slighter change in slope upwards caused a major cartwheel and several explosions. The maximum safe speed achieved was closer to 25m/s, though Jeb had to brake\u00A0far before that hill was encountered again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there were no terrain title mismatches found today, I ran into an interesting bug that the Squad developers might wan tto check up on (if they don\u0027t know about it already). I noticed that one of the flags I planted disappeared once I was a couple of kilometers away and ended up having\u00A0to plant a new one to replace it (the first flag after the end of Day 4). This happened once again when I was quicksaving near the edge of a mountain and when Jeb was driving away from it, the flag temporarily jumped in front of my part, then disappeared. Stopped the truck and turned the camera around to see that the flag was *sinking* through the surface of Duna(!). I have no idea what that is all about, though I took a few screencaps as the flag fell through the ground. Then I just shrugged it off, planted another flag, and moved on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCresting over the edge of another mountain across the valley from the mountain with the sinking flag, Jeb jumped over the edge too fast and ended up breaking one of the rear wheels after a hard landing on the peak. Bill had to step out and repair the tire, planting a marker flag before going back in the truck to mark Jeb\u0027s failure at reaching this peak intact. Only a hundred or two meters away, however, he does it again, this time with the rear-right wheel was busted. Annoyed, Bill once again steps out of the front cab and repairs the damage. \u0022There\u0027s no way he\u0027ll do it again\u0022, Bill thought.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurprise! Very shortly afterwards, Jeb does it *again*! This time with one of the front tires. Jeb and Bill look at the warning light on the control panel and neither of them even bother speaking; Jeb bangs his head on the dash while Bill doesn\u0027t even speak a word as he gets out for a third time to save Kratos from being stuck on top of the mountain. The rest of the crew were inclined to dub the peak \u0022Mount Stupid\u0022 in honor of Jeb\u0027s terrible driving for today\u0027s leg of the trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the day\u0027s journey went without incident, though involved one or two more reloads. Kratos sets up camp relatively closer to previous camps than the last four days of travel thanks to the shenanigans previously mentioned.

Along the way, the truck reentered the Dunar Highlands; however, there were less problems traversing this terrain than previous encounters with the Highlands. Jeb was able to keep the vehicle at speed over most of the terrain, only slowing down whenever Kratos had to navigate steep slopes downwards. One of the slopes was especially challenging, starting off at 19\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0then turning into 22\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E; trying to drive down the latter slope resulted in a reload, so Jeb ended up driving around this \u0022bowl\u0022 instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp ahead was a rather large cliff face next to one of the taller mountains encountered on the trip thus far.

The rest of the crew agreed to the idea and the first peak they discovered was christened \u0022Mount Nye\u0022. Soon after, a taller peak was discovered and ended up with the name \u0022Sagan\u0027s Peak\u0022. While there, the crew decided it would be a good time to transmit the science they\u0027ve accumulated over the past two to three weeks (KSC told the crew to take five while a Minmus mining operation sent supplies to a LKO fuel depot), though really it was just an excuse to soak in the views from atop this mountain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time later, the descended from the peak to continue on with the journey.

Turns out that the efficiency is pretty terrible and the result was that 600 units of ore only made a small contribution towards LFO replenishing. Thankfully, this campsite had an ore concentration of just over 4%, allowing Bill to deploy the miniature drills and completely fill the LFO tank after two more refills of the ore tanks and a few Dunar days. On the plus side, KSC gave the crew another Duna mining contract a few days earlier and refueling Kratos netted the administration a fair bit of cash as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aTU4O/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"einzelgaenger","CreatedById":155216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T17:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDAY 8:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort leg of the trip on Duna before I headed out of state for vacation, though I haven\u0027t had an internet connection to post until just now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscovered that it\u0027s easier to go downhill when each side of the truck is on either side of a \u0022terrain line\u0022 (whatever they\u0027re called), such as on the exact equator.
