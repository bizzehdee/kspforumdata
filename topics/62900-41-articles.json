Often you only have two or five days to accept the contracts. I think it is reasonable to allow the deadlines to stretch enough that you can get the \u0022Gather science\u0022 and \u0022Launch first vessel\u0022 done first and then accept the two others.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I just tested something. I let the clock run for about 15 days, and those contracts were still there. I watched one run out of time, and it came back. I think those ones just keep coming back until you do them. I\u0027m doing more testing right now by playing through the first few launches. My first launch was 3 days later and I didn\u0027t accept the \u0022Gather Science\u0022 contract before that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Can confirm.
