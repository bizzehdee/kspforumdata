Materials, temperature. Why should we not know these things? Okay, so you open up the science JR.. uh oh. It either tells you nothing or say to you that the Research and Development is closed so you can\u0027t understand anything. Its the same on Kerbin, want to see the temperature? Nope, can\u0027t do that. Barometer? Nope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome may say its because your in Sandbox and it shouldn\u0027t matter because you\u0027ve unlocked everything,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ebut it does matter\u003Ci\u003E.

However, I can\u0027t do this. The display seems to be telling nonsense at the same time.
