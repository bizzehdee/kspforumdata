That video claimed a simple simulation of a scrap of cloth was running at TWO frames per second by simply properly calculating it, I find that very difficult to believe if the physics engine used had been even remotely well programmed. The claim that the AI ran it at thousands of frames per second is\u00A0less difficult to believe - because that simulation is extremely simple and the AI is likely just regurgitating the closest known approximation with terrible accuracy. Not once did the AI presented actually have to work on more than an abysmal\u00A0number of types of objects at the same time, this is a huge red flag if you want to \u0022sell\u0022 an AI that\u0027s competent and can be applied to complex systems. The claim that it \u0022only\u0022 uses 9MB (or whatever it was) is for a pathetic number of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Etypes\u003C/strong\u003E of\u00A0objects in play. I\u0027m now going to use \u003Cu\u003Emath\u003C/u\u003E so if you can\u0027t stomach that, it\u0027s time to stop reading:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo properly calculate the outcome of an impact between two objects you need to know their exact physical shape, weight, speed, rotational speed, angle of impact and\u00A0point of impact. When you\u00A0let\u00A0the same two objects collide thousands of times you can get a number of good examples as well as edge cases\u00A0- then all you need to do is match the closest one to what\u0027s about to happen next time and you have an ALMOST GOOD ENOUGH really fast prediction. Now let\u0027s add just one more object, Object3, and run the simulation for a few thousand times between that and Object1 and then again a few thousand times for Object3 colliding with Object2, your database now grew\u00A0to three times its first size\u00A0by simply adding A SINGLE OBJECT, this\u00A0results in slowdowns\u00A0since the AI has to dig through the much larger database for a match. Now let\u0027s ATTACH Object1 to Object2 and collide that with Object3, this introduces yet another factor for the AI to consider: how much force it takes to separate Object1 from Object2. The database is growing. Now let\u0027s attach Object1 to Object2 \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ein a slightly differrent spot \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003Eand we have yet another scenario that causes database growth. Now let\u0027s attach Object3 to Object2 and collide with Object1 that is attached to a second copy of Object1. At this point the AI is already\u00A0using a huge database that is nothing like what that shady video would have you believe, and we\u0027re still on THREE object types. How many pieces do you build your rockets out of? I certainly never build a rocket out of just two pieces. I\u0027m not sure at what point the database hits the terrabyte mark but for something like KSP2 I\u0027m pretty sure the database size would make you pale in the face - and it still wouldn\u0027t be anywhere close to accurate... not to mention its selling point is completely lost because it would no longer be even remotely fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could go on but anyone who still doesn\u0027t understand is not going to listen to reason and logic, I have better things to do with my life. Final nail in the coffin for this topic: KSP2 is - as far as I understand - already developed to the point where it can handle big\u00A0constructs accurately and it will use some kind of \u0022grouping\u0022 of objects that greatly reduces the number of calculations needed in most cases and that still permits simply dividing the group if circumstances demand more finely detailed calculations. This system is close to perfectly accurate, runs fast even on low spec hardware and is already\u00A0close to done. Anyone who wants to throw out this system 6 months before the game hits the market has no business giving advice to game developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-02T18:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189417\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572636045\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200079\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maxxor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, maxxor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou guys arent thinking like an ai or a computer you just see different label cloth isnt the same as rocket. but an ai just handels collision physics its pretty universal if you set the same standards of interaction. almost all parts will bump similarly against eachother. doesnt matter if you have a supercustom cool rocket the parts are still interconnected in a similar way. even if your meme rocket is unique to your ego neural processing will make any game handle a 700 part much easier than if it never existed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nmost times of physics and slowdowns are during launch explosions and landings the only connections that are really in effect are seperators, topcones of air, landinglegs. it could probably learn how to expect things to bump around at 4x speed too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I\u0027m aware of that. And this might work well for destructive structures too. However the AI has to be trained and the result is then baked into the design.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is perfect for clothing as its an limited number of styles, you could treat robes and dresses as skirts , however most rockets tend to be unique and only used once, or the design evolve, they also stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI assume the AI creates an simplified model of the clothing where just some points are used for cloth physic. The upper part of an skirt will not be much affected it compared to the hem as an simple example.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"c4ooo","CreatedById":168905,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-02T18:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223697246\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189417\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572436862\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200079\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maxxor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/30/2019 at 8:01 AM, maxxor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis should be in ksp2 the devs can use neural learning to train the game to expect physics calculations and boost performance with 1000fps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189417\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572636045\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200079\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maxxor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, maxxor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou guys arent thinking like an ai or a computer you just see different label cloth isnt the same as rocket. but an ai just handels collision physics its pretty universal if you set the same standards of interaction. almost all parts will bump similarly against eachother. doesnt matter if you have a supercustom cool rocket the parts are still interconnected in a similar way. even if your meme rocket is unique to your ego neural processing will make any game handle a 700 part much easier than if it never existed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nmost times of physics and slowdowns are during launch explosions and landings the only connections that are really in effect are seperators, topcones of air, landinglegs. it could probably learn how to expect things to bump around at 4x speed too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwut\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video demonstrates the use of the NN for simulating cloth.
