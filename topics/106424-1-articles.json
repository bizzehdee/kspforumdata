As far as I\u0027m aware, it\u0027s at least 4.3.3, and I know we haven\u0027t upgraded to 5 yet, but there have been quite a few updates in between the two and I\u0027ve got no idea which one we\u0027re on. Logic would dictate one of the latest versions of Unity 4, but one can\u0027t be so sure (it can\u0027t actually be the latest version as it was only released after 1.0 landed/lifted off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82118-KSP-64bits-on-Windows-(this-time-it-s-not-a-request)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E original x64 thread\u003C/a\u003E says 4.3.3, but that was for version 0.23.5. The player for 4.3.3 doesn\u0027t seem to be cooperative in that it won\u0027t even start the game, hence my thinking it\u0027s probably some newer version that I\u0027ll be needing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that I\u0027m meddling with powers that I really shouldn\u0027t be here (even though it\u0027s just the replacement of two files...) and that the x64 version was vilified by many here owing to its bugginess, but I had very little problem with it on the whole (compared to what I\u0027ve heard it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E capable of) and I just want to see how it performs with 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u0022He\u0027s bonkers, I\u0027m tellin\u0027 ya!\u0022 -- KSP Forum AND dev team, most likely.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. 1.0 is pretty damn cool. I\u0027m loving the female Kerbals (at last!), though I\u0027ve not done much except fret about the dismal vacuum ISP of the RAPIER and how my beloved Ranger SSTOs no longer work because of it. I\u0027ll think of something to get \u0027em working again, especially considering I need them working for a mission I\u0027ve got planned.
