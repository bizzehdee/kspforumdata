I usually use some sort of girder, PF structural element or other item as a base for attaching things like the drill, antennas, solar panels etc. Also, when you say pylon, do you mean the actual KAS pylon or are you referring to the Pathfinder saddle?

Nope, not strange at all.\n\nI know why the weirdness is happening with the interaction between OSE Workshop and Pathfinder. The problem is in OseModuleInventoryPreference. It\u0027s not checking to see if the part\u0027s vessel is null, and as a result it throws an NRE. I think that part module is added to all parts, which is why Pathfinder\u0027s Conestoga and Buckboard (and others) are affected. I\u0027ve got a pull request in motion to help correct the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T04:55:35Z","Content":"\u003E I know why the weirdness is happening with the interaction between OSE Workshop and Pathfinder.

It was something Obi really needed to add in and good that he did but it doesn\u0027t surprise it\u0027s behind the NREs.

Anyway, I\u0027ve made a lot of progress. I\u0027ve got the OSEWorkshop functioning properly now (I have a pull request in progress), and debugged things on my end. I can now print parts in the Blacksmith. I also have some new templates, and did a *lot* of under the hood changes and bug fixes. I\u0027m in the process of testing the Outback, and have confirmed that if you leave it on the ground and then switch focus to another vessel, the backpack will be gone when you come back. It seems to be something to do with it being flagged as debris, and the game cleans up debris. So far I haven\u0027t seen any error messages in the logs, except for a complaint by KAS that the part is -1m below ground for some odd reason... I guess space is a bad part of town...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T21:17:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"}]}
