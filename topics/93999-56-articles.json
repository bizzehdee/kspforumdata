I would like the mod to change thingsbeyond Jool, whilst everything within Jool\u0027s orbit, including Jool, remains unchanged. The addition of a comet is fine, but I really do not want to say the Jool system being tampered with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind at all if there were changes made but released as a separate mod, but just not this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just as a suggestion, could the moons for Urlum be given higher inclinations?
