On rescue missions to retrieve kerbs from orbit, in previous versions I was able to target the cadet, and when I got close enough they would remain highlighted, which made it much easier to adjust velocity and rendezvous with them. The most recent missions I have been on, they are no longer highlighted even when I matched orbits and came within 1k meters. Any assistance here would be appreciated, not the greatest pilot so trying to link up with black space and not being able to see the target felt impossible. Thanks all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-22T04:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you select the other craft as target?
