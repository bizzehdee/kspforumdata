It would not be fair to move some threads and not others, as that would lead to accusations of favoritism. Further, the guidelines for what is considered roleplaying and what is allowable are changing, it would not be right to retroactively moderate users for this change in rule interpretation (by this I mean that moving some threads and not others is effectively moderating those that are not moving).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s been decided that the best way forward is to start with a clean slate, with no baggage of \u0022this is how this thread has always been\u0022.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T13:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh dear me.
