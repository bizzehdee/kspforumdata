For example, the fuel margin for a deep space probe is likely double or more than what they need to accomplish the primary mission. However, they usually plan on having an optionally extended mission. Fuel margins for sending resupplies to the ISS or other single use craft with short durations is probably much smaller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pand5461","CreatedById":172084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T18:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say, it must be a fair bit, probably a few hundreds m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunication satellites: more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = more lifetime, about 15 m/s per year is needed to maintain position at GEO.
