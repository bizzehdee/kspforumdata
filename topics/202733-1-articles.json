There you can find the contract and it will mention the ID number KSP uses to refer to it. And then also all you vessels will have ID numbers assigned. But to make things not so obvious, there are different IDs and contracts of different types sometimes use the one or the other. Here is a thread where I reported a little but about that (and the obvious advertisement, that I did make a save file editor called KML to help with that):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022137308\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8969105408\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200764-contracts-losing-ids-fixing-save-instead-of-altf12/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess would be, that the contract just refers to a non-existing sattelite and in the thread I described how just to build a new one and assign it to the contract\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grizbud","CreatedById":208274,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-31T01:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the information, Mythos.\u00A0 Your KML identified the mismatch of ID\u0027s and, after editing, the vehicle was highlighted on the map.\u00A0 Unfortunately, once on site, the battery bank would not attach to the satellite even though there were nodes present.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure if it was the engineer\u0027s experience level or something else.\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027m still trying to figure out how the construction in space process works ... with little success.\u00A0 Guess this contract will just have to expire.\u00A0 Thanks again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mythos","CreatedById":137308,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-31T09:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223981769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202733\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221622423219\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208274\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grizbud\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Grizbud said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, once on site, the battery bank would not attach to the satellite even though there were nodes present.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure if it was the engineer\u0027s experience level or something else.\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027m still trying to figure out how the construction in space process works ... with little success.\u00A0 Guess this contract will just have to expire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems to be a case of figuring out how the construction works, then.
