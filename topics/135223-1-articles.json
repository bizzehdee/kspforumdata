I have some experience in KSP, I\u0027ve been to both the mun and Minmus, I\u0027ve escaped Kerbin\u0027s SoI, and I\u0027ve gotten into (nearly) circular orbits of these three bodies. I can\u0027t dock, I\u0027ve tried, so if you have any tips on that, that would be great. I haven\u0027t gone interplanetary yet, but I\u0027m working on it. I know how to install mods and stuff, but the info that I get from MechJeb and KER isn\u0027t helpful yet (I don\u0027t understand it). If you could just help me out with some basic math and what the info mod\u00A0stuff means, I would be very grateful, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T21:05:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T21:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would start here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/26220-the-drawing-board-a-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust look through it and read up on any topic that you\u0027d like to know more about.

Measured in seconds because it conveniently avoids any confusion with units.*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) TWR = thrust to weight ratio: thrust being in newtons of force and weight (also newtons) being the mass in kilos multiplied by gravity (which is 9.81 on Kerbin). Must be more than one to lift off any planet or moon. Can be as low as you like in orbit if you have time to kill. Note that there is still plenty of gravity in orbit and therefore by definition you are not weightless, you just don\u0027t feel it since you\u0027re constantly falling. Also note that people seem to find \u0022freefall\u0022 too un-sciency, so they make up terms like \u0022micro-gravity environment\u0022 to avoid saying the (wrong and un-sciency) \u0022weightless\u0022 even though there is nothing \u0022micro\u0022 about the Earth\u0027s gravity at only 400 km altitude...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nc) dv = delta-v: how much change in velocity your spacecraft can make. Absolutely and resolutely fixed by your mass, quantity of fuel and engine Isp (aka the rocket equation or one of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacewesterns.com/articles/105/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe cold equations\u003C/a\u003E). Starting from KSC (velocity due to Kerbin\u0027s spin: 175m/s) you need to accelerate to about 2300 m/s to orbit at 70km. However, it\u0027ll require a dv of about 3200-3500 m/s to get there due to gravity losses, atmospheric drag losses, and steering losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with those three figures, you know (a) how efficiently and (b) how powerfully you can go (c) from one orbit to another. KER just gives you the figures and helpful tools to use them. MechJeb also allows you to \u003Cs\u003Echeat\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cem\u003Equalitatively improve player experience by automating certain maneuvres\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E* I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E is essentially energy per mass, or thrust divided by mass flow rate. Thrust is exhaust velocity times mass flow rate, so by this first definition mass flow rate cancels out leaving: Isp = exhaust velocity. Velocity is distance divided by time, so I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E could be measured as distance/time. However, in a geocentric model mass flow rate can be replaced by weight flow rate. Since weight = mass times \u003Cem\u003Eg\u003C/em\u003E (which is distance per second per second), then you can bridge from one measure to the other by multiplying or dividing by \u003Cem\u003Eg\u003C/em\u003E. Therefore by this second definition, I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E = (distance / time) / (distance/(time*time), and the units cancel out giving I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E = time. This should make engineers happy because they can discuss engine efficiency without worrying what units their fellow engineers are using for everything else, but it seems someone forgot to pass on the message so you\u0027ll still see a bunch of different units used to describe rockets, and even more for jet engines.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T02:28:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
