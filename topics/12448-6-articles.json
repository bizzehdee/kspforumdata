I apologize for this late fix and for my absence. The last few months have not necessarily been kind to me. After many extensions, I finally finished my project at work and was promptly laid off at the end of May. I work in visual effects. The job market for VFX has been exceptionally poor, especially in LA, making it difficult to secure a job.
