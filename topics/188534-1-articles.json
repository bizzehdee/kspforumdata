(Sorry Monopropellant, you are for another discussion). The classics, designed to be unambiguous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the KSP community has always\u00A0tried to put a definition on them. Liquid Fuel was easy - liquid hydrogen. It can run as a high efficiency vacuum engine, or as a jet engine along sea level. As a first stage or in a NERVA. Liquid Hydrogen checked all boxes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOxidizer, on the other hand, has stayed in debate if not given up on. Liquid Oxygen feels like a good candidate, but fails in one area: hypergolic-ness\u00A0(Okay, that\u2019s the dumbest way to say that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I mean is that to keep with KSP\u2019s engine style of instant ignition and many starts and stops, the propellants probably have to hypergolic. (If you aren\u2019t a rocket nerd, that means they ignite instantly upon contact). Unfortunately Oxidizers that are hypergolic are quite rare, and almost all of them only are with fuels like hydrazine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I found one: (really\u00A0a family of propellants, but\u00A0I settled on one.) fluorine or one of its chemical siblings, chlorine trifluoride. These are hypergolic with pretty much anything (It doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s liquid\u00A0hydrogen or flippin concrete!) Also, with proper treatment, ClF3 can be stored in tanks made of many different metals.

ClF*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, a real propellant that has the magical aspects of oxidizer: Instant ignition and good efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nflamma est ubi?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Of course it isn\u2019t ClF3!

The efflorescence of fluorine chemistry sparked by the Manhattan Project led to studies in this country, and the Oak Ridge people, among others, investigated it exhaustively during the late 40\u0027s and early 50\u0027s. So it wasn\u0027t exactly an unknown quantity when the rocket people started in on it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EChlorine trifluoride, ClF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:7pt;\u0022\u003E3\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E, or \u0022CTF\u0022 as the engineers insist on calling it, is a colorless gas, a greenish liquid, or a white solid. It boils at 12\u00B0 (so that a trivial pressure will keep it liquid at room temperature) and freezes at a convenient \u201476\u00B0. It also has a nice fat density, about 1.81 at room temperature.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIt is also quite probably the most vigorous fluorinating agent in existence\u2014much more vigorous than fluorine itself.

It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that\u0027s the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water \u2014with which it reacts explosively. It can be \u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003Ekept in some of the ordinary structural metals \u2014 steel, copper, aluminum, etc. \u2014because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes. And even if you don\u0027t have a fire, the results can be devastating enough when chlorine trifluoride gets loose, as the General Chemical Co. discovered when they had a big spill. Their salesmen were awfully coy about discussing the matter, and it wasn\u0027t until I threatened to buy my RFNA from Du Pont that one of them would come across with the details.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIt happened at their Shreveport, Louisiana, installation, while they were preparing to ship out, for the first time, a one-ton steel cylinder of CTF. The cylinder had been cooled with dry ice to make it easier to load the material into it, and the cold had apparently embrittled the steel. For as they were maneuvering the cylinder onto a dolly, it split and dumped one ton of chlorine trifluoride onto the floor. It chewed its way through twelve inches of concrete and dug a threefoot hole in the gravel underneath, filled the place with fumes which corroded everything in sight, and, in general, made one hell of a mess. Civil Defense turned out, and started to evacuate the neighborhood, and to put it mildly, there was quite a brouhaha before things quieted down. Miraculously, nobody was killed, but there was one casualty \u2014 the man who had been steadying the cylinder when it split. He was found some five hundred feet away, where he had reached Mach 2 and was still picking up speed when he was stopped by a heart attack.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThis episode was still in the future when the rocket people started working with CTF, but they nevertheless knew enough to be scared to death, and proceeded with a degree of caution appropriate to dental work on a king cobra. And they never had any reason to regret that caution. The stuff consistently lived up to its reputation. Bert Abramson of Bell Aircraft fired it in the spring of 1948, using hydrazine as the fuel, NACA and North American followed suit the next year, and in 1951 NARTS burned it with both ammonia and hydrazine.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe results were excellent, but the difficulties were infuriating. Ignition was beautiful \u2014so smooth that it was like turning on a hose. Performance was high \u2014very close to theoretical. And the reaction was so fast that you could burn it in a surprisingly small chamber. But. If your hardware was dirty, and there was a smear of oil or grease\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E somewhere inside a feed line, said feed line would ignite and cleverly reduce itself to ashes. Gaskets and O-rings generally had to be of metal; no organic material could be restrained from ignition. Teflon would stand up under static conditions, but if the CTF flowed over it with any speed at all, it would erode away like so much sugar in hot water, even if it didn\u0027t ignite. So joints had to be welded whenever possible, and the welds had to be good. An enclosure of slag in the weld could react and touch off a fire without even trying. So the welds had to be made, and inspected and polished smooth and reinspected, and then all the plumbing had to be cleaned out and passivated before you dared put the CTF into the system. First there was a water flush, and the lines were blown dry with nitrogen. Then came one with ethylene trichloride to catch any traces of oil or grease, followed by another nitrogen blow-down. Then gaseous CTF was introduced into the system, and left there for some hours to catch anything the flushing might have missed, and \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Ethen \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Ethe liquid chlorine trifluoride could be let into the propellant lines.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIt was when the stuff got into the motor that the real difficulties began, for a chlorine trifluoride motor operates at a chamber temperature close to 4000 K, where injectors and nozzle throats have a deplorable tendency to wash away, and unless the materials of which they are made are chosen with considerable astuteness, and unless the design is \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Every \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Egood, the motor isn\u0027t going to last long. The propellant man liked CTF because of its performance, and the engineer hated the beast because it was so rough on motors and so miserable to handle. Although he had to learn to live with it, he postponed the learning process as long as he could. It is only recently, as the customers have been demanding a better performance than can be wrung out of IRFNA-UDMH, that CTF has been the subject of much intensive, large scale, testing.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, like many of the halogens and exotics, the advice is simple \u0022Don\u0027t use, not worth it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-30T05:40:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2019 05:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jacke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harrisjosh2711","CreatedById":177745,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-30T22:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223679351\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188534\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221569821040\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brikoleur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Brikoleur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve tried it.

For example, if you have a high-power kerolox engine, and there\u0027s no kerosine on Eve, then that engine is not suitable for use as a launch stage from an Eve base supplying fuel with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the things I like best about KSP is the way it\u0027s possible to combine parts in innumerable ways to create craft that perform jobs the part creators never even imagined. The Lego thing. I don\u0027t think there is a single engine designed specifically for an Eve launch stage, but there are several that work for the job because of their characteristics. If you\u0027re proposing a feature that significantly limits what parts can be used for what purposes, this will significantly reduce the range of possible, viable designs in the game. Tighten these constraints enough, and the Lego-ness is as good as lost: the viable designs will be tightly constrained and closely similar, just like with RL spacecraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain: I am aware that realism superfans would want it this way, and as I\u0027ve said many times I\u0027m all for having mods like Realism Overhaul that accomplish this.

As far as I\u0027m concerned it is right now in a very, very sweet spot that balances constraints and creativity, and any move out of that in either direction should be treated with extreme caution. KSP is so successful precisely because it hits this sweet spot, and it wouldn\u0027t take much to shift it out of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want that, which is why I\u0027m so negative about many of these proposed changes (fuel types, life support, n-body physics etc).

Fuel tanks, for instance,\u00A0should be visually distinct, according to their purpose (and in Nertea\u0027s mods, they are). Same with engines, most of them should have something unique about them, despite having an overall similar role.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s another approach to reducing engine proliferation: cut down on the size range. Instead of having 1.25m engines, then the same, but a bit bigger 1.875m ones and so on, have a collection of varied engines in sizes from 0.625m to 2.5m, and handle specific needs by clustering. With KSP2, clusters of individual engines are already said to be the name of the game. IRL, there is exactly \u003Cem\u003Eone \u003C/em\u003Eengine that approaches 3.75m scale, for instance (the M-1),\u00A0and that one never flew. Most real rocket\u00A0engines end up in the 1.25m range after scaling them to KSP,\u00A0and the ones that don\u0027t usually have nozzles several times the size of the rest of the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223680057\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188534\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221569943592\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brikoleur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Brikoleur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you elaborate on that, with an example?

They are abstract and are open to the player\u0027s imagination. Because of LiquidFuel\u0027s density it\u0027s actually primarily considered by the Realism Overhaul community, to be RP-1, a form of Kerosene. Meanwhile, its use in the one nuclear engine, the NERV, suggests that should be Liquid Hydrogen. Of course, it\u0027s far too dense to be Hydrogen, and Kerosene would utterly suck in an NTR. But here we are: abstract stock propellants being stretched across use cases far too wide for any one specific propellant to fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will agree that Oxidizer is quite a gray area. Most, I think, tend to equate Oxidizer to LOX simply because \u0022It contains Oxygen. It\u0027s liquid. So it must be Liquid Oxygen!\u0022 However, Kerbalism (and I think, KSP Interstellar) interpret it as HTP, which persists at room temperature for a generous but not indefinite time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a quick look at the Wikipedia page, I see that ClF3 is stored well in quartz vessels, and reacts quite well with Water. In such a world I imagine kerbals would have tanks made of diamond, and Water would directly replace LiquidFuel as the main fuel. I\u0027m honestly concerned for what would go into an NTR that can operate on Fluorine (and not dissolve). Finally, I imagine that Kerbin wouldn\u0027t be green for long if Fluorine rocketry became a norm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
