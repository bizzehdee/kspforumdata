I have tried recovering simple things like droptanks and SRB\u0027s but they get destroyed as soon as the main craft gets 20km away.. Only other way I could figure it out is go all the way to orbit, and once the payload is in a stable orbit, I can de-orbit and land the first stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo wahts the secret for returning those things? thanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T08:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe secret is putting your spent stage on hold until you have time to deal with it.
