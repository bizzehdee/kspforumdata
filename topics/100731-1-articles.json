Even cargo, which protrudes far out of the front can be lifted. I chosen the front-end loader design to make this possible. Landing on Mun and Minmus is possible. The landing wheels are positioned between \u0022sligtly behind mass\u0022 and \u0022i have to land this without air!\u0022. That way most cargo won\u0027t allow you to take off until the end of the runway arrives. Landing on Mun is a little tricky, because of the bad TWR. I did a pretty bad job at placing the air intakes. There are much to much. They aren\u0027t placed by Air Intake, Jet Engine, Air Intake, Jet Engine... just all intakes and afterwards the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome data (this is proved, more could be possible):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E92t to 240km orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15t to Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32t to Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E21t to LKO while half of the cargo hanging out of the front\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe with some extra fuel as cargo (2 orange tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna with refueling in LKO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see, its more a lifter, than a traveller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very proud of the contraption, but i have to admit, that it behaves like a diva \u0026gt;10km and it is not user friendly. Here is the way up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAG = Action Group\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. AG 2, 3, 4; throttle up, SAS on;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. [optional] alternately press W and S to swing the nose up before the end of the runway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. pull up to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 - 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (depends on the weight of the cargo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. [optional] press R and AG 5 to help it get its nose up. Don\u0027t forget to press R and AG 5 again, when its not needed anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. above of 28km you have to watch your SAS. You have to throttle down the 2 jet engines at the bottom, when it starts to push down. Do that on the Fly or you shut down the engines with AG 4 (i would recommend to use point [5.] to stabilize the plane while doing that). Or just shut them down, when not needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. gain speed between 31km and 33km height. you won\u0027t reach 2100m/s on heavy cargo. if it becomes tought to gain speed, go on to point [8.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. AG 4 to shut down the bottom 2 jet engines. pull up to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Alternate AG 1 (atom engines) to stay/get above 2100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. watch your air intake. throttle down to 1/3 to hold it above 0.06. then press AG 2 to disable 6 more engines. throtle up to 100%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Throttle the remaining engine on the left to 80% and reduce global throttle gaining height. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Go to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome additional Heavy Metal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3mMbSks.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223mMbSks.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot relevant at all... wait, these toys were delivered by this SSTO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace biplane, front loader, off center thrust/mass.
