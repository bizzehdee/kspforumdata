I\u0027ve even double checked it on the wiki and in game too. I\u0027m probably not the only one to notice this also, considering how long Jool\u0027s been in the game. So, has this little, um, \u0022bug,\u0022 been put there purposely or just hasn\u0027t been noticed enough to be fixed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T00:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several other knowledge base entries that are not quite right.
