Forgive me if this seems common sense to some but I didn\u0027t get my first pc until well into my 30\u0027s. This raises questions for me. I have a 32 and 64 bit install. Should I Have installed my 64bit into the c:/programfilesx86 directory? Sorry if this is a dumb question but a lot about computers is hokus pokus to me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elong and short: if you start KSP from the KSP.EXE, use the 32 bit. if you use KSP_x64.exe, use the 64 bit. the different bitiness refers to the word size of the program. most modern chips run x64 faster and better, but Unity is kinda full of bees when running in x64 mode. for more info, consider\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgiMzKb8dD0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, esp starting around 1:00\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genolution","CreatedById":54840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T00:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok but what ATM file should I install? x64 or x86?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AetherGoddess","CreatedById":115971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T00:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Genolution\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Genolution\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eok but what ATM file should I install? x64 or x86?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you don\u0027t know how you are starting KSP, then you are probably using the 32 bit, which is x86 (because of vararies you don\u0027t care about, x86 has come to mean 32-bit processors).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T00:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder what impact \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/Maxmaps/status/514853449834319872\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echanges to the asset loader\u003C/a\u003E will have on ATM?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill it make life easier or open new opportunities, I wonder what fixes in incorporates natively?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genolution","CreatedById":54840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T01:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see. thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T01:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FranFranz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FranFranz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi everyone!\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having problems loading KSP with different mods and I\u0027m getting crazy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E. I think the issue is linked with Active Texture Managmenent and Interstellar mod 0.12.1: the game starts loading and reaches the window with the Squad Monkey, but stops loading after a few seconds with the file WarpPlugin/Plugins/InterstellarToolbar (there\u0027s no crash nor white screen, the game just remains loading that file...). The last lines of KSP.log are the ones reported. I also tried to remove ATM and the game actually loads correctly (InterstellarToolbar included), but it obviously crashes after a while because it runs out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any hint on how to solve this problem?

I\u0027m about half done building a Minimus-based Station Science station(also has MP and LF storage for \u0022miscalcuations\u0022 during ordinary exploration missions) and the parts count is already getting high enough to halve my frame rate. When I send up complicated parts deliveries(i.e. solar arrays, KAS crate deliveries, fuel trucks, etc...), or when my satellite passes by, it gets pretty hard to dock anything. If this helps alleviate that I\u0027ll use it in a heartbeat.
