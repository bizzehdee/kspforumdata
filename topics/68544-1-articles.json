With creating a new build the selected ladder is not extended but will extend with a right click option. When loading builds the ladders are not extended and will not extend when clicking on the extend button. I deleted the settings file and had the program generate a new one but it did not help. Is there any way to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T15:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt present there is no fix. Ladders were changed to tweakable with 0.23.5 and there\u0027s a bug so you can only set their state right after you place them on your ship, you cannot change the state after you load them with the ship from craft file or after you revert to VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, place a ladder, tweak it to unfold to fine-tune its position, then tweak it back to fold if you want to have it folded on your ship before launch. If you need to change it later you need to delete the ladder and place a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Larrt_M","CreatedById":104021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T15:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for your answer Kasuha!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
