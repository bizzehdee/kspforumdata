I\u0027m with sumghai in that I wouldn\u0027t really want the crew to steal all the reports when they transfer.. you might end up having to do some weird transfer/EVA dance if say you wanted science to return to Kerbin but not the kerbals on the station etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see those features become stock. It\u0027s simple, it\u0027s straightforward, and lines up perfectly with Resource transfer...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T22:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe above two posters make good points about science transfer being handled separately from crew transfer. I was mostly hoping to avoid a situation where crew transfer is implemented but science transfer is not, meaning we\u0027d still need to do eva transfers if we want to bring science. Transferring science separately would be better still.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
