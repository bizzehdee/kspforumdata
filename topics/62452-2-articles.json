Most of the time, I try to voice my concerns to the devs directly, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve realized that they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really listen.

My favorite, and a big one - lack of Delta-v indicator for ships and other important editor/in-flight info. According to devs, it would \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cruin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the mystery of constructing stuff. In my opinion, the only thing it ruins is time. It wastes our own time that we could spend actually flying instead of re-building or calculating delta-v by hand. Also, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an inconsistency - there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an actual delta-v indicator for maneuvers, and lots of detailed info about the planets.

Because the base game doesn\u0027t tell them anything in the first place, and they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know the difference between playing with Delta-v displayed and without it! So they consider it as a normal thing. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t used delta-v concept for a YEAR of playing KSP, until actually finding the formulas and started to calculate it by hand. Then quickly got Kerbal Engineer, since it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s PITA to calculate things by hand. It takes time, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here to play the game. But now that I know what delta-v is, I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see how can I play without using it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really, the ones that don\u0027t care are mostly the people doing SOKERBAL XD jokes.

Lack of reentry heat. Unfortunately, I think devs won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ever implement it, at least not in a base game. And even if they would, as it was said, it would be done with something like \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cradiators\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that diffuse heat, so they won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Climit possible designs to take any shapes player might want\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Apparently, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no such thing as inflatable heat shields and dynamic part creation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry heat was mentioned multiple times, There\u0027s no reason for it not to be implemented until now except for the constant focus changes.

And risks of losing Kerbals vs probe gives you even more choice here.

Tech tree as a mean to introduce parts to the new players. This is just plain silly. Tech tree is not a tutorial, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a tech tree for a career mode. Tutorial (Training) is a separate thing in the main menu, hello? I get that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still WIP, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m talking about the whole concept that developers try to follow here. Harv actually SAID that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s suppose to introduce parts to the new players, being a tutorial. But a tech tree is actually a part of the tycoon part of the game, so there should be different logic behind it, how it expands.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree deserves a book for itself to voice all the stuff wrong with it, a long one at that. Back-ass-ward logic, meant to be a tutorial but it teaches nothing, it just limits the parts. Manned flight first (\u0022HEY, LET\u0027S PRESENT THE TRIO TO THE NEW PLAYERS FIRST SO THAT THEY CAN KILL THEM FASTER\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022macegee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022macegee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4. Manned flights give too much advantages over the use of unmanned probes, while there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s little reason not to use kerbals. Also, lack of probe-sized experiments and few scientific equipment. Again, I get that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still WIP, but the concept that devs, according to their own words, would use here is that probes would be just cheaper to use than kerbals. But why should they give that much science? You can get so much of it by doing EVA reports from polar orbit by flying over different biomes. You still can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t scoop soil samples with unmanned modules. Or even take photographs and million of other readings. Astronauts in space are mostly there for servicing (mostly to control and repair). Electronics do most of the stuff. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more. Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to eat or breathe. But probes need to eat, electricity.

But they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not the base game. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not maintained by a paid developers.

The biggest problem with everything I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve just talked about is that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m 99% sure that it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t change until the 1.0 release. It saddens me to say that the devs made me don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care about what they do anymore, because of lots of their questionable (and wrong) actions. So while I still play with joy, I have to use mods, have to start over and over again every once in a while because of it, which is okay for an early-access game if you think of it. But now I just wait for them to finish. Not to see a finished product, but so that mods would stop break and I can have persistence peacefully.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a long post already, and I probably missed or forgot something, but I\u0027ll stop for now.

First, a healthy mod community is going to be (and is already) a very important aspect for the success of the game. Exactly where that line should be, i.e. what should be in the product and what should be left for a mod is a difficult design decision with real economic and community impact. It\u0027s not an easy choice, and of course it will change over time...but as the game is in pre-release have a little patience for it to sort out and respect that it\u0027s a difficult, complex decision. Personally, I think a good compromise would be a very rudimentary flight computer like the Apollo-era DSKY - you have to know what you want to do, but the computer could execute it. The maneuver nodes are a good graphical approach to this, but I\u0027d like to see something a bit richer. And, as you note, MechJeb is there and will always improve for something more full-featured. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, it\u0027s supposed to be a game - and that balance between game and simulator has always been a dangerous one. Microsoft Flight Simulator died to some extent because it was too much of a simulator...and Microsoft Flight died because it was too much of a game.

Adding basic craft stats to the game - I agree with adding craft stats into the stock game. The thing I\u0027ve loved the most about this game is learning. Reenforcing terms and math I\u0027ve used in the past, learning of new terms and procedures, and learning to plan out missions before they leave. Because of this I think it would be great for a new player to learn what Delta-V is, and how it is used.

They will be experimenting with builds and missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the option were there to display craft stats, like mass, TWR, and Delta-V they could begin to learn WHY their craft or mission didn\u0027t work.

As of now you can build 1 to two craft and easily unlock a majority of the tech tree with just a few missions. You are able to unlock all of(pretty close to all) the techtree with out even making it to another planet. I believe the science requirements and when you unlock parts of it should reflect the kind and amount of parts available. Either tweak the science or add more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

There\u0027s a mod for that - From what I understand Squad is not that big, and from what I assume can\u0027t afford to be big. So the amount of Devs available to dedicate to aspects of the game is limited. Because of this I don\u0027t expect them to be able to keep up with player demand for more options, more parts, more features, and all the other creative ideas that the public comes up with. I actually like that mods are allowed to be applied, and that the community creates their own additions to the game. You get to, well, modify the game as you wish. If you want to fully cheat, you can, if you just want a little more information about your craft you can.
