A confusing part, the IlCP will be designed for 2.5m stacks and provide good visibility, even when stuff is stacked in front of it. It will not really be designed for re-entry (warranty totally voided!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/ilcp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ilcp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe model will probably get more details before I texture it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be making the texture (and possibly the attach nodes) in such a way that it will look good both in a 2.5m stack and on top of a 3.75m stack, so it could double as a 3.75m command pod. It\u0027s about as tall as the Mk1-3, so I think I\u0027ll probably have it seat... 4 kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Percebob","CreatedById":65578,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T23:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you plan on making the IVA ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks good by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-11T23:10:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2014 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Percebob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T02:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t completely decided, but I think it will be quite spacious, with each of the 4 crew directly below a window.
