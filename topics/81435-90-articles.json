My first generation armor worked fine, why did I ever change that. \u003Cp\u003EPlus you can actually make a\u003Cstrong\u003E controllable SRB-SRM\u003C/strong\u003E, although a bulky design you could control it when the solid fuel is fired. I made one by attaching Monopropellant tanks on the side without additional length, it serves as it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Emain propulsion before firing the solid fuel\u003C/strong\u003E.
