I just directly copied as much of the linked space station as I could, so I\u0027ll drop the double adaptor. Thought it was funky, but figured better to do the direct clone, maybe there was a reason.

It\u0027s less wobbly and thus better for construction. Just be sure to include some standard docking ports places because those are what usually get put on your service craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sometimes clustering small 1.25m engines is more powerful and efficient (not on your CPU! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) than 2.5m engines. 6 LV-T45 engines mounted as a cluster gives you 1200 thrust and vectoring. That makes a nice middle zone between a skipper and mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding your tug, instead of angling the engines, you can create separation with the modular girder segment. Radially mount it then mount some fuel tanks to it. Attach engines and you\u0027re good. You also can probably get away with 2 nuclear engines since they are heavy and less engines will actually mean more dV (but you may have a bit less fuel after the rebuild so overall delta V will be slightly reduced). I would also tell you to not cover your capsule with docking ports. You\u0027d be better off with a rockomax adapter there and a probe core if you really want the docking ports.
