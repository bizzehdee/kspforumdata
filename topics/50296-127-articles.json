Talking from 14t to 144t to over a thousand each time I revert to and from the craft. Now forgive me... this is for .25. So Im not looking for in depths trouble shooting here. Maybe just a point in the right direction. And the reason I am reporting this despite being on .25 is.. ive seen this before. I swear its happened to me before or someone else on the forum. I think it may be tweakscale. Because there are no individual sizes you have to use tweakscale to get the size you want ( 2.5m in this case ).
