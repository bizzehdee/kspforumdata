Also, I can\u0027t switch between 1- or 2-symmetry with \u0027x\u0027 like I should, not until I have deleted the part I was trying to attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this something other people have encountered? Seems to happen every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: also happens with Wing connectors - basically anything added to the girder segments of the subassembly will do the same thing. The part you manually add doesn\u0027t flicker, only the other one added by the 2-symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-24T10:43:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2014 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Progressm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T03:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I know what you\u0027re talking about. Attachment in the SPH is kinda a mess. I belive the reason you\u0027re seeing the flickering is because the parts actually are clipping due to symmetry weirdness.

I\u0027ve had this where whole sections have doubled up on top of each other. I think I just started again as I couldn\u0027t unattach the root part anymore (complete mess). I did launch for a laugh and ended up with half my craft buried at a 90degree angle in the runway, when the physics kicked in my plane just rained out of the earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Progressm","CreatedById":80659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T21:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh - in short, looks like switching between the assembly rooms really stuffs up symmetry, as stated above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does work to an extent though, is tricking the game into allowing 4-symmetry in SPH by first attaching say tail fins with 2-symmetry, then flicking the whole plane on its side and attach another pair of tail fins - turn plane back and voila, 4-symmetry tail done. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It does bug out sometimes, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
