I just cannot seem to ever get myself to much into Kerbal without having a reason to visit places other than bragging rights. I tried playing the campaign, but at this point there is not much to it. I heard there is a mod that adds Kethane or something like that into the game which sounds fun, as having to setup resource mining stations at various places to refuel, etc would definitely add a big layer to the game for me. However I am unable to find it on the Kerbal mod store, or anything like that. Thanks for any mod suggestions that may fit into what I am looking for!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T02:18:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane and Interstellar are two that I can think of as adding stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-8-4-Find-it-mine-it-burn-it!-Now-w-Toolbar-Critical-bug-fixed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-8-4-Find-it-mine-it-burn-it!-Now-w-Toolbar-Critical-bug-fixed\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-23-KSP-Interstellar-(Tweakables-New-ISRU-Preecoolers)-Version-0-9-2-(Beta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-23-KSP-Interstellar-(Tweakables-New-ISRU-Preecoolers)-Version-0-9-2-(Beta\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaGicBush","CreatedById":71139,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T02:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKethane and Interstellar are two that I can think of as adding stuff like that.\u003Cp\u003EKethane: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-8-4-Find-it-mine-it-burn-it!-Now-w-Toolbar-Critical-bug-fixed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-8-4-Find-it-mine-it-burn-it!-Now-w-Toolbar-Critical-bug-fixed\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-23-KSP-Interstellar-(Tweakables-New-ISRU-Preecoolers)-Version-0-9-2-(Beta\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-23-KSP-Interstellar-(Tweakables-New-ISRU-Preecoolers)-Version-0-9-2-(Beta\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright thanks for some reason I didn\u0027t see it on the KSP mod store, but I guess it\u0027s just on the forums at the moment.

Interstellar, in my opinion at least, is ever so slightly OP. Power transmitting and some of those engines just make everything too easy. I would recommend EL once 3.8 comes out, because some awesome new textures are going in to replace the alpha-y current ones. Also, NearFuturePropulsion is very good. KSPX too. And maybe station science.
