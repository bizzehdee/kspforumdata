We here at Evitt Industries like explosions and booms, so there is no guarantee that your kerbals will not die.![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Please do not trust your whole space programs budget on one of these.\n\nThe first one we have for you is the E001 Aircruiser. This is actually pretty stable, however pitching up is very sluggish. Seriously, don\u0027t fly this thing at mountains.\n\nThe next one is the E003 Aircruiser. It has only two engines, but by placing the engines on the tail we have made it less sluggish when you try to pull up. At least, that is what we hoped. It still doesn\u0027t pull up well. The next one, the E004, is very similar. The only change is that we lowered the engines to improve the pitch axis.\n\nIf the first ones weren\u0027t unstable enough, just wait for the later ones. The E005 Aircruiser was more of an experimental plane. And it did not pass the tests. Unfortunately, it would go off the runway and explode before it could take off. If anyone can fix this or tell me how to, I would be very grateful.\n\nThe E006 Aircruiser has the same problem as the E005. It runs off the runway and explodes before it takes off. This experimental private jet caused a lot of troubles and drained my space programs budget in career mode. Again, if you could fix this (or any of the other ones) I would be very grateful.\n\nThe E007 aircruiser may be slightly insane. It is just a bigger version of the E005, with a lot more engines. Engines are basically the tools engineers use to make bricks fly! This one *also* runs off the runway. I have no idea what causes that. Please, *please* tell me how to fix it.\n\nThe E008 Aircruiser was a logical step forward. By centering the engines, the plane is less sluggish. But that\u0027s not the case. This plane just explodes.\n\nThe final one, the E009, was intended to be supersonic. However, I\u0027ve never flown it that fast. Be very careful with it.\n\nEDIT: Here is a working picture album on imgur:![SS0UL#10](http://imgur.com/a/SS0UL#10) To open, right click on it and select open in new tab. From right to left, they are E001, E002, E003, E004, E005, E006, E006, E007, E008, E009, E009.\n\nStuff You Need To See\n\nI would love it if you guys could help me fix these aircraft. But until then, I take no liability for the loss of kerbals. Be careful.\n\nHere is the download link:[https://www./folder/eoczidcce4wwd/Aircruisers](https://www./folder/eoczidcce4wwd/Aircruisers) Tell me if there is a problem with the link or the photos.\n\n -Alexonaut\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T15:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alexonaut**\n  \nThe photos are not showing up."},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:31:31Z","Content":"You need to use the full url for your images when using img tags.

There are several programs you can use to upload photos on the internet, I\u0027d recommend looking them up on google and picking which one is best for you. Alternatively, if you have a steam account, you could upload them as artwork there, or just take the screenshots using Steam\u0027s screenshot key."}]}
