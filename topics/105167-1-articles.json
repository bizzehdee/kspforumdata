I want to make it clear that I find just simply sticking a K on to words is completely absurd, and often sounds completely ridiculous. Imagine if you will, kadding a \u0022K\u0022 onto kwords. This is simply krap. It doesnt make a kounce of sense and sounds kawful.\n\nHowever, I believe it can be done successfully. Take, for example, Kethane. I think (and as far as I know) the Kethane name is based off of Methane, and replacing the M with a K sounds perfectly reasonable. The word just sounds good, as does Karbonite, as they\u0027re both made up words.\n\nSo why is it unreasonable to change some words, such as Kosmonaut, Kosmos, Kapsule, or other words and putting a K in front? I like the way it looks, and the sound doesn\u0027t change at all.\n\nI believe it\u0027s cool to use in moderation. What do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T16:36:03Z","Content":"First, Kosmos is already a word, which brings up my first point. Adding k to words, besides sounding ridiculous, misinforms people as to what you are really talking about. In your previous thread we have someone who thought Kolniya was a real thing because the game uses it, blind to the fact that it is actually molniya and had to look it up to see what it really meant. The game shouldn\u0027t be deliberately spreading misinformation as facts. I can tolerate when a word that had a meaning related to Earth is changed to mean kerbin instead but when you deliberately change a word just for the sake of changing it you are hurting yourself and everyone who has to read it."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:07:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m not a big fan personally and in general I don\u0027t think that k-words sound that much more kerbal, apart from the obvious exceptions like Kerbol or Kerbin.
