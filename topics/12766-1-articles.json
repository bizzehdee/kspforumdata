Put your satellite at \u002B180, \u002B60, or -60 phase degrees, on the orbit of your smaller body. Easy. L3 wouldn\\\u0027t be slightly outside the orbit like it should, but it\\\u0027d be very close. Added bonus: these orbits are completely stable in the 2-body problem -\u0026gt; no station keeping!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the L1 and L2 points. It requires tweaking the game code a bit. This tweak would only work with tidally locked satellites, like Kerbin-Mun and MAYBE Kerbin-Minmus. Tidally locked satellites still rotate relative to the background of stars, and that means, absent a larger body nearby, you could put an artificial satellite in a synchronous orbit around them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you see where I\\\u0027m going? Synchronous orbit = spacecraft doesn\\\u0027t move relative to the surface. Tidally locked = parent planet doesn\\\u0027t move relative to the surface. Put a spacecraft in a synchronous orbit of the Mun, right at the surface point where Kerbin is ALSO directly overhead. From the Mun\\\u0027s view, the spacecraft and Kerbin are right in a line that never changes. Just like L1. Same deal on the other side of the Mun for L2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\\\u0027s a problem: according to the wiki \u003Ca href=\u0022http://184.154.141.114/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Mun\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe Mun\\\u0027s theoretical synchronous orbit\u003C/a\u003E is outside its SoI. So the tweak would be to extend the SoI to allow Mun synchronous orbits. The same tweak may or may not work with Minmus. It\\\u0027s less massive and rotates slower, so it\\\u0027s SoI may have to be MUCH larger for the tweak to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"illectro","CreatedById":763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T01:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry guys, but KSP does not have Lagrange points, system it uses does not allow for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, they aren\\\u0027t the perfectly stable points everyone thinks they are, you would sill need stationkeeping, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point#Stability\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echeck out the wikipedia page on them\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL4 \u0026amp; L5 are stable in the Kerbin system - for the l4 \u0026amp; L5 point to be stable the ratio of mass between the two bodies has to be greater than 24.96:1 - and the ratio of Kerbin - Mun satisfies this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, long term perturbations from minmus may disrupt this, I need to do some real maths....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
