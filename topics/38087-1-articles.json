This is because if you have to use a full tank when building the ship, the CoM is based on that, as are all the delta-V stats shown in things like Kerbal Engineer and MechJeb. Thus, if you have to have full tanks in the VAB/SPH, you can\u0027t tell where to put your center of lift, nor how to balance your RCS, nor how much delat-V you really need to lift the thing (without doing manual math). Also, if you need to lift a big cluster of empty tanks, the rocket that can do that might be crushed by the weight of the full tanks before they dump all their fuel on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpty tank mods overcome all these problems by having empty tanks in the VAB/SPH. Problem is, they add yet more parts to the list, making all parts that much harder to find. And at present, all empty tank mods use either stock or KW tanks and look just like them, so it\u0027s easy to grab the empty when you want the full version, and vice versa. TAC doesn\u0027t add any parts but doesn\u0027t work in the VAB/SPH, but is quite useful in many other ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, TAC could be made to work in the VAB/SPH. But until that happens, empty tank mods are useful enough to justify the clutter they create. HOWEVER, if you\u0027re going to make an empty tank mod, PLEASE retexture the tank models (or make new ones) so their icons are immediately obvious for what they are, to avoid the confusion caused by the look-alike mods already out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
