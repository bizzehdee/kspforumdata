Either way the game is stupendous and besides it taking a heavy toll on my PS4, with low framerates when I launch big rockets, I haven\u0027t experienced any game breaking bugs up until now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was clearing out some save files and I accidentally seem to have deleted the \u0022persistent\u0022 save file.

Career1). \u00A0Then when ever I complete a mission or am back at the KSP and select save, \u00A0I edit the name to Career 1 and overwrite it and that is always my fall back if I mess up a quick save. \u00A0The only other time I save is mid missions with the \u201Cquick save\u201D option. \u00A0Either way I suggest when doing a regular save to always name it and not use the file name\u00A0it defaults to. \u00A0That way I never accidentally delete the persistent or my actual quick saves. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if that made any sense. \u00A0I\u2019d have to load up the game and look at it to be more specific if I was too confusing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
