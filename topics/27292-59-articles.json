I realized this morning that my first M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar station, orbited yesterday at such great cost in time and effort, was orbiting retrograde. D\u0027oh! Well, kisht happens. Before addressing that issue, I emptied my kethane driller into my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbiting refinery station and converted the kethane to fuel and oxidizer. I then practiced making skill with targeted landings on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn by putting my now-empty and fully-refueled kethane driller back on the surface at a new deposit and began filling up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1342.photobucket.com/user/LameLefty/media/screenshot121_zpsf0dc1420.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o777/LameLefty/screenshot121_zpsf0dc1420.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot121_zpsf0dc1420.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1342.photobucket.com/user/LameLefty/media/screenshot124_zps0ee8fb6d.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o777/LameLefty/screenshot124_zps0ee8fb6d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot124_zps0ee8fb6d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then launched a three seat nuclear-powered rescue ship (with one seat left empty just in case) and rendezvoused with my retrograde-orbiting station.
