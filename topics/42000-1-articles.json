Enough parts will bring any CPU to its knees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor laptops there are a few things to keep in mind. One, is that you\u0027ll probably have a pretty crappy GPU, at these prices you\u0027ll never get anything really powerful. So you should take advantage of the terrain settings tweak described over in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u003C/a\u003E. That seems to be the only aspect of KSP that really hits the GPU hard; it\u0027s not noticeable on relatively powerful desktop GPUs, but it\u0027s pretty obvious on weaker GPUs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the other thing, is that no mobile CPU will get really good performance with high part-counts. That i5-3320M for instance, is somewhere in the same neighborhood as my i7-4650U (similar turboboost speed, and relatively close performance/clockspeed). And my CPU does alright, but it\u0027ll never get 60FPS with anything more than 75 or so parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the suggestion to go with dual core over quad core. It won\u0027t make a difference in performance, and those high end mobile parts are really expensive, as in $400-$600 just for the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy CPU performance thread doesn\u0027t have many results for mobile CPUs (feel free to download my rocket and add your own), but it should give you an idea of what I mean. None of the CPUs that I have data for get much above 20-30FPS, even when down to fewer than 150 parts.

I do tech support work. Back towards the end of January, I decided to pick up 8.
