Upon reaching the destination, fire the decouplers to shed the wings and off you go."},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:22:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But as soon as it docks, it goes right through the floor of the cargo bay.\n\u003E Any ways to prevent this?\n\nTry placing the docking ports on the top of the cargo bay so the rover \u0022hangs\u0022 from the top of the aircraft.\n\nThe rover is [probably] falling through the plane because you\u0027re relying on the plane\u0027s floor to hold it up. This won\u0027t work because the when the rover docks to the plane, they become one vessel, and vessels can\u0027t collide with themselves. hence, the wheels on the docked rover can\u0027t collide with the cargobay of the aircraft because the rover and aircraft are one vessel.\n\nBut You don\u0027t provide pics of the problem occuring, so that\u0027s all speculation"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:35:40Z","Content":"No, that\u0027s right on the spot Vagabond. I was just hoping there was a way to do it, since I\u0027d like to be able to deliver it, then pick it up again and haul it back for recovery. \n\nWhich is why I can\u0027t just attach wings on decouplers, since I\u0027ll need them again later. \n\nI guess I\u0027ll have to find a way to dock it with a ceiling port in the field."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:56:58Z","Content":"Quantum Struts should do the trick. You just have to make sure that they\u0027re pointing where they will reattach once the 2 ships dock. When you\u0027re in the VAB, you can see the lines where the struts will connect to whatever it\u0027s aimed towards.\n\nLike on my ship here:\n\n![QGHz9pI.png](http://i.imgur.com/QGHz9pI.png)\n\nWhen I dock the 2 ships together, the struts reattach from the transfer ship to the plane."},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:07:52Z","Content":"Maybe put retracted landing gear on, and then drive under the ceiling port and extend them so it lifts up onto the port.
