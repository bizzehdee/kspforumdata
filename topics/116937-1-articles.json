However, it has been a bit overshadowed by the much-higher-quality Near Future Propulsion. So I have concluded that there wasn\u0027t as much demand for an alternate VASIMR mod. So now, I ask you, the players, what do YOU want?\n\n**-Lander parts:** More bits and pieces to build landers. Low profile engines, legs, lander cans, staging mechanisms.\n\n**-Artifical Gravity Rings:** Nice big toruses for building interplanetary ships. Deployable and non-deployable.\n\n**-Probe Parts:** Nice big probe cores, Telescopes, Probe landers, and Rovers?\n\n**-New Solar Panel:** ![vZ91d8.gif](http://share.gifyoutube.com/vZ91d8.gif) might just start working on this one now. It would be pretty cool to have working.\n\nSo that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to put in the poll. Please, let me know if you have any other ideas.\n\nSmallFatFetus\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T02:18:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SmallFatFetus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T02:49:39Z","Content":"What about some satellite like Dawn, Ulysses, New Horizons ?"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T04:31:59Z","Content":"Hmmm, I don\u0027t know.
