(in some cases predicted trajectory will wobble by hundreds of kilometres if multiple gravity assists are involved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is caused by the fact that the trajectory prediction is made by using the currently active probe/pod COM, rather than the entire craft\u0027s COM. Any rotation or vibration in the craft will add ~0.01 to 0.1m/s to the probe\u0027s COM and alter the predicted trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to check is to get one of those \u0022wobble\u0022 orbits and let your craft rotate freely in one direction (SAS off). You will notice that the wobble will repeat itself with the same frequency as the craft\u0027s rotation. The wobble will also immediately stop if you warp 5x. If you unwarp back to physics the wobble will be a lot lower or completely gone. (either FP errors or inherent wobble of clipped/large part craft, these errors cause significantly lower wobble and are not considered in this report).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure if images would help here, I will try to create a twitch highlight showing the issue ASAP if required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggested fix is to calculate trajectory from the craft\u0027s COM rather than the control part\u0027s COM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ExJ.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T23:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems good.
