So far I\u0027ve had a mixed enjoyment and fusteration of the game but overall I\u0027ve really enjoyed it. I also visit an IRC fan chatroom by the name we6jbo-ircforge and I\u0027ve heard through the chatroom that there are plans to add multiplay to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to shed my own opinion on multiplayer in games that have sandbox elements. When Minecraft added multiplayer support to the game I tried it once and never again. To me, adding multiplayer to a game takes away ownership of all my creations and hands it to the server owner. When I leave the server, all my creations and my own stuff is instantly wiped from me. Even a game like Terraria where you keep your equipment has the same problem. Nothing can be built without it being given away. It\u0027s my opinion that games like Minecraft, Terraria and maybe even KSP needs to adopt a ownership system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure exactly how an ownership system could be implemented into a game but I have always liked Spore for being able to send multiple copies of the creations people built to the different worlds. In that regard, the content creator still retains their work and only a copy is made available to everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T23:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that not owning something personally is kind of a hard fact of multiplayer, which people either love or hate, rather than an actual issue. Minecraft is quite a good example. In a large, hundred-player server, creations tend to blend together, giving a general sense, rather than an individual one. Whether or not you would like this is simply preference. Of course, this is different with small servers between friends. Here, each person naturally can associate a creation with a specific owner, giving a sense of ownership that is recognised by both the creator and the viewers. It\u0027s this second type which KSP seems to be moving more towards, if only for the vast computing power needed to simulate hundreds of ships at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a Spore-esque system, I think the Spaceport is based around a similar idea - people can use other\u0027s creations, but the original still stands as is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T01:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022we6jbo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022we6jbo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure exactly how an ownership system could be implemented into a game but I have always liked Spore for being able to send multiple copies of the creations people built to the different worlds.

In the case of a collaborative build on Minecraft, the build still resides on the server and therefore is owned by the server owner. If the server owner gave you the server\u0027s map after you were done with the build then I\u0027d say that the ownership has switched.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T02:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot Kerbal Live Feed, Kerbal MultiPlayer (which is partly derived from KLF), working, synchronous multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55835-KMP-v0-1-5-0-0-23-wip-alpha\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55835-KMP-v0-1-5-0-0-23-wip-alpha\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T03:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you play with friends this should not be a problem.
