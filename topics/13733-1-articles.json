I\\\u0027m hoping everything can be found for free. PLEASE CORRECT MY UNDERSTANDING, but so far I think this is what is needed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Blender - for the actual modelling/texture of the parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Wordpad/text editor - for configuration file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\\\u0027ve seen some people writing C#, but i believe this is just if you want to write code for plugins? \u0026lt;----_IS THIS CORRECT????\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHAT ELSE IS NEEDED IF THIS IS NOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED? I JUST GRADUATED SCHOOL AND HAVE MORE TIME ON MY HANDS, AND THIS SEEMS TOO COOL TO PASS UP. CAN SOMEONE DESCRIBE HOW TO GO FROM START TO FINISH ON A PROJECT (just which software is needed and a typical development cycle)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dani-Sang","CreatedById":4234,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-06T10:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdea: Your Mind\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcepting: Pen and Paper (or wordpad)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModeling: Any 3D Program (blender is the free one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexturing: 3D Program to create UVmap and then a program like Photoshop to \u0027paint\u0027 it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImporting: Unity \u0026amp; Notepad.
