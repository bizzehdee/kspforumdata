I do use F5/9 during a flight, but I\u0027ve also been using the escape key then choosing save game to manually save, then typing in a name. I have done the manual saves before and after flights. I recently killed a bunch of tourists during a rocket flight and tried to load an old manually saved game. All of my old saves display the same mission reports with 52 completed/1 failed. This is correct only for the most recent saved game. The old saves do have different levels of funding, building upgrades, tech unlocks, but they all have the same mission reports from my most recent save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I do have 1 mod (chatterer), so maybe it is affecting mission report display?? I am using 64 bit Windows 8 via Steam running 32 bit KSP (I\u0027m assuming here.. I did not seek out 64 bit KSP, just accepted what Steam gave me, so it must be 32 bit, right?), build id = 00842 (downloaded 2 weeks ago). I have an I7 2.7 GHZ with 32 GB RAM and 2X SLI NVIDIA 770 graphics cards with 3 gig each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1) If I load an old save, are the mission reports of this failed mission affecting my game? Maybe I should just ignore the mission report that says I failed because it isn\u0027t hurting anything or did each of my saved games take a reputation/funds hit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2)Any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T23:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 11:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started a new game, and this keeps happening. Any old saves display the mission reports from my newest save. I did check and verify that I have the most up to date version of chatterer, so that\u0027s not it. Maybe someone could verify that this does or doesn\u0027t happen for them? One quick way to test: start a new game, do one mission and manually save the game. Do a second mission and manually save the game. Don\u0027t delete any mission reports. Then load the first save and see if it shows 1 or 2 completed missions?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T23:33:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
