I think that was a wise decision because to much realism takes away the fun. I would not like it to take different fuels in my rocket only because NERVA won\u0027t work with the default fuel, hell they would also need to introduce a lot of new fuel tanks only because of one engine??? Also did anybody of you guys have come into the mind that there are maybe players that are enjoying things how they are right now? Major features like advanced aerodynamics, re-entry fairnigs and so on maybe are realistic but seriously will they be fun? For some real life rocket engineers maybe they are but for a wide specrum of 08/15 people they probably are not. Also i do not see a point insisting so much on that stuff where there are perfectly legitimate mods that can modify your experience the way you want. There is a bunch of people out there enjoying KSP which are not on this forum and it is really unfair to speak for all of them by saying the community this and the community that. I have faith in the devs that they are trying everything for KSP to be an fun and enjoyable game (they have also an economical interest in that) but i have no faith and no understadnding for all the grumbler here trying to destroy that experience because they think they have to be on some impatient egoism trip getting all the stuff they want immediately and without further reconsideration. This is some very rude behaviour that i observe here. Life is like that, sometimes you can\u0027t get everything immediately and sometimes not at all. And KSP is far better then real life, you can have almost everything right now if u are accepting using mods or modifying it by yourself which is pretty easy too. I love this game for beeing so open to modding and tweaking but i would not love it at all anyone taking away that freedom from me or forcing me to make a mod later to revert to an earlier state. So my suggestion is also if such realism things like aeordynamics and deadly reentry are introduced in KSP please make them optional and switchable in the settings menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shizophrenic","CreatedById":107022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T12:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hawk_za\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hawk_za\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eawesome so far the below items are what i can find as the most requested features can we create a poll to see what the community wants most of all ill keep posting till i think i have everyone\u0027s wants on this one list\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E nice list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebefore someone starts saying anysthing. consider please: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould it fit in the Setting of game: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals are a more or less human like sentient lifeform.

Major features like advanced aerodynamics, re-entry fairnigs and so on maybe are realistic but seriously will they be fun?

Ask people who have played with FAR if they prefer that or stock. And I\u0027m not a real life rocket engineer, but I think FAR is immensely fun and a lot better than stock.

Yeah, if someone wants a specific thing, by all means, say \u0027there\u0027s a mod for that\u0027. But that cannot be the answer to everything, nor should it be. For a start, the game is 32 bit so installing really anything over 70 mods will make things unbearable (ATM and reduced texture packs can only do so much and are powerless against plugins) so eventually, at some point in the future, the answer to \u0027get a mod for that\u0027 will be \u0027I can\u0027t, I have no room\u0027 and they really don\u0027t. There are some things that SHOULD be stock. Off the top of my mind, Enhanced Navball. Harv has said it was supposed to be included in the stock game but for whatever reason, it still isn\u0027t. But that aside, there are things that the devs promised, like re-entry heating. That\u0027s been forgotten about and swept under the rug so the modders have to pick up the slack until Squad can catch up. I repeat - this is a feature that the devs said would be included in stock. The modders are just doing what Squad has failed to do i.e. deliver on their promises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gpisic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gpisic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd KSP is far better then real life, you can have almost everything right now if u are accepting using mods or modifying it by yourself which is pretty easy too.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee above. Yeah, I\u0027d like FAR, (an updated) B9, KW, DRE, Interstellar, EPL, Kethane, the inflatable habitat pod, Modular Kolonisation System, KAX, FASA, AIES, CoolRockets, EVE, Chatterer, TextureReplacer, HotRockets, Soundtrack Editor, DistantObjectEnhancer, AntennaeRange/RT2, Hullcam, RPM and oh wait, I ran out of memory 6 mods ago. And it\u0027ll stay that way until KSP becomes 64bit. I know it\u0027s out of Squad\u0027s hands and really depends on Unity, but still though.. you can\u0027t say you can have almost everything you want when in practice, you can\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gpisic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gpisic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo my suggestion is also if such realism things like aeordynamics and deadly reentry are introduced in KSP please make them optional and switchable in the settings menu.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I agree on.

You can kind of see it in the settings.cfg with crew respawn (permadeath) and using stock craft in sandbox, so I honestly hope it\u0027ll be fleshed out and expanded on in future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
