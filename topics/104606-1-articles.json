But I don\u0027t think I\u0027d ask for a draggy, dangly, snaky hose animation for when kerbals are connecting hoses. I think it would be sufficient (and not overly processor intensive) to implement a system where a kerbal on EVA touches point A on one ship and then touches point B on the other ship, and then a hose line is calculated between the two points (dropping down to the surface, snaking along with a bit of a wiggle, and connecting up to the other ship). The hose would be a static item once dropped into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBarring that, a straight-line ray hose would be OK, even though it looks silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd barring any of that, I\u0027d like the ability to right-click on tanks to refuel them with any ships that are closer than some maximum-allowed distance apart (and we can just imagine the hose connecting the ships, just like we imagine all of the lines that connect all our tanks and RCS tanks and Xenon tanks and docking ports on our current ships).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T21:04:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T18:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, we have KAS, I guess detachable fuel lines was never on Squads drawing board but thankfully KSP has a strong modding community that\u0027ll keep scratching those itches well into 1.1 and beyond \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and I split this off, best practice is to start a new thread, linking back to the old one, it prevents necroposting \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E necromoaning that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T18:54:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome sort of functionality like this would be great!
