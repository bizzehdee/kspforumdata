I normally hate posting a WIP because I tend to get super enthusiastic about a project and then never get around to actually finishing it.\u00A0I felt that I had to share this though. I see so many awesome controllers for this game and I always wanted done of my own.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI originally was working on a my own controller using a type of wood that was left over from when it was being used to make a child sized rocking chair. The wood turned out too thick to mount any switches or buttons to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone on here seems to have made, or at least started, their own controller and it always appeared to involve ordering custom printed circuit boards, CNC machining, 3D printing, and so on. I just don\u0027t have the access, or the financial means, to make that a reality, so I have had to go low budget.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter finally getting fed up with all of my components collecting dust, I decided to take a trip to the local Walmart. After a walk through of the store, I ended up buying craft popsicle sticks and wood glue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is actually turning out nice. The wood is pretty strong after you glue a brace to a row of sticks and let the glue dry completely. I also have access to a power drill and a Dremel drill that I managed to get my hands on when I attempted to make my own controller the first time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the pictures I have the LED lights that are going to be the annunciator lights on the panel. They are very bright and clear LEDs so you can\u0027t tell what color they are, so I had to label each of them at the\u00A0LED. This works out fine since you won\u0027t be able to see the writing after the entire enclosure is finished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still haven\u0027t figured out what to do for the face of the panel. I used to work on military aircraft and I really liked the black plastic covers that had the lettering for the annunciation cut away so that the light shows through the lettering. Since I think that takes some kind of laser cutting and that just isn\u0027t going to happen, I will have to figure something else out. Maybe marking out some transparent sheets meant for stencils and then cutting away with an Xacto knife.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am seriously thinking of just making the entire thing out of popsicle sticks. It turns out to be strong enough to work with after the glue dries, and it just makes me think it is something that would be found at the Kerbal Command Center in the early days of a career play through.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a last note, I wanted to post this because I want to show that a controller is possible on a budget. The housing for the controller doesn\u0027t need to be super expensive to turn out decent. Put that extra money into the lights, buttons, switches, potentiometers,\u00A0Arduino boards, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe code that makes it all work is the brilliance that is KSP Serial IO by zitronen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a side note, holes were drilled in the sticks\u00A0so the LED can poke through. Underneath that is a hole that the wiring is fed through.\u00A0It is all coiled up just to make it easier to store it all. I have the wiring cut in order to accommodate connecting it to the Arduino board for testing. I didn\u0027t want to make it a permanent arrangement, just in case, so the LEDs are sandwiched\u00A0together by two lengths of twist tie.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the lighting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the Custom Groups (CG) are blue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/Light is green\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGear/Brake is red\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel/Mono/Elec Cau (cautions) are yellow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe two open are just blank spots on the panel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel/Mono/Elec Warn and Overheat/Stage Lock are all red.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe layout was originally different so that is why Gear and Brake are in with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and Light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fW8DUsc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022694\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fW8DUsc.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ge7sMjc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022694\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ge7sMjc.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am currently working on gluing sticks together to give the lights individual compartments to avoid lighting up the wrong indication on the panel.

I ended up 3d printing a few frames for LCD panels, but the rest is wood and paint. I used a thin MDF that was a miscut in the local hardware store (no idea what that type of store is called in English), and some three layer plywood with a cheap aluminium corner reinforcements. If I was to redo the panels, I would have given them a thin layer of filler before the paint to smooth out the structure in the wood, it might get a better imitation of metal then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe individual panels are painted black so I can apply inkjet printed adhesive paper labels, with a bit of touch up with a black felt pen. This approach might work out for your annunciator as well, although there will be some light bleeding through the black printed paper. Personally, I intend to cover my annunciator with white paper and black letter, but i am very interested to see what you come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kungfufishstick","CreatedById":144240,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-16T01:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember looking at your project.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have the code set up for how I want it to work so the hard part is getting everything put together.

The hardware was pretty simple in the beginning, and you can build a controller in phases. Thus it is possible to play and develop at the same time, as your skills evolve. There are a ton of very knowledgeable coders around that can help you with any problem you might encounter on the software side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know you helped me when I first got into trying to code my own controller.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222768039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147720\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474486370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00223491\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tybot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, Tybot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m familiar with coding fundamentals, I\u0027m a web developer by trade\u00A0(more front end than back end).
