The POS as shown in the video is carrying 2 mini landers to plant the first flags and footprints on the Mun, and the micro-shuttle is hitching a ride so it can be used to recover the crew of another micro-shuttle which made the mistake of trying to go too far into a polar orbit and promptly ran out of fuel. \n\nWith the profit from both Kerbin and Mun space station contracts, plus that of the Mun flag contract, I should be able to recoup funds spent on launching the POS, upgrade the research facility, and likely continue building around it with a science lab and proper sized docking ports.\n\nDoing the TMI with junior ports was quite risky due to the possible degree of joint flexing between the ports. Thankfully I was able to use Kerbal Engineer to minimize thrust torque during the first big burn out of LKO.

The reason for my unemployment frustrations is the staffing firms bickering with the employers over their commission and other petty squabbles. I got sick of being kicked around and have family responsibilities they are expected to understand; the industry I\u0027m working in doesn\u0027t do a lot of direct hiring at the entry level thus I would \u0027remind\u0027 the recruiters their responsibility towards ensuring a stable income for me. Not their own commission.\n\nIt helped to get a perspective on the other side of the fence before I aired my dirty office politics; hiring managers are disappointed their HR staffing firms throw masses of applicants ill-suited for the job scope and expertise required!\n\nMy overseas friends residing in the US and UK are thankfully, really helpful understanding that frustration is related to anger and related to depression in some order or another. I used to study applied psychology in my spare time last year and I like to help people who are facing depression from relationship related issues as I used to have no end of problems with that in an earlier stage of life. \n\nSo that\u0027s how I\u0027ve been managing - talking about the problem, helping others with the same problem, with a different cause, and they in turn help me by reminding me optimism can be useful sometimes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-------------\n\nAnyhow back to the adventures in the small planet with little green astronauts: I\u0027ve been having an obsession with turboramjets lately. A Facebook acquantance of mine started learning the arcane arts of Blender and produced some custom parts for KSP lately, so I started looking at supersonic transport aircraft. Coincidentially in the real world, the Airbus patent for a Mach 4\u002B jet/rocket propelled airliner is a trending topic this week. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hgf7d8KfZdM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nBesides fitting in with my new workplace the other important thing this year is X-Com 2 scheduled for release this October. To which I paid homage to the truly excellent X-Com remakes from the past few years by seeing if the fat and stubby Skyranger can work in KSP. Despite a most humorous discussion in a KSP General Discussions thread over the obesity of this airframe, I had no issue at all borrowing a craft file from a KSP forumer, taking his design apart and re-engineering it over the course of a few hours, putting it back together into a Mach 3.5 capable intercontinental STOVL transport. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2qPggkdF10?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI could make it VTOL by cramming in a few more basic jet engines in the VTOL propulsion bays, but I wanted to illustrate VTOL is an expensive and wasteful capability when STOVL is much more reasonable - the more mass I expend in cramming in vertical propulsion, the less fuel and payload I can carry. And a Skyranger using conventional propulsion needs all the fuel it can carry racing across oceans to respond to extraterrestrial threats on a far off continent."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T16:18:59Z","Content":"Episode 4 of the Primitive Orbital Station series.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOoP9Gf_SLE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNext episode. half the station will be detached to serve as a mothership for Minmus exploration, while the lab module remains in Munar orbit permanently as a research outpost / orbital tanker."},{"CreatedByName":"Canberra Gaming","CreatedById":147308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T16:31:39Z","Content":"Wow some amazing work there man!

The names of the original crew on board the munar orbital laboratory complex were retained as \u0022Jeb\u0027s Contingent\u0022, while the crew that stayed back at KSP to develop future aerospace craft were all renamed after I took \u0022applications\u0022 for the kitten space program :3\n\n![OAS8JeT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OAS8JeT.jpg)\n\nWe ran into difficulties as I ended up with the majority of people becoming Engineers due to the hard-coded Kerbal jobs (jobs are assigned based on the hash of the names!) so I took some creative liberties with a handful of folk - changing male names to female names, or naming the characters after the English translation of a Celtic name for instance, ended up giving me a near equal mix of pilots, grease monkeys and boffins, which I was happy with since I could now tag people when I flew them out on missions! \u003C3\n\nYesterday night, Lemlur, chief of engineer and creator of awesome automotive wheels in the mod forum, piloted mission CCRV-4 atop the new R-8 rocket powered by a Twin Boar liquid booster at its core.

Lemlur overhauled the entire station power infrastructure using the magic of Kerbal Attachment System / KIS hopefully providing a temporary fix to the issue by cramming the lab full of solar panels plus cannabalizing spares from POS-1 and the Crewed Cargo Return Vehicle itself (CCRV).\n\n![3YubL6i.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3YubL6i.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"flamerboy67664","CreatedById":118380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T00:21:46Z","Content":"I am Alfonso Kerman.
