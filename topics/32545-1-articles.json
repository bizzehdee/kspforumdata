Was just wondering if there were any advantages to putting objects (comm sats, space stations, fuel depots, etc.) into geosynchronous orbits. I\u0027m getting ready to start a new save, which means setting up new comm sat relays (I use the RemoteTech mod) and building new space stations around Kerbin and Mun. Is there any reason to put these objects into gso or is it something that\u0027s just neat to do. For example, I believe a recalled the real ISS is in a gso around Earth. If it is, why is it so?

If you\u0027re not in GEO, then you have a tower, not an elevator. A 200km tower cannot work, for (at least) two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A construction material capable of supporting the weight of a 200km tower simply does not exist, and probably never will. It would have to be thousands of times larger than the largest thing we have ever built. It\u0027s simply impractical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reaching orbit is about speed, not altitude. If you go up 200km with 0 velocity, you fall down. If you want to get to orbit, you still need to accelerate to 25000km/h from the top of your tower. You have solved nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space elevator, as it\u0027s usually envisioned, must actually have its center of mass in GEO, which means that it must reach down 36000km over the equator, but it must also reach up several thousand more with a counterweight on the end. The counterweight reaching up must have the same mass as the cable reaching down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to use a very thin carbon nanotube fiber, which is the lightest and strongest material that we know of. You would need several tons of it on a reel to make up the first 36000km strand. You launch the reel to GEO, as well as a counterweight reel (which must have the same mass, but doesn\u0027t need to be carbon nanotube). You unreel the fiber down and the counterweight up, until the fiber reaches the ground, then you attach it to something solid. After this, you can start building your elevator by sending up climbers. Each climber carries more fiber strands, wrapped around the first one, until you\u0027ve built a solid cable. Then you can build 3 or 4 more adjacent cables for redundancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the idea, and it can only work from a GEO orbit. The only problem is that the longest carbon nanotubes that we have made in a lab are 1cm long, so the technology isn\u0027t ready yet. There are still a lot of details to be ironed out, like anchorage, station-keeping, static electricity, reliability, climber design and transit time. It actually takes quite a while to travel 36000km, even if the climbers are fast... However, as soon as we get the nanotubes figured out, the concept will be much more practical than a tower, a railgun, or some of the other wacky concepts out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T07:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t your assent \u0022pull\u0022 the orbital elevator out of orbit over time?

You can also adjust the counterweight on its own cable to compensate somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I find the Space Elevator a bit too ambitious, and the atmospheric part of the cable too problematic to be practical. I kind of prefer the \u0022orbital trapeze\u0022 concept. This is how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of having your space elevator in GEO, imagine a rotating version in LEO. Its Center of Mass would be, for example, on a circular 200x200km orbit, with two 100km long cables extended either way and rotating on its axis like a giant cartwheel. It doesn\u0027t have to be equatorial. The end of each cable comes down to an altitude of 100km, at a suborbital speed, where a suborbital spaceplane (something like the XCOR Lynx or SpaceShipOne) would catch it, or dock with it.
