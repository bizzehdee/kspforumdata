You can do this already with the ressource-window, so maybe it\u0027s not that complicated and add an icon in the app-bar to bring it back on display. The general information presented in this window is not this important (at east for myself), so I\u0027d like to use this space for other stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for listening\u003Cbr\u003E\nSnips\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
