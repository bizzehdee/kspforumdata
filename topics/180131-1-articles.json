Basically this is a turbofan engine that rather breaths whatever the ambient air is, and exhales faster air and irradiated superheated\u00A0liquid propellant. It would have about the same liquid fuel consumption as the largest stock jet engine, but its thrust would INCREASE with atmospheric density, making it the perfect jet engine for use on Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis concept could also be adapted to use monopropellant to drive the impeller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-27T21:13:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2018 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zosma Procyon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-27T22:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a number of mods that offer atomic turbine engines - Atomic Age (now adopted by LGG).
