This suggestion is simple, recolor the Swept Wings, Delta Deluxe Winglett, AV-R8 Winglet, and Standard canard to remove the grey accents and replace them with black accents. This would make them \u0022fit\u0022 with the new parts aesthetically.

This response would be up at the top of the suggestion and development discussion sub-forum as a sticky thread, SQUAD\u0027s response would also be on the thread itself. I think this would benefit both us and SQUAD, as they would see some minor things that while they might think are trivial we as a communtiy find important (much like the new voting system on the bug tracker which HarvestR himself said was immensely helpful) and we would have a formal way to impact the game. This system would have to be carefully implemented so it cannot be abused. I would also say this system should be limited to small things (such as the topic of this thread) and not large things (such as ideas for new planets). Any way just a thought.
