The game was running fine last night. When I started it up this morning, I loaded my saved game and was met with a barrage of \u0022Craft Loading Error\u0022s at the Space Center screen. The messages read \u0022[Craft name] was not loaded because it had the following parts missing: [part name]\u0022. I didn\u0027t read them carefully because at the time, I just thought it was some funny little indie game bug, nothing to be concerned about. There were a dozen or more of them. I closed them all out and went to the Tracking Station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of my ships were gone. I had about a dozen vehicles all around the solar system and none of them were showing up in the Tracking Station. Rockets, bases, space labs, everything gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I tried loading a vehicle in the VAB, all of my ships had ***Contains locked or invalid parts*** errors below their names.

The sticky in this forum will tell you how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what you describe is what happens when parts are removed from KSP\u0027s database of parts. Generally this happens when uninstalling mods, but you said you don\u0027t have any. Based on the \u0022parts missing\u0022 list, it looks like many your stock parts are missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas there anything else that you did or happened to your computer (or steam install) at the time? If it did, in fact, give those errors, then all of the craft are deleted from that save. I would not load up any more saves from that install till you figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I would make a copy of the entire KSP directory to keep whatever is left safe. After that, inside steam, you can right click on KSP and view the properties. There is a button to verify the game cache. Run that and hopefully it will repair any broken game files. It won\u0027t, however, recover your save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter it fixes the files, you can try loading up another save and see if it works. If so, restore any quicksaves you have from before they were eaten. (Hopefully you have a recent quicksave in there somewhere...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T01:22:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
