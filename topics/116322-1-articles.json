Any suggestions are very much appreciated.\n\nThis is the craft in question: \n\n![FUuJdau.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FUuJdau.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T19:22:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:16:55Z","Content":"The CG looks plenty low in that.

Maybe somehow changing the instant full wheel deflection to gradual application of steering could help?\n\nTheir aren\u0027t any torque wheels in there, and I have attitude control mapped to WASD and rover wheels to the arrow keys, so that shouldn\u0027t cause issues, but I\u0027ve tried your suggestion of having some torque and SAS and it does keep it stable in the air perfectly, which helps things a lot. It would be nice to find a more realistic solution though.\n\nThat brake bug explains why it tips forward on braking though, I\u0027d rather not add any more mods because my KSP crashes enough as it is though so I guess I\u0027ll just have to design to minimize the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:27:09Z","Content":"...First, remap your driving keys to something else than rotation keys.
