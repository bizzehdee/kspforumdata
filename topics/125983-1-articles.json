Space? Where\u0026#39;s the fun in that? As I push towards a Mach 1 capable hydrofoil I ended up with this little fatty...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a starting fuel load as in the craft file you can expect a seamless transition from boat to hydrofoil without any control inputs, a 66% power cruise speed of c. 73m/s and a top speed around the 120m/s mark. You can play with single notches of trim to see how you can affect the speed, typically I don\u0026#39;t trim more than one notch nose up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you take out or burn a bunch of fuel you will surpass 150m/s, you will probably want to experiment with nose down trim, but I\u0026#39;ve not yet seen it take off so we\u0026#39;re still good.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you fill the main tanks (ie those that aren\u0026#39;t disabled) you can see a 66% cruise speed of around 62m/s and an endurance of c. 35minutes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPassenger cabins for 144 Kerbals, plus 2 crew, each cabin\u0026#39;s upper hatches are accessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 toggles reverse thrust, and this thing stops on a dime. You can also use the air brakes that are built into the tail fins\u0026#39; controls, for finer braking. For low speed turning you\u0026#39;ll need to manually toggle the thrust reverser for the outboard engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n9 toggles the cockpit ladder\u003Cbr\u003E\n0 toggles the front ladder, if a Kerbal takes a swim.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNB: When putting her in the water, take it slow. Really slowly... Like 5m/s max. It\u0026#39;s a boat, not a sports car.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=3][URL=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/flipnascar/Pride-of-Veere---Hydrofoil.craft\u0022]Download via KerbalX[/URL][/SIZE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/5xBvGLx.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]mJ0OX[/imgur]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T16:21:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlipNascar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T03:08:51Z","Content":"\n144 Passengers you say?
