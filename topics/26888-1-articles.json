Volcanic activity would most likely be extensive on the moon but that could be positive for any lifeforms there. Tidal heating of the core which drives this volcanism could generate a powerful magnetic field which would help to protect life forms from the intense radiation that would be trapped in Jool\u0027s magnetosphere. Indeed, this radiation would probably be the greatest danger to life on Laythe though a wide range of values are plausible.

Laythe is physically impossible...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about Laythe that makes it physically impossible for it to naturally exist in our universe is its density, which is far greater than that of any known element. But most of the bodies in the Kerbol system suffer from this same problem, so apparently the universe the kerbals live in allows for a super-dense state of matter (perhaps some form of quark matter) and there is some of this in the cores of these overly-dense planets and moons. But given that super-dense state of matter, I don\u0027t see any problem with Laythe existing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETidal friction (because of interaction with Vall and Tylo and Jool) can keep it plenty warm. Also, being volcanic, there\u0027s no reason the atmosphere couldn\u0027t contain carbon dioxide to aid in a greenhouse effect. Although we don\u0027t see any active volcanoes, most of them could be under the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of Laythe\u0027s heating must come from the sun because there is enough difference between the poles and the lower latitudes for ice to form at the poles. And the rest of the planet being near the freezing point will allow temperatures to easily drop a little below freezing point at night, so any water that gets into the cracks in the surface rocks will break those suckers apart as it freezes...no wonder Laythe has all that sand at lower elevations. And if the oceans contain some ammonia as well as water, the freezing temperature of the oceans could be considerably below 0 degrees C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the atmosphere is a stretch at all. Laythe\u0027s surface gravity is five times greater than any of Jupiter\u0027s moons or Titan (because of that wonderful high-density core). I do think that the significant fraction of oxygen in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere means that there must be photosynthetic life in its seas (even if its just single-cell organisms) because the oxygen would be hard to explain otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for anyone saying that Laythe must be terribly radioactive due to Jool\u0027s radiation belts, I would like to point out that the interior of Jool can\u0027t be anything like the interior of our jovian planets... it\u0027s too small and has the wrong density (although its density is low enough that it could be made from physically possible elements -- a rocky object about the size of Venus covered with a very thick atmosphere would look right). And even if the developers decide they MUST give Jool a magnetic field, it certainly wouldn\u0027t have to be anything near as powerful as Jupiter\u0027s because Jool isn\u0027t anywhere near the size of even our smallest ice giant planets (Uranus and Neptune).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T10:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan we ignore the density thing?

Or did you just go hyperbolic when you read about density? Nowhere was I arguing against geothermal heating or volcanic activity or any of the attempts to stay as close to realistic physics as practical (such as game sticking to Newtonian mechanics, with the simplification that they only allow one body\u0027s gravity to affect your ship at a time, and all other bodies are on rails). In fact, I spoke in favor of all those realistic things. I love it! I was just saying that the only blatantly unphysical aspect of Laythe was its density, and you can get around that objection with the single supposition of a super-heavy state of matter, and then you can continue to work with Physics as we know it in this miniature solar system. The existence of super-dense matter is something that gets used in science fiction stories all the time (\u0022Its hull is solid neutronium! None of our weapons can harm it!\u0022) and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s way out in left field to suppose a quantum state of quarks could exist where they can form a stable lattice of macroscopic size, giving you material with the density of an atomic nucleus. And with that material (and you don\u0027t even need very big balls of the stuff) you can solve the density problem of the little planets and make a too-tiny star like Kerbol support thermonuclear fusion reactions (just like Arthur C. Clarke turned Jupiter into a star with lots of dense monoliths in its center). Give me the quark matter or neutronium or pion condensate or whatever you or the theoretical physicist of choice want to call it, and then I can go on with Physics as I know it to explain what I observe in the game. But if you just want to ignore what can see in the game (the masses and sizes, and therefore densities, of the bodies) and picture them as light fluffy objects, there are all sorts of physics violations going on. I wouldn\u0027t know how to calculate anything...and I calculate all sorts of stuff in this game to figure out what\u0027s going on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what Elder Scrolls is, and whether or not the authors of that game try to stick to realistic physics model, so I can\u0027t comment about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for communications between ships, as I understand it we will eventually get operating comm links (once the antennas and high gain dishes are more than just for show), and some people currently do use a mod that requires more realistic communications (or so I\u0027ve heard...I haven\u0027t used that mod myself). You may think it would suck to have more realistic communication limitations, but the players that use those mods happily impose those limitations on themselves because (I assume) the greater realism makes the game more challenging and fun to them. I\u0027d be quite happy if the communications setup, once implemented, incorporates light-speed limitations (when controlling a remote probe, for example). Currently I play the part of the pilots and computers that control the spacecraft, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027m doing anything to violate causality by knowing where other ships are when I plan my maneuvers (in most cases those positions could be extrapolated easily using Newtonian physics and a simple computer system).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IcarusBen","CreatedById":173604,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T19:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo Brotoro,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree short things: I agree with the density thing, mostly because the planets are quite small(Jool is the size of Earth), Elder Scrolls is a game about a magical realm(not very realistic) and finally, I think that communications should be a toggle-able thing in the options so you can alter the difficulty.
