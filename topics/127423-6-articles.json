MISSION SUCCESS!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dispatched SERAPHIM I to rescue him - this was early in my KSP days, and I was still building manned rescue vehicles. The SERAPHIM, being a \u0022heavy\u0022 rescue craft, had a hab pod and a 3-man command module. I was intending to send only one crew, but two more conspired to stow away. No big deal, I\u0027ve got room for four more, and this is just a one-man rescue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil SERAPHIM I crashed on the Mun, leaving me with four stranded Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSERAPHIM II was hastily designed, and designated a HARM (Heavy AUTOMATED Rescue Module). It landed very neatly, just a few meters from the original crash site...leaving it about 10Km from the wreckage of SERAPHIM I. Not a problem. I began to use their jump jets to ferry the three \u0022rescuers\u0022 over to the robot rescue...and by the third one, I got a little careless. Harlan Kerman was doing over 100ms when he caromed off the hull of SERAPHIM II and slammed into a cliff face, then plummeted into a crater. His body was never recovered. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust last night I had a another bad one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just started a new sandbox game, and decided to do one of my patented \u0022grip-it-and-rip-it\u0022 SSTO designs (try to throw together an SSTO by just eyeballing it, put it in a stable orbit, and then land safely back at the space center, without any testing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might sound pretty hard on the test pilot, but as long as you get her off the runway in one piece, you\u0027re probably in good shape even if it fails spectacularly, as long as you build in enough safety systems (as I learned on that first Mun landing, having the ABORT button get your command crew as far from the explody bits as possible is a very good idea).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway - the BANSHEE MK I was a huge success, right from the get-go. A little in-flight tweaking of the control surface settings and she was steady as a rock in atmospheric flight. (Well, maybe not ROCK steady, but disabling the secondary elevons helped keep her from shaking apart.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd she was FAST.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo fast, in fact, that soon she was shooting across the night sky like a comet. I made sure to bring up the heat indicators in KER. Climbing surface temperatures, but not critical. Jeb was balancing the increase in speed with thinner air of higher altitude, and grinning all the way...but I couldn\u0027t see him, because the heat gauges, had expanded my displays. Need to fiddle with that, can\u0027t be block-*KABOOM*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShip rocked by violent explosion. Jeb\u0027s portrait, gone. The BANSHEE was still stable and climbing, still sheathed in plasma. It took me a second to realize what had happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the events surrounding SERAPHIM I, I had taken to installing drone cores on all my rescue vehicles. That had lead to me installing cores on ALL of my ships to test them out, unmmaned, until they were (relatively) safe to fly. Out of habit, I had done the same thing with BANSHEE I, testing or no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently I\u0027d misjudged the acceleration potential of the BANSHEE, and while I was fiddling with my HUD, the Mk I cockpit had rapidly heated beyond 2400 degrees and...well...exploded. The BANSHEE is a solid little design though, because she shook a little, parts fell off, and she just kept climbing and accelerating, plowing though the atmosphere with her trusty drone core leading the way. She carried on to stable orbit, but I couldn\u0027t let poor Jeb go out like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reloaded, took her up again, solid orbit and re-entry. Well, okay...I maybe have left the autopilot on and hit the time acceleration while on my glide path back to the Space Center, and that \u003Cem\u003Emay \u003C/em\u003Ehave caused the back 2/3rds of the ship to break off (did I mention there was a wee bit of a shimmy from those control surfaces), but the remaining chutes deployed perfectly, and Jeb set her down gently on her two remaining wheels and the nose.
