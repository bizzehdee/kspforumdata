The refineries and converters have a certain physical size. The Kerbal pod has a certain physical size, as does the engine, which will be a large engine because you need to be able to lift off of Tylo. Even if you mount everything else radially, you end up with a craft of a certain minimum size that you cannot possibly reduce in any way, shape or form. This minimum size will already consume most of the length of your cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the fuel tank you need to mount has a certain physical size, which is determined by your ship\u0027s total dry mass and your engine Isp. Since you have a heavy mining vessel full of ore and fielding drills, tankage and converters for two different resource mods that needs to lift off of Tylo, by definition that means that your dry mass is high and your Isp is low. This makes the fuel tank physically large. You will simply run out of space in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make things work, either sacrifice some of your requirements, or allow a larger cargo bay. Of course, even with a larger cargo bay your vessel will be impractical, because it will be tall and heavy, and therefore likely to tip over unless you find a perfectly flat spot to land on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-05T08:15:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2015 08:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T08:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you added procedural parts it\u0027d provide cfgs for ISRU mods, so that would ease some of the tank size issues ( and you could also delete all the tanks from the mods too, if you\u0027re worried about memory usage ) - but why are you using Kethane AND Karbonite?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoilingOil","CreatedById":153076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T10:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith all that mass put together, that mining ship is going to be a small planet!
