Today I present my first tutorial on basic aircraft design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease read all of this post and watch the video as some things are not mentioned in the video that I forgot and I would like to apologize now for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things to remember when building a plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake sure to place the wings last.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEnsure the plane is not too heavy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPlace the Center of Lift (blue ball) just a hairs width behind the center of mass (yellow ball) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemember to place control surfaces on wings. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPlace landing gear beside or just behind the control surfaces.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one last thing I need to elaborate on... If the craft is having a hard time lifting off the ground you can use **** and Q or E to slightly change the angle of the wings. In the case of not wanting to lift off tilt the wings up with only one press of the button (I do not know the exact angle I am guessing it is 5 degrees) The problem you need to remember if using this method is the plane will have to be tilted down on the navball so it will fly level. If the navball says level and the wings are angled up the plane will have a tendency to fly upward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDD_z1fzAD0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo recorded by: myself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMusic by: Kevin MacLeod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are any points someone thinks I missed please mention and I will update this thread as required. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T10:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should probably make a point about symmetry and control surfaces have different effects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I recall correctly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying control surfaces in symmetry (like your wing surfaces) makes them elevators. i.e. they will act in harmony and provide climb/dive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying without symmetry makes them ailerons (acting in opposition, lets you roll)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why your design flown in the video doesn\u0027t quite roll smoothly but yaws slightly, as it is using a combo of the tail, vectoring and pod torque.
