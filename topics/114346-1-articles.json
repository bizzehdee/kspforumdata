SSTO has 9 rapiers and 4 ramjets. Before everything worked fine, but now, after activating engines on runway, game slows from 60 stable FPS to 1-2, while MET is flashing yellow. Even after I will disable the engines and stop the craft, FPS will not improve. I checked debug log, but no bad messages there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance you know why is this happening?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
