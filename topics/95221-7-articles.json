The DOE patch was a completely optional patch that should had only been installed if DOE was installed alongside CactEye. In hind sight, it wasn\u0027t the most elegant solution ever conceived for resolving the incompatibility between the two mods. But it worked. The reason why it would break every time DOE updated is because the DOE author is good enough to update the version numbers in his Visual Studio project, which migrates into the DLL file when Visual Studio compiles said DLL. The problem is, when the DOE patch is compiled, Visual Studio creates this hard dependency on the specific version of DOE. More than likely, there is a better solution to this, I just never had the time to really fiddle with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T18:01:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you much, good to know.
