The difference in price comes from differences in demand and from the fact that 3He is storable once you have it, while tritium decays. If there were a massive increase in demand due to sudden deployment of fusion reactors, the tritium supply would catch up with demand faster because tritium can be bred directly from lithium, while 3He is available only after the tritium decays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre-First Contract, it kind of made sense to have to produce your own tritium and 3He, because some of the missions you could do with fusion would use more fuel than has ever existed on Earth at one time. At least if the decay calculations were reliable enough that you could breed tritium and let it decay while you were doing other things. Now that we have Funds, the better way to handle known-but-extremely-rare isotopes is to give them a cost where it\u0027s possible to buy them, but manufacturing or mining them yourself is a good way to earn Funds for other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlos_rpg","CreatedById":116969,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T23:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sort of new to KSPI, and I\u0027m having a problem that I don\u0027t know if is a bug on the version, bug on my installation or is intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to start a Thermal Turbojet (atmospheric or air intake fuel mode) engine at EVE on a 70km circular orbit ( barelly at the end on the EVE atmosphere ) an it explode instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this right?

In a nutshell the rate of heat generated is direction proportional to the speed of the air entering the intakes. The faster you are going in relation to the air the faster heat is generated.

With no change in behaviour. The Moment i hit around 200-300 m/s on launch the thing simply explodes. And the first thing showing in the crashlog is always a structural failure between reactor and generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also did not matter if i launch it on a short rocket (between the rockets basically) or on a long \u0022normal\u0022 rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got a pointer what i can do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had similar issues on horizontal builds. I mounted a reactor on a ground vehicle to act as a mobile fuel processor and microwave transmitter dish. For some reason anything attached to one side of the reactor would simply \u0022slide\u0022 off as if it were lubricated and not attached at all. Adding struts (even super-reinforced strusts from the Kerbal Joint Reinforcement mod) didn\u0027t help; the stuff attached to the end would simply stretch out the struts like rubber. It\u0027s also worth noting that the stuff that \u0022falls off\u0022 behaves as if it is still connected to the ship, even in terms of camera focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it seems only stuff on one side of the reactor slides off... the other side seems to remain attached as normal. So if you can\u0027t solve your issue, a temporary workaround may be just to only connect things to one side of the reactor. Not ideal, but better than not having reactors at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-21T21:25:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2014 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Undecided\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sober667","CreatedById":116695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T21:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/wavefunctionp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/wavefunctionp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is a chat and wave working and testing new wersion if u wana ask about and maby suggest u are free to go\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Undecided","CreatedById":116984,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T21:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nightdagger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nightdagger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think his point is more that it seems pointless (and a waste of career mode funds) to play when we know that the next update is going to render every craft with Interstellar parts unusable.
