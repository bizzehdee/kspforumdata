It has two oceans, one big one called Marionia, one smaller one called Bradonia. There are of course many small lakes scattered around, and by lakes I mean like the \u0022Great Lakes\u0022 bordering between the US and Canada, except there many of these. Near Bradonia is a stone age race of creatures called Bradonians, peaceful, mostly agricultural economy, barter trade, not a token economy yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Marionia, there is a race called the Marionians, a totally different species. Marionia has lots of volcanoes around and many mineral deposits, and the Marionians are in the Bronze age. After eventually transferring into the Iron age by mining up the rich deposits of ores in the area, the Marionians stop exploring, knowing they have no reason to explore further. There are two classes. The Mining class, which are also dedicated to science, and the Farming class, which are dedicated to religion, and have been exploited by the Mining class by keeping them believing in superstitions, while they keep learning about science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, the Bradonians are learning more and more about the stars, and have entered a bronze age. Their studies of the heavens are done to permit exploration and navigation, as all children are taught to navigate by the stars. This is done as a duty, a job, a responsibility of the young people for the older people. The Bradonians explore further and further and eventually colonize one of the oasis-like regions near the large lakes. They go further and further, eventually finding Marionia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarionia during this time is not very much more technologically advanced, after all necessity is the mother of invention, and they have everything they need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they met, the better resources of the Marionians being traded to them caused the Bradonians to progress rapidly and begin to dominate the Marionians. The Marionians are oppressed, and eventually a war starts due to civil rights. Rocketry is developed at the end of this war, and Marionian countries Murico and Zoviat use rocketry in a space race driven by a cold war. The Zoviats put a satellite in space, the Muricons put a Marionian and Bradonian into space in a single spaceship, and didn\u0027t really care about their lives, killing countless astronauts in the pursuit of the goal, while conversely, the Zoviats were trying to put a single Marionian in space, one at a time, carefully, and thus lost the race into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, a nation called Mina joined the race with the goal of reaching the moon called Arwin. Their rocket looks like the Saturn V with shorter first and second stages and a longer third stage. This is because Zimron is smaller than Earth but Arwin is further away. After landing on Arwin, several missions in fact, a new power, called the \u0022Coalition of States\u0022 joins the race. They want to begin to exploit Arwin for it\u0027s resources, such as pumice stones \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(a joke my mom made)\u003C/span\u003E. The Minese scientists have found that mining Arwin could be devastating on a global scale, while the Coalition feels they are being oppressed. After a probe is launched to gather Arwinian samples to the Coalition, The Minese begin really working hard to prevent them. The Coalition won\u0027t budge, and thus a war is started. Other nations join this war, the Bradonians join the Coalition, the Marionians join the Minese. After a long war, the Coalition wins, and they end up depleting Zimron and most of Arwin\u0027s resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, a solar satellite has detected an asteroid of huge size on a collision orbit with Zimron within a few decades. No one knows how to deter the asteroid, so two fringe groups arise. One group, mostly Marionians, believe that this is God\u0027s judgement, that it is Judgement day. The other will go to any lengths to scour everything they can to build a generational colonial ship, even going as far as to melt down 3000 year old swords and other precious artifacts. A small group is designated to make sure that some artifacts remain, and are kept on the ship. Additionally, each ship has a designated historian whose job it is to make sure that everyone remembers the history of Zimron so they don\u0027t repeat the mistakes they have made.After 10 years, the ships are completed, and ships with both Marionians and Bradonians are sent out into the cosmos towards the likeliest destinations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen they were just out there floating around in space, if lucky they would eventually find a home. It\u0027d be a shame if the place were already inhabited. *hint*hint*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T01:04:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T22:23:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShould I change the name of this thread to \u0022We created a planet\u0022 ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T01:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould I change the name of this thread to \u0022We created a planet\u0022 ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We make planets with our imagination\u0022 would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, planets around white dwarves are most likely to be carbon planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich would make terrible living conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T11:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mom is a librarian, not a scientist.
