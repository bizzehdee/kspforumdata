I would like to add some more realism to several of the engines with Turbopump exhaust plumes, and thrust vectoring. I understand how to do it, but I may not be able to get it to the point of polish that I really want and still keep up with the other items I would like to model. If anyone has any interest in contributing, and has some knowledge of RealPlume and gimbaling plugins, I would love the help to be able to get this pack up to spec in a more reasonable amount of time. This won\u0027t stop these items from getting added eventually, you (perspective collaborator) might just be able to do it quicker and better than myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, if there is any other misc. items that anyone wants to contribute to the effort, I would appreciate the help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to the pack as it stands: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117844-Realism-Overhaul-Saab-s-Historical-Pack-Preview-Available\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117844-Realism-Overhaul-Saab-s-Historical-Pack-Preview-Available\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
