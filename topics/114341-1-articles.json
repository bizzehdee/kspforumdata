If it was a small lander, I could see it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T11:35:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mariohm1311**"},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T13:22:14Z","Content":"Anyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T13:23:55Z","Content":"I need a picture/diagram."},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T14:25:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I need a picture/diagram.\n\nSure:\n\n![lQ3dMDv.png](http://i.imgur.com/lQ3dMDv.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T15:09:08Z","Content":"Both SpaceY and KW Rocketry have conical cargo bays (petal bays), reminiscent of the LEM bay in the Apollo Saturn V. \n\nAre you talking about something like that, or more like an aircraft cargo bay that opens at the back, or a more aerodynamic version of the space shuttle bay?
