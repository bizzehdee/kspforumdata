The whole mission included 3 probes on different altitudes fitted with communications equipment and different science instruments and SCANsat sensors, so the landing part was just an afterthought. With nearly 4 minutes of signal delay introduced by the remote tech mod, I didn\u0027t think much of my chances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen everything else I could gather was done, it was time to try this. After a small deorbit burn, I instructed the probe to orient surface retrograde and burn for 1000m/s (all the fuel that was left) and throttled the engine to 0%. Then a few seconds later I instructed the probe to throttle engine to 10%, thinking there would be a 4 minute delay. Turns out there is no delay when you manually right-click an engine and adjust it\u0027s throttle. Manually adjusting the throttle in real-time would have made the landing trivial, if the probe was designed to land (centre of mass was off, and delta-v was short some 50m/s). It was the roughest landing I have ever done, hitting the ground 50-60 m/s and spinning wildly as I tried to burn the engine at 100% throttle every time the spinning probe pointed retrograde. Lost all of the solar panels, but by some miracle the extended communications antenna as well as all the science instruments survived - I think the spinning landing gear managed to absorb most of the shock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of this? Is it cheating to ignore the signal delay on throttle? Should there not be an automated landing protocol in a probe that is 4 light-minutes away? How would you balance landing a far-away probe so that it would be suitably challenging but not require excessive manual calculations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T12:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheating is a matter of perspective in single player games.
