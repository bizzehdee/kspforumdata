Prior to KSP I was all in on World of Tanks, but that feel off near the end of my wife\u0027s last pregnancy and the birth (IE I ended up not having ANY free time anymore). Then my brother-in-law last summer mentioned KSP as my youngest started being a better sleeper at night and I was hooked. I haven\u0027t gone back to WoT and I spend any gaming time with KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t as much time as I\u0027d like the last 5 or 6 weeks. Been doing a pretty major basement renovation, plus I hurt my back pretty badly about 3 weeks ago and sitting is not always the most comfortable thing (especially not having to actually go to work as much as possible and sit at a desk). I figure in 2 or 3 weeks I should be mostly healed up again and my basement renovation should be winding down a lot. So hopefully by the time the .20 patch comes out I\u0027ll be back to playing KSP 2-3 nights a week (usually 3-5hrs a night). Right now I am probably managing at most 1 night a week for 2-3hrs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do also occasionally play Star Craft 2 with my brother-in-law and father-in-law, but that isn\u0027t more than maybe one night a month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say so far I probably have slightly more time in on WoT. I\u0027d estimate I probably put in around 600hrs or so on WoT over the course of about a year. I\u0027ve probably only put in maybe 300-400hrs on KSP so far. The only other games I have put in nearly as much time in my life have probably been FFVII (I have played at least 7-9 times at a minimum of 30hrs each time and the longest game was just shy of 80hrs before I decided to stop doing side quests and beat the game) and maybe the Total War series if you count them collectively (Shogun, Medieval, Rome, Medieval 2, Imperial are the ones I have/have played and I\u0027ve probably put in at least 50-80hrs on each...except for Imperial, maybe only 25-30hrs in on that one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, scratch that. Back in the day in HS and College I might have put more time in on Counter Strike \u002B Day of Defeat (if you count them collectively, which I do). I probably played at least 2-3hrs 5 nights a week my Senior year in HS and Freshman year of college \u002B scattered playing of them my Junior year of HS and 2nd and 3rd years of college (not much by then.
