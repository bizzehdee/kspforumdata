16.5 tons\n\n![rPgoc0R.png](http://i.imgur.com/rPgoc0R.png)\n\nsince i posted the challenge i\u0027ve somewhat changed my design from the example, i haven\u0027t got round to giving it a name but i have taken off the chutes and top reaction wheel to save on weight. i originally wanted to parachute the drop tanks down a la the space shuttle boosters but gave up on that.\n\nhow did i launch it? i take off from the launch pad at full throttle and at maybe 100m up slightly tilt the prograde vector to the east then point the craft straight up again.\n\nafter the first drop tanks have... dropped, funnily enough, i tilt the craft over slowly so that it\u0027s about halfway to 45 degrees east when the tanks run out at hopefully 12 km up.\n\n![p8Jlpwy.png](http://i.imgur.com/p8Jlpwy.png)\n\nfor the next stage i continued thrusting towards the surface prograde vector till 18 km up when i switched to orbital mode and burned in the bottom of that prograde for a bit before just going for the centre.\n\n![hT2acbF.png](http://i.imgur.com/hT2acbF.png)\n\nthis got me to space with an Apoapsis of a bit over 80, i created a node and although the node read 16 seconds past experience has taught me that for some reason 7-8 hundred m/s delta v in this craft takes 12 seconds yet the prediction is always at 16 before i fire up the engine. i guess that that\u0027s a bug.\n\n![ObrgkAe.png](http://i.imgur.com/ObrgkAe.png)\n\nanyway i get into orbit with a suprising amount of fuel left.\n\n![0UPEnkR.png](http://i.imgur.com/0UPEnkR.png)\n\nso then i try to be all fancy and land at the KSC\n\n![ofuygEV.png](http://i.imgur.com/ofuygEV.png)\n\nyeaaaahNOPE, some batteries explode but they\u0027re neither crew or the engine so i\u0027m fine.\n\n![VDIdB4E.png](http://i.imgur.com/VDIdB4E.png)\n\nand i bring the ship down under 4 drogue chutes, one small paracute and some help from the engine.\n\n![YlBOLZQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/YlBOLZQ.png)\n\nas you can see it has splashed down intact sans batteries and with a little fuel left.\n\n![oLiAEw4.png](http://i.imgur.com/oLiAEw4.png)\n\nand that was my attempt. it\u0027s probably not the best way to go about this (as i hope the rest of you will prove) but seeing as it inspired this challenge and took all day i\u0027m sharing this with you anyway.\n\n[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3bAkbqjp8mGOWxTc2E2REVvMmM/view?usp=sharing) is the craft file.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T20:48:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mattihase**\n  \nembiggening title"},{"CreatedByName":"dewkiller72","CreatedById":120053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:39:39Z","Content":"Nice solar eclipce in picture 2 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alberto De Beni","CreatedById":98636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:39:49Z","Content":"14.2T without clamps, not the lightest possible, but i wanted to make it cool.\n\n![rmkYpPp.png](https://i.imgur.com/rmkYpPp.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aFSYrUUG_8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nOnly 3 parts out of 18 are discarded, all the rest is recoverable \n\nDownload:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0a8psdvcf7z7oi/S_E_T_O_.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0a8psdvcf7z7oi/S_E_T_O_.craft?dl=0)\n\nAction groups 1: decouple main fuel tank\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T11:26:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alberto De Beni**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSpaceKenguin","CreatedById":146594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T02:20:58Z","Content":"Can I use mechjeb?
