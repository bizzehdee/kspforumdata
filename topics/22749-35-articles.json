Remember though that Dragon is half the size of the ATV in both pressurized volume and in weight capacity. NASA selected the ATV and Cygnus to be lightweight, high frequency vehicles that allowed for lower cost, more frequent replenishment of the station with more fresh items and also allow for shorter duration experiments to be conducted and even returned (in the case of Dragon) since the loss of the STS program has meant that any experiments could not return to Earth, greatly limiting what could be done onboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T20:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EATV just took it\u0027s second to last flight though, so when that\u0027s done, all they have is Cygnus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harharluke","CreatedById":36547,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T21:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems an ISS module has sneaked itself into the pack \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T22:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo it\u0027s there because it\u0027s actually the TKS_FGB, but it\u0027s named ISS_TKS_FGB.
