What actually happened was I was in the middle of an Eloo mission, returning to the \u0022mothership\u0022 in LEO with the lander from the surface, and upon entering physics range and getting close to the main craft, the main craft exploded and seemed to come off the rails\u00A0in the most fantastic-ly horrible up-close\u00A0way. (\u003Cem\u003EEdit\u003C/em\u003E-forgot about this part) The camera then broke away from the craft and began to move through the planet Eloo and came out the other side.

I did not make a backup of my 1.1.3 main save. I ran the game and loaded the most recent save at the time, which was a quick save of when the landing craft touched down on Eloo\u0027s surface,\u00A0but chose to just play around a bit with jets for a few days and not do/check on anything else while mods were getting updated. My memory is fuzzy on whether or not I remember seeing my one and only station in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (altitude at 240km, named \u003Cem\u003ESS2\u003C/em\u003E) at the time. 2 day ago from writhing this I went to the orbital map view in the tracking station and was unnerved to find my first station around Kerbin, SS2, gone. Luckily I don\u0027t think I had\u00A0any kerbals on the station, or a ship docked to it, but it was large, and an important fuel depot that had actually did have 2 very small \u0022tug\u0022 probes for moving around orange jumbo tanks for refueling.\u00A0Here is a picture of it, it looks like a giant cross but in this photo has 2 large interplanetary\u00A0ships connected to it in this instance; I\u00A0don\u0027t have a better screen shot of just the station:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/318999100688266840/7F512B3EDB3A6E489C86B1A546336E2AC666C8CB/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/318999100688266840/7F512B3EDB3A6E489C86B1A546336E2AC666C8CB/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional Details:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCurrently I am running only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, MJ2, and Atmos Traj.
