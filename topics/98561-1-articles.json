Figure I\u0027ll let you know a few things I noticed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErin doesn\u0027t match up with the texture. There doesn\u0027t seem to be large patches of dry land like the texture seems to say there should be. Instead the entire planet is riddled with snake like veins of land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPock doesn\u0027t seem to have a working color map in normal view. Just has colors of minmus. Looks like Pock in map mode though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThud could probably use some tweaking with the height map. I haven\u0027t checked the original PlanetFactory in a while, but in this version the map view looks a hell of a lot cooler than the actual planet is. I suspect the heightmap just needs harder lines edge for the craters. Right now they transition way too smooth to really be as noticeable as they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAblate, as stated above by someone, doesn\u0027t really look like it should. This is likely going to be the hardest planet to get right due to the unique shape it has, but it will be worth it if it can be done right. Also the PFOffset mod you tried to use isn\u0027t a valid PQS, it\u0027s a custom wrapper by Krag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInaccessable could probably use a bit more \u0022squishing\u0022 to make it seem more like the original. I think your main issue here is the fact you\u0027ve tried to copy Krag and use PQSMod_PFObate which isn\u0027t actually a valid PQS mod. The PF stands for Planetfactory and it\u0027s a custom wrapper that Krag added, which I\u0027v mentioned above as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few other notes, I\u0027v noticed you\u0027ve left most of the other PQS mods active that were copied over from the templates such as the PQS citys and noise mods. It\u0027s probably a good idea to disable any that you aren\u0027t actually using. As for getting around the PF mods that krag used such as oblate and offset, I think you might have to use the vertexheightoblate and offset mods (could have the name wrong, but it\u0027s something along those lines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Looks like Thud has same issue in default PF. I\u0027m wondering if it wouldn\u0027t be better to make those types of craters with seperate map decals. Also I noticed Accension doesn\u0027t look anything like what it should either. The other thing you\u0027re missing is Voronoi craters for most of the planets. You might have issue getting those to work though. Took a look at PF source, the PFOblate and PFOffset are actually custom PQS mods, so they may not be possible to do in Kopernicus quite yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T04:21:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Borisbee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JID00Gaming","CreatedById":134914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T19:31:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENext update will fix most bugs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Do you think you will release this update?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Borisbee","CreatedById":91794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T09:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Augustus, try adding the follow PQS mod to Inaccessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\t\tPQSMod_VertexHeightOblate\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\theight = 1300\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tpow = 10\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tsphere = Inaccessable (PQS)\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tmodEnabled = True\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\torder = 100\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tParent = Inaccessable\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should give it a more squished appearance so the middle sticks out a bit more like the original.
