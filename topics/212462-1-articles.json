I\u0027m now building a Saturn V analogue and each stage is it\u0027s own assembly, at the moment you can\u0027t change the body for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E calculated but Mun gravity is about a 6th of Kerbin so it can be easily reckoned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou build all the stages separately and stack them as desired for launch. It\u0027s a much more flexible idea than subassemblies. I\u0027m not sure if you can import an assembly in to a different workspace, but that would be the icing. This is a well thoguht out redesign given thought from the ground up. Very impressive.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople review bombing this game really haven\u0027t given it a chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
