Of course you could probably set that number based on the difficulty or turn off the option completely. This would especially be cool on ironman mode games as you have to keep every kerbal you\u0027ve got safe or else game over when you run out! I think it\u0027s a cool idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T04:07:03Z","Content":"How many people want to be astronauts and have the required credidentiales? A few thousand. Now kerbals probably don\u0027t have rigourious entry requirements.

Those who are \u0027accidently smashed\u0027 can be replaced with the rescured ones. I don\u0027t think this could be hard. Of course, if you can have as much scientists as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T10:13:29Z","Content":"This actually would make rescuing mission quite valuable, as that allow you to get more kerbals to launch away."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T10:23:29Z","Content":"But this way, it will become impossible runs many missions together, or build bases off-world...
