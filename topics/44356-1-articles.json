Take one of the 1 to 4 adapters and flip it upside down. Next, cut it into 5 parts, one in the middle with a single node on the bottom and four around the sides, each with a single node on top. The side parts connect to the center part with the same style of non-node attachments as struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they can be angled or use interlocking shapes (if that makes a difference in KSP physics) to resist coming apart under thrust, that\u0027d be even better. Hold your left hand palm up, fingers curled up. That\u0027s the center part. Hold your right hand palm down and hook your fingers over your left hand\u0027s fingers as one of the side parts. Upward thrust on the center locks it to the side part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is an adapter like this would have to be assembled in the VAB, or loaded with the subassembly mod, but it wouldn\u0027t violate the tree structure, same as sticking things to the bottom of a 1-to-n adapter then connecting them with struts doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T05:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou would still have the problem that without docking ports you\u0027re not allowed to have branches in the tree structure come together, they can only branch further, so while it would appear to work, it really wouldn\u0027t do any more than flipping the multicoupler over. It would only be attached at one point and the rest would just happen to be in the same place, without being attached, like putting the tips of your fingers together, there\u0027s nothing to keep them from coming apart again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T06:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParts hanging off the bottom of a multi adapter can be connected with struts, so can more parts hanging from those parts.
