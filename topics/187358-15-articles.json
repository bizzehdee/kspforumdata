How do you solve the problem of time warp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you can come up with some kind of warp-by-consensus system. Time warp only occurs once everyone agrees to it. This would be dreadful for obvious reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps a five day time warp takes place on the hour every hour. Thus you have around 55 minutes to perform launches and manuevers before getting back\u00A0into a stable orbit or landed position.\u00A0This would be a real bummer if you got caught by the time warp while you\u0027re in the middle of flying a plane or something, but any such problem could be planned around. Presumably any manuevers you had arranged for orbital burns during the five day warp\u00A0would be executed automatically by whatever automation the game will include. Even with all this, you would have to waste enormous amounts of time waiting, especially if you make a trip to\u00A0some of the more distant planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you\u00A0create a separate instance of the universe for each player. Everyone controls time warp for themselves, therefore everyone sees the planets in a different alignment. This allows you to have full control over things like quicksaves and the revert button.\u00A0In spite of this, other player\u0027s creations still appear if they\u0027re in a stable orbit or landed on a planet.

I\u0027m trying to say that in the scenario you described, there being\u00A0 zero ability to get physical in the midst of dispute and conflict over resources is an artificial restriction of an entire dimension of who we are. It will fundamentally flatten what can be done when interacting with lots of players. As far as what we know about KSP 2, chances are the multiplayer won\u0027t even support enough players in one game for factions and trading disputes to even develop. In which case any weapons or guidance systems modders may develop will be as much toys as the thruster tool in Garry\u0027s mod is. So there\u0027s either limited multiplayer, where weapons are a silly mechanic to reach for when trying to have fun and screw around with your friends, or there\u0027s expansive multiplayer, in which case you\u0027ll have to literally put serverwide bans on high speed ship collision if you don\u0027t want violence to arise. People are violent animals. Whether you want them to or not, they\u0027ll find a way to kill you with a sepratron unless you specifically bar it from gameplay.

Being a big spaceflight nut is a rare enough interest that I really don\u0027t share it with any of my real life close friends. A few of my friends have said they\u0027ll buy KSP 2 when it comes out to play with me because they know how much I get out of KSP 1, but the truth is that I know they\u0027re not going to stick with it like I have to KSP 1 and so I\u0027ll have to reach out to find people to play with. And at that point, it\u0027s the more the merrier. I would totally love to join a vibrant server with like 35 people tooling around three solar systems. And having some sort of communication system with like one voice chat channel per system or something would be perfect for that. It would be great to meet people that way. But with KSP 2 as it\u0027s looking like it\u0027ll turn out, I guess I\u0027ll just have to join a discord server or something. But how cool would it be to be able to meet other people through the game?
