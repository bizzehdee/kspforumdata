Then, a while later, you make another release branch (in our case v5, at this point you might have v4.3.1 in full release), and any fixes to v4 you merge first to v5, then to master.

The menus are a bit hard to understand, but it\u0027s something to get used to if I plan on using this mod. I read on another thread you wanted to use this mod and the cormorant aeronology parts to create a sts. As soon as Pak updates his mod (there are some part discrepancies that effect flight dynamics and the OMS pod seems to fuse with the body of the ship making it non select-able) I will push out sts trials on this as soon as possible. I need to know what parts you would like tested with an STS, let me know.\u00A0I absolutely love the SRB sep module, why hasn\u0027t anyone thought of that one besides you guys?

The ones you have work well and set up great. The integrated cam on the lander module is another awesome feature. I will continue further testing on engine systems and other parts and let you know if I run into any snags, but so far so good, things are working well and looking awesome for just a development mod, which could go live right now and no one would complain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest asset you guys have is the fact that you are active in keeping the people who play ksp apprised of your progress.

While doing this we tag prereleases from it, in order to deploy them to our testing servers - in your case you could have separate pre-release publishing channels (a pre-release KerbalStuff mod instance, for example, would also allow CKAN to have a separate line of releases and pre-releases).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce a release is made from a release branch (let\u0027s say we release v4.0.12 - i.e. first production release of v4, 13th tagged build; v4.0.0 through v4.0.12 were pre-releases) by pushing it to the full-release KerbalStuff instance, you can then still do pre-releases if you want, but patches can just as easily be added to the release version. Then, a while later, you make another release branch (in our case v5, at this point you might have v4.3.1 in full release), and any fixes to v4 you merge first to v5, then to master. Then once you release v5, you can let the v4 branch slide into the grave and forget about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething similar to this approach might enable you to have your separation of pre- and full-releases, with a little care to how to use KerbalStuff/CKAN etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGit / branching -- I\u0027ve only ever ran into problems with git\u0027s branch management.\u00A0 More precisely its inability to cleanly merge disparate branches without necessitating manual conflict resolution.\u00A0 If I ever have to manually resolve a conflict, git has failed in its purpose, and has become more of a burden than the utility that it offers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, my current (private/unlisted) dev setup is not too far off from what you are describing; only I end up manually merging changes from disparate branches (e.g. change made in 2.04 branch that is not in master, but needs applied to 2.05 branch; I end up manually merging it into master (by copying files...), and from there doing a proper upstream merge to the 2.05 branch -- the problem is this leaves the 2.04 branch \u0027out of synch\u0027 with master / unresolvable).\u00A0 \u0026lt;--- this is my main problem with git branch management;\u00A0 how do you merge -just one change/commit- back into master from a sub-branch, using the Git-GUI tools?\u00A0 (I don\u0027t want -all- the changes from the dev branch, but just a very particular subset).\u00A0 I will certainly admit that my \u0027skills\u0027 using git are, perhaps lacking in a couple areas; but really... should I need to take classes / read 100 page manuals just to use a \u0027productivity enhancement tool\u0027?\u00A0 (would rather spend that time learning new programming concepts, new libraries, or new APIs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I need is not multiple-branch management, what I need is a separation of release and development threads / forums / posts / downloads.\u00A0 If I offer a \u0027stable\u0027 and a \u0027dev\u0027 download on the same page, I guarantee some kid is going to download the dev one by mistake, and start moaning about why Y is broken/why X has no texture/why Z is unavailable.\u00A0 And the biggest part of this that I need is the ability to just pack/release the dev stuff instead of spending all night testing it; but as long as there isn\u0027t a \u0027stable\u0027 release, I have to do at least some minimal amount of pre-release testing (you would be surprised how much I actually catch/fix during this period; silly bugs that you guys never have to even see/deal with).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding branch management / git use in general - it -can- be a great tool.\u00A0 For example for last-nights \u0027bugfix\u0027, I was able to start a new branch, revert to a previous commit (from master), do the codeside fixes for the Modular Upper Stage, pack it all up, and then un-revert and merge in the new \u0027fixes\u0027 to the master branch.\u00A0 Whole ordeal took maybe 10-15 minutes.\u00A0 What took the rest of the night was doing testing and fixing up on the changed solar panel stuff (which I probably should have just reverted and saved for the weekend) (apparently, for some reason, Unity-animations don\u0027t update in the same tick as which they are \u0027played\u0027 (could actually be a bug in my animation control module); so I had to invent a workaround to get the solar-panel default \u0027extended\u0027 orientation that didn\u0027t involve relying on the animation state being alterable and query-able).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, thanks for the suggestion and info, certainly one of the more intelligent/informative/helpful posts that I\u0027ve come across, and I likely will change up a bit of my workflow to help clean up a few of these issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
