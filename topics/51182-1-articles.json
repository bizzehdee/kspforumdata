I was wondering, is Duna\u0027s gravity and atmosphere so strong you just need parachutes and no boosters? Also, how do I get to Duna from Kerbin? Would rendezvousing fuel and boosters be necessary to get to Duna? I don\u0027t need a rover design, I just need an idea of how much fuel I need, but a rocket design would be nice. Do the probe and rover need to have a shielding mechanism on the bottom?

Chutes help but plan to land on thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You get to Duna by burning when it\u0027s about 45 degrees ahead of Kerbin in their respective orbits. It takes about 1,060 m/s of delta-V for an optimal transfer burn and then about 370 m/s of delta-V for an optimal aerobraking maneuver (around 12.5k above Duna\u0027s surface). Launch from Duna is 1380 m/s of delta-V. Planetary gravity is 2.94 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, about a third of Kerbin\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Rendezvousing the payload with a dedicated transfer module is not strictly necessary, though many people do this.

My lander did come in a bit too fast so had to kill some speed with the engines but as it wasnt that heavy the chutes did get it to the surface.
