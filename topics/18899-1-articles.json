The problem I have been running into is when I get into orbit with the sun and wait to reach my Apoasis, there is some force stopping me from pointing my ship in the opposite direction I am traveling. Sometimes if I manage to fight it enough to hit that direction, it goes past and throws my ship into a frenzied circle eventually ripping it apart, with no rockets on at all. Even with the small air thrusters to aid in turning, no rockets or anything to propel me, I cannot face that way, as if some force prevents me. I do not see what the hell could be effecting the direction I drift that far into space and it is rather frustrating. If anyone has some insight on what issue I may be running into help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pablock","CreatedById":12497,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T11:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are experiencing is an old issue known a \u0022Deep Space Kraken\u0022, caused by imprecissions in the physics engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fixed for next release, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/entry.php/12-Krakensbane\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eyou can read the official explanation here \u003C/a\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigomidis","CreatedById":31969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T15:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe that Kraken is going to be toasted in the next release at last our battle is coming to an end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T16:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it is right now, the Kraken can strike at any time.
