Some people think it\u0027s common and/or recommended to do the two-step process. I don\u0027t yet see what is the advantage of doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Some say it\u0027s better to do just one burn. My intuition also says to do just one burn. (I also learned about the \u0022Oberth Effect\u0022 from this thread (thanks!) which may have been the source of this intuition. That said, I took a class in orbital mechanics 20 years ago. It\u0027s probably buried in here somewhere.) Apparently you can save a lot of fuel this way, so why would anyone do two major burns (one in the SOI and one out)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tada","CreatedById":57283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T22:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, problem is, that you cannot do very precise burn from directly from Kerbin orbit, so light corection burns when in transition are way to go I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T22:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne burn is always more efficient due to the Oberth effect. One burn is also substantially harder to pull off without fancy calculations and autopilots. Two burns is much easier, it doesn\u0027t require precise launch and arrival windows, and it allows it to be taken more like a rendezvous than a transfer. Two burns does sacrifice the boost from the Oberth effect, which makes it more delta-v costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther reasoning stems from the fact that the Oberth effect is difficult to understand.

Of course one must always do minor mid-course corrections \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXaiier: Yes, I don\u0027t have a feeling for the Oberth effect yet...haven\u0027t internalized it, can\u0027t explain it. That bugs me. I agree, \u0022one-burn\u0022 interplanetary hops are hard to do well. There are webpages that give launch window times and angles that help A TON...I doubt I could do it without that help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is fairly easy to setup a maneuver node in advance, knowing exactly when to start firing the engines and which way to point are both difficult. I find my burns take longer than the planning tools accommodate for, so I\u0027m pointed more in an outward / away direction than I should. So frequently just after a major burn from Kerbin I must do a multiple 100 m/s delta V burn in an \u0022inward\u0022 direction (toward the target planet). If I wait even longer, the corrective delta V gets much bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess the answer is, getting away from Kerbin makes the second burn easier, while escaping from Kerbin in the approximately correct direction is also easy. It just (in my experience) may cost you 500-1000 m/s delta v that way. That must be the price users are willing to pay for an easier sequence of burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-16T23:18:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2014 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MajorThomas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
