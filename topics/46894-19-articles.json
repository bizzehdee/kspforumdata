I have 32 bit Windows XP and theoretically 4 GB rams but afaik 32 XP doesn\u0027t support more then 3.smth RAM memory. I have just enabled PAE but idk if it really works. This is my first mode so i think it shouldn\u0027t be too much to handle. Thanks I have already thought about downloading reduced pack but haven\u0027t really thought about lowering textures resolution. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goozeman","CreatedById":68303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T14:00:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know this kinda goes against the whole Kerbal mantra of \u0022MOAR POWAR,\u0022 but is there a smaller 1.25m engine in the works? I find that the Vesta is massive overkill for some upper stages and even the LV-909 can be too much of a good thing. Something along the lines of the 48-7S but in a 1.25m package would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
