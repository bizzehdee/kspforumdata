I had a Sentinel satellite out there FOREVER in the right orbit and I could only get 11/15 mapped (this mapping mission was for Kerbin-threatening asteroids in an orbit around the Sun).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was orbiting the Sun with Duna behind me and Kerbin in front of me. When I clicked on the Sentinel unit itself, and turned off/turned back on tracking, it said something about \u0022tracking objects near Duna\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a whim, I decided to get closer to Kerbin in my orbit thinking \u0022maybe I\u0027m too close to Duna?\u0022--eyeballing the map from above, it looked like I *was* a little closer to Duna than Kerbin. I burned prograde to drop my orbit inside of Kerbin\u0027s to \u0022catch up\u0022 and within just a few moments I saw messages \u0022tracked 12/15, 13/15, etc.\u0022 pop up at the top of the screen. Within 10 seconds I got to 15/15 and the parameter completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, my orbit was off so I time accelerated to Periapsis and put my orbit back where it belonged. This was unnecessary as the orbit part of the mission basically already counted itself as complete and lo and behold, the *entire mission* was already complete!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory is, I was sitting in the same spot for a long time with no new asteroids, so changing my orbit was like going fishing for more asteroids and I caught a bunch really quickly. Give it a try, can\u0027t hurt--as long as your Sentinel sat is well-stocked with fuel of course! The prograde burn to drop my orbit from 14mm to 13mm from the Sun cost about 350 m/s of\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
