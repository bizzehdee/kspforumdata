I know there was an old sketch of a Kerboneer Plaque made back in 2014 which is yet to be made into an add-on, though it could be added as a flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002246569\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9985601798\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/21666-kerbal-space-programs-pioneer-plaque/\u0026amp;tab=comments\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=287437\u0026amp;embedComment=287437\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-287437\u0022 style=\u0022height:264px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same could be done for a potential Golden Record mod, having it be just a flag to add to your mission. However,\u00A0I think it would be even better if it were playable on the mission. Basically, if you played the item, then you could have a custom soundtrack for your game. If you want to listen to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDark Side of the Moon\u003C/em\u003E, you can do it. If you like to listen to Vocaloid, you can do it. If you want to listen to the actual contents of the real-life Golden Record, you can do it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
