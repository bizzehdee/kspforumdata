I would also say to remember a) this instrument would mostly belong on probes, so the characters probably aren\u0027t interacting with it - that\u0027s what crew reports are for. So things like referencing Jeb doesn\u0027t really work, especially because we don\u0027t know whether Jeb is there, or even alive, depending on the player.
