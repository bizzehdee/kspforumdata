I added a log in MM so modder know if someone is playing x64 or x86. Now you added something that remove it. So now I can\u0027t trust any log I get and someone managed to send me a x64 log without telling me. I got better thing to do than debug a KSP Win x64.\n\u003E So congratualation you got me in a really bad mood. So now I will make sure any MM on Win x64 KSP will not EVER work again.\n\nEven though I was not the person who did this (I don\u0027t even use the unfixer), I apologize on their behalf. It\u0027s very sad that the actions of this individual (or more) have caused this, because it affects all 64-bit users. I knew going into 64-bit I wouldn\u0027t receive support and I have not bothered any modders since switching, especially since I use too many mods to recreate the bugs in 32-bit."},{"CreatedByName":"Lumaan","CreatedById":120286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T01:34:19Z","Content":"@jrodriguez - Please don\u0027t unfix what ever sarbian is doing to MM (same goes to other that might think to unfix it), let\u0027s just end the unofficial 64bit KSP here and just be happy to have had fun while it lastet \\*or move to Linux 64bit\\*, and then wait with 64bit until Squad feels 64bit is ready for official release."},{"CreatedByName":"Youen","CreatedById":116909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T09:11:45Z","Content":"My *personal* opinion is that jrodriguez is doing nothing wrong (except removing the log thing, but that wasn\u0027t on purpose obviously). He wants to use mods, that are open source, on a different version of KSP, that\u0027s his right. It\u0027s also his right to distribute the thing so that others can do the same. Wether win 64 is worth playing or not is a matter of taste.\n\nNow, I also understand some modders are tired to get bug reports that have nothing to do with their work. Probably like Microsoft employees are probably tired to get bug reports of other Windows applications that have nothing to do with Windows bugs, web developers are tired to get internet explorer bug reports, and so on. The problem is that *some* users are not able to read, understand, and apply simple instructions (not necessarily there fault either, computer science is complicated, most people don\u0027t know what \u002264 bits\u0022 even means, and think they\u0027ll get better performance or other silly ideas). It\u0027s written everywhere, where win 64 related stuff is distributed, that \u0022mod bugs\u0022 must be reproduced on 32 bits before posting. So if someone should be angry, in my opinion, it should be solely against these users that report bugs on the wrong forum thread. And even then, that\u0027s a whole part of software development to sort out which bug reports have to be discarded or not.\n\nThere it was, just stating my opinion, please no-one take anything personnaly, because it isn\u0027t. Makes me a bit sad to see a clash here, because I only see dedicated and generous people in the KSP modding community :-)\n\nAlso, I would kindly suggest to jrodriguez to add a clear (and very visible) statement on the OP to not report \u0022mod bugs\u0022 found on unfixed versions of KSP (unless that\u0027s already the case when using the tool, I haven\u0027t tested it).

I\u0027m not trying to start or spark or an argument!

Now some will say that is exactly the point. Common sense is not at all common. To be harassed with bug reports that are completely unavoidable due to the 64bit build, will get absolutely frustrating as hell.

As the game progressed, the available space for Mods became smaller and smaller. The buggy 64 bit version, finally released all that great ram space. Then they shut it back down. ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif) I have spent most of my time squeezing and cutting every bit of space I could get, only to have my game screwed up so badly it was crashing and failing more than my play time. Then another patch or update and I would have to start all over again. Since finding this AWESOME THREAD, I am finally enjoying KSP the way I like to play. Most of the people that have found this Thread, don\u0027t complain, or bug report at all, so thrashing the guy that helped a lot of people get back into enjoying KSP again, doesn\u0027t seem like a very fair response, all in all considered. \n\nSorry about the long post, I just wanted to back this guy up and give huge thanks, because I had no idea how to do what he did. Maybe in the middle I could offer a bit of a user friendly perspective to all you great Mod Creators. Thanks for all your hard work, as I have said many times, its thanks to you guys I keep playing.

I could only see the benefit of it being less hassle to not implement the lock outs. But that\u0027s just a ridiculous statement. Its a much better route to lock them out from the Mod creators perspective. I was simply trying to say its not fair to criticize the OP for trying to implement something for the users. That was all. I try and stay neutral on most subjects and support the Mod Creators the best I can. I cant say I feel your pain, but I understand the hassle it is to work with the public, and more so, you guys do it for free and get ragged on. I again just like this workaround because I can finally play with all my fav mods again. I will NEVER complain to a mod creator about the functionality within 64 bit, and I try damn hard not to complain at all. I still do, but I was a thread starter for the donations rules, and within months a huge percentage of Mod Creators had donation tabs. This is not trying to pat my own back, its just to relay that I genuinely support both sides the best I can.
