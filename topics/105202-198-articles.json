The KPBS have one recycler that uses water and more EC, but reduces by 81%, rated for 1 Kerbal. The default \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS one reduces by 60%, also for only one Kerbal.  \n\nIf a have a base for **3 Kerbals**, I got the same duration with **81% x 3**, or **81% x 1 \u002B 60% x 3.** I really liked that!
