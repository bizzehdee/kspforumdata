I docked two truss-sections (both with a pair of solar panels) together, using bicouplers like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/njzizmH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022njzizmH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the alignment is not perfect, which results in a difference at the tips of the panels of 0.5m, which is realy annoying. Both docking ports have the \u0022decouple\u0022 option, meaning they are properly attached, but it still looks like this: (the other pair is perfect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FHmUjiW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FHmUjiW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to undock and redock it, but i never got it straight.

The game allows for some error in docking port alignment during docking, the magnetism may improve the alignment but once it\u0027s close enough the game will just declare parts docked and freeze their relative position in space whatever it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T14:55:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used 3 docking ports, 4 also worked, dunno how concerned you are with your part count but thats my 2cent solution\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T15:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JimmyAgent007\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JimmyAgent007\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI used 3 docking ports, 4 also worked, dunno how concerned you are with your part count but thats my 2cent solution\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that more dockingports dont look that good, also the partcount is allready to high (look at the panels from b9)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
