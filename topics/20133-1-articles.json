When the destination at Moho is below the solar plane, what\u0027s the best way to transfer there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a circular orbit, it\u0027s easy to think of plane changes as \u0022twisting\u0022 around a line from the craft to the planet\u0027s center of mass, and the same happens in an elliptical orbit: If I add some \u0022North\u0022 component to my ejection velocity at Kerbin (the apoapsis of my transfer orbit), then the plane of the transfer orbit will be inclined through the Kerbin-Sun line: the craft makes a rising arc above the solar plane as it falls towards Moho, but the periapsis will just be back on the solar plane again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I could look for a launch opportunity when Kerbin is lined up with Moho\u0027s ascending/descending nodes and do that. But let\u0027s say I launch 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, the Kerbin-Moho transfer apoapsis needs to end up really far north of Kerbin, in order to get aligned with Moho\u0027s orbital plane. I\u0027m guessing this requires more than one impulse?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T04:19:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by LambdaCactus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuantumFlux","CreatedById":32058,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T05:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as your initial burn point is not aligned with the ascending/descending node you will most likely need at least two burns, yea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T17:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Moho as an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wait until Kerbin is on the exact opposite side of the Sun to Moho\u0027s apoapsis. I then launch and perform my injection burn, bringing my solar periapsis down to that of Moho\u0027s Ap. Once that is done my solar Ap is usually slightly in front of Kerbin, so I warp to that point. I then burn either north or south to give my orbit basically the same inclination (barring the fact that my Pe may well be above/below Moho\u0027s Ap). Then exactly half-way between my Ap and Pe I burn either north or south again to ensure my Pe matches with Moho\u0027s Ap. You\u0027re then in the same inclination as Moho. You\u0027ll probably then have to burn again at Pe, either retrograde or prograde to change your orbital period, thus allowing you to catch up or be caught up by Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it\u0027s not the most fuel efficient way of getting there, and takes longer than a direct injection (as you\u0027ll make two solar orbits) but I find it the easiest way to get there using only the Mk1 Eyeball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you can understand my method, as I find it rather hard to concisely describe in writing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/wjHWY#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egallery link\u003C/a\u003E that may help explain it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I know you requested the most efficient transfer but unfortunately my grasp of the maths involved isn\u0027t good enough.
