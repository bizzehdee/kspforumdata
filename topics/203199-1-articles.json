Again, intellect tells us that the coffee is going to be hot, common sense tells us that if we get it on our skin it could very well burn us to an extreme. Anybody who has ever drank coffee should know this.

It could also be said that McDonald\u0027s, a huge corporation with an army of lawyers and analysts behind the scenes, should be even smarter and reduce situations that reportedly lead to hundreds of serious burns per year. In any legal system and economic framework, it\u0027s smart, common-sense, and completely foreseeable that people will work within that system.

There\u0027s nothing irresponsible about being old or wearing cotton, and neither the woman nor McDonald\u0027s are to blame for that, but they combined to make the burns much worse than a typical coffee burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that perplexes me about the case, although I\u0027m not interested enough to research it myself, is that the coffee spilled while the woman was removing the lid to put in cream and sugar. McDonald\u0027s and every other drive-through already handles that part when I order. Did she ask to do it herself, or did McDonald\u0027s get her coffee order incorrect and set up the situation that required her to remove the lid, or maybe things were done differently when the case happening 30 years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-23T03:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223993140\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203199\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624391948\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the lack of common sense, I will say it\u0027s more purposeful ignorance.
