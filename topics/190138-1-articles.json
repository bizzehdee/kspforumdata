usually filled with some kind of pressurant (even pump-fed engines need pressure in the tanks, just not as much as pressure-fed engines).\u00A0 This can be bad if the pressurant winds up near the rear/bottom of the tank, where there should be propellant, when your engine needs fuel (or oxidizer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say you launch a basic sounding rocket, like a WAC Corporal (1948 technology here, hang onto your hat).\u00A0 This is a primitive two-stage rocket, with a high thrust Tiny Tim booster (originally an air-to-ground unguided rocket from WWII).\u00A0 Your basic WAC Corporal stack will pull something like 30 G off the launch pad with this booster -- but the booster burns out after about 0.6 seconds, leaving you falling upward at roundly 200 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you now want to stage and ignite your (pressure fed, hypergolic liquids) upper stage sustainer, you\u0027ll find it doesn\u0027t work.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EEVER\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Because the air drag at 200 m/s results in enough deceleration to immediately slosh all the propellants to the nose cone end of the tanks, and the nitrogen that\u0027s supposed to push the aniline/furfuryl fuel and red fuming nitric acid oxidizer into the thrust chamber instead runs straight out through the injectors.\u00A0 This is why ullage has to be managed.\u00A0 The WAC Corporal method, as of 1948, was to ignite the upper stage at the same time as the Tiny Tim, and time the staging decoupler to fire at the exact same time the Tiny Tim burned out.\u00A0 That gave the sustainer engine most of a second to come up to thrust, and ensured the booster wasn\u0027t hanging on creating drag that could (even with the sustainer fully ignited) lead to pressurant in the feed lines instead of propellants.\u00A0 Done this way, the WAC Corporal worked about 95% of the time, and would fly as high as about 120 km (less if it was carrying a payload, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s hot staging.\u00A0 As Signo noted, the Soviet space program used hot staging a lot -- it\u0027s the reason you see many of their rockets with open strutwork interstage structures, so that the next stage exhaust has an exit to prevent either choking the engine before it\u0027s fully ignited, or blowing out the interstage fairing with potential to lead to a structural collapse as maximum G load.\u00A0 By contrast, the American space program almost never used it (can\u0027t say for certain they never did, but I think that\u0027s true).\u00A0 Look at a Saturn V -- specifically at the base of the S-II second stage.\u00A0 It has (relatively) small solid propellant \u0022ullage rockets\u0022 -- there to ensure there\u0027s a (small) positive acceleration after the staging event, so the ignition of the next stage can take place successfully.\u00A0 And there are no ullage rockets on the Service Module, because it was intended to fly in vacuum and needed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to point before a burn anyway, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E works just fine for ullage management.\u00A0 I think there are even Apollo recordings where the crew mentions the ullage burn start, several seconds before the burn to return from Lunar orbit to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUllage can be managed other ways, of course.\u00A0 One way (used often for things like attitude jets/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and long-term station keeping thrusters) is a bladder tank.\u00A0 This stores the fuel (usually a monopropellant, most commonly hydrazine or a derivative these days) inside a bladder, much like a water balloon inside the rigid tank structure; pressure is applied to the outside of the bladder, and the inside is carefully debubbled before launch, so that \u003Cem\u003Eevery time\u003C/em\u003E you open the valve, the propellant flows into the catalyst pack and turns into thrust.\u00A0 In the case of Voyager 2, even if the last time was \u003Cem\u003Ethirty years ago\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re launching from the ground (even if that \u0022ground\u0022 is Lunar regolith), gravity (even if it\u0027s a fraction of a G) does an admirable job of managing your ullage.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s actually been done in a rocket, but another possibility would be an aerospace version of what I learned to call a \u0022clunk tank\u0022 when I was flying radio control models (before they were electric).\u00A0 This had the fuel pickup in a weight on the end of a flexible tube which would always find its way (with an audible \u0022clunk\u0022 if you checked it on the ground with the engine stopped) to the current \u0022bottom\u0022 of the tank.\u00A0 Works great when (as with an aerobatic model) you aren\u0027t sure where you local gravity will be any given moment; won\u0027t work any better than a fixed pickup in microgravity (so probably not very useful in actual rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IkranMakto","CreatedById":198477,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-03T06:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223712660\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190138\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221575327849\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103766\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Signo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Signo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn IRL example Is the soviet N1 Moon rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and almost every soviet rocket too ;}\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-03T08:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP there is also another variant of hot-staging that isn\u0027t used in real life for reasons that should be obvious.

ullage.\u00A0 It\u0027s manifestly unnecessary in the stock game -- stock engines and tanks don\u0027t care about ullage in any way.\u00A0 If you\u0027re playing Realism Overhaul, or pretty much anything using RealFuels and real world engine parts packs, you\u0027ll need to pay attention to ullage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s ullage?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad you asked.\u00A0 Ullage is the \u0022empty space\u0022 in a propellant tank.\u00A0 There\u0027s always some; usually filled with some kind of pressurant (even pump-fed engines need pressure in the tanks, just not as much as pressure-fed engines).\u00A0 This can be bad if the pressurant winds up near the rear/bottom of the tank, where there should be propellant, when your engine needs fuel (or oxidizer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say you launch a basic sounding rocket, like a WAC Corporal (1948 technology here, hang onto your hat).\u00A0 This is a primitive two-stage rocket, with a high thrust Tiny Tim booster (originally an air-to-ground unguided rocket from WWII).\u00A0 Your basic WAC Corporal stack will pull something like 30 G off the launch pad with this booster -- but the booster burns out after about 0.6 seconds, leaving you falling upward at roundly 200 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you now want to stage and ignite your (pressure fed, hypergolic liquids) upper stage sustainer, you\u0027ll find it doesn\u0027t work.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EEVER\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Because the air drag at 200 m/s results in enough deceleration to immediately slosh all the propellants to the nose cone end of the tanks, and the nitrogen that\u0027s supposed to push the aniline/furfuryl fuel and red fuming nitric acid oxidizer into the thrust chamber instead runs straight out through the injectors.\u00A0 This is why ullage has to be managed.\u00A0 The WAC Corporal method, as of 1948, was to ignite the upper stage at the same time as the Tiny Tim, and time the staging decoupler to fire at the exact same time the Tiny Tim burned out.\u00A0 That gave the sustainer engine most of a second to come up to thrust, and ensured the booster wasn\u0027t hanging on creating drag that could (even with the sustainer fully ignited) lead to pressurant in the feed lines instead of propellants.\u00A0 Done this way, the WAC Corporal worked about 95% of the time, and would fly as high as about 120 km (less if it was carrying a payload, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s hot staging.\u00A0 As Signo noted, the Soviet space program used hot staging a lot -- it\u0027s the reason you see many of their rockets with open strutwork interstage structures, so that the next stage exhaust has an exit to prevent either choking the engine before it\u0027s fully ignited, or blowing out the interstage fairing with potential to lead to a structural collapse as maximum G load.\u00A0 By contrast, the American space program almost never used it (can\u0027t say for certain they never did, but I think that\u0027s true).\u00A0 Look at a Saturn V -- specifically at the base of the S-II second stage.\u00A0 It has (relatively) small solid propellant \u0022ullage rockets\u0022 -- there to ensure there\u0027s a (small) positive acceleration after the staging event, so the ignition of the next stage can take place successfully.\u00A0 And there are no ullage rockets on the Service Module, because it was intended to fly in vacuum and needed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to point before a burn anyway, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E works just fine for ullage management.\u00A0 I think there are even Apollo recordings where the crew mentions the ullage burn start, several seconds before the burn to return from Lunar orbit to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUllage can be managed other ways, of course.\u00A0 One way (used often for things like attitude jets/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and long-term station keeping thrusters) is a bladder tank.\u00A0 This stores the fuel (usually a monopropellant, most commonly hydrazine or a derivative these days) inside a bladder, much like a water balloon inside the rigid tank structure; pressure is applied to the outside of the bladder, and the inside is carefully debubbled before launch, so that \u003Cem\u003Eevery time\u003C/em\u003E you open the valve, the propellant flows into the catalyst pack and turns into thrust.\u00A0 In the case of Voyager 2, even if the last time was \u003Cem\u003Ethirty years ago\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re launching from the ground (even if that \u0022ground\u0022 is Lunar regolith), gravity (even if it\u0027s a fraction of a G) does an admirable job of managing your ullage.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s actually been done in a rocket, but another possibility would be an aerospace version of what I learned to call a \u0022clunk tank\u0022 when I was flying radio control models (before they were electric).\u00A0 This had the fuel pickup in a weight on the end of a flexible tube which would always find its way (with an audible \u0022clunk\u0022 if you checked it on the ground with the engine stopped) to the current \u0022bottom\u0022 of the tank.\u00A0 Works great when (as with an aerobatic model) you aren\u0027t sure where you local gravity will be any given moment; won\u0027t work any better than a fixed pickup in microgravity (so probably not very useful in actual

relatively low altitude, when depending on gimballed engines for attitude control.\u00A0 If you\u0027re flying at Mach 1 or faster, there\u0027s a lot of dynamic pressure on the nose of your rocket, and if you won\u0027t have large (heavy) fins on the second stage (and even larger, heavier ones on the booster to keep the rocket from swapping ends almost immediately after launch), that stage is going to tend to tumble between MECO and second stage start, even if you have ullage rockets powerful enough to overcome air drag and get a reliable start.\u00A0 By hot staging, you avoid having a gap of a few seconds in your vectored thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmerican rockets, historically, handled this by not staging in thick air -- a modern example is the Falcon 9, which stages above 100 km, where there isn\u0027t enough air to matter.\u00A0 Early Soviet launchers, by contrast, had shorter burning engines.\u00A0 One of their methods was to ground-start a core with a longer tank and a set of side boosters with shorter tanks, and stage away the side boosters while allowing the core to burn longer, but even then they still used hot staging, likely because ullage rockets added complexity and reduced reliability (or possibly because they simply didn\u0027t have suitable small solid propellant engines, though engines from air-to-ground or air-to-air missiles are very suitable for this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
