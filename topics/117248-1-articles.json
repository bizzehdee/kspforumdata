Smaller solar panels hardly register as working at all. The bottom line is that if you are out beyond Duna, solar panels by themselves are incapable of providing high volume EC/sec, such as to run an ion engine at full power. Thus, you need another approach. Some options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Run the ion engine at VERY low thrust, just consuming whatever pitiful amount of EC/sec the solar panels provide out there. This will result in burns of epic length, which might make a delicate rendezvous rather difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Have enough battery to store all the power you need for the longest burn you have to do at full power and use a couple of Gigantors to SLOWLY refill the batteries at a bit less than 2 EC/sec. Then you have to hope they can do this in time for the next burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use fuel cells to run ion engines. IIRC, this provides about 1600s Isp, considering both the xenon and the LFO consumption.
