OBSERVATION. A huge part of space exploration comes from looking at and mapping things FIRST and then you start blowing stuff up to try and get there. Having a \u0022fog of war\u0022 for the solar system that you can uncover with various methods would be great. I\u0027d love the idea that you only start with knowledge of the sun, kerbal, and the mun, but can either send out exploratory probes, use telescopes, and maybe even other methods(from realistic stuff like enough science \u002B knowledge of orbits =\u0027s figuring out a possible location, to more kerbal things like chain launching suicide 900 suicide probes in every possible direction) to figure out where other planets are. Further upon discovering you don\u0027t have any idea what they look like in detail until you actually GO there(or high enough tech could be very powerful telescopes). There\u0027s so much you could do with this(especially if you could then randomize the solar system each game) that i\u0027d love to see it implemented.

I wouldn\u0027t mind if you could \u0022paint\u0022 a portion of each piece in heat shielding for weight/cost issues. Only a small section if you want to be efficient, or just coat the whole damn thing to be safe.
