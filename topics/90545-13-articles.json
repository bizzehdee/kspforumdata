Yep, that\u0027s pretty much what I was thinking, about double-sized, dual nozzles in all directions.

I think that leg stack just needs to be trashed. I\u0027ve played around with it a lot, and there\u0027s just something funky about how impact force gets transmitted through that sort of part. The engines always fall off, and the only safe landings I\u0027ve done with it required a speed of about 2.9 m/s or slower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe good news:\u003C/strong\u003E I have proper individual landing legs WORKING now. They\u0027re still more fragile than I\u0027d like (something about the large scale parts KSP doesn\u0027t like), and I\u0027ll probably have to adjust the suspension numbers over time. But they function! So here\u0027s the plan: I\u0027m going to remove the landing-leg stackable ring (leaving a placeholder in for now, so it doesn\u0027t delete vehicles out of people\u0027s savegames), and add the legs I originally intended. I scaled them down in size a little (20% reduction), and you can still comfortably fit 6 around a 5m stack if you want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m finding that they still need a pretty modest landing speed, but they\u0027re not destroying the vehicle at 3.1 m/s... they\u0027re doing it at closer to 5 m/s. lol. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I suspect some of it has to do with the design, in that the suspension distance is not very long. But now that I\u0027ve figured it out, it opens the door to additional leg designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fragility of the 5m parts when landing is troublesome. I\u0027m tempted to start recommending Kerbal Joint Reinforcement to people. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Yes \u0026amp; no. I could make a duplicate that is scaled by a fixed percentage, and even replace the texture. But with animated parts, you can\u0027t just paste in additional components, as they won\u0027t animate. So at this point I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. OK cool.

A scissor-like Y-shaped animation is probably possible, but I\u0027m trying to keep a couple of things in mind as I work on these. One is that these large, heavy vehicles are pushing on the bounds of the stock physics. So to keep things stable, I opted to keep the piston suspension vertical, since I think that is helping keep the vehicles from leaning when they land with a lot of weight. Also, the parts always have a single attachment point, and so if you have a longer \u0022sliding track\u0022 or secondary hinge point, you\u0027re much more likely to see some flexing that causes part of the structure to clip in and out of the side of your rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking the legs \u0022spidery\u0022 minimizes that, and having the leg bend out 90 degrees with a horizontal leg and a perfectly vertical leg gives the best \u0022reach\u0022 for a wide base while also trying to keep the suspension vertical. I can experiment with some other angles too of course.

When multiple people aren\u0027t happy with the design, then it\u0027s time to re-think it. That\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing, sometimes it\u0027s worth trashing or reworking a design to get something better.

Now, for parts that will be used on a rocket, it needs to be sleek and lightweight too, but I see what you guys are saying about spindly/spidery weakness. So something completely different here might be good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have ideas for the kind of look that you\u0027d like, let me know.
