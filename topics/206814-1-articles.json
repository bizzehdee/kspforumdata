This rocket was a big one. It features a core stage powered by the \u201CVector\u201D engine, two liquid fuel boosters powered by a \u201CReliant\u201D Engine on each side and a super-efficient upper stage powered by a single \u201Ccheetah\u201D engine. A relay satellite, which was can be sent to the Mun or Minmus, is featured in this file. Replacing it with a lander or a rover will be fine. You can also switch it with a space station or a capsule to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. You can change the shape of the fairing to adapt for different missions. If you are sending crew, just replace the satellite in the fairing with the capsule and cover the capsule with \u00A0a rebuilt fairing. Feel free to tweak the rocket for your custom payload. Anyways, it\u2019s a capable rocket design.
