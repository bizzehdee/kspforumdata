My first suggestion would be to remove the mono-prop section, saving you a bit in mass. The docking port has mono-prop built-in, and it should be enough to do docking.

You could try removing one of the engines. Do the pre-coolers actually do anything? If not, you can probably take it out.\u00A0You can also reduce drag a bit by removing some of the intakes. Generally, you only need 1 per-engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, make sure that you\u0027re flying the craft well.

About 1400 will be needed to get into orbit around Kerbin. Then another 1100 to transfer to Duna, and another 100 for corrections around Duna. I\u0027d want to have a bit more just to be sure.

than the stuff I generally build, leading to\u00A0inefficient flight above 20km - requiring the nose to be far above the prograde to get sufficient lift , creating drag, and also resulting in cosine losses to the rocket thrust - basically a lot of the thrust is going straight down, fighting gravity rather than accelerating you in the direction of travel. \u00A0To get success with this approach requires a high thrust-weight ratio which means carrying a lot of engine mass\u00A0all the way up to orbit. \u00A0 Finally, a MK2 monopropellant tank is a metric f-ton of RCS. \u00A0That and engine

Let me chime in here as I\u0027ve just accomplished what you\u0027re attempting (maybe).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy quick version is... I ended up launching 2 components of a landed base for Duna somewhere around .9 (don\u0027t remember) and then I moved across the country, and came back to a version where the atmosphere on Duna changed a bit. So I didn\u0027t have enough chutes to land safely and my science bay ended up with blown tires at the south pole, and my mining bay ended up at the north pole. Also with blown tires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent a ship up that could hop about the surface, and refuel as necessary, but it couldn\u0027t achieve orbit on Duna once it landed. I sent it with a pilot (obv) and a level 2 engineer. Wellll... level 2 engineers can\u0027t actually fix wheels like it says, so I de-orbited my solar base hoping that one of those engineers had gotten enough experience to get to level 3, and went BACK to my original idea of designing a Duna plane. Which I did (pics below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway. First... I don\u0027t believe that plane will fly that well on Duna. For my craft, after struggling with trying to go as light as possible (I really wanted to use ION), I ended up using the mk2 cockpit (I think) with mk1 parts behind it, and the huge 737 wings. I mounted the main gear along the centerline (like a U2) to prevent any pitching or yawing about on the surface. I ran 2 nukes (wing mounted (inline)), and I put an aerospike on the tail so that I could be sure I could get off the ground as quickly as possible. The plane lands completely via parachute. Fly to site. Deploy drogues, deploy mains. Use reaction wheels to control everything (though it\u0027s well balanced) and it floats on down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I thought I had better pics) but... it uses 2 of the hypersonic jet engines to fly itself off the runway to altitude (mounted to the back of the nukes). This... as you\u0027re experiencing uses lots of fuel. I carry 3 drop tanks (which you can see in the photo), and I stage them first to ditch the frontal area. Once we\u0027re at altitude, and pushing hypersonic speeds (900-1000m/s), I fire the aerospike, ditch the jets, and light the nukes. This leaves me JUST enough to achieve orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in orbit, I send up a tanker, dock to the jr. port just under the nose, and it has again... just enough delta v to get to Duna (at the phase I sent it at anyway... I think it carries about 3k dV iirc) Once at Duna, I aerocapture (carefully, as heating is an issue) and use whatever fuel I have left to finish the maneuver. Then the craft glides forever (even at high altitude). Get where I\u0027m going... pull the chutes, and sink the drills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt flies on Duna beautifully at about 20% throttle on the nukes. Aerospike to get off the ground and climb like whoa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ONLY thing I forgot... was the bloody storage container for the ore. But I posted about that, and a few people put a mod out that enables the ISRU to \u0022store\u0022 1 unit of ore, so it can function as designed. My logic here was that if this were the case IRL, they would just shovel the ore directly into the bloody thing, and make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... a few pics (thought I had better screens tbh, but whatever)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReady for takeoff.
