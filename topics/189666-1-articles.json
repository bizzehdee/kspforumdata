Put absolutely \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything \u003C/strong\u003Enot associated with getting to orbit on decouplers and dump before taking off - solar panels, radiators, chutes, air brakes, landing gear, etc. Also get rid of of the docking port on the nose - that alone could be causing the tipping and will be robbing the craft of a LOT of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen start taking stuff away.
