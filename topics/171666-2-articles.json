These new software development models work directly on support, and in the case of crowd-funding often no product will exist without it. While KSP isn\u0027t in this boat anymore, it\u0027s very easy to see how some folks would translate\u00A0the recent trend in indie development to a game that was until relatively recently an indie title.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless of the reasoning, it\u0027s still reasonable to assume that if Take-Two believes KSP\u0027s sales are underperforming, they will be less likely to take risks (such as further development) with the property. If someone is hoping that existing KSP will eventually add some feature or content they want, they might decide to buy products they dont necessary want in hopes of voting with their wallets enough to encourage more development of things they do want.\u00A0Of course there\u0027s no actual official statement saying that spending $15 now will bring more stuff in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while no one official is saying the DLC must be bought to support KSP\u0027s development, it\u0027s easy to see why some would feel that way.

vast majority of the rest of the expansion is honestly just creating an issue with community sharing where some people may have the parts and others wont (so id still have to stick to 100% stock parts if i intended to share something i wanted anyone to load up).\u00A0 Mission builder looks neat, but like career and science mode is completely pointless for someone who has the imagination to create their own missions/scenarios and sandbox makes doing that far easier (not to mention the stock game as well as the expansion doesnt really support stock combat, pretty much the only thing that im truly interested in these days with KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat and the biggest issue is the whole internet connection and TT being able to do anything with data they collect BS in the EULA that could theoretically make its way into the game at some point.\u00A0 I dont really care if TT adds some sort of spyware (if you can get past my firewalls then you can have my data), but i really dont want it to be any sort of DRM or anything like it that requires activation, or at worst a constant connection to the internet to play (that alone would make me instantly stop updating).\u00A0 DRM free is one of the main reasons i bought the game with actual money and i really really hope that doesnt change with the expansion and 1.4 (not liek DRM actually stopped pirates but thats irrelevant to this discussion).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIll defenetely give 1.4 a try (and if it looks good i might get the expansion lateron), but at least i can rest assured that i have 1.3, and well, regardless of whether i accept the EULA or dont, noones gonna take 1.3 (or any older version i have saved) off my multiple backup drives...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

For old hands who literally did support this game from it\u0027s infancy, it\u0027s a bit of a slap down to tell them their baby\u0027s all grown up and is selling it\u0027s own product that we can decide either buy or not buy. We\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eemotionally\u003C/em\u003E invested in this, and the direction of future development (of DLCs and core content) is a personal issue for many of us.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor many of us, the relationship with Squad/KSP hasn\u0027t been transactional for a really long time, and it\u0027s a tough call whether that\u0027s something we\u0027d want to welcome back, especially once you\u0027ve seen what\u0027s actually being offered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: FWIW, I\u0027m an old enough player that I don\u0027t have to buy the DLC either.
