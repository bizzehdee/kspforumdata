Do you know if it is the distance from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E affecting it, is it just common, or is it because of the debug menu.

I havve never docked before but It may be the Kraken. Wait it started to lag??? Well it depends, KSP simulates every part that is in physics range which is less than 5km. And it is probeley lagging because yout space station is made out of lots of parts. The game is trying to run all the caculalations but too slow and cant update the graphics and video making it super laggy. Dont worry. I made a 2000 part rocket it was super laggy. Then the game may crash so this could leading to Game Diles being delelted or reverting before you dud your mission losing all your progress. So becarfula dn try not to use so many parts.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happened may times to me.
