There is probably a way to get and edit the part info of these vessels, and I suspect I have to work with confignodes, but I haven\u0027t worked with that yet. I could find surprisingly little documentation on it. Could someone direct me to it or give me a few pointers on how to edit parts on far away vessels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T16:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you edit parts on unloaded vessels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might be a limitation of our API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the API docs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E    /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E    /// The protoVessel can be used to get some saved information about unloaded vessels.\u003Cbr\u003E    /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E    public ProtoVessel protoVessel;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the Vessel.ProtoVessel method, specifically says some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe look at loading the vessel, making your changes and then unloading it?
