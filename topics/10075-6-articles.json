Right now I\\\u0027m trying to piece together how to ensure everything is balanced. For example, there\\\u0027s a custom ZO2 filter part. I assume that this part turns energy into ZO2. So in that aspect, I should delete / ignore the packaged ZO2 solar panels, as they don\\\u0027t provide power, but simply provide ZO2, right? Eugh.\n\nEDIT: Okay, so if I wanted the BEST COMBINATION of these mods, I would have:\n\n- All solar panels generate power, not ZO2.\n\n- Use the ZO2 filter to generate ZO2.\n\n- All solar panels use PowerTech to determine energy generation based on angles. Currently none do this they only work for ZO2 like this?\n\nSo what do I have to make my .cfgs say to work based on angle to sun and generate power with it?
