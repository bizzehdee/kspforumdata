I have run into that issue with ComSats to put onto a launcher. When I had the probe core as the root part they wouldn\u0027t attach to the new ship. When I changed the root part to a Decoupler on the bottom of the ship, they attached just fine. Hope that helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberius K","CreatedById":163867,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T02:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember you can change the root part of sub-assemblies that are ghosted, i.e. dragged off to the side of the main craft, using the re-root tool\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T15:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can?
