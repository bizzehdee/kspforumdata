still apply.\u00A0\u00A0 That mod gets enough frequent updates that doing making a new video each time would be very

AP\u0027s before you take off, and then switch teams on the craft you are flying later to activate the defenses.\u00A0 Someone will correct me on this, because I can usually switch in flight, but I\u0027m not sure how I do this :D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

off.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are setting up a ground defense station, just enable all the team and firing settings when you deploy it.\u00A0 It will automatically come alive when it detects an enemy craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are setting up an enemy fighter, make sure it has both the BDA weapons manager and AP modules onboard.\u00A0\u00A0 Launch the craft to the runway from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then gently steer it off to the side onto the flat grass, aiming away from anything it can run into.\u00A0 Set the brake, throttle down.\u00A0 Open the AP module and set all your flight limits if you want to change them.\u00A0 The \u0027stock\u0027 settings usually work fine, until you want them different.\u00A0 Set the WM settings to whatever you need, I usually leave it on team A.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch your second plane, set the AP as you need if you want to have the computer fly it, or not if you are going to fly it.\u00A0 Start your take off, and immediately switch to Team B.\u00A0 This will trigger the drone plane to start it\u0027s take off roll, within a few seconds.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are trying to fly against a ground station, wait till you are on your attack run to switch teams, as switching teams during your take off roll will get you blasted before you even take off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t played in a year or so, but that is how I used to do it.\u00A0\u00A0 Just mess with the settings until you\u0027re happy.\u00A0 If you can\u0027t get the fighter\u0027s to fly with you, there\u0027s usually some stupid reason for it.\u00A0 Engine\u0027s not enable, autopilot not enabled, etc.\u00A0\u00A0 It\u0027s what usually get\u0027s
