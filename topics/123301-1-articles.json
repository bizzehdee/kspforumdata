I have been doing some research into all the new technologies and will likely be building something in the $1500-$1800 price range, so I should be able to setup a fairly decent machine (one for the next 6 years I hope). This will be a PC used almost entirely for gaming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my question for the moment is about system memory. How many GB should I plan on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am initially planning on 16 GB in a 2x8 setup, and I can probably choose a MB that has 4 slots total for expansion later if necessary. Is there any reason to need more than 16 GB right now? I am planning to install Windows 10 Home 64 bit (my current PC is still Vista, LOL), what kind of memory use can I expect from the OS alone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T16:57:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWindows 10 x64 uses less than one for me, and 16 GB should be enough for almost everything.
