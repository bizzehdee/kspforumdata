IF every shell from a salvo hits\u0027 which it will with that set up, then there is nothing\u00A0 anyone can do about it, apart from making ships indestructible for everything else in game. ( which I\u0027m not going to do as It\u0027s not my number s that are wrong)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare NAS turret deviation to the WW2 turrets in SM Armory, they have real world deviations, and the shell fall is as you\u0027d expect from 14/16 inch guns. With proper deviations the guns work very well though.\u00A0 It is because of the over accuracy of NAS that i don\u0027t recommend using\u00A0 it with LBP in it\u0027s better balanced form..
