Now rewrite one knowing that thousands of people are going to read it and cite it in the future as gospel, others are going to actively look for things to criticize in it, still more are going to pound you with questions about the things you didn\u0027t do, etc. Be sure to write it in a language other than your native one, too. Devnotes, for better or worse, are now PR activities, which means that language and content have to be carefully controlled and vetted.
