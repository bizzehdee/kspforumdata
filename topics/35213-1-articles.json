I\u0027m having a problem every once in a while where all of my controls stop working for no apparent reason. Even when I\u0027ve been using MeckJeb it loses all functionality because of it. Is it something in the game I\u0027m doing wrong, or is it a programming thing? I can\u0027t even turn RCS on/off. I can however hit M and get to maps, select a new satellite, and that one works... then back to the other one and no controls. I can\u0027t seem to figure out any kind of pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T01:14:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re out of power.

Now imagine you are sending your very first rover to land on Mun, everything is going great got in orbit with way more fuel then you\u0027ll ever need (rare indeed) and you are in position to deorbit and land. Then you lose control because of power, it\u0027s fine I have those one solar panels on the rover I was using just for this occasion I\u0027ll jut wait for the sun to hit them and boom back in business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 years later you realize that the craft is in the perfect orbit to always devoid it of solar power leaving your best launch to date orbiting Mun... I am due for my third rover to Mun and I plan to have enough fuel to bump that damn rocket towards the sun and get what was suppose to be my first rover be my fourth....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T02:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022syvmn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022syvmn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell look at that...I feel a bit dumb...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry!
