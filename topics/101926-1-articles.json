During this time I got thinking about electric and hybrid vehicles (irl) and started reading a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eregenerative brakes\u003C/a\u003E. Then, because I still had a crazy amount of time to wait while recharging, I thought maybe there\u0027s a mod for it. Sadly, after searching through a full recharge cycle I could find nothing.

It would produce a value of electricity equal to (some constant that is decided for balance) * (surface speed). This way, no electricity is generated by sitting there still. Sounds like my first mod!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
