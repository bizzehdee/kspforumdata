You already did a magnificent job with 1.0.5 introducing contextual contracts, such as \u0022expand your base on Minmus\u0022 or \u0022shift satellite\u0027s orbit\u0022. What I\u0027d wish for now is that you take this one step further: Personell shifting on space stations and outposts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say contract 1 goes like: \u0022Build a space station in orbit of Mun. Have a Lab on it.\u0022 That\u0027s in the game. Contract 2 now says: \u0022Expand the station, add room for 4 Kerbals.\u0022 That\u0027s in the game, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t it be great if contract 3 would say: \u0022Ferry 3 external scientists to the station.\u0022 With contract 4 saying: \u0022Return the 3 external scientists back to Kerbin\u0022 (Splitting the Return of the scientists into a fourth contract would be an option, because otherwise this contract would block a slot for 6\u002B months. Then again, other contracts are pretty long-termed, too)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAllow me to clearify why this would be both great and easy to make happen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAll necessary technology is available. This would be a new type of the existing contextual contracts. The external personell could use the same models and restrictions as tourists (icon, 3d model, no EVA, etc.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSuch contracts would bring life to the stations and outpost. Just look at the ISS and how there\u0027s a constant shift of personell.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere would be more interaction with \u0022the world outside\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0022Biological payload\u0022 could take a more important role. After all you went at some lengths to implement the tourists, how about adding some serious customers?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you find this interesting. Since I\u0027m a software developer myself, I\u0027m quite willing to contribute to the design of this idea, if you find it worthwhile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m looking forward to replies and feedback!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYours,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBreizhad\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk1980","CreatedById":163203,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T14:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni like that idea a lot. always feels wrong to build all sorts of orbital stations and surface outposts and to expand previously built stuff and then leave them empty. and it feels just as wrong to randomly put some resuced kerbals in there without any purpose just so the station doesn\u0027t feel like the pointless emtpy husk it really is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncontracts to get civilian personnell up there (and back) would make the whole base building business a lot more believable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John JACK","CreatedById":161340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T22:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102390-10511x-contract-pack-bases-and-stations-3211-290416-formerly-kerbin-space-station/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso there was a mod with space hotel and tourists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-10T22:18:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2016 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by John JACK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
