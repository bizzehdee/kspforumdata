Hello, no bloody fairing anymore. ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\n[rant]\n\nThis is ridiculous. Do I really have to hack my save file every time I put an engine in a fairing? Who came up with this idiocy?\n\nCan we please get rid of this? It\u0027s dumb, and there\u0027s no logical reason for it. Even if it worked correctly, which it doesn\u0027t, why can\u0027t I fire an engine in a fairing if I want to?\n\n[/rant]\n\nOk so I\u0027m having a bad day, not helped by the idiotic new docking controls. But this \u0022feature\u0022 is just plain stupid.\n\nGranted I probably should have put a decoupler on top of said fairing base, but hang on, they HAVE a decoupler already (or at least they decouple where wanted) What Gives?\n\nAll in all, stock fairings appear to be inferior to every singe fairing mod ever created. Is there actually a way to do build an interstage without encountering this issue?\n\nOn the topic of fairings, why the \\*\\*\\*\\* can I not strut from a fairing base? you know, the logical way to support the stack? If fairings actually reinforced the joint properly, that would be fine.
