The more thrust an engine can produce, the more efficient it will be. Thrust is decreased in atmosphere because the engine exhaust must first overcome the pressure of the atmosphere to escape the nozzle (If the atmospheric pressure is high enough, the engine produces zero thrust), reducing the amount of effective forward thrust it can generate, hence lowering it\u0027s Isp. Fuel consumption remains constant. \n\nIn 0.90, (I\u0027m not sure of the WHY behind it) engine thrust was not variable. Since the thrust could not be changed to accurately represent atmospheric levels, fuel consumption was used to simulate the efficiency changes as the Isp changed. \n\nSo, yes, at sea level both thrust and Isp are lower, but your rate of fuel consumption never changes, your rocket engine is just able to push harder (and therefore be more efficient) the closer you get to a vacuum.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T13:29:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"StevenLawyer","CreatedById":78513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:31:00Z","Content":"So, a little further examination, I think I have partially answered my own question.

Aerospikes have very little Isp gains in vacuum, but unusually high Isp at 1atm. Their thrust curve will be almost unaffected by the black hole that is Eve. If anything, being able to get reasonable speed through air makes ascending from Eve easier than before if anything.

Eve ascent should be easier btw, especially with aerospikes (which are btw even more efficient in atmosphere than the ISP indicates). Your rockets will have a lot less less dV due to the nerf, but Eves atmosphere, the biggest issue during ascent, is also a lot thinner now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not \\*that\\* much harder.

Now, the shape of parts affects how much drag they have, and parts in a stack can be occluded by parts in front of them.

Or does fuel consumption decrease along with thrust?\n\nBy the way, this is the way it works in real life. Fuel flow is a function of the turbomachinery in the engine and is pretty much a constant. Thrust, however, is a function of the pressure in the nozzle and the pressure outside of the nozzle, so it changes in the atmosphere. And ISP is a function of thrust and fuel flow, so it also changes in the atmosphere."}]}
