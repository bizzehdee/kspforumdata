I wanted to use mouse and keyboard to make building and piloting easier. Unfortunately the keyboard does not seem to be working on KSP while it works on many other games. The mouse does work correctly and apparently there\u0027s supposed to be full mouse and keyboard Support. The keyboard I\u0027m using is a USB dongle. Could anyone help out with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Space Noob","CreatedById":228223,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T22:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having the EXACT same problem.
