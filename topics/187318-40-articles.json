Orbiting the Moon, because of its small size, relatively low mass, and extremely large mass concentrations relative to that size, orbits below 100km \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E very unstable... but the Moon is an unusual circumstance. No other major moon in our solar system has that unusual of a mass distribution as a ratio of its size. Even then, orbits above 100km are considered fairly stable over the Moon... and there\u0027s nothing that says a \u0022lumpy\u0022 Kerbin, or \u0022lumpy\u0022 Mun would need to have a large mascon ratio to its size the way the Moon does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s break it down. The moon has a radius of\u00A0 \u22481,738 km and a mass of 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg. The problem is that the Moon\u0027s mascons constitute nearly 0.1% of its mass. (ref. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/50\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/50\u003C/a\u003E ) 0.1% of 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg is 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E19\u003C/sup\u003E kg, roughly the mass of Uranus\u0027s moon, Miranda... just as \u003Cem\u003Edisplacement\u003C/em\u003E. While no single mascon has a density variance of more than 1% from norm, the Moon has a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of mascons left over from the Late Heavy Bombardment period. So many that its point center of mass is displaced 2 km towards the Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if they were to include \u0022lumpy gravity\u0022 in the simulation, so long as it was less than or equal to the Moon\u0027s unusually high 0.1% mascon distribution, even an orbital altitude of 100km (30 km above the atmosphere) would be fairly stable for months, if not years. This is due to the fact that Kerbin has over 72% the mass as the Moon, (5.2915x10\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg vs. 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg) but an equatorial radius of less than 35% of the Moon\u0027s. (600 km vs. 1,738 km) Thus, a 100km orbit is 1 part in 16 of the planet\u0027s radius, as compared to a 100 km orbit over the moon which is only 1 part in 6 of its radius. Even the Moon\u0027s 1% mascons on Kerbin wouldn\u0027t be a significant change in vector over time, so long as you\u0027re outside the atmosphere. (and inside the atmosphere, they would have a negligible effect compared to the atmosphere\u0027s effect)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost people put Kerbin Observation satellites at an orbit of 250 - 500 km where mascons similar to the Moon\u0027s extreme examples would have no noticeable effect over years, likely decades. Communication satellites mostly go in keo-stationary orbit of 2,863 km and would be effectively 100% stable, with 1% mascons having an imperceptible effect over \u003Cem\u003Ethousands\u003C/em\u003E of years. The only reason it\u0027s an issue over our Moon is that it has no atmosphere, so you can orbit a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E closer to its surface. (I\u0027ve personally skimmed orbits at less than 500 meters from the highest equatorial peaks on the Mun) Give the Mun 1% mascons and yes, orbits under 20km will be unstable... but then, \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E they be? (those orbits are basically skimming the surface and \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be stable for more than a few revolutions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that having been said, I don\u0027t think Intercept Games is going to model mascons.

Orbiting the Moon, because of its small size, relatively low mass, and extremely large mass concentrations relative to that size, orbits below 100km \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E very unstable... but the Moon is an unusual circumstance. No other major moon in our solar system has that unusual of a mass distribution as a ratio of its size. Even then, orbits above 100km are considered fairly stable over the Moon... and there\u0027s nothing that says a \u0022lumpy\u0022 Kerbin, or \u0022lumpy\u0022 Mun would need to have a large mascon ratio to its size the way the Moon does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s break it down. The moon has a radius of\u00A0 \u22481,738 km and a mass of 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg. The problem is that the Moon\u0027s mascons constitute nearly 0.1% of its mass. (ref. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/50\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/50\u003C/a\u003E ) 0.1% of 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg is 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E19\u003C/sup\u003E kg, roughly the mass of Uranus\u0027s moon, Miranda... just as \u003Cem\u003Edisplacement\u003C/em\u003E. While no single mascon has a density variance of more than 1% from norm, the Moon has a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of mascons left over from the Late Heavy Bombardment period. So many that its point center of mass is displaced 2 km towards the Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if they were to include \u0022lumpy gravity\u0022 in the simulation, so long as it was less than or equal to the Moon\u0027s unusually high 0.1% mascon distribution, even an orbital altitude of 100km (30 km above the atmosphere) would be fairly stable for months, if not years. This is due to the fact that Kerbin has over 72% the mass as the Moon, (5.2915x10\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg vs. 7.342\u00D710\u003Csup\u003E22\u003C/sup\u003E kg) but an equatorial radius of less than 35% of the Moon\u0027s. (600 km vs. 1,738 km) Thus, a 100km orbit is 1 part in 16 of the planet\u0027s radius, as compared to a 100 km orbit over the moon which is only 1 part in 6 of its radius. Even the Moon\u0027s 1% mascons on Kerbin wouldn\u0027t be a significant change in vector over time, so long as you\u0027re outside the atmosphere. (and inside the atmosphere, they would have a negligible effect compared to the atmosphere\u0027s effect)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost people put Kerbin Observation satellites at an orbit of 250 - 500 km where mascons similar to the Moon\u0027s extreme examples would have no noticeable effect over years, likely decades. Communication satellites mostly go in keo-stationary orbit of 2,863 km and would be effectively 100% stable, with 1% mascons having an imperceptible effect over \u003Cem\u003Ethousands\u003C/em\u003E of years. The only reason it\u0027s an issue over our Moon is that it has no atmosphere, so you can orbit a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E closer to its surface. (I\u0027ve personally skimmed orbits at less than 500 meters from the highest equatorial peaks on the Mun) Give the Mun 1% mascons and yes, orbits under 20km will be unstable... but then, \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E they be? (those orbits are basically skimming the surface and \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be stable for more than a few revolutions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that having been said, I don\u0027t think Intercept Games is going to model mascons.
