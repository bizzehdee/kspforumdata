Now that I\u0027ve given it a couple hours of play, I think I can make a fair comment on it. \u003Cp\u003EI made a new modpack when 0.1 was released, and I\u0027ve been running that for a while, at over 110 mods and 5500\u002B MM patches, it was about as much as I could get away with, with the planet factory pack. All I did when installing this pack was pull out the old stuff, delete planet factory and drop this in... and it worked beautifully.. even knocked out a few bugs from 0.1 (the sun used to burn out, placing everything in darkness after a few launches, which was kinda fun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I was running the lo-res pack, but I\u0027ve since reverted back to your full res textures with no hit on performance so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just wanted to throw out my thanks for your hard work, and to let you know its working great (at least on my install).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is running at over a hundred mods plus this, on 32 bit, with 2 gigs of RAM and a core2duo from 2006.... still pulling a solid 22-28 fps. (I\u0027m probably your worst case scenario for testing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot quite sure how this is physically possible but can\u0027t tell you how good it is to hear its working, and with multiple mods running at this early stage, I\u0027ve been so engrossed with this mod, getting the bugs sorted I haven\u0027t had a change to test it on my career KSP, great news! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tygoo7\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tygoo7\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis looks really great.
