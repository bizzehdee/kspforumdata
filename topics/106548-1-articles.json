Otherwise I don\u0027t really see the purpose. Nuclear engines already have alternators and produce electricity (which is rarely needed thanks to solar panels).

Radiators allow a change of heat. That\u0027s what those fins on the PB-NUK RTG are. There\u0027s not really a good way to use radiators to produce heat from anything but that radioisotope decay. Radiators, however, would be REALLY good to have to disperse heat, and the first stockalike mod to include functional radiators will be a must-have until 1.1, assuming they add radiators then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
