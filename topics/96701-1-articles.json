Now I have no idea if this is possible (i\u0027m going to make the assumption of no) but it\u0027s a cool idea, it all depends on fuel levels, timing, etc. It\u0027s something I could see the Chinese doing though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen is the next Earth-Mars transfer date?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any other spacecraft gone from Lunar orbit to Mars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T22:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the next transfer window opens next year (early summer I guess).
