Inside the atmosphere, skin heating and internal heating have a different relationship than they do in a vacuum. Once in space, the part is essentially seen as a more singular object. Heating between the skin and internal components is dictated primarily by the skin to internal flux value (there\u0027s also skin to skin that\u0027s not tracked visibly). While in an atmosphere, you have convection to deal with. It wicks away heat at a pretty good clip (below entry speeds, anyway), and it\u0027s far outpacing the ability of the AHMS unit to transfer heat from the internal to the skin to be dumped, which prevents the AHMS skin from actually getting hot enough to dump heat. Unfortunately it doesn\u0027t have any effect on the internals though, so they will continue to heat up. That\u0027s my guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: I think it also has something to do with the firespitter plugin that runs the electric engines. I just launched one on a rocket up to 60k and ran it. Soon as it runs out of FSCoolant it starts overheating nearly instantly, but if you throttle down you can slow it down to watch. The skin temp of the AHMS freezes just as before, but the instant the engine explodes it starts heating up like normal again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T07:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T07:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randazzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randazzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny chance you could upload a craft file somewhere so I can test this?

The specific structure in question (and the only part of the craft that is thermally active since the rest remains at ambient temps) is built thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter Engine mount - attached to wing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal washer - attached to engine mount\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAHMS - attached to thermal washer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter electric propeller - attached directly to AHMS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo heat gets past the washer, or any that does is radiated by the wing faster than it can pass through, so the rest of the craft is practically inert for this. The assembly described rises to 600K rather slowly as I ascend; with one AHMS it will rise in temp at very high altitudes but that doesn\u0027t seem to be an issue, with two it will never go above 600K even when the engines and wings stop producing useful lift at 22km, but any dive from above ~15km seems to have a strong chance of resulting in the problem described unless engines are killed first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might as well be noted that this doesn\u0027t happen every single time. Sometimes I\u0027ve done nosedives from 20km with no problem even with engines running, others I\u0027ve done simple heading changes at 15km and engines overheat. The only thing that seems absolutely consistent is that so long as you either change altitude slowly, or stop all active generation of heat, you seem to avoid it. But it happens often enough that if I try a couple times, I can be assured to make it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly fix I found is to land and either save and reload, or time warp until the entire craft is magically updated to ambient ground temps, at which point everything functions normally again. Attempting to let it cool conventionally (i.e. without timewarp) will get the core temp down (very very very slowly) but skin temps remain static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT response to your EDIT: That\u0027s kind of along the lines I was suspecting, that it\u0027s the interface between atmosphere and space that causes the issue.
