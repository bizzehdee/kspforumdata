The engine gets sort of hot, but the AHMS itself never approaches 600k, and it won\u0027t cool anything until it hits that mark.\n\nI ran a single engine up to about 20k and let it run until it started to stabilize around 740ish, then dove straight down.\n\nEdit: After a couple more tests, I think I have a handle on what is happening. Inside the atmosphere, skin heating and internal heating have a different relationship than they do in a vacuum. Once in space, the part is essentially seen as a more singular object. Heating between the skin and internal components is dictated primarily by the skin to internal flux value (there\u0027s also skin to skin that\u0027s not tracked visibly). While in an atmosphere, you have convection to deal with. It wicks away heat at a pretty good clip (below entry speeds, anyway), and it\u0027s far outpacing the ability of the AHMS unit to transfer heat from the internal to the skin to be dumped, which prevents the AHMS skin from actually getting hot enough to dump heat. Unfortunately it doesn\u0027t have any effect on the internals though, so they will continue to heat up. That\u0027s my guess.\n\nEdit2: I think it also has something to do with the firespitter plugin that runs the electric engines. I just launched one on a rocket up to 60k and ran it. Soon as it runs out of FSCoolant it starts overheating nearly instantly, but if you throttle down you can slow it down to watch. The skin temp of the AHMS freezes just as before, but the instant the engine explodes it starts heating up like normal again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T07:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T07:05:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any chance you could upload a craft file somewhere so I can test this? I\u0027m not having luck reproducing this. The engine gets sort of hot, but the AHMS itself never approaches 600k, and it won\u0027t cool anything until it hits that mark.\n\u003E I ran a single engine up to about 20k and let it run until it started to stabilize around 740ish, then dove straight down.\n\nI\u0027ll see if I can upload the plane I\u0027ve tested it with. The specific structure in question (and the only part of the craft that is thermally active since the rest remains at ambient temps) is built thus:\n\nFirespitter Engine mount - attached to wing\n\nThermal washer - attached to engine mount\n\nAHMS - attached to thermal washer\n\nFirespitter electric propeller - attached directly to AHMS\n\nNo heat gets past the washer, or any that does is radiated by the wing faster than it can pass through, so the rest of the craft is practically inert for this. The assembly described rises to 600K rather slowly as I ascend; with one AHMS it will rise in temp at very high altitudes but that doesn\u0027t seem to be an issue, with two it will never go above 600K even when the engines and wings stop producing useful lift at 22km, but any dive from above ~15km seems to have a strong chance of resulting in the problem described unless engines are killed first.\n\nIt might as well be noted that this doesn\u0027t happen every single time. Sometimes I\u0027ve done nosedives from 20km with no problem even with engines running, others I\u0027ve done simple heading changes at 15km and engines overheat. The only thing that seems absolutely consistent is that so long as you either change altitude slowly, or stop all active generation of heat, you seem to avoid it. But it happens often enough that if I try a couple times, I can be assured to make it happen.\n\nOnly fix I found is to land and either save and reload, or time warp until the entire craft is magically updated to ambient ground temps, at which point everything functions normally again. Attempting to let it cool conventionally (i.e. without timewarp) will get the core temp down (very very very slowly) but skin temps remain static.\n\nEDIT response to your EDIT: That\u0027s kind of along the lines I was suspecting, that it\u0027s the interface between atmosphere and space that causes the issue. Do you have any suggested fix, or is it basically \u0022be careful how high you fly until aerodynamics and thermals get fixed\u0022?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T07:10:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T07:16:05Z","Content":"Eh, I made another edit.

I also have done all I can to figure this out, and I think you are correct. Testing other parts as heat sources gives the same result, adding heat sinks or other methods of \u0022buffering\u0022 really has no effect and obviously isn\u0027t worth the mass on an aircraft.\n\nOn the other hand the basic functionality of it is fantastic once you learn to cope with this. I can fly reliably at 15-20km on Kerbin and achieve nearly Mach 1 with props, the only caveat is that you simply kill engines to dive and don\u0027t maneuver at extreme altitude. Also did some tests with NFE nuclear reactors, they perform great on that too...and in fact I\u0027ve built a kinda-working nuclear powered AHMS cooled propeller quadruplane SSTO with plasma thruster final stage that looks ludicrous yet somehow space-steampunk.

As of version 0.25 they use the stock radiator module; Prior to that they used the Deployable Solar Panel module to approximate radiators. \n\nI\u0027ll need more information to help at all, such as, KSP version, Heat Management Version, and any mods that might be affecting it.\n\nStandard troubleshooting step: Delete HeatManagement and reinstall fresh. Remember to delete the AltStockTech file if you don\u0027t want the tech distribution.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T20:41:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"dboi88","CreatedById":150676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T21:03:36Z","Content":"Hi, thanks for responding so quickly.\n\nI love the mod by the way, i can finally get my big mining unit working without over heating!

You\u0027ll either need to update KSP or download Heat Management version 0.24b or earlier. You can find them by [going to this page](http://kerbalstuff.com/mod/723/Heat%20Management) and clicking on \u0022Changelog\u0022.\n\nEdit: If you have a lot of stuff going on in your save or use a lot of mods, I\u0027d suggest just downgrading Heat Management rather than risking breaking your save.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T21:16:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"}]}
