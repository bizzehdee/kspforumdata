If you want to use a 3rd party app that is between you and the app.\u003Cp\u003EI try to keep FASA as bug free as possible but I cannot guarantee that your save game will continue to function after you have installed it, played for a bit, and then uninstall it. Your game should work but your save game probably won\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your save game is important to you then you should have a separate install for trying out mods. That way you can see if you like them and don\u0027t risk messing up your save game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also cant help or fix your install if start deleting files from it. I am not sitting at your computer, I can\u0027t see what you did and did not do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is a specific part you want removed then delete the entire folder for that object. Many parts share textures and just deleting a texture is a bad idea. If you need memory use one of the texture reduction mods that\u0027s out there, they work much better than deleting a few parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a problem with your game then use the instructions on the first page for fixing it. It works every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrizzank,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not trying to start a flame war here, nor am I expecting unusual support. I appreciate a lot all the work that you and the other mod authors do to make the game more enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t \u0022deleted\u0022 files, I was asking if it was doable, and your answer is what I expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also know and acknowledge that you do not support CKAN. No one is forcing you to, and in fact, it appears that CKAN is working fine by simply grabbing the information from kerbalstuff.com.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a suggestion re. CKAN; while I\u0027m sorry that you don\u0027t want to do that, I (really!) do understand and accept your decision. While I may disagree with it, I\u0027m not going to belabor the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe. save game being important, nothing is that important that I couldn\u0027t just start a new game. I am simply removing those mods which I either never used or no longer use in an effort to save memory. If, as in this case, removing a mod creates a problem with a game, that is ENTIRELY on my head! I asked for help, and between your answer and another from Starwaster, I got an answer I can work with. I wasn\u0027t aware about the possibility of completed contracts causing long-term problems until his answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, I have just moved the save game onto a 64bit Linux system with 16 gig memory, and the memory problems I was having have gone away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, if you feel I was attacking or being offensive, please accept my apologies. No offense was intended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T16:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHay there is no problem at all, from your perspective your just asking a simple and legitimate question.
