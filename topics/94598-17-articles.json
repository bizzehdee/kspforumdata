The 2.5 Fusion Reactors *SHOULD* have a Mass Flow Rate that is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(Old ISP/New ISP)^2 = New Mass Flow Rate\u003C/strong\u003E (this is as E = 1/2 m v^2, with m representing Mass Flow Rate, and E remains unchanged as the Thermal Energy is the same)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3398/3000)^2 = \u003Cstrong\u003E1.2829 times higher than what it would be at 3000 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, if you multiply the new Mass Flow Rate by the 3000 second ISP (as Thrust = Mass Flow Rate * Specific Impulse), you get the following new Thrust-rating at 3000 s:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E389.4 kN * (3000/3398) * (3398/3000)^2 = 389.4 kN * (3398/3000) = \u003Cstrong\u003E440.7206 kN\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extra heat that can\u0027t be poured into a higher Exhaust Velocity doesn\u0027t simply disappear- it gets converted into extra thrust instead... So, the new Thrust for any Thermal Rocket when changing the ISP and keeping the same total Thermal Energy (and propellent), becomes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOld Thrust * (Old ISP/ new ISP) = New Thrust\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the value of (Old ISP/ New ISP) is *ALWAYS* greater than 1 when *reducing* the ISP (as the extra Thermal Energy doesn\u0027t have to simply disappear- it goes into a higher maximum possible Mass Flow Rate), and *ALWAYS* less than 1 when *increasing the ISP (heating less mass up to a higher temperature)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the maximum ISP of other propellents should be lower than of Hydrogen (as the ISP will be lower at the same temperature). The Molecular Mass of Methane is 16.04 and of H2 is 2.01588, so the maximum ISP with a Thermal Rocket Nozzle should be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3000 / [(16.04 / 2.01588)^(0.5)] = \u003Cstrong\u003E1063.5 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas it was previously:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3398 / [(16.04 / 2.01588) ^(0.5)] = \u003Cstrong\u003E1204.6 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that this is just the equation for changing the ISP when switching between two different propellents at the same temperature [ New ISP = Old ISP / sqrt (New Molecular Mass / Old Molecular Mass) ] as the per-particle energy (E = 1/2 m v^2) is the same between the two...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with Hydrogen, the remaining thermal energy gets dumped into increasing mass-flow rate (and Thrust) so the Thrust of a 2.5 meter fusion using Methane (or any different propellent) at the new temperature should be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(New ISP/ Old ISP) * New Mass Flow Rate = (New ISP/Old ISP) * (Old ISP/ New ISP)^2 * Old Thrust = Old Thrust * (Old ISP / New ISP) = New Thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that (Old ISP / New ISP) ^2 is the PROPORTIONAL increase in mass-flow rate (so if = 1.2, Mass Flow Rate is 20% higher), which is why you multiply in the Old Thrust...

Even if we reduced the mass to levels that would be more appropriate for their size (the Sethlans Particle Bed Reactor- the 1.25 meter version of the Akula line I\u0027ve been focusing on lately- weighs 2.2 tons with its nozzle in KSP-I, whereas the Timberwind 75 it is based on weighs 2.5 tons but has 4 times the volume...) their Thermal Power production (and thus TWR as Thermal Rockets) is still much too low for their size. I suggest reducing mass AND increasing Thermal Power until a Sethlans weighs 0.625 tons without its nozzle and produces 1/4th the Thermal Power of the Timberwind 75, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) It turns out, upon close inspection of the relative sizes of the nozzles, that they are more than 2.4 times the size of the ones used on Timberwind relative to the reactor size. This means that the Vacuum Specific Impulse (and Vacuum Thrust- which is related by Vacuum Thrust = Vacuum ISP * Mass Flow Rate) is considerably less than it should be. We have two options- we can either ignore the actual size of the nozzles, and pretend they are the same relative-size as the nozzles on Timberwind (which doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense- the Timberwind engines had nozzles designed for use in a rocket first-stage, whereas the Thermal Rocket Nozzles are clearly designed for vacuum at the Mass Flow Rates of a fission reactor), or we can adjust the Vacuum ISP and Thrust/MW upwards. I suggested approximately 20% (so that basically the Vacuum ISP drives a 20% increase in the Vacuum Thrust...) before, but actually the re-balancing needs to be more drastic than that... (see part #2 of this post) The more I think about it, the more I prefer the latter solution of adjusting the Vacuum ISP and Thrust/MW, because the values are just so far off (20% was a HUGE under-estimate as it turns out.... See below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can basically forget the second comment of mine you quoted- that was from AFTER I had confirmed that the relationship between Thrust and Thermal Power was accurate for a Timberwind or NERVA Reactor, but *BEFORE* I realized the nozzle size was relatively larger for the reactor-size than what was used on either system (the NERVA had a relative smaller nozzle because its total Mass Flow Rate was much lower, the Timberwind because it was designed for atmospheric use...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth double-checking the actual operating ISP of a Sethlans Reactor in vacuum before taking anything I say about the Vacuum ISP as the word of God (in fact, I already have KSP open- I think I\u0027m going to go and do it now). It\u0027s possible that Fractal_UK already adjusted the ISP of the Sethlans/Akula Reactor series to match the predicted vacuum performance of a reactor as hot as the Timberwind, but with a nozzle designed for vacuum (the target ISP should be about 1200).
