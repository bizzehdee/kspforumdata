I unlocked them but didn\u0027t use them for a while because the contracts I was getting could be easily completed by designs I already had just by adding a little something else depending on the contract. When I finally got to make a new rocket I decided to add a fairing and noticed I was losing around 800 m/s of delta V. So I was wondering if I was better off not having them and it was better just to have those 800 m/s. So considering what I was losing, is it really worth it to use them? Will the reduced drag compensate for the amount of delta V lost? Is there anything that I\u0027m not taking in consideration?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T20:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally have had nothing but problems using the stock fairings in since 1.05.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T20:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy experience with fairings has been that they\u0027re only useful for extremely draggy payloads, for the very reason that you mentioned. They add quite a bit of weight, but really don\u0027t cut down on drag that much, so they only help on a few edge cases where the payload is so draggy that it makes your rocket flip-happy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also worth noting that IRL\u00A0fairings are more for protecting the payload.

For example with RT, most antennas\u00A0snap\u00A0under high dynamic pressure when deployed. This can be well shielded by a fairing and I now seldom use one extra antenna just for launch.
