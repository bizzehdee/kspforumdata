I\u2019m running via Steam on OSX and was running version 1.11.2.3077, and all was well. Today I got an upgrade notice to move to 1.12, and now I\u2019m seeing two problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: I get the staging set up the way I want in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but when I go to the launch pad, the engine and decoupler are reversed. I can manually move them back to\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Ethe correct order, but it\u2019s consistent that the settings in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E are reversed when I move to the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: After launch and I switch to the map view, there is no Apoapsis marker. Worked fine in 1.11, but the marker isn\u2019t present in 1.12, making it difficult to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone else seeing this, or is it a new setting that I need to check? I restored 1.11 since 1.12 isn\u2019t playable in its present form, but I would like to be able to run 1.12 if there\u2019s a way to fix the two issues I\u2019m having.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T20:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t seen #1 but as for #2 are you perhaps on career game setting?

In 1.11, the tracking station shows as level 1, but\u00A0the markers are visible when in orbit. V1.12 shows level 1 also, but the markers are not visible. Part of the problem might be due to the way I\u0027m running KSP, which I do\u00A0by launching the program directly from the app, which is buried in (OSX) Library folder. Running directly I get v1.11, and If I run via Steam I get v1.12. Very strange, and it implies some sort of a problem with the application launch structure (or me being too smart for my own good!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just discovered this, so I think my next step is to uninstall KSP\u00A0via the Steam interface, then delete the KSP folders in the user Librarty (if they still exist), and finally\u00A0reinstall it via\u00A0Steam and see what happens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T22:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a patch was just put out, so maybe try that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JB182","CreatedById":210976,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-30T14:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212503-macbates/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022212503\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212503-macbates/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@macbates\u003C/a\u003E, Welcoma Aboard! and sorry cuz i can\u0027t answer your question, becuz\u00A0 KSP won\u0027t load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-30T14:58:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2021 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by JB182\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
