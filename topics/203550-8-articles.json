The chances for a class-wide failure requiring remedy to affect a synod launch, without getting a waiver for at least resupply, (sunk cost FTW!) is slim, but is also the reason the mars base keeps supplies on hand for a missed synod. The chances of two sequential synods both being obstructed by critical, class wide failures... AFTER successfully getting a significan population to mars, is ridiculusly small. But Falcon Heavy can still throw the most essential supplies to mars if that happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022going with the full intent to stay rather then visiting to learn *how* to stay\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont understand the difference. Nothing is going to be perfect on the first go. every problem that arises is a learning experience, one more thing that needs to be mastered for an independant mars city state. Going to stay IS learning how to stay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also seem to be positing that there will be some diffictlty that is completely insurmountable, no matter how much mass they can sling to mars. I do not buy your arguments here. Even something as fundamental as gravity can be compensated for with spinning carousels. And building said carousels out of martian iron, makes it that much easier. (carousels are not in the current plan, because they probably wont be needed. But they are an option if they are.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey, if you have a functional fuel plant, which the first crew will set up, you can always bring everyone home packed in like sardines.

Don\u0027t take Angry Anstronaut\u0027s word as gospel, they are absolutely meaningless given that he made absolutely zero calculations in the video.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe comparison you make there is meaningless. It takes 2 minutes from 10 km on earth to sea level with the drag created by starship; without any atmosphere and earth gravity, the same process would have taken sqrt(10,000/9.8)=32 seconds. But there\u0027s no place on mars where the atmospherical density of mars is equal to the one at earth sea level, or even at 10 kms of height for that matters, so the two cannot be compared.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second part of this that is uncomparable is the flight profile. On any starship hop, it is vertically up and down. On mars, it is the exact opposite, that is almost horizontal. There is no horizontal terminal velocity, only vertical, which means the atmosphere is going to bring you as close to zero as possible horizontally.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThird, you talk about free fall. This is not free fall, at all. Going at terminal velocity always means that you *aren\u0027t* in free fall, in fact the vomit comet to simulate free fall has to use its engines to compensate for the atmospheric drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, never take a youtube video as a source. Make your own calculations about what is being talked about, or better yet find a reliable source talking about the problem to see if it actually exists. This one in particular literally cannot exist, the drag created by a particular shape can be throughly verified in computer simulations and doesn\u0027t need real testing nowaydays. They were testing the control from the aero surfaces, engine reliability, cold gas thrusters, pressure holding of the tanks etc, but nothing like that. it is clear in the video that Angry Astronaut completely misunderstood the nature of the test\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-13T16:05:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2021 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Beccab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"southernplain","CreatedById":204094,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-13T16:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224003828\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626149882\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUS wants to go to Mars, because that\u0027s where they wanted to go to during cold war to beat USSR and back then, we didn\u0027t know just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0crappy Mars\u0027 surface is.

To add more on to what K^2 said, the reason people got interested in going there in the first place originally was because of the \u0022canals\u0022 that were popularized by Percival Lowell in the late 1800s. Then in the early 50s when ICBM development began, space travel became a very serious possibility which numerous entertainment companies took advantage of. Part of the reason Mars is automatically accepted as the next target for space exploration after the Moon is \u0022because Von Braun said so\u0022; Disney\u0027s Tomorrowland episodes on space exploration were instrumental in shaping US public perception of space. Likewise I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the interest in Mars in the USSR/Russia comes from early 20th century works of art (like the movie Aelita), and then considering these same people responsible for propaganda then had to create new works during early Space Race, they\u00A0naturally chose Mars as a dreamy target, as it is what they did before.

A colony would fly/float, and would likely be so massive it would be hard to tell you were even in the air. To use an Earthly example, despite regularly getting sea-sick on ocean liners or having trouble sleeping on trains, many passengers of German trans-Atlantic rigid airships in the 20s and 30s found no issues travelling and staying multiple nights aboard the airships. And if the gravity is lower anyways, you are likely going to feel uncomfortable to a certain extent.

Given that we don\u0027t have very much data at all about partial gravity environments it isn\u0027t fair to say that Venusian gravity is Earthlike\u00A0for humans.

Every single built environment on Venus needs to be shipped in except for the atmosphere and what we can extract from it. For example, we can mine water ice on Mars (using techniques we perfect at Shackleton crater on the Moon), and bury habitation modules in regolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224003867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626160022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other thoughts-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Safety and perhaps mental anxiety for colonists is a huge improvement, if the Mars city suffers a breach it has the potential to explode, the counteraction of such a problem of which would require building the city in segments that can seal off in an emergency. Versus on Venus where while the air will begin to leak, it will do so slowly, and it poses no threat to the colony itself (the outside toxic atmosphere will not mix with the inside fast, and it will not drop altitude quickly).
