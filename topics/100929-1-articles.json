NOTE: I download DRE 6.5.2 Beta but when I install it, and click on the button, it always reads 6.4.0...\n\nInstalled DRE as per the instructions. When running first time it created the ModuleManager.ConfigCache and ModuleManager.ConfigSHA at GameData folder. DeadlyReentry folder is at /#gameroot#/GameData/\n\nThe DRE Icon appears in the top right of the screen, just left of the resources tab (as it should, i think) and when I click it I can set the difficulty, so everything appears to be normal, so far.\n\nIssue: I simply cannot get anything destroyed, so much for \u0022deadly\u0022 reentry ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI even tried to raise the value of shockwaveExponent to a whooping 2 and nothing happens, I re-enter with no heat shield, at 45 or plus suicide angle and the worst I could get so far was to kill the kerbals by applying excess G force. Even the flame effects are less visible than those without DRE.\n\nAny help?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T09:29:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jaeleth**"}]}
