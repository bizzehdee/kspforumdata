But wouldn\u0027t that be too overpowered? I think the optimal solution would be an engine-angler adapter for Mk.3 fuelsages, that\u0027d angle the engines to have the Center Of Thrust looking towards the Center of mass. Why this would be good is that there\u0027d be no overpoweredly high gimbal, and you could use all engines (maybe not 3.75 ones, but the others).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
