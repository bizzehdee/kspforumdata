It was one of those rage quit moments for me last night. Seems like ever since 1.0 was released, I\u0027m always finding some game breaking bug with either stock or some core mod for the selection of mods I\u0027m using with a particular install that forces me to quit that save and try a different selection of mods or hope the next release of KSP fixes said bugs and not introduce new annoying bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try FAR out later today when I get a chance.

Still having the phys. warp issue during reentry, that and that parts are apparently heating too quickly under phys. warp for some people indicates a stock issue for me there. Without any phys. warp, FAR on stock used up about 50 units of ablator for a 600km x 30km reentry.

FAR helps a little with a reentry in KScale2, but not by much. Still uses about 120 units more of ablator to reenter compared to stock scale.

It barely weighs anything, so that can\u0027t be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note though that they don\u0027t have a \u0022explodes upon depletion of ablator\u0022 trigger. The only thing the ablator does is cause a negative heat flux in the heatshield. In other words, it\u0027s like a \u0022consume this to instantly shed x kilojoules of heat energy\u0022 resource. This prevents the heatshield from achieving a high temperature, because once the temperature rises above a certain point, ablator starts to get consumed in exchange for cooling the shield down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means that it\u0027s perfectly viable to have a heatshield that runs out of ablator during reentry, if the craft safely completes the maneuver. Running out of ablator just means that the heatshield temperature will rise unchecked until it explodes or stops receiving reentry heat. If you have enough heat capacity left in the shield, you might just finish your descent before it gets there. Especially since at very high temperatures, radiation flux increases significantly, which slows down the accumulation of heat. So adding ablator is not your only means of strengthening a heatshield; tweaks to maxTemp or even emissiveConstant should also increase the amount of protection it offers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, we now have this overcomplicated mess with internal temperature and two different skin temperatures and internal-internal conductivity and skin-skin conductivity and internal-skin conductivity and whatnot... you\u0027ll probably have to look into the exact causes of heatshields failing on reentry to understand where the bottleneck is. The shield could explode due to too high internal temperature, or due to too high skin temperature, and you need to treat them differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you\u0027re testing, could you also test interplanetary aerobraking? I\u0027ve heard people say that reentry in stock KSP is a tame little kitten while other planet\u0027s atmospheres are bloody axe murderers. Claims like \u0022ship instantly exploded upon touching Jool\u0027s atmosphere trying to aerocapture\u0022. I\u0027d assume that a scale increase would worsen this problem. Of course, whether or not timewarp was involved may have been a factor, I don\u0027t know; that\u0027s the problem with the current discussion, hardly any two people discuss things based on identical premises, because nobody seems to have all the facts. And here too, the question is: if stock KSP has that huge discrepancy between Kerbin reentry and other planets, does FAR have it too? Or does FAR\u0027s voxel drag model result in a less drastic difference?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard it claimed that the heat simulation is distinct from the aerodynamics simulation, and runs off of entirely different values than in 1.0.2, which for example results in the fact that restoring the 1.0.2 aero absolutely doesn\u0027t produce the proper 1.0.2 heating behavior. If that\u0027s true, that implies that using FAR wouldn\u0027t make that much of a difference.

As Kopernicus becomes more popular and stable, and people make more configs for custom planets and such, it will become progressively more difficult to keep up with them all, even with just the popular ones. I chose to do OPM and Trans-Keptunian because I feel those two planet packs bring an experience most comparable to our real solar system but still have that stock feeling. Unfortunately, I just do not have the time to consider making new configs for other planet packs at this time; I barely have time to play in addition to maintaining/improving my two plugin-based mods and I still have some work to do with the OPM/Trans-Keptunian configs (Paul released an updated version of KScale2 that I have yet to make adjustments on my configs for).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a generic update script you mentioned, like Streetwind mentioned, its often not as simple. The code snippet you have is very much what I have for most of the planets/moons, but there are exceptions since the planet packs need to work together differently in certain places. For example, Paul\u0027s original config for Eeloo simply doubles the radius and SMA, but OPM does additional things such as moving Eeloo to be a moon of Sarnus, so there was a conflict I had to resolve (and I admit that my solution probably was not the best for future-proofing since it involves a change to the original KScale2 config, I plan to resolve this). Another example is Trans-Keptunian adjusts its planets to work with OPM, so I had to account for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the planet pack simply adds planets and nothing else, the general snippet you provided would work most of the time, you would just have to apply it to each planet. An overlooked problem I quickly found is making sure the planet is of the right mass. If only the mass is provided in the original pack\u0027s config, you will need to quadruple the mass to maintain the same surface gravity (g = G * M / r^2); if only the surface gravity (geeASL) is provided, you don\u0027t need to do anything; if both mass and surface gravity values are provided, the mass value needs to be deleted like you have in your snippet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping KScale2\u0027s Github repository would be updated to the release so I could fork and do a pull request with my configs, but I may just create my own repo that would install as a separate config pack.
