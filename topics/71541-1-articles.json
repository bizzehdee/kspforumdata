However, since the mun, Kerbin, and Kerbol are all in the same plane, There would be a rather lengthy eclipse every day, right? And to make matters worse, the mun \u003Cstrong\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E tidally locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I understand it, the rotation of the mun is its sidereal rotation, and the time for one of these to complete is 1 day, 14 hours, 36 minutes, and 24.4 seconds. Am I doing this right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this looks like a related rates problem to me, but I don\u0027t know how to set it up, and I\u0027m not sure how to handle the eclipse. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T14:56:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the wiki, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn is indeed tidally locked with Kerbin, and i don\u0027t believe that the eclipse that would take place every M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar day actually affects the solar panels as it would in reality. I believe you should use the Synodic Rotation, which in the case of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn (someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong here), should be the same as the Synodic Orbital Period since it is tidally locked. So, it\u0027s actually, as far as the game is concerned, a fairly simple problem. You only need to have enough battery power to get you through half of the Synodic Orbital Period, or 19h 35m and 57.7 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RenevB","CreatedById":110395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T15:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say don\u0027t worry about the eclipse. The Mun is going fast enough that it\u0027ll be negligible compared to the night.
