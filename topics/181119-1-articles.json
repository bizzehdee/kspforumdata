It could be an incompatible mod, but I\u0027m not sure which one(s) might be involved. At first I thought perhaps it was because I had \u0027Dragable Navball\u0022 installed, but I uninstalled it and they are still missing. Of course it is probably some other issue, but could be something left behind?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T08:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you in an early career game?
