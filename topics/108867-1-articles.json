I\u0027m not talking about after expenses, I\u0027m saying that they are literally charging me money to accept contracts.\n\nI also tried activating Unpaid Research Program at 50%, and now every contract provides literally zero Reputation.\n\nIt seems to me that these programs are siphoning off twice as much as they should be.\n\nI should mention that I\u0027m taking the contract screen at its word. If it is actually giving me the right values but telling me the wrong ones, I wouldn\u0027t know.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T05:05:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SyX**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:52:46Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96162-Administration-strategies-bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96162-Administration-strategies-bug)"},{"CreatedByName":"SyX","CreatedById":38409,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T05:05:13Z","Content":"Ohhh, I see.
