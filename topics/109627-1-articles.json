After i got Valentina Kerman out and planted a flag, i walked back to the craft and boarded the plane. As i attempted to take off again, i noticed that the engines had stopped working. The status was \u0022Air combustion Failed\u0022. I right clicked the intake and the airspeed was 100m/s, even though the plane was perfectly still on the ground.\n\nI loaded the quicksave again and i noticed that whenever the plane passed directly overhead the north pole, or come close to it, the engines would shut down and restart after leaving the zone. It seemed to affect the vessel at any altitude.\n\nEdit: The anomaly seems to affect vessels that come about 20m within the north pole, at any altitude. **Not only did the engines stop working, control surfaces had stopped working and wings did not provide lift. The resource tab displayed no electrical charge and intake air resource.**\n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot :\n\n[**http://i.imgur.com/8olS8NL.jpg**](http://i.imgur.com/8olS8NL.jpg)\n\nI have noticed that this bug is only present on v1.0.2 and not on any previous versions.

I ended up killing the task and planted the flag a little offset from the pole.\n\nConfirmed on Minmus. I went to 0\u0027/0\u0027 at the north pole, and actually fiddled around to get on the exact spot. Driving over it caused camera spin out, but that happens in orbit too. But getting out and stepping on exactly the point causes this:\n\n![63X5qPC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/63X5qPC.jpg)\n\nWell, that looks wacky. Like you I tried planting a flag here. Doing it while in this whacked out state causes what you described, the kerbal is not just immobile but unresponsive to anything (but not dead), menus don\u0027t work, nothing works. I also killed the task and reloaded a quicksave; planting the flag one second off the exact pole caused no problems. So long as you don\u0027t plant a flag while you\u0027re tripping out, it seems you can just walk away from it and suffer no ill effects, though I don\u0027t know that I want to tempt it repeatedly. I gave the site a name I thought appropriate...\n\n![GYDQSfF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GYDQSfF.jpg)"}]}
