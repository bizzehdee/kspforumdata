I, for one, find that it\u0027s not the easiest thing to fly (It would probably work better with a joystick!), but the practicability and novelty of this craft more than makes it up (or at least, that\u0027s what I hope). Please note that I am no mulbin, and cannot work to his/her standards, but I give all of my crafts my best work. whether it be extensive research or design work (I had to go through several internal iterations to get it to where it is now), or perhaps large amounts of time spent on the drawing board. I hope that the PYLON presents itself ,at first, as a challenge, before becoming a friend, and finally, an unforgettable asset. know that this is not the definite model, but more the start of a new era in cargo spaceplanes. As 0.23 has been granted to us players, as have the players been granted less restriction in the realm of commercial competition and creativity. the PYLON could be seen as the \u003Cem\u003Efigurehead\u003C/em\u003E craft of ZodiaK industries, leading us into the unknown and untested.
