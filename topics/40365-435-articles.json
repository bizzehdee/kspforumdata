Am I missing something? Is this wip? I find the relay setting useless. When I look at the RemoteTech antennae config files, they state the antennae as being omnidirectional. I could not find such in the Phased Array configs. Hmmm?

I have done relay networks/\u0022constellations\u0022 before with RemoteTech, using only 3 sats at 120 degrees from each other at a Kerbalsynchronous orbit with much success. I have tried many different experiments with KSPI, and the array parts just aren\u0027t functioning properly for me. I have seen Wave\u0027s youtube video, used 4 sats at 90 degrees from each other at a 750km orbit and everything. I have the experimental version KSPI. I tried removing other mods too. I have a complete understanding of orientation and LOS, blocked signals by celestial bodies and so forth. I put a receiver next to a transmitter on the launchpad and got nothing until I pointed the arrays at each other using MagicSmokeIndustries parts. But for some reason, the phased array microwave transceivers don\u0027t receive unless I point within \u002B/- 90 degrees of the transmitter...even when the transmitter is in orbit. Even if I \u0022receive\u0022 a signal, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhen I switch from receive to relay, the joules drain to zero immediately\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003E I have let a sat rotate in orbit only to notice that if the phased array microwave transceiver is not pointing within \u002B/- 90 degrees of the transmitter, the signal is lost.\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t know what to say.
