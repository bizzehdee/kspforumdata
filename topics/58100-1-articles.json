How do you make a boat in stock ksp? how do the float mechanics work?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as you can make rockets, planes and rovers in a remarkable variety; so it is with boats. Just think of a boat as a plane or rover or even a horizontal rocket; only you want to get it into the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, the hardest part is simply getting the craft to and into the water without wrecking it. I usually start at the runway, back up to the shallow drop and then turn and drive parallel to the runway, to the coast. Near the shore where the incline is steeper, I turn and approach the waterline at nearly a 90 degree angle; going across the hill surface instead of straight downhill. This allows greater control of your speed and also lets you enter the water very slowly; otherwise its easy to break the boat when it hits the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s even a submarine mod out there, but I\u0027ve not tried it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
