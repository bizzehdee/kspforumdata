However, once they get loaded into the game, they only take up as much as an equivalent png or tga file. Ganinian, I would suggest converting the MBM files into TGA files. They take up more space than PNG\u0027s, but due to a unity bug, PNG\u0027s load very slowly. TGA\u0027s are also a great choice as they allow the player to resize the textures as he sees fit, which is very complicated with MBM\u0027s. The addons memory footprint in-game, however, will stay the same, no matter what image format you use. Anyway, 6 512*512 files are maybe a bit much for one engine - maybe you could resize some of the textures?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I came here to post: The Vigor looks quite a bit like a service propulsion system.
