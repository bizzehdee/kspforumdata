I used to play KSP on the PS4 and after this would happen I would have to delete that save and start a new one. The game also crashes a lot on the PS4 even just leaving the pause screen for 10 minutes, Its really annoying. I have ran into 3024 bugs on the PS4 that crashed the game. It can be as simple\u00A0of pausing the game, placing a part, flying a ship, crashing in to a planet, or just driving a rover. It really annoying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
