This pack is done to complement JNSQ and Precursors while being rescaled. (Both packs are homeworld swaps and this adds a secondary pack for late-game exploration). (The original is very glitchy and my poor PQS skills did not help). The new LSR will have up to 106 bodies, although initial releases will only have 5-7 bodies with more being added. I won\u2019t use parallax because it is out of my skill level and also due to the already-data intensive mod pack (the texture size depends on the body, with some having 2048x1024 while others having 4k or even 8k textures). The pack is scaled to JNSQ (2.67x scale) to make it more challenging, and the homeworld is a super earth. Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnnamed planet pack (please give name suggestions) consists of a single planet orbiting between Duna and Dres (with no moons planned) that has 32768x16384 textures. This size of textures has never been attempted before and is possibly the human limit before RAM issues start coming in. The planet will be as optimised as possible to keep the file size under a gigabyte. The terrain will be very very rugged and detailed in order to show off the planet in \u201Call of its glory\u201D. There will also be a dense and thick atmosphere for air breathing engines to work (which allows exploration and ascent significantly easier).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadius: 2,000km (3.33x Kerbin)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface G: 2.44G (23.9m/s^2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass: 27.1 kerbins\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtmosphere: 75km, 20 atmospheres\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbit: Beyond Duna (28,000,000 kilometres)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScale: 1x (normal)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLSR will be built over a year and is very ambitious, so the first release will take place in August featuring just the 4 stars and a planet or two. The detailed mod pack will be released very soon, possible mid-july.
