It then tries to download them from archive.org and eventually the whole program crashes...I can manually download the mods from the domains myself, but then I\u0027m struggling to make sense of how to install Spectra manually and ensure it runs correctly. I tried to follow a video from 2018 (linked below) to install it, but it seems things have changed since then and the current advice from the mod creator is to install with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m wanting to know how I can either fix things with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, or get some guidance on the manual install side of things. I understand you have to drag and drop the files into Gamedata, but when it comes to the \u0027extras\u0027 that Spectra has I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve installed them correctly manually.\u00A0 When I have attempted a manual install, I don\u0027t get clouds generating despite having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, and I tried to drag and drop the \u0027Spectra_EVE\u0027 clouds file to no avail...so I\u0027m guessing I\u0027m not doing that quite right regarding where I\u0027m dropping them? Also, the sun looked like a blob when I manually installed, which indicates again I didn\u0027t do the \u0027extras\u0027 quite right...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny support would be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zE_jCyR9QY4?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Installing Spectra Visual Compilation\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SwagdalfTheCray","CreatedById":229332,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-08T21:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, after about 20 plus attempts at downloading on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E it finally worked!
