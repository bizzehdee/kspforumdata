(So that you can get things to synch up). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Are the speeds of sliding parts affected by scale? Eg, does a speed of 5 mean a certain number meters per second (so distance traveled per second is independent of scale), or a certain percentage of extension change per second (so that distance traveled per second depends on scale)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Can all joint parts be \u0022free moving?\u0022 (So pushing on a hinged rod, say, would cause the hinge to move to the pushed position, or like using a piston as a shock absorber).

Can you strut to the surface of a rotator part? (Sometimes this seems to be OK, other times it seems to prevent rotation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* What is the base sliding/rotation rate of the various parts? (So that you can get things to synch up). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Are the speeds of sliding parts affected by scale?

Try using KJR. New parts (from Zodius Model Rework) are less prone to this, but you cannot defy laws of physics with them too, like using a small hinge to lift/rotate a 30t craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No, and it is not planned. But KOS is really easy, or just wait until we release an API for IR and somebody creates a smart-trigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I\u0027ve had issues with that too, but with KJR installed it is rarely needed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) This information is somewhere in part.cfg. But if you start using Zodius Rework parts you may notice that they are all synced (he put a lot of effort into it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Please wait for new release (we\u0027ll post a pre-release version soon-ish in Addon Development). The whole concept of speed was redesigned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) No, parts have to be designed to be free-moving.

I will certainly check out the rework parts, and KJR does seem to make a decent bit of difference (I was just using this when I thought to come back to this thread to mention that it does help somewhat with the \u0022bouncing\u0022 when moving parts stop moving).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to what\u0027s coming next!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: All these questions came from an attempt to build robot legs driven by both rotators and pistons simultaneously (part hierarchy built on the rotatrons, piston is strutted in the VAB and also docks to the rest of the leg on launch - with a part between the piston and the port) to increase rigidity and load capacity, and reduce post-movement-wobbles. I\u0027ve actually found that the slight inbuilt flexiness of certain stock structural parts helps a lot here... it means the synching doesn\u0027t have to be perfect (which is good, because it\u0027s really really hard to get the timing right given the obtuse geometry). First proof of concept attempt below. Still a bit of shaking at each end of movement but that\u0027s probably because a) the timings aren\u0027t right and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E There really should be a third rotator at the lower end of the piston.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://gfycat.com/IncompleteFlusteredKomododragon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gfycat.com/IncompleteFlusteredKomododragon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
