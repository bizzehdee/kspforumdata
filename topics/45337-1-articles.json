I have finally made a mining base on the Mun using extraplanetary launchpads and kethane, and now I am ready to build a space ship capable of interplanetary travel and landing. There is just one problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you build a ship capable of landing \u0022belly first\u0022, it tips over because using fuel moves the center of mass. Balancing the fuel doesn\u0027t really help, because the engines weigh too much. I have yet to make a ship that has overcome this problem, however I do have a few ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a mining/launching operation on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse it to launch a spaceship capable of landing on the side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse said spaceship to launch probes into orbit of all the planets of the kerbin solarsystem, and mining/launching operations on every moon.

As you use fuel, your center of mass moves towards the heavier part of your ship, either towards the front or the back. This means that your center of lift does not line up with your center of mass, which results in rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T19:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat exactly do you mean by \u0022belly landing\u0022 though? Are you referring to a VTOL that\u0027s built around a horizontal stack rather than a vertical stack? Then it\u0027s all about where you keep your fuel and your engines and balancing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built this kethane rover simply by building the rover first then placing its landing tanks radially onto the CoM and balancing engines onto the ends of those tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i818.photobucket.com/albums/zz102/Johnno17/Kerbal/KethaneRover_zps6cd5e4c0.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KethaneRover_zps6cd5e4c0.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruinsage","CreatedById":81262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T21:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, attaching fueltanks to the side of the craft at the center of mass is the easy way to do it on the small scale. But when you want to build something interplanetary, and still want it to look sleek, it becomes quite a bit more complicated. Right now, I\u0027m building a craft by first finding the center of mass of the fuel tanks, and then designing everything so that the fuel center of mass is right on top of the combined center of mass. This is annoying, as the engines are rather bulky, meaning i have to make it rather asymmetrical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother design idea i\u0027m tinkering with, is to detach the engines when the craft is in orbit. This, however, is quite a lot more.. fiddly. This is why i created this challenge. I wanted to see how others could overcome this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i were a modder, I would create a mod to balance the thrust of engines in such a way that the center of thrust is on top of the center of mass. Alas, I am not, so I will have to design my rockets around the problem. Perhaps I should create a mod request on this forum, I can imagine this could be beneficial in other cases as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T23:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing interplanetary is just about assembling stuff in orbit if it\u0027s too heavy for direct launch.

And to that end you haven\u0027t made a scoring system, no requirements list, and the goals, especially #3 aren\u0027t really something you\u0027d expect from a challenge.
