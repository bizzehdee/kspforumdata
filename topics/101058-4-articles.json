These are the cnc mill, the smelter, and the karbonite smelter. They all get unlocked at the same time as the 60 person apartment building. The reason these come over is to allow the construction of a type 1 civilization\u0027s base or space station with technology they could reasonably possess (robotic manufacturing).\n\n- Civilians will now generate \u0022Rent\u0022 at a rate of 100 funds per civilian on a ship per kerbin day so long as their needs are met. \n\nPlans for 1.2\n\n- Future expansion to this mod will add \u0022morale\u0022 and a government building, which turns the rent into adjustable taxes. You can increase the taxes on your base to pay higher at the expense of morale, or reduce taxes to get more morale.\n\n- Morale will change the rate that resources are produced/consumed on your base as well as effecting how much money you actually get out of taxes.

However they should be - it\u0027s a permanent base. So I thought how do we get all that on the surface of a moon/planet and connect it all up nicely, without having to strap rockets/wheels to it to get it into place? A permanent structure shouldn\u0027t move, buildings here aren\u0027t wheeled/skycraned onto their final site. You build it there.\n\nExtraplanetary Launchpads has the ability to generate ships in-situ, on a launch pad, and I\u0027m sure thats the best way of getting these massive structures at least most of the way to their destination, build it nearby. But you still need to wheel/fly it over, off the launchpad.\n\nThis is sort of EL\u0027s camp but it only applies to this mod (and MKS a bit but those modules are smaller) - what if EL could generate the ship in-situ, rather than needing you to wheel it into place? If you could pinpoint where you want the building to be generated, and then tell the construction dock to \u0022build it over there\u0022, that would match up a little better with reality.\n\nWhat we have right now is fine in KSP, even with FAR I can get ridiculously shaped rockets into orbit. I could if I tried get most of my designs into a proper shape with a fairing, using folding arms/panels etc, but with something like the biosphere I don\u0027t think a fairing will help! So, in-situ construction is my way forward, and I think that could benefit from the above or something similar.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T14:46:53Z","Content":"EL has that in the form of survey stakes ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pasty2k2","CreatedById":61163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T15:22:19Z","Content":"Really?

You place the origin stake, the x\u002B and the z\u002B stakes and you can build a rover or base part right on the surface.\n\nIf you\u0027re building a ship from the spaceplane hangar then x\u002B is forward and z\u002B is to the right (as you built it in the SPH). You can still get ground clipping issues if the ground slope changes over the size of your build.\n\nAbout the survey stakes...\n\nI found that EPL seems to measure the distance to a stake based on the distance from the center of mass of a ship rather than the location of the survey pod (in MKS\u0027s case the command center). This prevented me from designing Ares City 1.0 in my career mode in that I couldn\u0027t build modules out even though I had a command center survey pod less than 10 meters from the stakes. The detection range is 20 meters from the looks of it. My biodomes have a 30 meter diameter so you\u0027d have to pack the city close around a single biodome for EPL survey stakes to work. \n\nI made the extraplanetary garage part in my stanford torus mod before I knew about survey stakes and it pretty much saved my base building. It\u0027s basically a launch pad that is specifically designed to show you which way is \u0022up\u0022 when you build a ship from the Space Plane Hangar. Up on it is the post with the electrical hazard marker. I don\u0027t want to overlap parts from my mods any more than I did with the resource converters so i\u0027m not bringing it over to Civilian Population. \n\nI\u0027ll go make a request over at EPL to make survey stake detection distance based on the location of the part with the survey station on it as I\u0027d rather prefer that method to building bases. It\u0027s cleaner and easier to use.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T16:07:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07**"},{"CreatedByName":"pasty2k2","CreatedById":61163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T17:30:59Z","Content":"Very cool, though 20m seems a little limited in range (for these big bases), would be better if it were 20m from any existing part on that ship..
