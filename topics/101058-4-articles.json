This prevented me from designing Ares City 1.0 in my career mode in that I couldn\u0027t build modules out even though I had a command center survey pod less than 10 meters from the stakes. The detection range is 20 meters from the looks of it. My biodomes have a 30 meter diameter so you\u0027d have to pack the city close around a single biodome for EPL survey stakes to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made the extraplanetary garage part in my stanford torus mod before I knew about survey stakes and it pretty much saved my base building. It\u0027s basically a launch pad that is specifically designed to show you which way is \u0022up\u0022 when you build a ship from the Space Plane Hangar. Up on it is the post with the electrical hazard marker.
