What you can do in there is activate things.

But not a lot of details on the nuts and bolts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, yeah, the debug menu comes with a lot of baggage for some people. My personal philosophy is that it\u0027s your game, play it how you\u0027d like. If it feels cheaty to you, then skip it. If you feel like checking it out, do it. Although personally I find that once I start using cheats on a game to circumvent difficulty, the game itself becomes less rewarding. So I suppose that\u0027s my own personal level of \u0022feeling cheaty.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027m probably opposite of you in that I\u0027ve mostly been a sandbox player, and have only recently motivated myself to really drill into a career game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xkadlecm006","CreatedById":134883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T05:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, if you want more editing stuff such as moving your ships between different orbits and planets or even move whole planets try HyperEdit (kerbaltek.com)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
