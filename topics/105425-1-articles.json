I thought I bought in at 1,281.73:1, but it\u0027s actually 12,812.73:1 at 5% commitment and 78k buy-in. The developers do not make numbers easy to read in this game. A simple comma would be nice or maybe getting rid of the unnecessary decimal. Did a contract for 18k and ended up with 0 science gains with only this strategy active. I should be getting 1 for every 13k. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of off-topic, but: I thought the grind fest would disappear with a tree rebalance, but the tree is still full of nonsense (i.e. Jet engines without Jet fuel tanks, fixed landing gear (for jets?), ALL vehicle wheels requiring an upgraded facility to research rather than being spaced out in a sensible progression). 35:1 R\u0026amp;D ratios were far too generous, but 13,000:1? In this already existing grind-fest?

This can help out quite a bit in late game contracts since funds scale by the contract planet in large factors. A mission to Eeloo could net funds in the millions. This has shifted Outsourced R\u0026amp;D to be more effective later in the game when funds are more abundant, and not as necessary. In the early game, it is indeed not worth losing the funds over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing you want to keep an eye on is the commitment level. Consider this, at 5% commitment, you are losing 5% of your funds, and every 10,000 of them converts into one science. This means you would need 200,000 funds in a mission to see one science. (5% of 200,000 = 10,000) So later in the game, when funds are scaling to much greater amounts, and at higher commitment levels, Outsourced R\u0026amp;D can be a great source of bonus science. It isn\u0027t meant to be a primary source of science, but an auxiliary \u0022bonus\u0022 source. Imagine a late game ARM contract that awards 2.5 million funds - at 50% commitment, you\u0027d net an extra 125 science out of this contract.
