Each cell is a specific point in space, and stores data. It is a somewhat medium-large scale space however, default and minimum of 20km*20km on kerbin. If there are miniscule changes to the cell because of a tiny local factor, then miniscule effects will occur. You can however increase the grid level in the settings menu on the main menu of ksp to grid level 6, where the definition is 10km*10km on kerbin. or at maximum on windows 32bit grid level 7 which is 5km*5km on kerbin. If you are running the 64 bit version of ksp on linux, then you can go to whatever grid level your heart feels content. Note: every grid level doubles the accuracy, and will greatly increase RAM as it goes up the levels. the amount of cells PER LAYER is 10 * 4^n \u002B 2. grid level 5, which is the default, has 10242 cells per layer, and each WeatherCell is ~100B and the default is 5 or 6 layers per planet with atmosphere, excluding the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, KWS is also very configurable in it\u0027s CPU usage, you can tone down how often it does the cell updates, and how many cells it updates each weather tick. So if you cant handle the 50 cell\u0027s worth of calcs every 0.02 seconds, then you can tone it down to say, 25 or 10 or 30 cells per tick and you\u0027ll have less CPU usage. Although this is calced in real time, if you have the same startup conditions every time, you\u0027ll have the same outcome everytime, because of cause and effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) on the note of sound effects, I\u0027d love to have some wind sounds, and thunder cracks, but I lack the experience and time to implement them.

Your experiment with the intake air modules would probably fail because of the way intakeAir works.

I cannot recall the name of it, but there were issues with mods that adjust a certain stock module competing with each other, which prompted both mods to share-write that custom module to integrate with the flight director. You may want to look into that, seeing as this is likely going to interact with that same director. Could be a potential issue with compatibility in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silverfox8124","CreatedById":125032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Quiana, ModuleFlightIntegrator is what you\u0027re talking about, and I have talked to ferram4 about it.
