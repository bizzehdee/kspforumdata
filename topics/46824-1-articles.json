Despite having an 800 isp and 60 thrust, the weigh 2.25, as much as small diameter half fuel tank. In comparison, the LV-909 weighs .5 and has 50 thrust. I just performed a test with a small parachute on top of a small capsule on top of a small half fuel tank powered by an LV-909. After a vertical decoupler, the lower stage was a small diameter quarter tank on top of a full tank on top of an LVT-45. I launched completely vertically and made it to 1,275,000 meters. (The second stage ignited at 11k feet, almost in a vacuum, so the isp was already quite near optimal.) I performed the same test, except I swapped out the LV-909 for an atomic motor. It made it 525,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Although the atomic motor is just over twice as efficient as the LV-909, it\u0027s thrust-weight ratio is worse due to its much larger mass. Therefore, it is actually more efficient to use an LV-909. If you have enough fuel, the atomic motor\u0027s efficiency may eventually outweigh its thrust disadvantage, but at that point, you\u0027d probably be better off using a more powerful LVT-45, so your burns don\u0027t take forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m insane, but this makes sense to me.

One is highly efficient, produces x amount of thrust, and uses only 10 kg fuel per second. However, because the TWR is low your vehicle accelerates slowly and it takes 25 minutes to reach orbit.
