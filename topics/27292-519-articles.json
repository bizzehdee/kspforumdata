The most expensive part to bring to m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit was the big orange fuel tank, which should contain sufficient fuel for landing 10 times.

Like, it works and everything! I\u0027ve played with space planes previously, but I\u0027ve honestly never been able to make anything that worked at all. I tried a space shuttle, but it keeps tipping over and imolating itself on the pad from being too unbalanced. So I mounted 4 of the large 1.5m tanks around the space plane with 4 of the regular SRBs and it makes it to space BARELY and I can put a satellite in to orbit from the payload bay. I think if I reduced the thurst on the SRBs to more like 60% or so from 75% (going WAY to fast in the 8k\u002B range and wasting fuel on aerodrag), it\u0027d give me the extra dV to either haul a more substantial satellite (IIRC, it is around .75t what I tested on the launch) or more comfortably achieve orbit (I manages a 105x81km orbit with zero fuel left, but enough RCS to retro-\u0022burn\u0022 and return after launching the satellite).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebalanced enough with enough glide rate that I can pretty easily set it down. Only breaks off the engines 1 in 3 times (if I am not careful), but I have had zero crashes which broke up the entire space plane!!! It is a bit unbalanced if there is still fuel in the space plane though, which is a bit of a bummer, but between 80-100% full and 0-10% full (just the onboard fuel) it is extremely well balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T16:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finished upgrading my Hard Mode save buildings except for the Admin building (who needs overpowered strategies).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen set off to design a standard, simple and low cost crew launch and re-entry system which can get a 3 keb crew into a 130km orbit with manoeuvre capability.
