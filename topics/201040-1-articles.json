I don\u2019t have a picture, but look up Matt lowne\u2019s most recent geostationary network. Mine are carbon copies of his. The kraken shook them to peices. I attempted to deorbit the spinning satellites, and one almost did until- BOOM! 6 new peices of debri in orbit. The second, BOOM! 4 more peices. The third, the kraken tolerated and was successfully deorbitted.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuckily, I had a quicksave, and am going to deorbit the entire upper stage, satellites attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
