The only thing it\u0027s missing is that tyre screech and puff of smoke as the wheels hit the tarmac, that would really complete the space-plane experience for me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible for the tyres to screech and produce smoke under certain conditions, ie only when landing on tarmac and when horizontal and vertical speeds are above a certain point? It would be really cool if a bouncy landing would result in several squeals from the tyres!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T19:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, why not?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T20:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Sounds like an awesome idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Although most of my planes don\u0027t often land...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxjetterxx","CreatedById":37766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T20:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iStickyDuck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022iStickyDuck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Sounds like an awesome idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Although most of my planes don\u0027t often land...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI second this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T20:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAww yeah! *sstreeeach* second that!
