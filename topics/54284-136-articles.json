For greater than 0.5, it depends on badassness, courage, timed experience (using KerbalStats), and deed experience (stock).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBill Kerman: his stats should give him exactly 0, but thanks to the vagaries of floating point math he gets about -1e-8.

As just a workaround to the storage issue, timed builds seemed to be an otherwise useless mechanic (even though it\u0027s more realistic), thus productivity. It had some unpleasant unintended consequences: certain people started mass-murdering stupid kerbals and thus I created KerbalStats and its experience system.
