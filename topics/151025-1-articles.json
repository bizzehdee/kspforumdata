Rather than deleting the post, what does everyone think about pulsed plasma thrusters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about laser ablation as a means of propulsion since it\u0027s basically one of the proposals for asteroid redirect when I started to think about it for spacecraft propulsion. Laser ablation by itself probably has pretty terrible \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E so why not accelerate the gasses via electromagnetic propulsion? The propellant could be literally anything but probably an inexpensive inert metal would work the best (maybe?).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease excuse the crudeness of this, I literally spent 5 minutes in SolidWorks drawing it. So the 3 parts to it are the fuel which gets fed into one end of the engine, the laser that ablates the fuel, and an electromagnetic accelerator to eject the fuel at high velocity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHypothetically, you\u0027d like it to be adjustable because as you ablate it away it would need to be repositioned closer to the laser. There would probably need to be a shroud of some kind to keep the molten metal contained which I didn\u0027t draw. Then the accelerator accelerates said ablated material out the back as reaction mass. Exit of the engine is at the right of the picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022So2B4mv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022403\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/So2B4mv.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really have no idea if something like this would even work much less work well enough as a propulsion system so what\u0027s everyone else think? Someone may have thought of this already and there\u0027s something that I\u0027m missing that makes this a dumb idea. I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m not really that involved in novel spacecraft propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA drawback of this design would be the power consumption. I don\u0027t know how much power this would require to be feasible or if it would even be on par with existing ion/hall effect thrusters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think that a benefit would be having an inexpensive, easy to store fuel. You wouldn\u0027t need a high pressure gas tank on the spacecraft or really a tank of any kind. Hypothetically, it would be easy to refuel if it came back to Earth, just add a new chunk of metal to the engine. Fuel package space would be considerably less than existing ion/hall effect thrusters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027m not thinking about this right but at a high level, it\u0027s this: ablate solid with laser, accelerate ablated products. Would this work or not? What would you have to look out for if it hypothetically worked?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T19:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s a dumb idea because conceptually it should work.

What you\u0027re describing as fuel is actually the propellant or reaction mass. The fuel would be what you\u0027d chuck into the power generator to power this thing. Note that if you have solar panels, your fuel is essentially limitless \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe EM accelerator on the right looks like some sort of coilgun. While a single coil would be effective, you can increase the specific impulse by using multiple stages of coils. When the plasma reaches the center of the first coil, the second coil would be activated (and the first killed), so the plasma would accelerate some more. This continues until the last coil, giving the thruster an improved exhaust velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, you put forward a good point - this would consume quite a bit of power. I\u0027m guessing you can get by with solar panels for smaller applications such as satellite OMS, but larger things like manned spacecrafts would need either big panels or fuel cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xehpuk","CreatedById":170938,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T08:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read that usually ion thrusters use an inert gas like argon since it will do the least wear and tear on the engine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shikashi","CreatedById":152398,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T16:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA reacton mass of this density must make up for a truly wonderful \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E if you have a compact and low density electromagnet to accelerate it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T19:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightcraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightcraft\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
