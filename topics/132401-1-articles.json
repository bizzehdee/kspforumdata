When I turn it on the rover always keeps accelerating well beyond any speed I set. Does make following way point impossible as any turn leads to disaster. The one thing I have noticed it that when I set the speed to -2 it does slow the rover to a stop.. but not when I set it to -1.???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T17:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about the rover speed, but in the dev build of the 6th of January, Sarbian did fix few NRE concerning the rover waypoint system.
