For example rather than wings acting as flat plates, it would be nice for them to act as airfoils. The difference seems pretty academic until you try building an autogyro in the stock game and find that things don\u0027t work how they should.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo people think it\u0027s likely that the aero system will get overhauled?

speeds (so players can make craft that work over an unrealistically large range of speeds).\u00A0 It might also imply that he doesn\u0027t see aero as a high priority when he wants primarily to extend
