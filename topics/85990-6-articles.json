Simply going through the story, even if just once, is this \u0027goal\u0027. Again, the story wouldn\u0027t be the end-all of the game, it would simply extend the lifespan of career mode beyond the tech tree, and add something to do beyond getting more parts. Sure, doing your own thing is the real goal of the game--the story (told through contracts and science), like the tech tree, is just another part of career that pushes you towards accomplishing that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe career mode starts out by giving you contracts from the Kerbal Record Keeping Organization (or whatever the name is) to achieve certain milestones. This is the basics of a story mode already. Just expand that idea. Specifically worded contracts that ask you to do certain things, for exampe, land on the Mun before a rival space agency. This would be accomplished through several contracts detailing what the other space agency is doing, how your testing is stacking up against theirs\u0027, how far they\u0027ve made it so far etc.. A pre-built ship put into orbit with pre-defined maneuvers, acting as the rival\u0027s ship, could be the actual ship you have to beat to the Mun. You can try to just land before them, or maybe you will decide to destroy their ship- that could be up to the player. The rewards might be a bit more reputation than a regular contract, and like the others can simply be declined. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a very very simple (and not well thought-out) example of an early-game story line, but I think it illustrates the basic functionality of how it could work. The goal here is to not only complete a contract for money, science, and rep, but also to build on the game world. We know very little about Kerbal\u0027s world outside of the KSC..this would help us learn just a little bit more. Other \u0027plot lines\u0027 (or call them quests, or just contracts..doesn\u0027t really matter) could include things like searching for (and destroying?) the Kraken. Or a series of contracts that ask you to discover anomalies, all the while giving you some bits of back story (through science) as to why they might be there. The search for microbial life on Joolian moons (maybe you don\u0027t find any?) Any of these could work, but they are all basically just contracts and science- used in a way to tell a \u0027Kerbal\u0027 story, and add just a bit of gameplay and engagement to the end of the \u0027career tutorial.\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing I\u0027m suggesting is really unique, even...it\u0027s all been suggested before, and most of it already exists.

There are tutorials and there\u0027s sandbox where you can play around with designs and see what works and what doesn\u0027t if you have trouble in learning the ropes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you learn the basic concepts the tech tree is just a small speedbump that neither really serves the new player (at least after one playthrough) nor really challenges the experienced player and it\u0027s too easy and fast to serve as a driving gameplay mechanic for the career mode. So effectively it\u0027s almost redundant for anyone else but the person who plays for the first time and has enough skill to overcome the challenge, not enough skill to breeze through it and who\u0027s not too unskilled to be halted by it. So it\u0027s a very small niche who actually experience this as a meaningful mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily the new difficult options are some sort of remedy for this. But not to drift too far off-topic, I reeeeally hope they\u0027d make science somehow more interactive with the biomes.

I\u0027m not suggesting an \u0027ending\u0027 to reach. I\u0027m suggesting that the contract and science system be used to tell a (or more than one) story, to add fluff to the career mode. Simply going through the story, even if just once, is this \u0027goal\u0027. Again, the story wouldn\u0027t be the end-all of the game, it would simply extend the lifespan of career mode beyond the tech tree, and add something to do beyond getting more parts. Sure, doing your own thing is the real goal of the game--the story (told through contracts and science), like the tech tree, is just another part of career that pushes you towards accomplishing that. \u003Cp\u003EThe career mode starts out by giving you contracts from the Kerbal Record Keeping Organization (or whatever the name is) to achieve certain milestones. This is the basics of a story mode already. Just expand that idea.

Obviously new biomes mean random contracts popping up in them, but (and I very much hope to be wrong here) I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll ever include a chain of missions for interplanetary travel and exploration similar to the one that exists already for landing on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRex94","CreatedById":114868,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T10:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this thread seems to become a disscussion about where the Career Mode in general should go, to fit everyones playstyle and imagination. And i think thats a good way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me i think the TechTree and the way of gaining Science needs an overhaul as i already pointed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pages ago i also used the Term \u0027Endgame\u0027, but seeing the debate about this i would like to clarify what at least I meant by \u0027Endgame\u0027. I don\u0027t think we need a FINAL goal where the game is finished. What i meant is there should be a \u0027reason\u0027 why we are doing the things we are doing in career mode. Something like, you know, hey Jeb that trip to Vall wasn\u0027t for nothing. And that reason inside the gameworld, for immersion with the space program. Sure there is Fun for us as a player to go to Vall, or for Roleplay reasons or whatever you want to do in sandbox, but in career having a reason why the Kerbals are doing it gives you more immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027d be a good thing to ty Partunlocks onto \u0027Landed on planet X\u0027, as suggested earlier here, because that on the other hand would destroy the freedom to steer your Space Program where you want it and how you want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have the Science archieve collecting all the reports, maybe some change to that Science Archieve, giving it somewhat more meaning, could be the \u0027Endgame\u0027 reason we need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another personal thing: For me KSP is a game of Engineering and Exploration. The Engineering part is pretty good already, the Exploration not.

What we would need is an immersive outfleshing of the planets, giving us things for the Exploration taste of the game. Right now, you go to Duna, land on Duna, see:\u0027hmm its red and has some mountains\u0027, but no reason or feeling to do anything more than just do Science and go again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo two ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Procedural Exploration: We all need the same Planets and the same Terrain, to be able to talk about and help each other to get to the different places. But this doesn\u0027t exclude that we could all have our own Exploration once we are where we wanted to go. Think of it as an advanced Ground Scatter, procedural generated things at random locations (depending on biome and planet), where everybody can explore and ecounter things for themselfes. Sure after quite a time we would all know what can be encountered in which biome but we can\u0027t point an exact location, giving everybody some reason to explore.

Again, I am fine with open-ended, but I want in-game REASONS to do things. Yes, I can build a base if I like, yes I can build a station. There is not really a reason to do so in game. I want a reason. I like the idea of resources---in space---because they provide another reason to do something (which you can ignore if you like). I like the idea of construction, and more permanent facilities on the Mun, Duna, etc. Not landing things that I have to make Rube Goldberg machines to hook together (for no reason, since Kerbals would be happy forever standing on the surface in their suits). I want the ability to eventually tunnel (nuclear tunneler messed with at Los Alamos ages ago (had a lecture by the guy who worked on it), or to land habitat modules (lightweight), the bury them with regolith (shielding). I want a reason to do this though, perhaps extracting Hydrogen or Oxygen for use in life support or as fuel. I dunno, more options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome are not interested, but I\u0027d like to have some automation, both real \u0022robots\u0022 and kerbal pilots. For example, different probe cores capable of different autonomous actions, you start with remote control, then get some simple robots (a lander than can descend based on radar altimeter data, for example (thinking stuff that is really obligatory for something like RT to actually be realistic). Fleshes out the tech tree some, as for distant planets you\u0027d need automation given large time delays for remote control. Kerbal pilots? Yeah. What\u0027s the point of tracking their abilities when they don\u0027t use them. The player can always chose to fly every mission 100%, but it would be nice to have some routine stuff done by your astronauts at some point (launch parts for a station or ship assembled in orbit, for example). Even stuff like you send a CM home, get involved in something else, forgetting it, and the pilot could at least reenter and deploy the chutes (I lost a ship not realizing that I could not have 2 ships reenter at the same time (docked to bring a ship home from the Mun, then separated for each to reenter and land\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 ooops).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T16:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDont even care.
