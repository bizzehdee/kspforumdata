I\u0027m looking to do a new career game in the 2x to 3.2x range, but also want to go anomaly hunting with the appropriate Contract Configurator\u00A0contract pack (either Anomaly Surveyor or K-files). It would be really disappointing to finally make it to a particular anomaly, only to find it hiding deep underground. Currently using Hard Solar System 2X, bUT the first contract is to go to the island airfield, which is now hundreds of kilometers away.\u00A0Kscale 2 appeared to work, but wasn\u0027t compatible with OPM. Any advice would be welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
