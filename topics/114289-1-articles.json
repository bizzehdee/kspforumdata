So far I\u0027ve been playing KSP completely vanilla. While I certainly havent done everything there is to do, I feel I\u0027ve gotten a good idea of what stock can give me (Built a minimus refinery, several trips to EVE and Duna, One trip to Jool and its moons). I\u0027ve learned to play the game completely without aid (no mechjeb help, minor help from guides), so I think I\u0027m ready to start with some mods. I\u0027ve looked into some mods and put together a (long) list of potential mods I thought would be cool / useful. Having some suggestions on which are good, which arent, which are out of date, and which I\u0027ve forgotten would be great!

I recommend you start with a set of essential mods, and then once you\u0027ve learned how to use them and what they do, start transitioning to other things. Also, it really sucks to install a bunch of mods, only to have your game bug out and then having to guess which mod is doing it, or having to uninstall and reinstall them one by one. Better to add them gradually. Especially for mods like Kerbal Attachment System, Infernal robotics, or the large parts packs.
