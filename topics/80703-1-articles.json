These contracts usually means doing one or the other, but rarely at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to introduce campaigns that are planet/moon specific. Which means there is a common destination for the items you may want to test/bring along in your flight.

However it does give a lot of interesting things to do that is relevant to the destination. Once the Mun campaign is completed (or an alternate campaign is selected in the contract screen), the campaign will shift to another destination specific contract list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows for ships to be built with a specific overall goal in mind, and not a strange Frankenstein collection of unrelated parts to be tested at far away unrelated places. This will also cut down on having to do unnecessary repeat visits to the same destination to complete a contract, for example landing on the Mun and then months later needing to return to test an engine in Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to hear some feedback on this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-04T16:54:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2014 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Levelord\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
