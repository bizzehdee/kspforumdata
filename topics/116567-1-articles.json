Now, I know you can transfer your product key to Steam but since I don\u0027t like Steam, or Valve for that matter, I would love to have it on GOG instead. Is this possible? Note that I already *own* the game and I know you can buy an other license on GOG but that\u0027s not what I want. **I simply want the game on GOG instead of redeeming it to Steam.**\n\nIs this possible?"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T14:15:09Z","Content":"Just drag it out of your steam folder and play it by itself."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:18:26Z","Content":"Not possible, I\u0027m afraid.

I don\u0027t have steam or an updater to deal with and I get updates asap. I just wish I had not paid full price, but glad I did at the same time especially if this is still an advanced beta and things only get better."},{"CreatedByName":"Instresu","CreatedById":119022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:18:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Frankly I prefer the KSP website.

However, it can be a little bit finicky and the KSP site is sometimes *very* slow. Especially when a new version is released."}]}
