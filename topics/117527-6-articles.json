I\u0027m in the process of making RealChute patches for this mod, but I can\u0027t figure out if your radial chute is supposed to be a drogue chute or a regular chute. The tags suggest drogue, but the temperature values and altitude deployment suggest regular.

Suggestions?\n\nRegarding your above discussion, I think your reluctance/hesitation for RealChute support was something about the textures of the canopy getting overridden by RealChute? ~~I don\u0027t know much about it, but there is a module that you add the parachutes that specifies the texture library (see below). There is then a TextureLibrary.cfg in Realchute (link to relevant github page [here](https://github.com/StupidChris/RealChute/blob/master/Output/GameData/RealChute/Materials/TextureLibrary.cfg)) that has textureURL\u0027s (see below).

I probably just copied the wrong set of tags. My hesitation on making RealChute configs myself was just the complexity and the fact that I had no idea what most of the settings did.\n\u003E \n\nFear not, good sir! I made you a thing. It should work out of the box (untested) as long as you get rid of the second ProceduralChute module. Or the first. You really only need one of them! The first one is the bare bones, the second one does fancy things (like allow you to resize it in the VAB with the RealChute Editor), but the costs are kind of weird.\n\nThe way apparently all RealChutes parts work is that the smaller the chute gets, the more expensive it gets, and the bigger it gets, the cheaper it gets (at least that\u0027s my interpretation). You can adjust it as you see fit obviously, but I followed that guidance below. You don\u0027t have to even bother with that at all actually (and getting rid of the ProceduralChute module entirely is also an option, but it kills the player\u0027s ability to use the editor, but it can be useful in niche scenarios).\n\nAnyway, I explained everything to the best of my ability, line by line. It\u0027s a mess if you read it on the forums - best to copy to a text editor, preferably one with syntax highlighting as my explanations are in comment formating.\n\n**The Legal Bit**: my knowledge is piecemeal at best, cobbled together from basically repeated trial and error and peaking at other people\u0027s configs. It\u0027s probably not 100%, but it\u0027s probably enough to get you started in the right direction, if you so choose. Warranty Void if found to be less than 100% accurate (also please let me know if so!). When I get around to it, I\u0027ll see about posting some more configs.\n\nOh, how I got the numbers, since they should work as is. Regular Radial Parachute (stock Mk2-R) has 500 drag deployed; your\u0027s has 2000, so I figured your parachute is 4x as effective. I just flat multiplied the deployment diameters by 4 from the RealChute patch for the Mk2-R, while leaving everything else unchanged, except for a few adaptations to bring it inline with your chute\u0027s values (weight, cost, altitude, etc). Not the cleverest of solutions, but it\u0027s something. Just make sure this really is a regular chute and not a drogue chute, because drogue chutes this size kill everyone (with gravity mods) and rip a part things. If you want to make a drogue chute, scale down the diameter, bump up the altitude(s), lower the pressure, and switch the material to Kevlar. Either way, this is more for instructional purposes.\n\nAlso, a lot of of the values/variables from a stock parachute, as you\u0027ll see, straight translate to a RealChute. Thanks for adding \u0022automateSafeDeploy\u0022 to your chute by the way, I didn\u0027t know about that one!\n\nAnd that should be enough to get you started.\n\nCheers!\n\nre: Tags = yeah they reference \u0022drogue orange\u0022\n\nSpoiler\n\n//-----------NEVER MAKE A REALCHUTE PhysicsSignificance = 1!!!
