The ability to download mods, purchase DLCs, and just update the game takes me upwards of hours. However,\u00A0\u00A0unless there is a easier\u00A0way to install them, I believe a launcher that can do this on its own would be incredible. Even uploading ship designs would be a nice feature. Different operating systems have differing file layouts so a combatibility would be very helpful for new players who lack tutorials that use the same system as they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraston","CreatedById":188565,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-22T15:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere did you buy KSP?
