In fact it is the only condition which has completed at the space center. But that corresponds to the screeny in the OP which shows no green tick for the wheels condition and green ticks for all the other conditions which are showing incomplete at the space center as though the mission condition passes were somehow inverted between the two readouts and still the mission has not completed.\n\nSo this looks like a bug in the mission conditions."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T15:57:55Z","Content":"Yes, it does certainly look like a bug in the mission conditions though I suspect it wouldn\u0027t happen if the vessel had rover wheels so the contract should really make that clear (and the difference between the mission control screen and the in-flight screen should also be investigated and fixed).\n\nOne thing you might want to try (but make sure you have a backed up save first) is to retract the landing gear and then extend it again.
