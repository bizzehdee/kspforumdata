Their music is fantastic, but one of the main reasons that I want them to succeed so much is that they\u0027ve sacrificed wealth and fame to stay true to their fans and to their own creativity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few years ago they signed with Atlantic records and were even in Rolling Stone Magazine, but after creating an entire album with them, decided to quit, and never released the album. Why? because Atlantic wanted to change their style so they could sell some catchy singles for a $1.32. (Sorry...i\u0027m a little biased.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast October they released a new album, produced by a friend and written and released independently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was lucky enough to attend one of their concerts, in a tiny venue in San Francisco in January. In total, probably only 200 people were in the room; and most weren\u0027t even there to see Fictionist, they were only opening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could tell they were discouraged; one of their band members had left a few days before and it seemed like they were going to fade away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly though, they\u0027ve started gaining some attention through friends in Neon Trees and Imagine Dragons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently they are opening for Neon Trees and yesterday they released a music video for their most popular song in the new album; showing what it was like working with Atlantic and in the major music industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should check it out.
