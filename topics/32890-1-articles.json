The base is located in the center of one of the craters directly on the equator.

A skycrane perhaps, with its own landing cradle, which would be refuelled by the tanker? A large orbital fuel depot with its own tanker ship for resupplying the fuel station on the ground? A rover hangar, with a variety of rovers in it? A taller lookout tower with command seats and cupola pods, for an overview of the base? An aircraft hangar with a lightweight plane for low-altitude flights? Just tossing some ideas out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to install some mods, you could also add a kethane miner (or, if there\u0027s no deposit underneath your base, mobile mining rovers) and refinery, and RemoteTech actually does enable satellite communications.
