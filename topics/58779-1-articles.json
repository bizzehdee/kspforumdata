As the time since 0.23 drags on, I\u0027m starting to wonder if we\u0027ll get a repeat of that situation this time around. I don\u0027t want this. Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s a great update, and it\u0027s not like I\u0027ll stop playing KSP if there isn\u0027t one, it\u0027s just that it has a lot of bugs that could use a patch. If I can get an official dev statement on this, that would be great.

From what I know, a big part of Squad is on holiday, explaining why it drags on. We haven\u0027t had proper Devnote Tuesdays in the Daily Kerbal since KerbalKon for that reason, so I wouldn\u0027t be expecting an announcement soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we\u0027re to get an announcement on this, it will neither be now nor here. I\u0027d expect a dev blog about .24 and potential hotfixes to .23 when the team comes back from holiday but until then, I think closing this thread is best before it generates any rumors or spereads false information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread locked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
