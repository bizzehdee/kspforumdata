This meant that when it came time to come home, despite having around 500 delta v to spare for the Hohhman transfer I couldn\u0027t get the right exit trajectory, and had to reach escape velocity and improvise from there instead. With the last rockets and empty fuel tanks ejected I had just enough monoprop to adjust the orbit to get home, and then set up a steep aerobrake before fixing into a stable orbit around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s the problem: the original plan was to score the aerobrake, pull into equatorial orbit around Kerbin and from there dock with my space station, (equatorial eastward orbit at 105 km) to \u0022deliver atmospheric samples\u0022 or whatever the probe was supposed to be doing there. I\u0027m out of monoprop now though, so instead of that I\u0027m sending up a recovery team to dock with the probe, then de-orbit instead. Thing is, the orbit around kerbin is hardly ideal;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B4QCRzv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B4QCRzv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s travelling westward, with a descending node of -136.2 degrees relative to the space station (which itself is more or less equatorial). It has a periapsis of 428 kilometres and an apoapsis of 924.3 kilometres. The probe is simple enough, a stayputnik with a few antennae for decoration, some batteries and solar panels (running out of power isn\u0027t a problem, obviously), a single (now empty) 100 unit monoprop tank with 4 RCS thrusters placed around the centre of mass (well, the centre of mass when the tank was full) and a clampotron docking port (standard size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really really would like to collect it safely but my current attempts have been less than successful; I wait for the space centre to pass under a point of its orbit, then launch, but the difficulties lie in compensating for Kerbin\u0027s movement while trying to work out the right trajectory, while having a rocket with enough delta-v to carry up a team that can safely return and land home afterwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you guys go about it? I\u0027m no stranger to orbital rendezvous, having erected that station in 5 launches (including the hellish placement of a full jumbo 64 tank last) prior to the Duna mission, but it\u0027s getting into the right orbital inclination that\u0027s my issue. I don\u0027t know how useful it would be due to the orbit being in an opposite direction, but the station has a full Jumbo 64 Tank attached, so one could go up and dock with it to refuel and pull out a lot of extra delta-v if that\u0027s something that could be considered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T06:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, you could send a craft from the launchpad to a westward orbit. Then you could simply plan a burn at the AN or the DN and put yourself on the same inclination as the probe. Then since you simply rendez-vous with it as you normally would on an equatorial orbit. Docking is gonna be touchy as you\u0027re gonna try docking something small with something rather large, which isn\u0027t what usually happens, so you\u0027ll want to be extra careful on your approach speed as you could easily bump it off. Then you have too choices: either you return with it on Kerbin, either you dock to your station. Returning to Kerbin is simple, just deorbit. For your station it will be harder. The \u0022easiest\u0022 way to do it would be to burn at the DN or AN to change your inclination, it might take two burns since you have a 136 degree difference. Then you could rendez-vous with your station and dock as usual. Shooting straight from the launchpad to the same orbit as your probe is doable, but very hard, so I do not reccommend if you go with stock. MechJeb could do it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good luck! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"b0b349","CreatedById":32439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T06:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou sound like you know what you are doing more then I do. The only thing I can think of is to make an orbit at roughly the same angle, so that you are parallel to the station, then aim your rocket westward near kerbin and eastward on the other side. So that you rotate your orbit around the earth until it is lined up. Other then that I got nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reavermyst","CreatedById":65325,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T07:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be tricky to accomplish but doable! The main trick is to have plenty of Delta-v available for both your launch stage(s) and your orbital stage(s) to put your craft on a similar orbital direction and to match the inclination. This means turn Westward and fight gravity on your way into orbit which will take a lot more Delta-v than your typical eastward launch. If you\u0027re up for the challenge, you could try to match inclination during your launch, but in my honest opinion, it\u0027ll be simpler to pop a maneuver node down and do it in orbit. It takes a lot more Delta-v to do so, but it\u0027s easier to accomplish on a mental standpoint. You don\u0027t need to worry about the eccentric orbit of your target, in fact, that makes it even easier! All you\u0027d have to do is circularize your orbit on the same inclination(preferably in a much lower orbit), then pop up a maneuver node to figure out when the object will be at or near it\u0027s periapsis in order to conserve fuel for your transfer. From there, it should be the same old rendezvous scenario!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Chris mentioned, don\u0027t be afraid to get mechjeb to make these maneuver nodes for you. It\u0027ll save you lots of time and even help you determine where the Ascending and Descending nodes are really located in your orbit which is extremely important in determining the correct time and direction of your inclination burn. Shoot, if you just want the issue resolved regardless of HOW it gets done, you can let the auto-pilot do all the hard parts!

A phasing orbit is just a slightly different orbit that will intersect the target\u0027s orbit at one or two points(or get close enough for target mode). Since this orbit is \u0022inside\u0022 the target orbit, we will be circling the planet faster, and will gain a little bit of distance with every orbit. Watch the closest intersect nodes. As they get closer(you should get a feel for how much you are gaining every orbit) slowly expand the size of your phasing orbit so the increment of distance that you \u0022catch up\u0022 to the target orbit gets smaller and smaller. Once you get a node that\u0027s reasonably close(within 50km ish), create a maneuver node at your periapsis and add delta v until the intersects get close enough for a rendevous.(In this case, about 2 km) Since we have made \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E periapsis close to the \u003Cem\u003Etarget\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E periapsis, we can make adjustments there without throwing ourselves into a wild orbit and risk missing the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used probes for this so they don\u0027t have docking ports, but that\u0027s close enough:) Now you have your probe samples!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T07:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 07:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Uberick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enigma179","CreatedById":67703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T07:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the help guys!
