You say 6 million dollars, but if we go by the cheapest Steam prices of around 20$ as you say, as our \u0022average\u0022, then 500,000 sales equates to $10,000,000 USD, which leaves four million dollars in surplus even if every employee were paid 100K yearly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe surplus goes up tremendously if the figure for sales increases.
