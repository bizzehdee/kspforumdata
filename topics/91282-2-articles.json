There are a couple of things that make it so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know that it got to Saturn, that it entered Saturn orbit without apparent aerocapture, and we know that it took about two years to do this. It is possible to calculate such an orbit, and how much \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v is needed to do so.

Cassini spent seven years going to Saturn, and slower most often is cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it gets really difficult is when they go through the wormhole, on the water planet the ship did station keeping for about 20 years. That is not much, but I am sure it adds up, and without good information about the local environment, ship\u0027s interaction et cetera and drag parameters, it is essentially impossible to do. Further, they fly about between these different planets, of unknown orbital parameters, of to us unknown positions, and around a black hole, the mass of which we can speculate but not know for sure. We also do not know how efficient of orbits were used for this purpose, although aerocapture and gravity assist maneuvers appeared to not be performed. Finally, they somehow blasted themselves into a doomed orbit around the black hole, after the horrible docking event. This changed the mass of the ship, may have cost them fuel, and probably impacted performance to some degree. But really, that does not make that part of the calculation any more difficult, we knew so little before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ways to do it seem difficult to do. We know neither how much fuel they had, nor what sort of fuel it was, really. It did not seem to be nuclear, or ion, but perhaps chemical of some sort. But who knows? We may be able to estimate a lower limit of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v, by adding up some actual numbers and estimations, but I think that really the film gave us too little information to do something that can be answered with any certainty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus in sum, the Endurance had a ton of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v. More than any spacecraft to date. But how much is a very speculative matter.

Hydrogen\u0027s critical point is 32K. Meaning, above 32K, there is no fluid to gas transition. As you increase pressure, the supercritical hydrogen simply gets denser and denser. Helium\u0027s critical point is even lower. I don\u0027t recall what the rule for critical point of mixtures is, but either way, Jupiter\u0027s atmo seems way supercritical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first real phase transition you should hit, with a definitive boundary, is hydrogen to metallic hydrogen. Here, things start to get murky. I\u0027ve seen a lot of contradicting predictions for properties of metallic hydrogen. They range from ordinary fluid, to superfluid, to supersolid, to ordinary solid. All that anyone really agrees on is that metallic hydrogen is wickedly weird. If it is, indeed, a fluid of some kind or a supersolid, the probe will keep sinking. In fact, in superfluid or supersolid it will be almost dropping as it would encounter a very sudden reduction in viscosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you keep sinking through metallic hydrogen, eventually you will hit a solid core. The outer layer will most likely be solid helium. Bellow it, there is likely to be a rocky core as well. But that layer of solid helium is likely to be the first definitive \u0022surface\u0022 of Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yru0","CreatedById":94856,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T15:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould Orion get to the moon now?
