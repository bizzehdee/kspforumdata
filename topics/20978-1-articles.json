Now seeing as I would like the next thread not to get locked, and this topic IS one that has interested me since I first learned about development cycles and how Minecraft didn\u0027t really have one, please discuss your opinions here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for one find the Minecraft system to be strange and inefficient. Minecraft has technically been in full release for about almost a year now and yet it still feels like a game that is in development. The game is definitely NOT feature complete, bugs are still rampant in the game, they are still doing major things with the base game itself (Like combining SMP SSP and the Mod API) I find that dumb things were added into the game (Snowmen?) while certain things were hinted at but never really implemented (I can ride pigs, but I can\u0027t ride horses...). Developer says they don\u0027t want to just add new blocks and resources for the hell of it, yet we get Lapis Lazuli (Which STILL doesn\u0027t really have a use)These are just a few things that frankly confuse me about Minecraft. Please don\u0027t misunderstand me. I like Minecraft. In fact, I think it is one of the best games ever made and THE best thing to happen to the industry in quite some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you are. What are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T01:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate Minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love Minecraft \u002B Tekkit/Technic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E reason I bought the game was those mod packs, and I won\u0027t play on a server without them. The base game is incredibly banal and tedious, with incredibly little complexity. To me, that proper mod support has taken so long in its development is an \u0022oddity\u0022 to me. Minecraft...is a game I want to love, but the only way I can come to like it is with a whole lot of customization with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and there\u0027s the sad downside that MC is fundamentally limited in some ways because it\u0027s written in Java. The cross-platform compatibility that provides is great, but it\u0027s added some more obvious limits on graphics performance. Hell, I still can\u0027t run MC with AA turned on, and in a game where nearly everyline is orthogonal, that\u0027s pretty darned annoying and noticeable. (Curse you ATI/AMD and your crap OpenGL support.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
