FreeIVA will work much better with support from the original mod author, much easier to take into account at ground level when building the IVA for a model/part\n\nThe problem you have here is that IVA\u0027s are generally quite time consuming to being with. modelling an exterior part can vary from quick and simple to drawn out and complex, this I soften determined by the level of detail and any animated parts involved. IVA\u0027s tend to start at more complicated than the part they are attached to and then get more so as the level of detail goes up, difficulties can arise if you want to end up with an IVA smaller than the part its going in when the part is small to begin with.\n\nThen to add to that, to incorporate FreeIVA compatibility you will need additional physics colliders on your Internal Model (and on the correct layer: 16) as well as colliders for any Props that you may be choosing to use. None of these are beyond the wit of an individual who is already making a model but its an additional consideration that has be taken into account and planned for (that and making sure your bulkhead colliders have a hole large enough to pass a Kerbal though).\n\nNote, colliders need to be thick enough to not let kerbals pass through but also no so thick as to upset the layout/physics of adjacent IVA\u0027s"},{"CreatedByName":"nervv","CreatedById":179484,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-14T18:20:07Z","Content":"Hello.

IT is still very slowly in development. [@pizzaoverhead](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/26349-pizzaoverhead/) has been working on this but there are multiple other projects of his and of course IRL stuff too.
