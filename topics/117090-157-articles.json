The torus ones, are strictly habitat. I\u0027d say the smaller ones (especially that cute, little one) could be used to store stuff for stations/craft. I wouldn\u0027t go as far as putting ore in them, but fuel would suffice. Maybe have them store life support? I\u0027m not sure how you could switch out from a habitat to a storage tank, but these are just ideas. I\u0027ve seen where the Nautilus X has several of these inflatable types on there for either hab space, storage or even laboratory work. \n\nNot going to go into texturing a lot, since that step isn\u0027t prevalent at this point and time. But, I\u0027d say keep them white-ish. To make them separate from the rest to not make them look like they\u0027ve been constructed in a kerbin sewing sweat shop, I\u0027d say add segmented seams, especially on the torus ones. Because, I\u0027m sure they will not be one piece of material, if you applied it to a real life material construction concept. Not really sure on how hard that\u0027ll be to accomplish on a model, but it\u0027s a thought. But, definitely for the fuel switching, a mylar/gold texture would be a nice touch. \n\nLike I said, these are just things to ponder and I am not requesting anything.

I have not seen it pop up during any of my testing, so chances are there is an external patch or another mod that is messing with one of the parts (or the part is just not setup properly to begin with).\n\nSpent a good chunk of yesterdays development time re-re-examining the possibilities of adding some basic ModuleSwitching, thanks to some prodding and motivation from [@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/).\n\nI\u0027m glad to report that in this specialized case it appears that it will work out.  So now most of the StationCore parts can have optional and swappable docking ports.  There were a few caveats that I had to work around a bit, as the stock code still really doesn\u0027t like some aspects of it, and I\u0027m not fully confident that it will be without errors; but so far it has been working.  If this initial use works out I might be able to add other similar uses to other parts/modules in the future.\n\nThis means that the modular station parts will have 5 components/modules; top dock, top, core, bottom, bottom dock.  Sadly I was not able to add docking ports for the sides of the hub-top caps, so the integrated hubs have 1 port (optional) \u002B 4 blank attach nodes... which is still better than no ports ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nDOS/COS/HAB modules will all have the optional docking ports, potentially the MST (modular solar truss) as well, though they are less needed for those as they would likely use the welding docking ports.  With this added functionality the COS/DOS modules are pretty much exactly as I had intended them from the beginning, and the DOS modules should even work well as single-part-spacecraft (as they have engines, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar, fuel, hab, and now docking ports).\n\nCurrently doing a bit more cleanup on the docking port module-switching (ensuring module order is maintained across scenes), and then will be doing a quick balance pass on the rest of the parts to make sure they are at least close to where they should be.  Few other things on the issues list that I\u0027ll be taking a look at, and then will be packing up the release shortly after that and hopefully have it available later this afternoon.\n\nAlso a quick heads-up that I\u0027ll be out of town for part of next week and week-end for another camping trip.  I\u0027ll try for an updated testing release on Wed. from the feedback between now and then, but if that doesn\u0027t happen for whatever reason it\u0027ll have to wait until I return (sun/mon).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Gerbwerz said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am seeing tons of this span with Exception Detector mod installed (100s of throws per second for updateHeat) plus the SC-C SM keeps decoupling spontaneously when I switch scenes and return to it.

In Roverdude\u0027s notes, these should be derived from the mass. Since much of the point of SSTU is combining parts, it wouldn\u0027t be appropriate (or balanced) for the multiplier to be equal to the mass of the entire module - instead this should have a multiplier based on whatever the \u0022payload\u0022 mass should be of the module. Probably not more than ton or two for the multiplier (exercise equipment, etc.), but the KM\u0027s can be the total mass of the module, more or less.  \n\nAside from fiddling with the exact numbers, I think that all works in a fairly sensible fashion.  \n\nIn terms of required space for supplies - a Kerbal eats 16.2 supplies a day, so a 90 day mission consumes 1458 supplies, which means that a two person crew noms through about 3000, or about 3 tons. Since that\u0027s more-or-less within Progress capabilities, that makes sense to me as a baseline.  \n\nI\u0027d be tempted to not include any recyclers in the DOS parts at all (and certainly no processors), but that\u0027s also worth thinking about.  \n\n\\*  \n\nST-HAB-A through D are relatively simple to sort, since they\u0027ll provide a bonus to Kerbalmonths relative to their mass (whatever their mass ends up being).  \n\nThe ST-COS-xxx modules are a little harder to grok right now, since they are currently a lot more generic than the DOS modules, and don\u0027t easily split into multipliers/non-multipliers. You can make a really good argument that the rotating torus parts (ST-HAB-E through H) will grant multiplicative bonuses, but again deciding how much they should have is awkward here."},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T00:32:42Z","Content":"One option for the ST-COS modules might be to treat them as generic, multipurpose modules - they do a little of everything, and therefore supply a small amount of multiplier, additional kerbalmonths and recycling. This would mean that individually they wouldn\u0027t be anything special, but if you strapped enough of them together they would sum to something significant."},{"CreatedByName":"Gerbwerz","CreatedById":164268,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T00:36:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Gerbwerz said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ok so ran some tests on the SM engine activation on the pad with a fresh KSP install.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here is my mod list:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/VIUUl4x](http://imgur.com/VIUUl4x)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As soon as I add TCA (and its 000\\_AT\\_Utils) to the game and put the rocket on the pad it activates the engine on the SM.
