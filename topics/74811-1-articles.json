Then I turned south and went from 30 S latitude to 40 S latitude, taking depth measurements every quarter-latitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I found is this: You can clearly see on this graph where I crossed the upper and lower lips of the smiley face, deeper ocean rifts between 1100 and 1300\u002B meters deep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b344/planettom/ksp/kerbinsmiley3a_zpse878e357.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbinsmiley3a_zpse878e357.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, I\u0027m cheating out the wazoo on this, using unlimited fuel. Phase 2 is to manage this without cheating; design a sub that can just be kerplopped in there at the deepest part and make a stable descent. Not quite sure how I\u0027d get it there though --- either by rockets, or maybe somehow making a big barge-transport boat, rolling the sub onto it, and transporting it all the way to 28 south 276 east and rolling it overboard...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jedensuscg","CreatedById":76475,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T02:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got the SCANsat addon installed and am using for my new career documented in my sig, I wonder if that could pick up the \u0022Kerbal on Kerbin\u0022.
