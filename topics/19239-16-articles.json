If we get ISP in the neighborhood of 4000s, how low will the thrust have to be for balance? 4? 5?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI typically think of it in terms of metric tons for weight, and kilonewtons for thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, note that the NERVA is a 1-meter part. I think that an ion engine could be a 2-meter part with a much higher weight but similar thrust to the NERVA -- that would allow a usable amount of thrust to remain, but would decrease the thrust-to-weight ratio. A 2-meter NERVA could then be added with similar weight, but lower efficiency and a higher thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples off the top of my head would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00222-meter VASMIR\u0022 data-cite=\u00222-meter VASMIR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight = 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust = 60\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp = 4000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00222-meter NERVA\u0022 data-cite=\u00222-meter NERVA\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight = 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust = 400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp = 800\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor something to that effect.

I will be first establishing a good space infrastructure in the Kerbin system, and then sending single-man orbital craft to Duna and Eve to test fuel consumption. (I already have a craft designed that worked before I found the fuel bug, and it works even better using the fuel bug). After that I will be designing more orbiters with NERVA, maybe some landers, and possibly even a permanent Duna ground-base. I don\u0027t know about orbital stations before docking comes out, the launch stage without docking would need to be massive and I\u0027m pretty sure my computer would disagree with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oicani","CreatedById":15361,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T18:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dragonfree97\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dragonfree97\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1cICb.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/1cICb.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one I made earlier\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty cool.
