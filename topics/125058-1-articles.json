Anyway was playing around and noticed the Wheesleys throwing sparks like they have no fuel or air. After a bit of investigating it seems they are intake air deprived despite having what was sufficient intake previously. Tried lots of different intakes, same problem. Built a test rig. Two circular intakes cannot feed two Wheesleys and only one Wheesley up to 80%. It doesn\u0027t improve if you add more intakes, that\u0027s about max output currently for a Wheesley.
