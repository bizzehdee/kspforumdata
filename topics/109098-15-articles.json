It requires yaw rate sensors and a processor that provides a signal to an actuator connected to the rudder. The use of a yaw damper helps to provide a better ride for passengers, and on some aircraft the yaw damper is a required piece of equipment to ensure that the aircraft stability remains within certification values.\n\nHere\u0027s an article on [Dutch Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_roll), also from Wikipedia, and then the page I linked in my last post also talks a lot about the Dutch Roll mode in particular. That\u0027s if you\u0027re interested in more on that subject.\n\nI guess I called it the wrong thing - its yaw *damper*, not yaw *dampener*. But it\u0027s basically a flight computer system that sends the necessary signals to the control surface to counteract unwanted oscillatory motion, which is what the SAS modules do in KSP (hence my prior recommendation). I\u0027ve added SAS to my planes that have had static stability/dynamic instability, and can confirm that it does help matters (with a minimal amount of change to an overall design to boot)."},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T20:20:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, select rotation gizmo, click on the part you want, press **F**, turn on angle snap.\n\u003E Then, click on any direction of the gizmo, it will snap to the nearby global snap angle.\n\u003E \n\u003E Just move it around a bit and it will align perfectly with the SPH.\n\u003E \n\u003E Now you can align anything, anywhere.\n\u003E \n\u003E Good for landing gears ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nFixed."},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T06:24:52Z","Content":"I was wondering why it did not work, haha. \n\nAnyways - I will have more screenshots for you aerodynamic-heads on friday. \n\nWith my latest design(the one I didn\u0027t post screens of), with a dihedral angle of 5 degrees and a second wing section, I manage going suborbital.\n\nBut by adding more fuel to be used for the rocket circularization burn, I lose quite a lot of speed and I am forced to start the rocket engine around Mach 2.5, at a maximum alt of 20km.

That shows speed when you expirience largest drag before going supersonic. Tricky thing abut it is that all engines behave different on different speeds, chosen engine for your craft must have enough thrust at given speed to breach trough highest drag speed to supersonic speeds.\n\nOnce you breach speed shown in critical mach number, drag becomes lower, but lift from wings too, so you must find sweet spot to get highest lift with low drag as much as possible to get highest L/D ratio.\n\nAs nuFAR is released, lots of people are focused on new cross section area feature and forgot about old still valid points in craft building.\n\nL/D ratio is still of high importance for given craft and payload it needs to carry. With low weight payload it is better design with low drag area as much as possible.\n\nWhile you don\u0027t have much lift from wings, you are still able to take off plane from runway due to high TWR ratio from engines that alows plane to accelerate quickly.\n\nOn high speed altitude such plane does not have much lift from wing, but it have much lower drag that gives pretty much high L/D ratio.\n\nWanderfounds Kerbodyne craft fleet are good example for such design aproach, although those designes don\u0027t offer much room for any pilot mistakes.\n\nWith KSP 1.0.x we also got some major changes with engines, overall ISP that engines could give is much lower than it was in KSP 0.90 and older releases.\n\nMeaning, large craft that was capable to reach orbit in 0.90 does not have enough fuel to do the same in KSP 1.0.x\n\nIt is still possible to create large spaceplane, but due to lower ISP, you need to carry more fuel to counterpart this, so more fuel weight cuts off payload weight that you were able to carry in 0.90. Assuming you are using same type and number of engines as in 0.90.\n\nAdds area ruling on top of that and you got quite a chalange to design craft that is capable to carry as much as payload as possible, still be able to take off from runway and reach low Kerbin orbit.

This actually seems a reasonably slick shape but it definitely seems to like all 7 rapiers, so I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s the shape - currently at 20km/1200m/s, L/D of 2.5/absolute drag about 400kN - or just how it is in the current state of things.\n\nI\u0027ve tried Mk3-\u003EMk2 converter and adding extra engines which gave the best aero result so far, but that has major clearance issues. The quad converter didn\u0027t really seem to add anything over just sticking engines to the bulkhead of a Mk3 piece..."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T10:11:18Z","Content":"Speaking of overcoming drag without area ruling:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You will most probably need to adjust control surfaces i a way that yelow line does not cross x axis at higher AoA angle than 15 degree.\n\nIt does not have always be 15 degree, it depends from one craft design to other, but point is that you most probably want to set controls in a way that when you picth with 100% of authority, point where yelow line cross x axis should not be higher than point where lift/drag lines starts to split.\n\nYour craft will be less maneuverable in that way, but much more stable and easier to control, because you will less likely fall in stall.\n\nOther way to overcome this problem is to be careful in piloting, so you do not pull controls too hard when you fly at low speeds, only to 70% of maximum available pitching.\n\nIt is hard to do it with keyboard control, so i more often use limiting pitching control in my craft designs to overcome this issue.\n\nAnother thing that may help, is [dynamic deflection mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116888).
