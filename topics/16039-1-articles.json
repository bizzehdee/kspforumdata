Munzer then did a descent run and landed back at base after an orbit (I forgot to record this). After refueling his pack at the crew base (see attached), he waited another orbit, and ascended to a successful rendezvous with Scott.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to start slightly ahead of the orbiting capsule, spending most of the fuel on horizontal speed, and lining up the suborbital trajectory with the orbit.
