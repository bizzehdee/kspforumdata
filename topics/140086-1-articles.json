Rule of thumb for aspiring inventors - patent first, publicize afterwards. Some countries (the US most notably, although the rules there have got a lot stricter recently), allow a so-called grace period in which inventors can disclose their inventions but still get a patent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you don\u0027t need a patent to do anything. Patents aren\u0027t permission for you to use your invention - they\u0027re a legal right to stop other people using your invention. That can work in all sorts of ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I create an HIV drug. I plan to make that drug available at cost to developing countries.

The inventor agrees discloses how his new idea works, and the government agrees to enforce a 20-year\u00A0exclusive use arrangement for the inventor. This benefits the inventor, because he is now (theoretically) guaranteed two decades of potential profit, and it benefits the government, because after those 20 years have elapsed, the invention becomes\u00A0available for public use. Everybody wins.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is to keep your invention a trade secret. If you simply never explain\u00A0exactly\u00A0how your invention works, then no one else can reproduce it. Coca-cola did this with their recipe for their eponymous product. Trade secrets, unlike patents, give you the ability to profit from your invention for far longer, as long as no one figures it out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t patent something that someone else invented and produced, even if you came up with the idea independently, and even if they never patented it. If something is already being produced, it is considered \u0022prior art\u0022 and so the government will not consider it to be patentable; they are only interested in patenting ideas that otherwise would remain trade secrets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past, ownership of a patent was based on who invented it first. So if Carl\u0027s Crab\u00A0Cafe and Alice\u0027s Awesome Eatery both file a patent for bacon-wrapped seaweed\u00A0at the same time, but Carl has emails proving he invented bacon-wrapped seaweed first, then Carl would get the patent and Alice would not. But just a few years ago, the USPTO changed the rules. Now, the patent is awarded to whoever files first, regardless of whether they actually invented it first. This encourages people to file sooner rather than later, sharing their invention earlier and resulting in more progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you create an idea and decide not to patent it, but just begin production, your competitor\u00A0may actually still be able to apply for a patent. However, if they attempt to enforce their patent, you can show that you were already PRODUCING the invention, making their claim prior art and getting their patent thrown out. You can also get their patent thrown out if you can show that the idea was already published long before either of you came along. That\u0027s what happened with Blue Origin and SpaceX; BO took out a patent for barge landings of first stage rockets, then sued SpaceX for trying to land their rockets on barges. SpaceX pointed out that the Russians had published plans to land rockets on barges long before, and BO\u0027s patent was tossed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you don\u0027t mind other people using your invention but want to keep someone else\u00A0from patenting it, you can file a patent directly into the public domain for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisclaimer: not a patent attorney, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T13:11:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T13:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222590572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140086\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463663217\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t patent something that someone else invented and produced, even if you came up with the idea independently, and even if they never patented it.

For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCarl writes an email to his chef dated January 1\u00A0mentioning an idea for bacon-wrapped seaweed, but they don\u0027t make any. On May 1, Alice comes up with the idea for bacon-wrapped seaweed and applies for a patent. Under the old rule, Carl could apply for a patent after Alice, citing his January 1 email, and he would get the patent. Under the new rule, Alice would get the patent because she applied first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCarl has an interview with a newspaper on January 1 and mentions that they will be adding bacon-wrapped seaweed\u00A0to their menu, but they never do. On May 1, Alice applies for a patent on bacon-wrapped seaweed. Carl points out that he already published the idea in a newspaper four months earlier, and so the patent is thrown out and both Alice and Carl are free to sell bacon-wrapped seaweed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn January 1, Carl begins selling bacon-wrapped seaweed to a small number of his customers, but doesn\u0027t put it on the menu. On May 1, Alice applies for a patent on bacon-wrapped seaweed and puts it on her menu. Carl sues, alleging that he came up with the idea first. He loses the lawsuit, because he can\u0027t stop Alice from making it since he never applied for a patent, but Alice won\u0027t get her patent because Carl was already making the stuff.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn January 1, Carl files a patent for bacon-wrapped seaweed. On May 1, Alice begins selling bacon-wrapped seaweed. Carl sues for patent infringement. Alice\u0027s lawyer finds a trade magazine from 1981 which discusses the possibility of bacon-wrapped seaweed, proving the idea is \u0022prior art\u0022, and Carl\u0027s patent is thrown out, leaving both parties free to sell it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne critically important point is the difference between #1 and #3. In case 1, Carl merely came up with the idea. Under the new rules, this won\u0027t keep Alice from getting a patent on it if she comes up with the idea independently. In case 3, Carl not only came up with the idea, but developed it and began producing it. In this case, Alice can\u0027t get a patent on it. This difference demonstrates the value of actually developing and producing an idea. Anyone can come up with an idea, but you have to actually do the work (either by producing it or by going through the patent process) or it\u0027s really not worth much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should also be noted that after any of the above cases, Peter from Peter\u0027s Pleasure Palace can come up with a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emethod\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efor producing bacon-wrapped seaweed, and that is a new idea which can be patented \u0022on top of\u0022 the old idea, regardless of whether the old idea is patented or prior art or anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T15:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWARNING: Just because you patent something, there is no guarentee that somebody doesn\u0027t come by, make an improvement, and patent that improvement. \u00A0This happens in any system that awards patents on inventions, because this is what inventions really *are* (read/watch some James Burke if you don\u0027t believe me. \u00A0That\u0027s his schtick). \u00A0In modern systems built to encourage patent trolling (more by the vested\u00A0status quo fending off disruptive tech than the official \u0022patent trolls\u0022), expect any interested parties to patent up all possible\u00A0implementations. \u00A0At that point they have an effective patent on it and you have nothing. \u00A0An example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLempel and Ziv invent dictionary-based compression. \u00A0They create LZ-77 and LZ-78 (happened in 1977-78 obviously)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelsh adds an improvement to create LZW. \u00A0Sperry files a patent (patent applied for in 1983, published in 1984)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpencer Thomas write \u0022compress\u0022 that implements LZW (1984), and in the process fixes a few things to make it possible. \u00A0Apparently it wasn\u0027t public domain (not that such is possible any more), but I\u0027ve never heard of a license being required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Compress\u0022 becomes the heart of compression, going on to power .Z,.gif, .pak, .zip (with a huffman backend) and others. \u00A0Result: Sperry-Univac owned\u00A0*all* of it [patent granted in 1985, and\u00A0has since expired], thanks to the LZW patent. \u00A0While I\u0027m not sure how much they managed to grab out of the whole sordid mess, it certainly damaged the LZ systems in favor of other less encumbered systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T19:25:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by wumpus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded dates\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T19:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo guarantee at all and that\u0027s a part of how the system is supposed to work.

Not because they\u0027re intrinsically a bad thing, but because unless the patent offices is\u00A0very careful (and historically it hasn\u0027t\u00A0always been terribly careful), a software patent can end up being far too broad and\u00A0covering the entire problem to be solved, rather than a particular set of solutions to the problem. It\u0027s a tricky balance at the best of times - narrow patents can be essentially worthless because they\u0027re too easy to work around, whereas broad patents can stifle progress entirely by handing an entire technical field to one party - but for a long time I think software patents fell squarely into the \u0027too broad\u0027 camp. Typically, the USPTO has now swung entirely the other way and getting any sort of software patent - even for a sensible invention - is an absurdly whimsical process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T19:48:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T21:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222591213\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140086\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463687165\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also not necessarily true that interested parties can patent up all possible implementations leaving you with nothing.

Under the old rule, Carl could apply for a patent after Alice, citing his January 1 email, and he would get the patent. Under the new rule, Alice would get the patent because she applied first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCarl has an interview with a newspaper on January 1 and mentions that they will be adding bacon-wrapped seaweed\u00A0to their menu, but they never do. On May 1, Alice applies for a patent on bacon-wrapped seaweed. Carl points out that he already published the idea in a newspaper four months earlier, and so the patent is thrown out and both Alice and Carl are free to sell bacon-wrapped seaweed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn January 1, Carl begins selling bacon-wrapped seaweed to a small number of his customers, but doesn\u0027t put it on the menu. On May 1, Alice applies for a patent on bacon-wrapped seaweed and puts it on her menu. Carl sues, alleging that he came up with the idea first. He loses the lawsuit, because he can\u0027t stop Alice from making it since he never applied for a patent, but Alice won\u0027t get her patent because Carl was already making the stuff.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn January 1, Carl files a patent for bacon-wrapped seaweed. On May 1, Alice begins selling bacon-wrapped seaweed. Carl sues for patent infringement. Alice\u0027s lawyer finds a trade magazine from 1981 which discusses the possibility of bacon-wrapped seaweed, proving the idea is \u0022prior art\u0022, and Carl\u0027s patent is thrown out, leaving both parties free to sell it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne critically important point is the difference between #1 and #3. In case 1, Carl merely came up with the idea. Under the new rules, this won\u0027t keep Alice from getting a patent on it if she comes up with the idea independently. In case 3, Carl not only came up with the idea, but developed it and began producing it. In this case, Alice can\u0027t get a patent on it. This difference demonstrates the value of actually developing and producing an idea. Anyone can come up with an idea, but you have to actually do the work (either by producing it or by going through the patent process) or it\u0027s really not worth much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should also be noted that after any of the above cases, Peter from Peter\u0027s Pleasure Palace can come up with a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emethod\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efor producing bacon-wrapped seaweed, and that is a new idea which can be patented \u0022on top of\u0022 the old idea, regardless of whether the old idea is patented or prior art or anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThought first to file was applied to multiple 19th century patents like the radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nProduction methods is another case.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also support that coming up with an idea is not enough, you need an prototype\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne issue of many idiot patents around, mostly software patents on web page\u00A0interfaces\u00A0is that it has been previously use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
