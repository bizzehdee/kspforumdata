But the principle answer is easy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure out how the current density of the universe needs to be changed right now to completely stop the expansion. How much mass would you need to add to the visible universe to achieve that? That\u0027s your answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ballpark number to expect would be the total mass of the visible universe including dark matter and dark energy. Dark and regular matter apparently was dense enough to significantly slow down the expansion once, and you need to compensate for the extra dark energy that has appeared since them. So that would be about 10\u003Csup\u003E53\u003C/sup\u003E - 10\u003Csup\u003E56\u003C/sup\u003E kg. Err, and that mass has a Schwarzschild radius of 10\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003E-10\u003Csup\u003E13\u003C/sup\u003E light years... where do you plan to put it? Of course, with that size, it no longer is an ordinary black hole, it interacts in interesting ways with the cosmological curvature and dark energy. The actual radius of the horizon would likely be much smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s the other way to get a bearing on your answer: The outer reaches of the visible universe appear to be moving away almost with the speed of light. What gravity force is required to reverse that? Right, an event horizon almost right behind them. So you can expect to need a mass big enough that it would usually generate a black hole with the radius of the visible universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it impossible due to the fact that gravity only propagates at C?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you magically let so much mass appear, you inevitably break the known laws of GR everywhere in the universe at least at one time.
