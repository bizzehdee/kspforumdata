The original Mechjeb was pretty damn good at transferring to the Mun but in 2.0 it completely ignores aerobraking when using the Hohmann transfer and sends me flying around into the orbit instead. Is there something that I\u0027m doing wrong to confuse Mechjeb somehow? Also is there any way I can just set my node\u0027s myself and get Mechjeb to handle the procedure?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T19:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two different threads going, which are trying to bring mechjeb up to speed too its lastest release.
