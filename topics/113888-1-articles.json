Do those actually do something? The folding radiators do have them, but they have two modules to go with them. If they do draw heat significantly better than say, a wing, is the effect comparable to what the folding radiators do? I have a hard time believing that... without extra modules, they would only draw heat from the parts connecting to it, and then only if said parts were hotter, right? Even if they have the numbers to radiate better than the average part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
