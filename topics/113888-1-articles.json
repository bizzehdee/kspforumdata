The folding radiators were quite straightforward, with weird thermal stats like heavy insulation, high temperature, and a special module that I imagine is what pulls heat form the rest of the ship regardless of location, after the one that look quite clearly like the animation for the model.\n\n    heatConductivity = 0.001 //They have built in insulators\t\tskinInternalConductionMult = 2000\t\tradiatorHeadroom = 0.75\tthermalMassModifier = 2.5\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleDeployableRadiator\t\tanimationName = Deploy\t\tretractable = true\t\tpivotName = Pivot\t\traycastTransformName = Panel_006\t\twindResistance = 5\t\ttrackingSpeed = 0.1\t\t}\t\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleActiveRadiator\t\tmaxEnergyTransfer = 12500\t}\n\nThen I opened the non-folding ones and... yeah, they have a couple of extra lines:\n\n    \theatConductivity = 0.75\t\tthermalMassModifier = 5\tradiatorHeadroom = 0.5\n\nSo... Do those actually do something? The folding radiators do have them, but they have two modules to go with them. If they do draw heat significantly better than say, a wing, is the effect comparable to what the folding radiators do? I have a hard time believing that... without extra modules, they would only draw heat from the parts connecting to it, and then only if said parts were hotter, right? Even if they have the numbers to radiate better than the average part?\n\nRune. That would make the choice easy... but the part a waste of texture.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T19:49:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rune**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:01:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E S N I P\n\nPersonally I don\u0027t care what they do.

Call it Kwatts. I mean in the .cfg, one of those numbers (or a combination of them) has to determine how much heat they dissipate per unit of time at a given temperature, right? Like, say, mass. Or thermalMassModifier, but that\u0027s equal among the same type of radiator. Wonder what it does. Anyhow, I\u0027m hunting for that one so I can compare among the different models, and see if, say, four of the small ones dissipate more or less than one of the big ones. Or what number of fixed radiators you need to get the same performance as a single deployable one. If there was some indication like a made up number in the description of the part ingame...\n\nRune.
