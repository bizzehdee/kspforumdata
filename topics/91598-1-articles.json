Having the ability to know where a specific Kerbal has been is a cool way to boost immersion and attachment to our Kerbals. My idea to expand this into Kerbal Ship Experience includes two ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew Hangar Building\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhile the ability to recover a spacecraft for full price is great for spaceplanes, it seems rather immersion-breaking to, after recovering a vehicle on the runway, sell it for 100% funds and then build a replica. Instead of the ship being liquidated into funds after a successful mission I propose the inclusion of a Hangar Building. After landing at and only at KSC, the player will be presented with three options when he mouses over the altimeter: 1.) Exit to Space Center, 2.) Recover the vehicle for funds. Those two already exist, the third new option I propose would be 3.) Park. The game then goes to the normal overview of KSC. But the ship you just parked is placed in the hangar. If you wish to Launch a new ship you do so from the VAB or launchpad as before, but if you wish to launch an old ship you click on the Hangar and a list of ships appears. You pick the one you want and it is loaded on the launchpad or runway fully fueled. This eliminates the absurd selling of all a reusable spacecraft\u0027s parts to just rebuild it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Kerbal SHIP Experience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you right click on a ship in the hangar, it tells you the same things about the ship that are recorded for Kerbals. This is just because I think it would be fun, to not only know your Kerbal\u0027s history but also your ship\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my idea. Just a suggestion, SQUAD I love your guys\u0027s work as is, I just personally think this would be cool. Anyway\u0027s I\u0027d like to hear the communities thoughts on this.

I like it, especially considering the fact that it promotes re-usage of ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also be applied to other things, perhaps? Reputation maybe? A ship that toured the solar system would probably be a heckuvalot more impressive than a ship that just got into orbit. Any implementation could be open to abuse, though.. For example, what constitutes a \u0022ship\u0022? Does debris count? Would a giant ship grant more rep than a tiny probe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I like this idea.

Pairing pilots with specific ships is an awesome idea! As far as the complications go the exp. would be tied to the controlling part of a craft, and wherever it\u0027s been is on its history. So a probe core would get credit for where it goes, but the jettisoned first stage does not as it is not controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T16:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good idea, I think that like the buildings will be in the new update upgradeible. It should have a limit on the amount crafts that can be stored e.g. the lowest tiered hanger could store 1 craft and the next could hold 2 as so on. It should also give you options to re-outfit the craft e.g. if you park a cargo SSTO in the hanger you could before launch you could place a satellite in the cargo bay so that it would still be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
