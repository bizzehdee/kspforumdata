While the most essential technology: energy-\u0026gt;matter converters (allowing AKS to create ships on demand on the surface of Dres) were brought along when escaping their home galaxy, most other tech such as advanced energy weapons, hyperdrives, and zero point energy generators were lost after the transport ship\u0027s landing engine failed and it ended up crashing into the planet at such velocity that nothing useful could be recovered. Knowing the situation was dire, AKSTechnologies was created and started constructing warships to defend the planet of Dres, and stayed alone avoiding confrontation, but defending themselves with every ship they had available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter settling down with their small but powerful fleet of warships, AKS slowly started sending recon probes and discovered that there were two major players, HKA and GMI, deciding to help HKA by providing ships in exchange for energy that was desperately needed to keep their ship factories in action. In exchange for energy they provided warships and other vessels to HKA to aid in their war effort while slowly expanding their fleet ship by ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAKS (if you actually implent this into your videos) will start out using 2 [AKS]SK-CRV-IIIg3 and 2 [AKS]SK-CRV-IIIg2 corvette class capital ships in orbit around Dres provided in the save file below (to go with the story they should be launched from Dres surface). Their primary base and center of operations is underground and safe from harm, but will start to expand with time to see new worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAKSTechnologies will provide both export variants of their own vessels optimized for use by kerbals (machines dont need crew pods, kerbals do) as well as few dedicated vessels for use by kerbals that have been created with them in mind. For starters you will get the [export]SK-CRV-IIIg3, and the BC-304 \u0022Korolev\u0022 ships. The ones labeled as [export] are available only to AKS allies, and can be supplied in small numbers, any ships labeled as [AKS] compose their own fleet and may not be used by HKA or anyone else but may fight in joint strikes if AKS decides to actively engage in combat against HKA enemies. All other (unlabeled) ships are available on the black market after spies stole the plans and may be used by any faction provided they pay enough money to said pirates/traders that have them around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways on to the ships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAKS SK-CRV-IIIg3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/sH2dq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

A corvette class ship, it is fairly lightweight, maneuverable, and has enough armor to nullify most 0.6m weapons such as Ibeam missiles. While its armor is far worse then the previous generation, it can take a few hits from medium 1.25m missiles, and is at least somewhat resilient to ramming attacks. Its weapons are optimized against smaller vessels, although the Tripedo-S (6 carried) is strong enough to hurt the largest capital ships with good aim and some luck. This ship comes with a fully functional launcher that has enough dV to get the vessel to Jool, Dres, Duna, and Eve, with the fairing allowing some aerobraking as well provided it is not jettisoned before encountering the planet. Finally, it is the simplest ship in its class AKSTechnologies has ever managed to create, with under 280 parts, you just cannot get a better armor scheme for the part count. Its no drek, but its not that much weaker, especially when you consider how much lighter and simpler it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe export variant (provided to allies of AKS) features two command pods on top, allowing the vessel to be controlled by kerbals. It still retains its droid control capability but all links between AKS command have been servered giving the owner full ability to repogram it to suit their needs. The export version is provided to allies of AKS in exchange for energy supplies brought down to the surface of Dres, with one ship exchanged for 100t of fuel/kethane/ore/whatnot which should be dropped on surface (and ends up used to power AKS\u0027s production tech\u002B some for their own uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[AKS] version\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/goqtk2g8qisq0g9/%5BAKS%5DSK-CRV-IIIg3.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/goqtk2g8qisq0g9/%5BAKS%5DSK-CRV-IIIg3.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Export] version for use by kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/nd728qks6qs9fnd/%5BExport%5DSK-CRV-IIIg3.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/nd728qks6qs9fnd/%5BExport%5DSK-CRV-IIIg3.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another ship, this one designed by AKS based of a ship they encountered in another galaxy but the plans were stolen by pirates and it ended up available to anyone who had the money:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBC-304 \u0022Korolev\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/b8E1V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The craft has very weak armor, but it is composed of a armored skeleton so it is not exactly what i would call a easy kill, especially considering its sheer size. That said, the ship was intended as a cinematic thing, for video creation. The entire ship has a detailed custom made IVA. There is a command bridge, observation deck, communication center, weapons command room, living quarters, engine room, and 2 fighter hangars all accessible by moving around a series of hallways/tunnels/stairs that are not too hard to move around on. Its main feature is the IVA internals, and that is what the ship was built around. Ohh, and for those that dont know, its modeled after the BC-304 from Stargate series, although with a few changes to make it actually doable with a hard 400 part limitation. For a true replica the entire rear would have to be much longer, and it would have to be a tad wider, and the upper hull would have to be a bit different, but i feel it came out good enough to release, just call it inspired by sci-fi, not a pure replica or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing is basically for cinematics, it has crappy armor if any, but its given a full out IVA that might be useful to make animated scenes with kerbals or whatnot.
