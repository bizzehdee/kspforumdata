I call that a win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, because I see a difference between you and the annoying rating trolls; you comment about it. The most annoying thing about the ratings trolls, especially in the spacecraft exchange, is that they give bad ratings all kinds of craft, and don\u0027t even say why, or offer constructive criticism. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me the weird thing about ratings is that they seem to be meant for someone who hasn\u0027t even looked at the thread yet, and, in some cases, what one person thinks of a thread is different from others, so it may drive away potential viewers and enjoyers of the thread. Also, it lets the thread poster vote, which makes no sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s just my two cents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T02:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad this issue got followed up and yes I am the poster responsible for the above-mentioned \u0022butthurt\u0022 response linked to above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fine everyone thinks this as some sort of point to pick on but consider the following scenario:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You got posted by winds of career change to the far side of the world and have been disconnected from a certain online community you know and love for the better part of IDK, several years, lurking time included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Finally get the time to post a new idea\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Idea immediately gets shot down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWonderful feeling \u0022coming home\u0022 to the image yes? Now, people are commenting that moving on and ignoring the rating is the \u0022correct\u0022 thing to do. Well I\u0027ll tell you this - different people have different ways of communicating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA WIP thread is just that, a \u0022I have this idea which I don\u0027t have the time to develop fully yet\u0022 - maybe you\u0027d like to give pointers and ideas, considering a lot of veteran craft builders might have already done the same concept some time ago, judging by Reddit traffic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same fashion, do you think it appropriate to boo on a new startup business just because it\u0027s, IDK, new? Give the idea time and it can grow. Shoot it down and the idea will be dead before it begins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, negative feedback - you have a choice, unlike everything and make other peoples\u0027 labour of love look like utter trash. Or exude some small manner of online courtesy - ugly, mismatched craft turn into splendid showcases in a matter of hours, days, or a couple weeks at most. Collaboration happens all the time here on the forums as you very well know and enjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell, for the collaborative projects I\u0027ve done, great things blossomed with the barest of positive feedback while others were busy laughing at how mismatched, fat and ugly the original creator\u0027s craft was. Tell you what, if there\u0027s so much negativity floating around, I might even be able to put forth a business case here - things that get downvoted, disliked, laughed at, ignored; these are opportunities to make a junior craft builder / new player\u0027s KSP dreams come true. In many cases these \u0022ugly ducklings\u0022 have very sound virtual engineering. They just need a good presentation, some streamlining, not get downvoted on sight, to succeed as enduring threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks once again everyone for bringing the issue to the attention. The above-linked idea did take off after all, thanks to virtual \u0027backers\u0027 of the idea on Reddit, Facebook, and YouTube. It didn\u0027t struggle to gain flight; it exploded with great feedback allowing fellow KSPs to design and enjoy a new class of aerospace craft. With mod parts, they might even look as good as the retro-futuristic posters and pulp fiction they came from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T20:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060ve noticed that there are people who just post single stars on every thread they can.
