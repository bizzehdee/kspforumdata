The first stage is propellor based and I just didn\u0027t have the level of control that was designed in, stability was a really big problem. To test my sanity, I used the debug \u0022set position\u0022 yet again with exactly the same craft (even down to the inventory of every kerbal and storage container) and checked every part and every resource (and especially to ensure raw/pitch/roll matched my design, because I needed to do some messing with that to get there), and the cheating craft still behaved as I previously tested but NOT as I was seeing with the real one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to figure out what the Kraken did to my craft? I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s offset some part during the landing (which is always brutal on Eve) in a way that isn\u0027t visible. Is this a known kind of Kraken attack?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne small detail that gives me pause is that \u0022control from here\u0022 on my pod and my docking port give exactly the same readout when switching between them normally. But in the landed craft, switching between them rotates the navball by a very slight amount. Suggesting something is out of place. Engineer EVA can rotate it slightly but the slight misalignment seems to be more fine grained than even the engineer can rotate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-05T11:33:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2022 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by fommil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-05T12:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurn off all the autostruts you can, these can sometimes bend the vessel out of shape if they shift in flight e.g. if the heaviest part becomes lighter, when you come back to that vessel the autostruts recalculate and can cause issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, I say use the new craft you cheated over and not the old, broken one; Eve is difficult enough without glitches making it harder still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fommil","CreatedById":112495,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-05T21:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224171276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209635\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221662380122\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurn off all the autostruts you can\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na solid plan, thank you.
