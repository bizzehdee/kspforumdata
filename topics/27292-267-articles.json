I started a new career game with the FASA mod, and after killing Bill and Jeb through horrible accidents in re-entry... (Horrible because I gained no science from them... =P) I finally came up with a design that works... Mostly. I sent Bill up, (after many tests with the various modes of the escape towers installed....) to collect science from orbit. Launch wasn\u0027t quite what I planned... But a westerly heading ended up getting me above the atmosphere. With deadly re-entry installed, I came in a little hot... But not hot enough to burn up. So... Coming down and the re-entry effects are done... That\u0027s when I see that I am at a mere 4k meters..... I punch the protective cover off my \u0027shute and release it. I recall some people trying to find the High Gee Death machines somewhere else on the forums..... If they\u0027re reading this thread.. I want to let you know I\u0027ve found one.

The cheapest way of getting the inclination down to 0 degrees was aerobraking at Laythe, after which it was easy to transfer to Tylo.

I went for a brute-force method for the lander, which will range from 2.3 to 4.1 TWR (Tylo gravity), depending on the stage. But it\u0027s a stupidly heavy lander, I think, at 70 tons. I built it more like an Eve lander. The interplanetary-stage is showing that it\u0027s down to 1 km/s of dV left after getting into a rather lop-sided elliptical orbit around Tylo (after a nice free aerobraking maneuver around Jool that shot me out almost directly at Tylo, but still needed a heavy insertion burn). But that 1k of dV is with the heavy lander attached. Once that\u0027s gone, the ship will considerably lighter with better dV. If I\u0027m still too low on fuel for the return trip, I still have a few fallbacks. The Kerbin return lander has some decent dV in it, and I also have a rescue ship on standby in Jool orbit, from a previous mission where it wasn\u0027t needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-04-16%2022-48-51-07.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-04-16%2022-48-51-07.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the pad before launch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-04-15%2023-16-13-65.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-04-15%2023-16-13-65.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander\u0027s stats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-04-14%2021-54-57-19.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-04-14%2021-54-57-19.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T13:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorked on some secret rail-gun mod, shhh...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bagface145","CreatedById":48918,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T14:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my file, the first Kerbal went into orbit around Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Concentric","CreatedById":103320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T15:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76915-Redundancy-is-King-A-Duna-landing-%28Pic-Heavy%29?p=1098505\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1098505\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESent Jeb to Duna in an almost-entirely untested rocket.\u003C/a\u003E My redundant systems don\u0027t seem to have been necessary, however.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alymon","CreatedById":106720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T16:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of things!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a booster seat (ask me how it ended).
