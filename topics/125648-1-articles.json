Bottom node is there and it works. I can attach the top end of the engine to surfaces other than nodes but not to other nodes. Is this a bug or intended? A google search came up empty. I read the wiki and was under the impression there should have been a top end node on that engine.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T19:15:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged prefix to Solved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T19:01:11Z","Content":"\nIt definitely has a top node, it\u0026#39;s buried a bit in the model so that you can angle the engine without it showing a gap.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T19:05:31Z","Content":"\nThanks for the reply.
