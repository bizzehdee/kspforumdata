For ATO, get to orbit, and then land at KSC (so you\u0027ll be going around Kerbin at least once). You are also welcome to leave it up there and go for a docking with any fuel pod in orbit to complete the other goals in the mission concurrently. But ATO means abort to orbit... so you have to at least make it to orbit as part of misssion. What you do after that is up to you, either continue the mission and then land on the africa land mass or ksc (if going for pilot or commander), or make preparations to land back at the africa land mass or KSC when you come around again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. if you can use a stock solution, go for it!

If anyone can design a more optimal space shuttle, let me know. I intended to create a good looking space shuttle for use on a private gaming multiplayer server with friends, and didn\u0027t expect it to fly so well. But in short, I figured out the design principles early and committed to them, and wow. Simple rule of shuttle design? Don\u0027t design it empty. Build it, test it, and balance it with a fully loaded cargo bay and whistles. Your maximum rating for launch, and maximum rating for landing.
