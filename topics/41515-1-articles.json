The other two times I managed to land (once in the dark) and successfully return to Kerbin. I\u0027ve watched tonnes of videos on this game e.g. Scott Manley, HOCGaming, Yogscast Duncan and would appreciate any things I should be aware of before I go on a mass murder spree of Kerbals.

Orbital mechanics depart considerably from terrestrial mechanics, and it takes time to master the concepts behind many things that would seem routine down here on Earth (such as how to get from point A to point B efficiently, how to bring two objects close enough to rendezvous and/or dock, and how to efficiently land on an airless or barely-aired body). As long as you go into it with an interest in learning how things work instead of just finding a pre-made solution by someone else that will work and not really getting why it does work, you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T01:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell congrats and welcome to space. First of all, keep up watching Youtube videos, and be sure to look back at old videos and tutorials. Videos from .18 onward should be applicable, for the most part. Like everything else, it just takes practice to make less disaster. Some times you just have a moment where everything fits together and from that point onward you can preform tasks with minimal effort, like docking, TMI, gravity turns, Rendezvous, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would make some recommendations: under the first tab of flight controls, change the default translation keys to the arrow keys and Rshift and Rctrl. This is much easier and allows to rotate and translate while docking. You will have to clear the \u0022move camera\u0022 controls before you use this because they are bound to the arrow keys as well. Also keep in mind that you can drive rovers with the arrow keys if you use arrow up and down for forwards and back, and shift and control for up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen docking use chase camera so you are properly oriented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stringyquark","CreatedById":74565,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T01:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigher orbits are slower, lower orbits are faster.
