The \u0022SRBOrbDecColor\u0022 texture actually lives the \u0022SRBs\u0022 folder, and since I used ModulePartVariant to allow changing the orbiter decoupler texture between the orange and white variants, I just have the variant reference the correct location of the texture for the base orange variant.  The model just looks for the texture in the same folder as the decoupler, but it works as expected.  The \u0022SLSCoreColor\u0022 and \u0022SLSCoreBump\\_NRM\u0022 files are referenced by the SLSEngineMount part, which I left in for no particular reason, but forgot to leave the textures with it.  As long as you don\u0027t use the stand alone SLS Engine Mount, you shouldn\u0027t notice anything wrong.  As for the \u0022SSMEEmissive\u0022, it is the Shuttle OMS engines that are looking for that texture.  I forgot to leave it in there since the RS-25 uses a new emissive while the OMS engines did not change.  If you use the OMS engines that just means you won\u0027t get any engine glow from them.  You can safely build the SLS in all configurations, STS stack, Delta IV Medium, Medium\u002B, Heavy, Ares I, Ares II, and two Jupiter DIRECT configurations and the only thing you may notice is no engine glow on the Shuttle\u0027s OMS engines."},{"CreatedByName":"N3N","CreatedById":165167,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-01T10:35:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, TheShadow1138 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E None of those should be a problem.

The only thing that comes to mind as a possible cause is if you merged folders, when updating the mod instead of doing a clean install.  The reason I mention this is that nearly every part changed and got new textures with new names, and some of the models\u0027 names also changed.  There are a couple of parts that are left-overs that really don\u0027t have a place anymore that don\u0027t have textures, but I think there\u0027s really only one of those.  Errors do get thrown up about the orbiter decoupler part, but the config references the correct texture so it should show up in-game with no issue.\n\nWithout logs I really can\u0027t do much in the way of help.

Since ICPS and DCSS also show the same issue I believe it is a shader issue because those parts use the same shader as the EUS, as does the Orion and Altair.  All the errors it throws about the fx group name is probably due to the deprecation of the legacy particles.  So those shouldn\u0027t affect gameplay, there just won\u0027t be a puff of particles when decouplers are triggered.\n\nI\u0027ve just finished downloading and installing the 2019.2.2f1 version of Unity and am trying to update my unity project with the latest PartTools without having to create a new project.  On the off chance that it\u0027s not entirely a shader issue, would you mind trying something?  In the config file for the EUS change:\n\n    VARIANT{\tname = flightOrange\tdisplayName = Orange TankprimaryColor = #984918\tsecondaryColor = #ffffffTEXTURE\t{\t\t_MainTex = ShadowWorks/Parts/EUS/EUSColor\t}}\n\nto\n\n    VARIANT{\tname = flightOrange\tdisplayName = Orange TankprimaryColor = #984918\tsecondaryColor = #ffffffTEXTURE\t{\t\t_MainTex = ShadowWorks/Parts/EUS/EUSColor\t\t_SpecMap = ShadowWorks/Parts/EUS/EUSSpec\t}}\n\nThis is just on the off-chance that the update changes how it looks for the textures if ModulePartVariant is present.  I don\u0027t think this would be the case, but it\u0027s something to consider anyway.

I\u0027ve downloaded 1.8 to test, and I\u0027m not making any headway.  Firstly, I play windowed instead of full screen and I have to scale the resolution up to over 2048 and then scale the UI to 150% so it\u0027s usable.  I\u0027ve exported the EUS with the latest PartTools, and it looks about like it did in your earlier screenshot.  It\u0027s like the game is placing both textures on the part at once with the one on top having some transparency so that you can see the one underneath.  So, when you use the default orange, the white and black alternate texture is visible underneath making some of the orange lighter and some of it darker.  Then if you switch to the white and black alternate, there is still some odd shadowing going on.  I\u0027ve checked the model\u0027s normals in Maya and everything is good, and it looks fine in Unity.  I even tried using a different shader with the same results, and even tried removing the PartVariant module, but the same results.  There\u0027s some weird things going on I think.  Not sure when this will be fixed, or even how to fix it at this point.\n\n**EDIT:**  I figured out the problem, and I think it\u0027s kind of dumb.  Apparently, before 1.8, if you used a \u0022Bumped...\u0022 shader, and did not supply a normal map, it simply ignored that aspect of the shader.  Now, however, if you use a \u0022Bumped...\u0022 shader and do no supply a normal map, it makes the part look like garbage.  Using a plain white texture converted to a normal map and added to the shader fixes the problem in KSP.  Though, without the normal map the part looks like you would expect in Unity, then looks like garbage in KSP.  Not sure why this is a thing now, nor what\u0027s up with the window sizing of KSP, but it should be fairly easy to fix the parts that are having issues with this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-20T01:03:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2019 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-20T02:22:25Z","Content":"**[Version 2.0.3 Hotfix](https://spacedock.info/mod/216/ShadowWorks%20Stockalike%20SLS%20and%20More)**\n\nThis update fixes the new issue introduced by 1.8 with parts that use \u0022Bumped...\u0022 shaders, but do not have a normal map behaving as though they have a messed up normal map.
