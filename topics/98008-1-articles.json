I will also be attempting this, once I finish this exam and paper. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I felt like I had to get this out there, because it is so cool! I want to see videos/photo albums of peoples attempts to recreate something like this. It can be something like a suicide burn to the pads like the Falcon heavy does, it could be a plane that glides to the pads, or separates in orbit, de-orbits itself and drifts to the ground using parachutes. Or you could have a ship/barge off shore to catch these things and shuttle them back to the KSC. Obviously the more stages the harder this is, and asparagus staging... probably wont be your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, post your edited and music videos like the Space-X Marketing team did, or if your bad at videos or computer can\u0027t record\u0026amp;play at the same time, post images in an album in sequential order!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny mods are allowed, I wont be picky. Get back to the KSC with all your spent stages, so that means you probably need a probe core on them. Be creative on how to solve the 2km rails/off rails bubble, and the fact you can only pilot one at a time. (maybe you do multiplayer with your friends to help out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload you get to orbit doesn\u0027t really matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule-of-cool is also in effect! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeorgeG","CreatedById":59741,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T03:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some I already flew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission to Dres a few weeks ago.

The side boosters took it up vertically, then after sep fell back to KSC, while the core provided the horizontal velocity to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oN0lp2k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oN0lp2k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond one is a mission testing out a Quad Lander to the Mun and Minmus. Used a similar vertical boost, stage, then begin horizontal velocity. But this used a big center core which was the first stage which separated, then two outer upper stages which made orbit then came down separately to KSC. That arrangement was done to allow the Quad Lander to fire its center LV-N engine to help it make orbit, using fuel from the two lower side boosters. Once it made orbit, the Quad lander flew itself to the Mun and Minmus (dropping some small tanks along the way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I can\u0027t force it to display page #40 of the album, where this rocket begins.
