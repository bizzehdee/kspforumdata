The Iceland-based developers of said MMO host a convention in Reykjav\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ADk every year, called Fanfest. During Fanfest 2013, there was (for the first time, but hopefully not the only time) a series of panels under the motto \u0022Making EVE Real\u0022, where guest speakers from private companies were invited to talk about topics that appear in the game, but may soon exist in real life as well. And thankfully, these panels were recorded on video and made available online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally found watching these panels great fun, and I think that anyone with an interest in near-future space development (or in the case fo the first video, something more theoretical) will enjoy them as well. What do you think? Do these speakers have a point? Can what they plan to do, really be done? Or are they crazy and will go bankrupt in short order? And if they suceeded, what would it mean for space development in the coming years?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may also be fun looking up where these companies are now, almost a year later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jm977zdr2c\u0026amp;hd=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVideo 1: Richard Obousy of Icarus Interstellar wants to travel faster than light.\u003C/a\u003E (Brief audio issue at the start, gets fixed after a minute)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3kP_40bplQ\u0026amp;hd=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVideo 2: Chris Lewicki of Planetary Resources wants to go asteroid mining.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022www.youtube.com/watch?v=QicZ_cYgUBs\u0026amp;hd=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVideo 3: Michael Laine of LiftPort wants to build a space elevator... but not the way you think.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFanfest 2014 is coming up in May, I believe. Let\u0027s hope they have another series of interesting guest speakers there. Because one thing is for sure... we seem to be on the cusp of an era of private space development enterprises.
