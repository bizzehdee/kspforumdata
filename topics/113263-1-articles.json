I tried to use the -nolog parameter but it\u0027s not working, obviously... I didn\u0027t understood why it wasn\u0027t working until I read this thread... I was thinking that -nolog was meaning \u0022no log\u0022...  Before, this file was growing to maybe something like a 100mb for each game session but today after I installed 5 or 6 addons at the same time, this KSP.log started to go crazy. I guess there is probably one of these addons that is spamming errors in the log file.  I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s errors or warnings because I didn\u0027t really wanted to open this 2.5gb file with notepad! Now I\u0027ll have to do some tests to find which addon is causing this excrements... It sucks because the game and all the new and old addons are still working fine even with so many errors in the log file! Thank you anyway for clarify this, I just lost about an hour trying to figure out why this -nolog parameter wasn\u0027t working for me..."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-23T21:08:40Z","Content":"This is a rather old thread but it\u0027s important to know what -nolog is and what it does.\n\nFirst, it\u0027s a [Unity3D engine command line switch](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html), not something Squad added to KSP.\n\nSecond, it only disables the Unity3D log, which is the output\\_log.txt on Windows, and the Player.log on Linux and MacOS.\n\nThe KSP.log is not affected.\n\nSo if you have a mod spamming the logs it\u0027s best to deal with that mod, as log writes will still occur."}]}
