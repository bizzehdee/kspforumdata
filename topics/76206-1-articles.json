One of the main sources of the problems that plagued it during the test flights was related to its sheer size and the Soviet infrastructure. Saturn V wasn\u0027t a problem for the US, because even though the first two stages were 10m in diameter (yes, that\u0027s accurate--the Apollo hardware is all friggin\u0027 HUGE), NASA and its contractors had one major advantage--the launch site was located just off the Atlantic Ocean, making sea-based transport of the outsized stages entirely feasible. Thus, the S-II (second stage) production facility was built in Seal Beach, California, with direct ocean access, while the S-IC (first stage) production facility was the NASA-owned Michoud Assembly Facility at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, just off the Mississippi River, with test stands located not far away, also with access to the Mississippi River. Even the first two flight articles, built by the engineers at Huntsville and tested in test stands there, could be transported by water, because of a roundabout series of navigable rivers that provided access to the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, barge shipment was the preferred method, (The S-IVB third stage was also built along the California coast, though without direct water access--shipping it required it to be trucked through town to the docks to be loaded on the barge. However, it was also small enough in diameter that the Super Guppy aircraft could carry it, and since the contractor had an airfield right on the property next to the factory, air transport became its preferred mode.) Every S-IC and S-II stage was shipped from the factory to the test stand by barge (through the Panama Canal, in the case of the S-II), then erected on a test stand and given a test firing of at least its full mission operating cycle, all the little bugs fixed, and then test-fired again to prove that there were no more bugs in the system, then shipped to the Cape, by barge, to be assembled into a flight-ready vehicle and flown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy contrast, the Soviet launch site, while as low-latitude as they could get it (for maximum boost from Earth\u0027s rotation), was also completely land-locked, hundreds of miles from any navigable waterway. Everything had to be able to be shipped in by rail, truck, or airplane--and this meant that the N-1 couldn\u0027t have its lower stages assembled where they were fabricated, or be test-fired before flight--instead, they were fabricated in sections, shipped by rail to Baikonur, and then assembled on site. The Soviet government refused to build full-scale test stands at Baikonur, so these complex rockets, assembled in relatively primitive conditions by relatively unskilled laborers, were never test-fired before launch. In a ground test, if there\u0027s a problem with the stage, you can shut it down, safe the vehicle, diagnose and fix the problem, and then try again. However, if the first time the rocket is fired is in *flight*, then you\u0027re pretty much screwed, since shutting down will still result in the destruction of the vehicle. (Yes, theoretically, a \u0022Flight Readiness Firing\u0022 test of the N-1\u0027s first stage on the launch pad could have been done. This would have greatly slowed the processing rate, due to the need to do it for each booster, could have severely damaged the pad and upper stages, and, at best, would have shaken the bugs out of the first stage only.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the Soviets couldn\u0027t transport the N-1 stages in one piece, it makes transporting the \u0022extra\u0022 ones to some mythical Siberian warehouse infeasible--what are you going to do, dismantle them into their original component parts (including \u0022un-welding\u0022 the welded joints in the tanks), load them onto trains, ship them out there, and then reassemble them on site for storage?--what they did made the most sense--partial disassembly to retrieve the most valuable parts (electronics and engines), and then simply scrapping the rest, since what would be left would essentially be structure, tankage, and plumbing--which are cheap (by comparison).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T16:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly the problem with N1.
