Side staging long SLS parts are a bit of a pain as there are no decouplers powerful enough to push them away so I decided to make the lifter stage one stage. This means it is not exactly the most practical or efficient design but it looked awesome and I think it is the tallest design to date!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe top stage can be anything you want. I just built something that was around the 1000 ton mark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was pretty difficult to build as I think it is about twice the height of the VAB. It doesn\u0027t turn too bad but the 32 large SAS modules help. The lifter stage is about 100 DeltaV shy of getting into LKO so you\u0027ll need a slight boost from the upper stage but that\u0027s good as it lets the lower stage fall back to Kerbin.
