Slightly lowering the lift values and adding lift values to other Mk2 components would make sense. Of course, we can help Porkjet finding the right balance by tinkering ourselves and recommending a full set of values in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T00:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot everyone has FAR or wants it.

However there does exist a stock solution that can be applied to any cockpit or fuselage - you hide a wing inside the part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou use the word solution, what was the problem it addresses? That there isnt body lift in KSP? I have made sausage shaped mini planes with nothing but a cockpit, fuel tank, engine and control surfaces before. A cockpit that produces lift might not help unless you have a fuel tank that produces lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As much as I like Porkjet\u0027s innovation and novelty, a cockpit that must be mounted at the extreme nose of an aircraft that uniquely affects the centre of lift - being the only part that does this - Might be more trouble that it is worth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t replace canards on a delta wing design, nor a tail on a conventional design, and on a mini shuttle design it is liable to pull the COL too far forwards on the already small craft thus requirering even larger wings to counter act that cockpit lift ior more weight near the nose to heing the COM forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy all means, you could try and find the sweetspot or \u0027perfect value\u0027 for lift rating on a cockpit, but I will be suprised if it is a signifigant value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike someone else said, the lift factor for the cockpit (and other spaceplane parts imo) should be optional and in a modulemanager file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Yes FAR should be optional, but so should this lift rating.
