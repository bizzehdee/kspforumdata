I have played KSP for 41 hours, with varying success ratio. I had a save, that was 3 years in-game. I had flags on mun, minmus, base on duna, satellites everywhere and two space stations around kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to bring a refuelling station into Minmus orbit for convenience. And bragging rights, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can\u0027t. It falls apart at launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was confused, but I thought that, oh well, I made a mistake somewhere. I loaded my Kerbin Satellite design... but it fell apart on launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loaded Stock Space Core and rebuild it.... only to see it fall apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loaded my Dunadein, the Duna rocket... and parts randomly detached from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EW.T.F. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried a new save, thinking that 18 flights may be too much for Kerbal to handle, or that 3 years time broke it. Didnt work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reinstalled the game, only to watch Jebediah plummet into launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am seriously furious about the game right now, so I come here, to seek guidance from KSP veterans... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly love the game, but I am unable to play it now. Maybe someone has similar experiences and somehow fixed it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T21:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you provide a screenshot?

The absolutely best thing would be actual craft files, if you could upload some somewhere. Failing that, then clear screenshots so we could replicate the designs. Also it would be easiest if it was a fully stock craft we could look/try, less hassle with mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressing F3 brings up your flight log, it\u0027ll have information. If stuff falls apart/breaks on the pad it\u0027ll likely say \u0022structural failure between A and B\u0022, which means the connection was too weak or that whichever was ontop was too heavy. Struts as mentioned can solve most things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iBeej","CreatedById":78998,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T18:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have become sort of a master of disaster when it comes to the issues you describe. There are 3 very important things you need to be aware of when \u0022disassembling\u0022 occurs on the launch pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) The more connection points between parts, the more flexible (wobbly) the craft gets. The FURTHER you build away from center of mass, exponentially increases instability. The solution? Make sure you use larger tanks of fuel instead of lots of tiny ones. (Less connection points) and make sure you use STRUTS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) I found that decouplers or separators are very prone to failure. Especially if the center of mass for a rocket is off balance from its connection points. If its really bad, they fail before you even ignite. You need to use struts to support your decouplers and separators. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Launch clamp placement. I found that these little buggers cause a vast majority of my launch pad explosions. If they aren\u0027t placed right, or if they overlap each other or if their frames pass through the body of your vehicle, the rockets shakes itself apart. Put your clamps on the center of mass for the vehicle and then watch its behavior on the launch pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny piece that flexes, is either going to cause a catastrophic failure on the launch pad by shaking or it will inevitably cause uncontrollable unstable craft in flight. So watch for things flexing or moving. Or flat breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big trick to finding massive failures is by hitting F3 and looking at the list of failures. Look what breaks first and start there. It will even tell you if launch clamps fail. If those fail, it puts strain in everything else and it\u0027s a big domino effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding everything efficiently and close to center of mass (and being well balanced when you do build further from center) is a huge key to keeping a craft stable and strong. And this needs to be considered when you go through your STAGES! because dropping mass, shifts your center of mass. So remember, you can fix all this and make it stable at launch but if your stages all drop off the bottom with a very heavy payload at the top, you can have serious pitching down when still in your ascent. This isn\u0027t so much of a problem when you are in transfer, but getting there... Is the key. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts, clamps, and center of mass with staging. Pay close attention to all of those. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T19:01:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by iBeej\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tstehler1","CreatedById":61706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T19:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a very popular strategy that almost any experienced player will tell you right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Runboy","CreatedById":62496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T19:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts most likely a glitched .cfg part file in your parts folder,other than that it may be your decouplers malfunctioning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T08:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurious why did everyone assume there was something wrong with his designs?
