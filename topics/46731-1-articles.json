On top of that, the person who made the B9 Aerospace pack is currently working for SQUAD so there\u0027s a fair chance we\u0027ll see some of his art style influencing them. Either way, there\u0027s a couple other really talented artists working on the game so you know the new parts will look good. We\u0027ll just have to wait a few updates(give or take) until we see anything like that. They\u0027re kinda busy at the moment with bigger, more fundamental additions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
