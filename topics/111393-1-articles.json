I can imagine being in a hotel or conference center with an aironditioner that we just can\u0027t turn down, and downloading its details, and being able to fix it. Plus, there\u0027s the small matter of not having to move one meter to grab the actual remote control for things. There is the possibility to use it to remotely control my camera, but I\u0027m also looking into getting an Eye-fi chip, and may be able to do the same over wi-fi.\n\nI do love to play around with gadgets, but I\u0027m leaning towards the Xperia. It\u0027s smaller, similarly capable, and looks so much better."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:45:36Z","Content":"I do not consider IR to be a real feature.

Bluetooth requires a much more active transmission upto 33 feet was it?\n\nThough, RFID and NFC are taking that side now-a-days... bringing IR back just seems like a stunt. (And Camacha isn\u0027t kidding about the issues of phones having that photo sensor in the wrong place (and sometimes even then), getting the things to transfer is quite the pain)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T19:31:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 07:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T19:46:12Z","Content":"\u0022IR blaster\u0022? You mean IrDA? I had two mobile phones with such port. Smartphones don\u0027t have that one because Bluetooth is a better way for transfering data. IrDA used to be such a painful way to transfer stuff. I remember how annoying it was to transfer MIDI ringtones and 320x240 px photos because it\u0027s a spatially directional transfer.\n\nReimplementing IrDA back would be useful as a curiosity, just like there\u0027s a compass and accelerometer module. I\u0027d be ok with that. You could write a program to emulate TV remote controls."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:32:01Z","Content":"Those that I have seen aren\u0027t actually IrDA, as they have no receiver.
