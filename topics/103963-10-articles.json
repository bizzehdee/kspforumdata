After all the trouble getting through figuring out scaled space and fiddling with the shaders and all the wonky \u0022apparent distance vs real distance\u0022 stuff, I discovered that the scaled object is just a flat textured sphere. Meaning that applying the postprocessing shader to it will result in a perfectly flat foggy sphere that looks nothing like a planet. Needless to say, this was an oversight on my part and it ruins my day. The only solution I can think of right now is either to phase the postprocessing out before the PQS disables (should look really weird), or figure out a way to keep the PQS active longer without it disappearing past the camera\u0027s far plane.\n\nEdited: Also, if anyone knows of a way to enable/disable the stock sunglare on will it would be useful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T11:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"DaniDE","CreatedById":130484,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T10:51:33Z","Content":"I don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t know who or what PQS is, but I love your mod :-) Thank you so much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T11:13:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t know who or what PQS is, but I love your mod :-) Thank you so much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWell, thanks.
