On Kerbin, it works as intended. On mun, it at best launch the payload up but with an okay orientation, and at worst it sommersault and proceed to ruin my payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo refering to some of the older threads, I noticed the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173583-landing-gear-weight-limits/\u0026amp;page=0#comment-3347698\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173583-landing-gear-weight-limits/\u0026amp;amp;page=0#comment-3347698\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Spring rate is what it sounds like. A higher \uFEFFnumber for spring rate will compress less for a given load, and will oscillate at a higher frequency. Perversely, this means you can have too much landing gear and will have to reduce the spring rate u\uFEFFnder light loads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* T\uFEFFhe damper rate, OTOH, is the percentage of criticality. 0% is undamped; oscillations will carry on forever. 100% is critically damped; oscillations will be eliminated by the end of the first cycle. A typical rough terrain suspension is damped around 30%, whereas a 60% damping is used for a smooth surface. Going beyond 100% damping tends to make it difficult for the wheels to maintain contact with the ground, jacking down the suspension over rough surfaces.\uFEFF\uFEFF\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut also, according to\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/175866-cant-tame-bouncing-landing-gear/\u0026amp;page=0#comment-3398427\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/175866-cant-tame-bouncing-landing-gear/\u0026amp;amp;page=0#comment-3398427\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\u00A0Did you set friction control override?

There is a known bug in the current version that causes a small amount of bouncing for landing gears on low-G CBs, by reducing or eliminating the effect of the suspension damper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFriction control has almost nothing to do with bouncing in the current version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes your payload have any fuel or other transferrable resources in it? Pumping fuel around to change the weight distribution can have a major effect on bouncing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rigidity of your craft can also affect bouncing. Springy joints between parts can amplify bouncing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only real method for minimizing any bounce is to tweak those damper and spring settings, and see if you can find a sweet spot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-10T11:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the purposes of an elevator, the airbrakes would work better most likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust use the max deployment slider to slowly raise them up and down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-10T15:40:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for both answers.
