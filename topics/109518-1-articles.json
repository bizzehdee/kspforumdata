No even \u0022ksp is not responding\u0022 or error report either! This happened on another occoasion last week. I was also doing the same thing then, albeit with a smaller ssto. Anyone else had this problem? It\u0027s really making me exasperated now, as I\u0027ve had to try landing this thing (which is big and difficult to land but more on that in a nother thread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) 3 times.
