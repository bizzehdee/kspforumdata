Haven\u0027t tried spot on collisions at high speeds in 1.0 yet, but I\u0027d guess it\u0027s going to be the same as before - really, really improbable and less spectacular than one would expect from orbital collision.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt allmost happened to me today. I ejected the last stage so that the pod carrying Bill could right itself. The spent stage still had a lot of fuel in it, so it was quite heavy compared to the pod, and the pod took some time to right itself begause of a center of mass just slightly below its middle, so I started losing speed faster than the stage. I saw it coming around 1000m away, so to be sure I leaned the pod over to let the lifting body effect make sure i was clear of the debris. It missed me by maybe 200 meters. Would have been less if I hadn\u0027t moved over. Not sure about the relative velocity, but I\u0027m guessing maybe ~50m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote: Yes, by pods right themselves with the heatshield down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Slightly modded my install to turn physicssignificance on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Under the pod I have a utility bay with some batteries.

A lot of things need to be going on at the same time for this to happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You need to currently be \u0027controlling\u0027 one of the things, otherwise they will be on rails and will not hit each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You need to not be time warping. When you time warp physics is not enabled and the objects will just pass through each other (though ending time warp with them inside each other will make them both explode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The orbits need to intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my case, it happened with a space plane that was launching satellites. I in a harmonic orbit with the plan to release the satellites and allow them to circularize under their own power. Left the space plane in the orbit for awhile to wait for the KSC to rotate to the ideal landing position and just as I was about to make a burn one of the comsats I\u0027d launched on the mission came by and blew off the back half of the plane (and itself). Was really surprised, but since I hadn\u0027t changed the plane\u0027s orbit AT ALL I was pretty much asking for it. You\u0027ll notice, though, that I pretty much had to set myself up for it to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EBAO","CreatedById":140732,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually set up a orbital impact.
