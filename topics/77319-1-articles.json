Air speed over land is different then your actual airspeed. This is because of math... plain and simple. I wish I could give you a more exact answer but I am not on my home computer. Real aircraft have to factor two speeds when flying, indicated air speed (IAS) which is the speed the plane is moving through the air. And true Air Speed (TAS) which is the adjusted air speed based on altitude above Sea Level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"illmatic","CreatedById":30543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T23:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat... doesn\u0027t help me much.

What I\u0027m asking is how IAS and TAS correspond to the numbers that KSP spits out, and for a better understanding of how Speed Achieved, Speed Over Land, and Surface speed are calculated and their differences within KSP, specifically. Finally, how can I use those numbers (without FAR) to make a best approximation comparison to the numbers used when recording airspeed records, such as those listed here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"illmatic","CreatedById":30543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T00:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOver in the \u0022Fastest Plane under 1,000m\u0022 thread they used KSP\u0027s surface speed as their indicator... and it seems as FAR correlated those numbers with its mach readout. So perhaps that is the answer to my question and the number I should be concerned with, yet, how does the low altitude of their tests factor in? Does KSP take altitude into account when determining surface speed? Should I just use 42 as my number and be done with it?

So if your aircraft will stall at 150 kts on the ground it will stall at 150 kts at 30,000 feet. Also speeds such as Vne (Never Exceed speed) can be in IAS. IAS changes as the atmosphere gets less dense. You can travel faster in less dense air before your wings rip off, but the IAS will show the same speed. Faster planes also have a Mach speed number as well. Many comercial planes then have a max IAS as well as a max mach.
