Duhh\u2026 I hadn\u0027t even considered that a mod could be responsible for this. I tracked it down to \u003Cem\u003EDocking Cam ver. 1.3.6.3\u003C/em\u003E by linuxgurugamer. The option only appears when the onboard camera is attached to the vessel however I haven\u0027t been able to attain the science even though it shows as being available. This mod has changed ownership several times so it\u0027s entirely possible that it could be an artifact from an earlier version. Hopefully, you can see below (I\u0027m not good at posting pics either) that the science is listed as available everywhere, whether landed or in space. If either of you are familiar with this mod and know what I need to do please let me know...
