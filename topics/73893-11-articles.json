And this permission can be denied by simply changing one entry in a config file from false to true. So where is the problem?

Contrary to what you may think, a lot of people do NOT know how to change a config file. I think it\u0027s hardly a reflection on their personal worth, competence to play a video game, or their literacy. You may want to step off that high horse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(EDIT to avoid double post)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnrelated side note.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give this a week, but if in the end we\u0027re still at a place where the opting out is not either defaulted, or a button on load so easy even my grandmother can do it, then I will explicitly be pulling both support and integration for all of my mods for anything that implements ModStatistics in their default installation package. And yes, I realize that means pulling Kethane and KAS support from MKS, but so be it.

Second, just to be nitpicking: if it\u0027s checked by default it breaks the same law in the same way but as I said before that\u0027s not actually relevant here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, after all that might be the right way to do it, people are enabled to easily opt-out and Majiir might proof me wrong and agree with it. Thank you very much Ippo (honestly). Let\u0027s hope that he will accept your pr and this matter is finally settled for good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT (and a bit OT): since it came up recently: yes I created (simple) mods. However, I have a very different approach concerning my (tiny) user base than most other mod authors. In my opinion a free to use mod is something someone created for his own good and decided to share with others. Those users have no right at all to demand anything and the mod author has no obligation at all to fix/change anything. So I won\u0027t act preemptive fixing automatically reported bugs. If no one complains and I\u0027m not affected myself I won\u0027t do anything about it. And if someone is affected he/she can send me their logs and info if they want to. So while I see the benefit of ModStats I personally don\u0027t really need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T14:14:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by marce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forfeit","CreatedById":115881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T14:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technicalfool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technicalfool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMajiir is bound by the same rules as every other modder who wishes to take advantage of Squad\u0027s services to advertise or distribute their mod.
