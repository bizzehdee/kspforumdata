Do not run any game, ever, as admin. That\u0027s basic computer hygiene, but add the fact that KSP is running community-generated code (mods) and you are just asked for trouble. If you cannot get along without running KSP as admin/root, then setup an OS (I suggest ubuntu) dedicated to KSP and use it for nothing else whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmin and root are for admin tasked, not everyday use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T23:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerb Paint works,both Tenzuks version and the abandoned version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sgt.
