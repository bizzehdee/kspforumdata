Spent 500hours with the game, loving it to bits and this did not change with the recent 1.0.x crazyness going on. I dont mind most of the changes, and love the new aero as it is in a very different ball park compared to the old soup stuff... anyway\n\nOne thing really starts to get on my nerves. This game runs terribly!\n\nUp untill recently, when i had my old rig which was beaten out of a stone with primitive tools i blamed the stoneage technology for the miserable performance and lived with the 10ish fps i got with most of the stuff i flew. But now i have a new rig, X99, [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), gtx960(temporarily) and 16gigs of DDR4, sm951 for os, all shiny, runs witcher3 at 1080p on high with 55-60fps. \n\nKSP on the other hand, while flying different S3 sstos with 150-190 parts, i still get BELOW 10fps on ascent. what the heck????? the cpu is not even throtteling above 3ghz (yes, it can and does go to 4.1) and lingers arund 10-30% load. not a single core is ever loaded above 30 while i play KSP. \n\nIve read a lot of people run the game with 250\u002B parts way above 30fps. I expected similar kinds of results with the new system. And am kinda upset that the game is labeled \u0022done\u0022, i have a beasty machine and it still runs poorly. What could be wrong? Windowed mode? ... i dont know\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T12:40:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T10:04:32Z","Content":"So KSP is essentially physics thread throttled, your graphics card and your ram are not doing much (until you run into the 32bit memory wall).

I\u0027ve been playing since 0.15 and on (almost) the same machine (it\u0027s had new RAM and graphics since then, but same 3.0GHz i7 core) and I used to be able to build much larger craft than I can now. I\u0027m fairly sure that the addition of the heat simulation is the culprit, not just during atmo ascent, but in space too (if every part has to calculate heat exchanges on each game cycle, that\u0027s a big overhead, even if there is little or no heat to be exchanged). In the past a 500-600 part craft was quite playable, now I find that 300 parts is around the limit (although some parts cause it to be worse than others). \n\nThere is *some* hope that unity 5 will help, but as selfish\\_meme points out multithreading isn\u0027t going to just boost everything. Processes can only be separated to different threads if they don\u0027t share common resources (ie: two threads can\u0027t update the same variable). So a single craft, perhaps all craft in the 2.2km range, will still have to be run on a single thread. At least calculations for other craft (out of range) should be able to run as a separate thread and therefore free up some time for the core running the focus craft. \n\nMultithreading and (64bit further down the line) will help, but they really shouldn\u0027t be seen as the things that will make KSP run better. The game is badly in need of code optimization and some re-assessment of architectural choices and that needs to happen if KSP is going to perform well. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I notiice a lot of \u0027stuttering\u0027 since 1.0.3/1.0.4. Nowadays when I launch vessels the game thread comes to a complete stop every few seconds and then restarts again with 60 fps. You can also see it on the time indicator that always switches from green to yellow color every time the game stutters and comes to a halt. It was perfectly fine before as should be expected on a Core i7 with 3.7 GHz\n\nThis stutter problem is to do with the Garbage collector and I\u0027ve been noticing it since 0.90.0. There are known limitations with unity\u0027s GC, unity5 *might* improve that a little bit, but fundamentally it needs to be solved by optimizations to KSP\u0027s code. \n\nThe stutter issue is almost non-existent in simple saves, 10-15 craft seem fine, but once you start having more craft in flight (and more debris) the problem gets steadily worse. \n\n[Here\u0027s a thread about the GC issue](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106523-Slight-freeze-every-5-seconds-%28or-so%29), but there isn\u0027t a solution there, just our attempts to understand it.\n\nThe stutter problem and the FPS problem are different issues, but both are serious issues and they badly need addressing.

I\u0027ve been playing since 0.15 and on (almost) the same machine (it\u0027s had new RAM and graphics since then, but same 3.0GHz i7 core) and I used to be able to build much larger craft than I can now. I\u0027m fairly sure that the addition of the heat simulation is the culprit, not just during atmo ascent, but in space too (if every part has to calculate heat exchanges on each game cycle, that\u0027s a big overhead, even if there is little or no heat to be exchanged). In the past a 500-600 part craft was quite playable, now I find that 300 parts is around the limit (although some parts cause it to be worse than others). \n\u003E There is *some* hope that unity 5 will help, but as selfish\\_meme points out multithreading isn\u0027t going to just boost everything. Processes can only be separated to different threads if they don\u0027t share common resources (ie: two threads can\u0027t update the same variable). So a single craft, perhaps all craft in the 2.2km range, will still have to be run on a single thread. At least calculations for other craft (out of range) should be able to run as a separate thread and therefore free up some time for the core running the focus craft. \n\u003E \n\u003E Multithreading and (64bit further down the line) will help, but they really shouldn\u0027t be seen as the things that will make KSP run better. The game is badly in need of code optimization and some re-assessment of architectural choices and that needs to happen if KSP is going to perform well. \n\u003E \n\u003E This stutter problem is to do with the Garbage collector and I\u0027ve been noticing it since 0.90.0.

There has been a lot of general discussion of KSP game performance but the fact is something is **wrong** with fisto roboto\u0027s system, as evidence by the processor not even reaching its top speed.\n**To fisto roboto**, I can only really suggest the obvious. Redownload a clean copy of the game and test it with no mods at all, ensure that v-sync is turned off and the framerate limiter set to something appropriate. Beyond that the usual things like checking the system drivers, and making sure there isn\u0027t background software running interfering with the game. As Red Iron Crown suggested, you could test Prime95 running a single thread and see what happens. And be assured that the performance you are getting is far below what\u0027s normal and expected for that sort of hardware and therefore you can hopefully fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T14:33:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I totally agree here.
