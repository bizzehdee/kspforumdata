That\u0027s the line where I break-down. Mostly because I get stuck on pseudo-realism, I don\u0027t want to send a kerbal in that tiny capsule for a 40 day mission, that\u0027s crazy. He\u0027d need room to breathe, or even another kerbal as backup.

I tend to try and do stuff in Kerbin orbit, because it\u0027s easy to reach. One random challenge I had found was something like... achieve an orbit no higher than 100 km, then send your kerbal out and put him in a 120 km orbit. It was an adrenaline rush! You rarely need to go on such a long EVA, but the challenge called for it, so I did it, and it was awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I need to come up with, random challenges that are do-able for me, but still original and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T01:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou sound like you\u0027re stuck right about where we (Humans) are stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say: Stop fretting that stuff.
