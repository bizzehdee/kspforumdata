If you can get 20 tanks in symmetry around one central tank, the mod should support it. If you have a ring of 20, then a ring of 40, then a ring of 80, it should still work... but you still have to run all those fuel lines yourself (for now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E work with other mod parts, depending on how they\u0027re named internally (the name in the .craft file, not the name you see in the editor). I look for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* fuel tanks: has \u0022fueltank\u0022 or \u0022fuselage\u0022 in the internal part name\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* decouplers: has \u0022decoupler\u0022 in the internal part name\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* sepratrons: has \u0022sepmotor\u0022 in the internal part name\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the mod part is named similarly, it will work - for example \u0022B9MegaFuelTank7-3extra\u0022 or \u0022SuperDuperAwesomeDecoupler\u0022. If not, it\u0027s easy enough to add part names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting against part packs (B9, KW, etc) will probably happen after I finish my next update. I\u0027m currently trying to get it to run the fuel lines automatically. Right now I can create a fuel line in the editor automatically and attach the source end, but can\u0027t seem to attach the destination end. I\u0027m working on it, but it\u0027s slow going since there\u0027s almost no documentation on the API.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T17:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eseems cool will be trying this out\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whaaw","CreatedById":69050,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T17:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDownloading....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
