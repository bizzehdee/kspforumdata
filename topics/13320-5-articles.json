Essentially, using a Fission Reactor, you\\\u0027d pump Propellant (which also would function as coolant) through the reactor until it reaches a usable temperature, then vented out to provide thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral advantages to this would be that it could be used as a \u0027Long Duration\u0027 solid rocket booster, but one smaller and lighter than SFB nowadays. Or it could be also a Liquid Fueled rocket as well although if that was done, I was envisioning the Engine \u0027Leaking\u0027 propellent/coolant if activated but not providing thrust- You\\\u0027d also need a amount of time to allow for the engine to work up to operational temperature (I was thinking 5 minutes or so) and a small amount of fuel to \u0027Prime\u0027 the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, being KSP, there should be problems with this design, ranging from radiation issues to Rapid exothermic reactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s the wiki page-\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_core_reactor_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_core_reactor_rocket\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea Two:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma Propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize Plasma engines are a type of Ion Thruster, but the ones we have aren\\\u0027t really what I was envisioning. Plus the ones we have are more geared towards Probes and unmanned craft. Also, they\\\u0027re not as powerful as the various designs I\\\u0027ve seen proposed. My main thought was a VASIMIR drive. Advantages to this drive over the Fission rocket would be no fuel leakage, and no radiation issues Disadvantages would be heavy weight for the Reactor ( Superconducting electromagnets require rather heavy coolant systems) plus extreme sensitivity to damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea Three:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two ideas in this category, one using antimatter annihilation products as a propulsive force, the other using antimatter to \u0027spike\u0027 engine fuel. Both would be EXTREMELY dangerous, but would give you massive propulsive capabilities.... at a high risk of exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter Rocket; Like in Star Treks warpcores, Antimatter and Matter would be mixed together in a magnetic bottle, then the resulting plasma would be vented out the bottom of the bottle to provide thrust. Advantages would be that you\\\u0027d get insane amounts of Delta-V for a small amount of fuel. Downside would be that the Reactor Chamber and the Antimatter Containment Unit would be both heavy as hell, Seeing as Antimatter can only be contained with Magnetic Fields, quite powerful ones, generated using superconducting Electromagnets; these are heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus add in the fact that I was thinking to make the Antimatter engines even MORE dangerous would be the issue that if jostled too much (G-Forces hit the red area at all), the Antimatter would detonate. Of course, ANY amount of damage (Aka having parts hit it) to the Antimatter storage unit would result in immediate detonation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion: Essentially, you\\\u0027d inject antiparticles into a Nuclear fuel; most likely fusion fuel. This causes nuclear fusion, essentially a smaller, less insane version of a Orion Drive in some designs I\\\u0027ve seen. Or you could use Antimatter with either of the two (Non-AM) engines I\\\u0027ve envisioned, and get a massive pulse of thrust, at the chance of causing a containment failure and immediate destruction of the spacecraft as Antimatter meets normal matter. To use the \u0027Spike\u0027 version you\\\u0027d need to add on a module above the thrust nozzles of the nuclear engines, a heavy one that like the AM rocket idea would be hypersensitive to impacts, but would have the advantages of NOT being hypersensitive to G-Forces (able to withstand being in the \u0027red zone\u0027). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027d also need a \u0027Controller\u0027 module that would inject AM in precisely timed amounts; manually adding AM would have a risk of containment failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter_catalyzed_nuclear_pulse_propulsion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter_catalyzed_nuclear_pulse_propulsion\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize my ideas are \u0027Out There\u0027, but figured I\\\u0027d throw them out here and see if anyone would be interested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dani-Sang","CreatedById":4234,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T21:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Lazurkri,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the great write up and constructive Idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea for nuclear was just to create simple \u0027energy\u0027.
