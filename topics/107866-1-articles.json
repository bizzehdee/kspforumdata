There are none. I didn\u0027t write about the service bays, I was writing about the cargo bays that you have on planes, you know, mk2 and mk3. And I would like to see similar ones, but on rockets, 1.25 and 2.5m. I think I saw those in some mod, but I don\u0027t know where.\n\n---edit---\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 6S Service Compartments\n\u003E -\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh wait, you want actual cargo bays.\n\u003E \n\u003E Modular Rocket Systems by Necro Bones is what you\u0027re looking for\n\nOh damn!
