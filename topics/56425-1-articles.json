Done that way it doesn\u0027t involve many code changes to the current debris deletion code. Maybe a display similar to the science gained for a mission could be used to tell which parts got recovered and how much they were worth. Have some randomness with parts not being recovered and gaining less credits for badly damaged parts needing a lot of repair. Maybe even a cost based on difficulty in recovery. An SRB a few kilometers from KSC would be a lot cheaper to recover than one in the ocean or on another part of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovery and re-usability is very much like resources gathering and thinking about it I can see the difficulty and effort that would be required for resource gathering or re-usability.

How many times have you sent a piece of debris on a free return trajectory around the Mun hoping that it\u0027d go back home and burn up in the atmosphere, only to discover that its periapse is at 26km instead of the 24 you predicted? That 2km of difference means you have a piece of debris perpetually orbiting in a highly eccentric and (what should be) totally unstable orbit. So then you either have to switch focus to it manually and watch it burn up, or remove it from the tracking station - both of which break the flow of gameplay for the player, while the latter also undermines any efforts the player might be making to \u0022play realistically.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it works well enough for now, but it does need to be improved before the final release; there\u0027s just no discounting that fact. A model to simulate aero-drag on unfocused parts need not be very complex or too computationally intensive! Consider that the only times the player will really encounter situations where unfocused debris enters the atmosphere are shortly after launch (i.e. the initial stages of a rocket), returning from an interplanetary mission (i.e. the example I mentioned previously where debris comes back on a free return trajectory / coming back from Duna and detaching the lander before re-entry), and setting jettisoned stages to de-orbit immediately after stage separation (i.e. ejecting the escape tower once your craft gets into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that all of these cases require direct player intervention, and so it\u0027s highly unlikely that two or more of these will be occurring simultaneously (and even less likely that they will be occurring on different worlds). Therefore it is entirely reasonable to expect the total number of non-focused debris being acted upon by aero-drag to be in the single digits. For simplicity you could even group all pieces of debris that are within a certain distance of each other, i.e. 2.5km to be one piece of debris that de-orbits together, dropping this number even further. The devs could very easily add a slider bar in the options menu to set the maximum number of pieces of debris that get \u0022simulated\u0022 in upper atmospheres, with a default value at 10 or so. That way, if 10 or less pieces/groups of debris are in the upper atmosphere, the game could run a much simplified series of calculations to determine approximately how they will de-orbit based on the average drag coefficient, some basic assumptions about exposed cross-sectional area (in all cases the mass is known so they could substitute some reasonable value for area based on that), and the altitude the piece/group happens to be at at the time (the density of atmosphere as a function of height is known).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t be perfect, but it would give players a better sense of things going on outside of their 2.5km physics bubble. It\u0027d remove the blatantly unphysical behavior of de-orbited pieces of debris continuing to orbit with a periapse of 26km. It would allow a more realistic simulation for the survivability and recovery of re-entry parts. And most importantly to me, it would mean that you could send multiple manned flights home without having the ship and crew suddenly disappear, despite the fact that I had pre-deployed the parachutes and was currently focused on another ship only 2.5km away. If I had any modding skill of my own I could probably make this happen, but as it stands I can really only hope the devs are out there reading this thread. :\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
