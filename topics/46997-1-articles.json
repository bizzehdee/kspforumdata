Thing is, I landed on the slope so the rover sped downhill. I switched to it trying to counter the downhill acceleration but it didn\u0027t seem to work except for the brakes. When I reached a rather flat surface, I tried driving again but it won\u0027t budge and instead,kept speeding away at the slightest incline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought to myself, \u0022Well it might be the high gravity here\u0022 so I launched a second version of the rover with pretty much the same specs,except it was a manned-unmanned hybrid - this time to Minmus. It won\u0027t budge again save for brakes and steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I tested the rover thoroughly before launching it and I\u0027m positive it moved just fine on Kerbin. When I was on Minmus and Eve, I double checked if the motors were enabled. They were. They\u0027re also stocked with batteries and a couple of radioisotope generators so I\u0027m pretty sure power is not a problem. I\u0027m GUESSING it might be the wheels, those beige sleeks w/c I think has something to do with grip. I don\u0027t even know anymore. So if anyone can tell me what I\u0027m doing wrong, it will be very much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try posting pictures tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-30T15:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2013 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mangekyou-sama\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T15:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post some pictures of your rover?

For Minmus - gravity. Also, if you\u0027re going down the slope with high enough speed, you won\u0027t be able to stop using motors only - that\u0027s how wheels\u0027 torque curve works, the faster you go, the less control you have over the speed.
