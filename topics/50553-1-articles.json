I\u0027m playing a mostly vanilla career mode game. I have some utility mods like Kerbal Alarm Clock, Maneuver Mode Improvement, etc installed. But the only parts mod I have is Procedural Fairings. I would like the ability to \u0022fold up\u0022 some of my designs to fit within fairings better, then use servos to unfold them in orbit - that\u0027s where the robotics-esque mod comes in.
