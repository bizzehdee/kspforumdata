That (sometimes) pesky c in a circle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I think movie and book copyright is going against it\u0027s intended purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally, in the USA, copyright protection lasted only 28 years. This means the whole Star Wars franchise should have been copyright-free by 2011. Copyright used to only protect works from the government.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, we all know that didn\u0027t happen. Between 1776 and 1991, authors and Congress have agreed that copyright was too short (yeah right too short...if I had a say in history, I would\u0027ve decreased it to 10 years), and extended copyright protection to be the life of the creator plus 50 years. Which means Star Wars will be free from copyright in 2072. Originally, copyright was also intended to promote the creation of new stuff instead of locking us from using and modifying others\u0027 ideas. For example, if someone wanted to make an anime Star Wars, too bad because counterproductive copyright laws are in the way. Major disappointment in copyright laws. CGP Grey has a great explanation on this very issue, you should watch it. Come on, copyright laws. Go back to 28 years, or eventually cause an internet war. I know which one I would pick if I controlled copyright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I copyright used to promote new works. Now, it has movie makers in gridlock because they can\u0027t make a movie about a group of people and creatures fighting an evil force in space, or any variant.
