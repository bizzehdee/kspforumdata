It essentially a fuel tank that has been repurposed to hang 12 structural panels that will enclose a factory (in this case the factory diameter is 8 meters but that is immaterial).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I wanted the connector to have a wall thickness of 0.125M and so I took a 0.625M 48gon {X,Y,Z} = 0,0,0 de-faced the N-gon and plopped a 0.5M 48-gon {X,Y,Z} = 0,0,0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking here is that as I upscaled the factory I could provide conduits in the factory wall for nauts to travel to the observation points or ports in the wall sides (this sounds strange but the walls begin vertical and curve into the RingConnector part, so the kerbals start out traveling XZ and end up traveling Y until they hit a port connector.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is real simple in blender, I de-faced the interior N-gon, {X,Y,Z} went to Object mode and joined the two objects. I then connected the interior and exterior and material, texture, UVunwrap and paint. A few minutes of work. There were no normalization issues, an no other obvious issues. I going to try a few other things in blender like inversion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn blender everything looked great, In Unity only two forwardmost surfaces and the bottom face was visible, and as one change perspective on the ring, the back two surfaces would disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice in Blender that if Unity is going to have a problem that Blender would give a \u0027heads up\u0027. I need to get this working because I eventually want to create passageways in my factory walls for nauts. If Unity can\u0027t figure out a simple washer shape it has no hope of figuring out a passage in 1/24th Ovoid section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T16:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you see backface as the part rotates then the normals are flipped. invert or flip the faces in blender should fix it, be a good idea to unify the normals so they are all pointing in the same direction as well. technically there\u0027s nothing wrong with the model so you won\u0027t get any warnings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T18:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eif you see backface as the part rotates then the normals are flipped. invert or flip the faces in blender should fix it, be a good idea to unify the normals so they are all pointing in the same direction as well. technically there\u0027s nothing wrong with the model so you won\u0027t get any warnings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured that was it and I remembering seeing the flip normals button, lol, we shall see how much stuff I need to flip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need now to figure out a way to merge multiple colliders in Unity, it looks as if the shell part will need at least 2 colliders if not more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you physically have to merge the colliders or can that overlap with one another?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T00:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoverlap them if you can\u0027t get a convex collider with a single mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T01:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eoverlap them if you can\u0027t get a convex collider with a single mesh.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part won\u0027t work unless I can create a concave cavity on the \u0027private\u0027 face.

This is a 1.25 meter access (top), its a starting level repair facility capable of handling multiple 1.25 FF craft. In my prototype I found that a central port was necessary to guide the ships into a turn basin, once at the same Y plane as the repair ports the ships stop, unselect the central port, select a side port and dock. The area next to the docking observation area will have standouts for lighting, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second image you see the planned crew transfer. This is for a 2.5 meter core facility, In a piece below the image the transfer path make a right turn surfacing under of Cupola module. The current 1 M core does not allow for transfers because 2* pi * .625 = 3.9M, 4/12 = .33 M and this is too small to allow for crew transfers given the structure needed for secure connection and post-launch stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hqGcmVy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hqGcmVy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T01:59:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to break it up into multiple parts, just need several colliders in one part to approxinate the curve. 3~4 should be plenty for what you have in the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T02:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou don\u0027t need to break it up into multiple parts, just need several colliders in one part to approxinate the curve. 3~4 should be plenty for what you have in the picture.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was reading the other thread on the dancing kerbal and though I might give the box collider a try, this is what I came up with like you said 4 colliders appears to work.
