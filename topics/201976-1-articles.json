The editor is going to be changed, and some parts may be omitted from KSP2. I would bank on there being \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENO\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0conversion or intercompatibility between the two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt back-compatible parts would be available out of the box. It might be possible to mod them in. That would mean that a craft conversion mod would be feasible -- it would include the KSP1 parts pack and the converter. If the game is moddable enough, even a \u0022KSP1 in the KSP2 engine\u0022 total conversion mod might be feasible, and if you did that \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you could start thinking of savegame compatibility. However, if you wanted KSP1 parts to coexist with KSP2 parts, you would likely run into some major trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, consider engines and fuel types. IRL, a big part of the differences in thrust and Isp aren\u0027t properties of the engine at all, they\u0027re properties of the fuel: kerolox for more thrust but lower Isp, hydrolox for less thrust but higher Isp. In KSP, these differences are baked into the engines, all of which burn an abstract liquid fuel. KSP2 clearly wants to change this: there will be a variety of fuel types for different kinds of engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, suppose the KSP2 Poodle burns hydrolox whereas the Reliant burns kerolox, with their other stats unchanged. This means you need to know which type of fuel each tank contains. And boom, your craft aren\u0027t back compatible anymore. You could always include the old parts as-is, but that would introduce massive balancing problems: why would anyone use the new engines requiring new fuel types, if you could get the same job done with the old engines all sharing a fuel type? You could make the new engines competitive by making them so much more\u00A0efficient or powerful that they\u0027re worth it, but then they\u0027d be \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E for the KSP planetary bodies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you consider career/science\u00A0saves, it gets even more constraining. Suddenly, you\u0027re stuck with the same tech tree, because unlocking it is part of the career. You\u0027re stuck with the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, because upgrading that is also part of it. You\u0027re stuck with funds, science, and reputation as resources, and can\u0027t add any others without causing a slew of back-compatibility problems you\u0027d need to address. You\u0027re stuck with a career based on contracts, because contract state is a part of the career save. And so on and so forth, before we even get to the difficulties you would have if you wanted to change the planetography or orbits or such in any way at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the upshot is that if you want to maintain any kind of savegame compatibility,\u00A0all you can do is give KSP a nice, fresh coat of paint and add a bunch of toys to play with. I would very much like to see KSP get that nice, fresh, coat of paint (better graphics, better UI, better career, etc), but that should be a part of the continuing evolution of KSP1, as further updates and paid\u00A0DLCs. I would be extremely disappointed if that\u0027s all that KSP2 is \u2013 and it certainly looks like they are aiming higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223962270\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221619585776\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208873\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InfernoSD\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, InfernoSD said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it would be neat if you could find your own derelict\u00A0craft from KSP1 floating in orbits and on surfaces.

It would be a great way to maintain continuity with KSP1. And it sounds totally feasible too. Suppose, say, 80% of the KSP1 parts (not counting surface-attached little bits and pieces)\u00A0are ported over in sufficient fidelity: similar models and attach points. Now you could just port over any craft that only includes that 80% of parts, and just flag them as \u0022derelict\u0022 -- i.e, none of the parts actually /work/ anymore, and they get a crusty spaceworn texture on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen when you import your KSP1 save, you just put them in their orbits or drop on them on the surface where they\u0027re supposed to be; if some of them aren\u0027t carried over because the parts aren\u0027t there, they\u0027re\u00A0presumed lost; if others get destroyed or damaged or fall over because of changes in planetary topography, that\u0027s totally fine too and just adds to the atmosphere. It would give the system a wonderfully lived-in feel, and you could use it to create any number of gameplay challenges as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
