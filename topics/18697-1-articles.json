If it wasn\u0027t for YouTube, I wouldn\u0027t have found this game. After watching a few videos about KSP i decided i\u0027ll try it out. I got the demo and played it for about a week. Then (after nagging my parents constantly), i finally got the full version. I set a goal to reach the Mun. I got there 3 times but lost the return part of all 3 ships, I was done for the day, tomorrow, I\u0027ll make it. So tomorrow came and i had explode on impact landings one after the other. After watching multiple Mun landing tutorials, I headed back to the VAB. An hour later, I landed on the Mun safely. I made Adnie jump out then realized i forgot ladders to get him back up and somehow managed to get him stuck between the lander engine and escape engine... since then, I\u0027ve made 3 or so more successful landings and put in ladders... That weekend, I became an astrophysicist.
