You can also re-pack your chutes but they cannot be activated with the sequencer as before they were first deployed. That is something important to remember. I know all of this was previously mentioned, I just wanted to add my part. You can also force open retractable solar panels which is useful if you don\u0027t have any statically mounted PVs and happen to turn away from the sun for too long while waiting for a node. I will note that in the case of PVs and parachutes. You have to have a kerbal on EVA and you have to be *near* them. Not entirely near though. I have a space station with four gigantors attached around a science lab and I was able to extend/retract the PV on the opposite side without moving. I\u0027ve also repacked multiple radial chutes while still clinging to the command module door. I\u0027m not so sure about them implementing the ability to repair PVs on EVA in the next patch though.

I\u0027ll test this soon and see if setting an action key for the chutes does work as it could be a bit stressful trying to rotate view around a falling lander headed for the surface of Duna and trying to activate 8-16 chutes in time. I\u0027m reasonably sure you don\u0027t actually need parachutes to land on Duna due to the low gravity and thin atmosphere which I think is around 1% of that of Kerbin at sea level if they are reasonably accurate analogs to Earth and Mars. However, it is notable that even NASA uses parachutes along with boosters when they send things to the Martian surface. As long as you have adequate boosters and enough fuel to counter the mass of your craft.. I daresay you could in theory land anywhere without parachutes. This is all untested theory of my own currently though so if you go try it and crash please share in your research findings and I will do the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T14:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022advil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022advil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECurrently the only way to repair solar panels that I have found is this.
