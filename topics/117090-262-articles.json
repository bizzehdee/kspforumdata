The problem manifests as craft/vessels being unable to undock in some situations.  This renders the vessels permanently joined, with the only options of fixing the problem being sending up an entirely new craft/vessel/station or manual save game editing.  A separate/second problem apparently exists with a \u0027decouple\u0027 option being available in some cases, even when no docking port was selected (this problem is likely easy to solve, but still need to know how to replicate it).\n\nWhat I need in order to be able to track down and (hopefully) fix the problem is a method to reliably reproduce the problem.  My current attempts to reproduce it have been inconsistent at best, and mostly a waste of time.

(technically only the pre-dock and list of steps are needed, but quick access to a post-dock-bug save will allow me to run a diff on the save files to check for corrupted or incorrect saved game-state)\n\nIf other methods to consistently reproduce the problem exist, I would also accept information regarding them (e.g. specific design setups / list of steps to cause the problem to manifest).  In the end all I am looking for is a reliable method to reproduce the problem so that I can actually work on debugging and fixing it.  If I can\u0027t reproduce it, I won\u0027t be able to fix it.\n\nIf I cannot get this fixed in the next few days/weeks, I will be removing the optional/switchable docking ports from the StationCore parts entirely.
