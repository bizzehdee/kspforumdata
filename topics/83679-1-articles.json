However, numerous problems arise. The information must not degrade. That\u0027s where I need your suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny digital data storage is useless. Not only commercial storage units will probably degrade in a century, but there probably won\u0027t be anything able to read it in 2114. I\u0027m not just talking about the hardware. The software will be lost. JPG won\u0027t mean a thing, just like obscure digital technology and protocols from Apollo era are now useless, and that was less than 50 years ago. Maybe there will be few knowledgeable people on the planet, working in various institutes, who will be able to decypher the binary code, but I want the stuff to be readily accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, acid free paper and a higher grade graphite pencil for writing a letter seem like the best idea for preserving written information in a small space. Ink is longlasting, but graphite is forever. In order to kill every trace of life potentially detrimental to the paper, I\u0027d include a crystal of naphthalene into the container. It will fill the space with pH neutral, but biocidal fumes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about DNA? Liquid anr wet samples won\u0027t work if they aren\u0027t buffered, cryo-protected and kept at -80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C or lower because of the chemical reactions which are too fast.
