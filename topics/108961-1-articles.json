How did you set up the collider for the part? If the collider is hollow/ring shaped too then it won\u0027t be a valid shape for PhysX and it\u0027ll bug out or just be ignored. Another issue could be where your parts origin point is; if its in the middle of the ring outside of the mesh and any colliders the game will not like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA screenshot of your model in Unity, so we can see the setup will help us offer more advice.
