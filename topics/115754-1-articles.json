Firstly, although Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere contains some water, it probably doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have much, and what water it does have probably exists deep within Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere, likely at a depth that would be lethal to life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere is far from tranquil. If you look at a picture of Jupiter you see horizontal bands of colours, these are clouds of gas, mostly ammonia, flowing horizontally in Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere at different speeds. The lighter ones, usually a white colour, are called zones, and are regions of Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere that are rising, while the darker clouds, usually orange to red are called belts and are areas in Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere that are descending. Life living in Jupiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere would likely be at the mercy of these vertical atmospheric flows, and organisms would probably find themselves being pulled down to depths with a temperature and pressure that would destroy organic molecules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter also has powerful horizontal flows between its bands and belts called jets, which achieve speeds up to 100 meters per second (360 km per hour). As these flows interact with neighbouring jets huge vortices can form (like cyclones on Earth), the largest of which is called the Great Red Spot, which has been known to exist continuously for almost 350 years and is so large it could swallow two to three Earths. If life could avoid the deadly vertical currents, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pretty sure the horizontal jets would be equally as hazardous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom another\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe region where it is 32 degrees sounds OK, but where the temperature is 32 degrees, the pressure is about the same as it would be if you were a couple miles below the sea on Earth.

The planet is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. There is virtually no water to support known life forms. The planet does not have a solid surface for life to develop anywhere except as a floating microscopic organism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFree floating organisms could only exist at the very tops of the clouds due to atmospheric pressure that is progressively more intense than anything seen on Earth. While the cloud tops could harbor life that is resistant to solar radiation, the atmosphere is in constant chaos. Convection forces the lower atmosphere upwards and colder areas of the atmosphere are constantly being sucked closer to the core. The churning would eventually expose any organisms to the extreme pressures nearer the core, thus killing any that may develop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould an organism find a way to resist atmospheric pressure that reaches 1,000 times what it is here on Earth, there are the temperatures close to the planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s core. Gravitational compression has heated areas near the core to over 10,000 degrees Celsius. It is so hot in some areas that hydrogen is in a liquid metallic state. While organisms on Earth live in areas near volcanoes, the temperatures there do not approach Jovian levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter is completely inhospitable to life as we understand it, but its moon Europa has been proposed as a possible habitable zone.
