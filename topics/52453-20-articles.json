I know, I know, strut it, right? Well, no amount of strutting helps, it always snaps within a few seconds of standing on the launchpad. The \u0027bounce\u0027 from loading the game up compounds this, but I\u0027ve clamped it enough to negate that, though of course it still separates a few seconds later. I have tried numerous other types of decouplers, or putting non-stretchy tanks between the 5m stretcher and the decoupler above it.

I just got into doing the realism overhaul mod series. I believe I have everything requested on the forum post list, but I seem to be having a problem still with the KI-7000 stretchable conic fuel tank and its resizing in career mode. I say career mode because the problem doesn\u0027t seem to appear in sandbox. My problem is that the top and bottom of the cone will not resize past a certain point as far as width. When the piece is selected it shows up with the approx. 0.625. size top and bottom and although you can make the width smaller you can make it no larger. I mention what it looks like when selected because it also looks different in sandbox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDars\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
