The only place it really comes in is contract expiration, but those are usually so long they hardly matter. Do you think things should be added to make the timing of missions more important?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give you an example of what I mean. So, when I start out a career game, I do my first suborbital hops, then orbit, then hit Mun and Minmus, and by the time I\u0027m done with all of that, only a couple Kerbal weeks have passed. So then it becomes time to hit Duna, but I\u0027ve got to wait a while for a Duna launch window, so I time warp nearly half a year. Gameplay-wise this presents no problem, but I feel weird that my space program spent a couple of weeks launching like crazy, exploring the whole Kerbin system, then just stopped and waited for months. Then of course I launch to Duna, and while I easily can run other missions while the ship is in flight, there\u0027s nothing stopping me from warping and finishing that mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo actually, what I do is I try to only timewarp in short bursts, and run at least a few missions in between launch windows. I also try to run multiple long missions at once, and I try to hit every launch window I can. (eg. launch to Duna, warp to Eve window, launch to Eve, warp to Duna intercept, etc...). There\u0027s nothing in the game making me do this, but I kinda wish there were. I think it\u0027d be cool if features were added that incentivized running multiple missions at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yearly budgets. In addition to contracts, you get a bit each year. Perhaps you lose it if you don\u0027t use it. Or maybe it\u0027s based on how much you did the last year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- R\u0026amp;D time. Tech nodes could take a certain amount of time to unlock after you use Science to unlock it. Not long, but progressing as you go down the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Construction time. Depending on the size/part count of the ship, it takes a certain amount of time after building to be able to launch. From the VAB you could choose to start construction and be able to take it to the launch pad when ready, or there could be a \u0022Construct and warp to Launch\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Science over time.

There should always be ways that you can still run and entire Jool and return trip without interruption if you really want, but I think there should be incentives for not doing so. I guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that I like to play a weird way, and I want the game to reward me for it, and sorta force others to do the same. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T08:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the party.

If what you want to do is just run one single big mission to a particular location, then bring it home, then start on the next one, then these ideas are going to add a dimension to the challenge. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, but this is why we have different game modes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be possible to play like that in this sort of game mode, if you\u0027re careful, and keep missions low cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this mode will support a fairly different playstyle- for those that want a full space program experience, rather than just being designer and pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JumpsterG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JumpsterG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave any of you done a mission to Eeloo or Jool lately? You realize it takes months and years of in-game time. \u003Cp\u003E If your life support on a station or funds will run out after time warping only a month, you\u0027re going to be spending a LOT of time doing mini-missions around Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this will necessary be a bad thing. The fact that missions to outer planets take a long time is something real space program must face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also a matter of balance- it should be possible to accrue enough funds in a reasonable amount of time, for a reasonable amount of effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funding issue is something a successful space program must address. It\u0027s a matter of cost benefit- if the things you\u0027re doing are costing more than they are worth, it\u0027s time to change something. If a mission to Jool is not financially viable, then other options, like downsizing the mission, or saving up some more first make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E These are all challenges we\u0027d need to face to become successful space program directors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, it does make sense to do a few other missions while waiting for a Jool mission to arrive- if time is a factor you\u0027ll have a lot more reason to pace yourself, and make some use of your time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JumpsterG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JumpsterG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe there are solutions to this problem. An infrastructure system to generate revenue streams, automated resupply missions, life support that allows for \u0022when-you-feel-like-it\u0022 resupply missions (roverdude has an interesting mod that will be released after 1.0 like this). Whatever is done to bring more management to the game, the systems need to be fully fleshed out and not just impose a regular funds sink or hard penalty for neglecting flights in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely agree. Lifesupport should be simple, and balanced so bringing enough is only a real challenge when you need a few years worth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/5RViAPN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5RViAPNm.png\u0022 alt=\u00225RViAPNm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EMade this ages ago.
