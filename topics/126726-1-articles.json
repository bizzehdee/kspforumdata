KSP is about enjoying the sandbox freedom and I think it is nice that this is somewhat carried over to career mode.

The 2nd and 3rd contract in this scenario would be to test a prototype engine and a prototype science equipment in Kerbin orbit to support the development. Then a 4th contract to test the actual probe you want to send. If all goes well (maybe prototypes would have a possiblity to fail randomly), you get the needed parts unlocked for the Jool mission and after doing this you have the 1st contract completed and also the parts available permanently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this sound reasonable or am I just babbling nonesense here?
