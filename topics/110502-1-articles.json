Historically it\u0027s been a bit different, early US spaceflight was fairly pilot-focused and much was done by hand; the Soviets tended to use more automated systems where possible. So yeah, an autopilot is realistic.\n\nThat said, much of KSP\u0027s core gameplay is piloting, I would recommend that you try flying by hand and see if you enjoy it before switching to autopilot. If you don\u0027t care for it or wish to automate some tasks, by all means use autopilot (some of the players whom I greatly respect are heavy MechJeb users)."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:34:18Z","Content":"Hi Zeke. And welcome to KSC. \n\nI don\u0027t know details, but autopilots are certainly used in real life. Especially to help with ascents etc.\n\nDo what feels best or right for you. What matters is your enjoyment. I would recommend learning to do stuff manually anyway sooner or later as it helps with your understanding.\n\npersonally I don\u0027t use mechjeb as I prefer to do it all manually. And yes it is hard to learn (rendezvous and docking is particularly challenging at first), but it feels great when you do it for the first time and it gets easier with practice."},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:38:58Z","Content":"Agree with what Red Iron Crown said.\n\nPrior to 1.0.2 Aero I started using MecJeb for the launch phase because launching the same launch vehicles over and over got boring. (Launch to 10K then 45 degree turn again and again.) Plus I liked the customization I could do on the various displays. But since 1.0.2 Aero I\u0027ve been flying whole missions by hand. Maybe not realistic, but definitely more fun. But in all likelihood once I\u0027ve flown the same LV so many times until I can do it without thinking I\u0027ll probably go realistic again and let the flight computer (MechJeb) do the heavy lifting. I\u0027ll still do the glamour piloting - docking and landings - manually.

It also teaches about orbital mechanics. But basic maneuvers are quite repetitive and laborious tasks. Some things are almost impossible with information KSP gives (for example pinpoint landing to large planets with atmosphere). In some point you know exactly what to do and when and then you may find that it is good thing to give routine stuff to autopilot and concentrate to more engineering stuff than piloting.\n\nReal space programs use very complicated flight software. MechJeb is simple part of videogame compared to automation of spacecrafts. They model thousands of orbits and what if scenarios per every maneuver. They said that the flight control software of the Space Shuttle was the largest and most complicated computer program in the world when it was introduced."},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T16:18:22Z","Content":"Its real, and even if it doesn\u0027t fit aboard your capsule, Ground Control has a hundred guys with slide rules and a 40-gallon coffee pot."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T16:30:35Z","Content":"From what I\u0027ve seen with how others use it, MechJeb has a good chance of robbing you of any sort of desire to actually fly ships on your own.

I recommend flying them by hand at first so that you learn what is happening, why, and what good and bad responses are before turning on Mechjeb. If you are playing in career mode, it should be less of a problem because you will have to figure out how to fly before unlocking more advanced features.\n\nThat said, as a pilot, engineer, and especially as a low tech stick-and-rudder glider pilot I\u0027ll personally defy anyone claiming that it\u0027s cheating or look down on people who do. They\u0027re flat out wrong. They\u0027re socially wrong for getting a bug up their behind, trying to micromanage someone else\u0027s game. They\u0027re also technically wrong as most advanced flight is conducted under some level of autopilot control, especially space flight. There is a time and a place for manual control and there is a time and place for automatic control. Especially in airplane training there will be lots of manual flying before you\u0027re allowed to use an autopilot, hence my suggestions above. But it\u0027s there for many good reasons.\n\nThe proper response when it comes to KSP is to be self referential. If someone wants the challenge of hand flying rocket launches, great! If someone else wants to use Mechjeb just for attitude control to free up brain space to do other tasks, awesome! (And that\u0027s a big part of what aircraft autopilots are for in real life: to free the pilot up from task saturation.) And if someone is bored after the 150th launch or simply doesn\u0027t want to bother with the whole \u0022flying\u0022 thing and spend more time designing and building rockets, marvelous!\n\nSo, recap:\n\n- It\u0027s your game, not someone else\u0027s. They don\u0027t like what you\u0027re doing in yours, tough. Go jump in a lake.\n\n- Real life uses just as much and often more automation.\n\n- In real life pilots learn manual control first, but commonly fly auto far more often later."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T16:47:34Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never used MechJeb.
