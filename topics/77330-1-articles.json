Now I either have to rely on simple designs that don\u0027t do much, but leave me with decent FPS or overly complicated designs that just dummy their way through the lag until I\u0027ve dropped enough stages that the FPS comes back up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking at my graphics card first and foremost, as its really the only part of my rig that seems to lagging behind. My CPU (i5-2500k) which I haven\u0027t overclocked yet (even though I have more than adequate cooling to do it) should be perfectly fine so that just leaves me with my old 3gb 580.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how much would upgrading to say, a 6gb 780 (I like having the extra VRAM for certain other heavily modded games) help with this issue? I realize the CPU plays a bigger part in FPS in KSP, but considering I like to pack in graphics mods (trimmed down of course) as well I imagine a new graphics card would be the best bet for right now (plus I really just need to overclock my i5 already).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T01:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei have a i7-3770(comparable you yours iirc during my shopping) and i use an 2gb evga 660. i play max graphics settings and 1920x1080 and run at \u0026gt;35 fps on ships less than 700 parts. its still \u0026gt;20 fps on bigger craft for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei recommend that card to everyone. i play almost all my games at max settings, and that cpu/vid card combo can even emulate all the gamecube resident evil titles at max settings 30fps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T04:14:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t actually see much difference upgrading..and your 580 is about equal with a 60..the thing that will boost your fps is to overclock your cpu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, unless you play other games and aren\u0027t happy with your fps in them, I wouldn\u0027t bother upgrading the gpu for ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU oc will get you where you want to be though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T04:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely overclock that CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe i5 2500k is a boss at overclocking, you can easily get it up to 4.5GHz or higher on air cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe physics is the main thing that slows down KSP.

If your GPU runs at 99% and you get slowdowns, lower the grafic settings and try again. If it still runs at 99%, update your GPU and you will get better fps.
