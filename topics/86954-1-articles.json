More than one Kerbal in your spacecraft is more often than not useless. You can add them as backup in case one of your Kerbals dies or is lost or if you want to move two ships independently (Apollo CSM/LM situation). The former is no longer an issue if you have experience and the second can also be done with a probe body. So there are too few uses for multi-Kerbal ships. The majority of multi-crew missions are done out of a need to roleplay. There should however be a gameplay reason too. To do that, I propose the introduction of the Morale/Science Efficiency System.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EMaking Multi-Crews Useful\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETo make multiple crews useful there needs to be an incentive to use them. The most obvious way is through implementing bonuses to currency collection (funds, science, and reputation), the backbone of career mode. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll focus on science in this thread, although it should be possible to do it with the other two currencies. By giving a percentage bonus to manned science gathering (surface samples, crew and EVA reports) it suddenly makes sense to bring more Kerbals with you on your missions. You wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to bring all your Kerbals out on EVA to get the bonus for surface samples of EVA reports, it would just count the crew of the last ship the player left. To prevent 100-man crew from collecting incredible amounts of science, there would be diminishing returns. After let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say a six Kerbal crew, the advantages would rapidly decline and beyond 10 it would just be not worth the extra space needed (planned human mission aside from colonization don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t go over 10 either).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EPreventing Ships Crammed With Crew\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhile the above would incentivize multi-crew ships and reduce single-seater OPness, it would not get rid of the problem of building very compact ships that can transport Kerbals without penalty for years. Real-life ships and stations with lots of crew are big and not just size of the inhabitants, but have separate sleeping comparts, commons rooms, etc. To solve this, I proposed introducing Morale. Every Kerbal would have a Morale variable and cockpits, capsules and crew cabins would all produce extra morale. The morale production would not be equivalent to crew capacity. If you want to keep a single Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s morale are 100% you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d need a crew capacity let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say just for him. This would force players to think about their crew\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s accommodations. Short trips wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be an issue, but if you wanted to keep morale up for long stretches of time then you need to build a bigger ship or station. What would this morale be good for: collecting science. The science efficiency described in the paragraph above would not only be determined by the amount of Kerbals but also by their morale. So if you leave your Kerbals in cramped corners for a while they might only collect 50% of the science possible and if you send them to Jool in just a Mk2 Landercan or have them on EVA for a weeks, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll drop to 0% science.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESolving Other Problems\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Morale/Efficiency System solves a host of problems. The OPness of one-man craft is severely reduced (especially outside of Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI), multi-crew ships have a use and players will be encouraged to build normal looking stations and interplanetary craft for reasons other than roleplaying. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also an elegant solution to the Life Support debate. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not too difficult to comprehend and mistakes don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t result in Kerbal deaths meaning then learning curve is less pressing. It also isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t as high maintenance as traditional life support systems, it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t require constant resupply missions and it does crew space better than traditional LS (as with them you just need a big tank or a greenhouse).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E The Morale System could also be used to make electrical management (EM) more interesting. Life support is a big part of the electrical requirements of ships, so it would help to make EM a bigger part of gameplay. At the same time it wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be too punishing as Kerbals wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t die due to the electrical system being insufficient to provide enough morale. One would sometimes still have the possibility to send an extra power module up to fix it.

Snacks! acts not too dissimilar to the Morale portion of my system: Kerbals need snacks and pods have a compartment of snacks onboard. If Kerbals don\u0027t get their snacks, reputation is lost everytime they want to eat (every 2 hours I think). Adding this to the Morale/Efficiency System would get both reputation and funds involved. If you have a lot of Kerbals at 0% morale, then your reputation will go down. Low reputation influences the contracts that you will get, which will influence how much funds you\u0027ll be able to make. Additionally Funds will be necessary to buy the extra parts (habs, solar panels, etc.) that you\u0027ll need to build the bigger ships or stations that the Morale/Efficiency System will entice players to build.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThoughts, comments, critiques?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T13:47:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptRobau\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T13:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting ideas.
