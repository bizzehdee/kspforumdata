You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need the Rockomax X200-48 tank and Inline Advanced Stabilizer, micro, both from KSPX, to open it, which is included in the download. I usually aim for all stock, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d forgotten KSPX (what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s left of it anyway) isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t stock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I could take them out, but both of them are positioned very central and would have to be surgically removed. Anyway, here it is on the launch pad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mK8sarph.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mK8sarph.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Double tap 0 to lock gimbal (and extend the antenna on the LES)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Blast skyward until the first stage runs out at 11 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Initiate gravity turn and press 1 to jettison LES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The second stage will run dry around 33km, press 2 to jettison the fairing (either before or after staging, doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really matter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Circularize orbit at 75km and voila!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SBe8apA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SBe8apA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Undock the docking port of the LM (not the decoupler), then dock the right end of CSM back on the LM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Point retrograde while controlling from the CSM and stage the booster away. It will probably have some leftover fuel, but the mission is designed to fly on the CSM engine alone. The sepratrons should be enough to push it away and out of orbit, crashing back to Kerbin. The engine fairing can then be decoupled, aiming a bit more to the ground as it\u0027ll fly off with quite a speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Activate the engine of the CSM, make sure the LM engine is off, and head for the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. After the injection burn, pump 5 tanks from the descend stage back into the CSM. Balance the three remaining tanks. This will give you about 1000m/s delta-V to land\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. At some point during the trip, EVA two kerbals to the LM (although the LM does have a probe core and could land without, but what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the point in that?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Aim for a munar orbit of about 30km, undock the LM and go in for landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Once landed, plant your flag!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YtVxxwm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YtVxxwm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the crew is back inside and ready to depart, deactivate the engine on the descend stage and throttle up. When you stage, the ascend stage will be launched up a bit, so make sure everything is ready to go when you do. Also, due to a lot of clipping going on, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to pump fuel over to the toroidal tank as you fly. Just right-click both and leave it pumping. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have about 900m/s delta-V to achieve an orbit. The CSM should have enough left to rendezvous if necessary. The LM has no RCS, so docking is done with the CSM. If you have some fuel left in the LM, pump it over, but leave some fumes to deorbit it later. The LM can deorbit without crew (hence the probe core, somewhere in there). Decouple the LM after the crew has been transferred and return home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iJMQcR4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iJMQcR4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures of a complete mission with an older version can be viewed \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/EpMTf#2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/gz1t7682mjnvprf/Kuropollo.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-17T17:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2013 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kurotenshi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T14:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m happy to see Apollo-style craft remaining popular - yours is a great addition!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
