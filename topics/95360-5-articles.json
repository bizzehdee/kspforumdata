This would allow you to set the flag in the VAB/SPH. Not sure if you can declare a default (such as your Omicron logo), but I will research to see if that can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself am looking into building a color chooser for use in SM when selecting the desired highlight colors in settings. Not too painful to do, but will require a plugin to create the needed interface in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, since a vessel is essentially \u0022recovered\u0022 after a flight (assuming you landed back at KSC), there is no history of a flight, other than experience that is stored with the kerbals that do the flying. So, aging between flights as you appear to be wanting to accomplish cannot be tracked in game. Now, it may be possible to simulate aging of your vessel by persisting a separate file that tracks flights. Not sure how we make that elegant, but as I always say, where there is a will, there is a way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could however add in-flight aging, based on accomplishments during the flight, and replace textures with the desired ones as you progress through the flight. This would also require a plugin (can be the same one) that looks for any additional fields you wish to add to your parts to track the changes needed during flight. I could help with the plugin or at least point you in the right direction. You might even use animations to simulate the process of weathering, or burning, based on temperature via Maya / Unity. Then switch to the desired new textures after the event. The modeling and texture stuff is not my strength yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe happy to look into the flag, aging and texture replacement needs if you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T01:43:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 01:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T05:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use something similar to what the space tug uses, which I recently discovered is part of the JSI part utilities mod, then a default can be set while allowing the user to customize what each flag object will display, allowing for a different flag on each instance of the flag object. It also allows for setting a flat object to, if not set to anything else, show an agency flag so that it will try to auto-set itself based on a mission you may be undertaking. At least, that\u0027s the theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge-based textures is something I know I\u0027ve talked to someone about in the past. One way that was talked about is implementing a new resource, much like how Deadly Reentry handles the shields being worn down. As the resource is depleted, which could start out as a time-based depletion and be depleted an extra amount based on the conditions such as reentry or collisions, or even based on what planetary body it is on (Duna can get really dusty at times). Then, using something like the static fuel tanks system of Kerbal Konstructs, you could replenish that resource which would cause your mod to revert any texture alterations back to a cleaner look. How to achieve the texture alterations is something that needs some research on, but the resource-based tracking of those conditions is a pretty solid and reliable method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween flights, as Papa_Joe has said, is not something that can be done at this time without some major work. Besides, once the craft is removed from the game world (reverted or recovered) it is reasonable to think that maintenance and repairs would be done. Between-flights without a recovery, however, if using a resource tracking system for the vessel states, would be persistent between game sessions, and would be easy to implement some sort of on-the-field maintenance similar to how a kerbal can fix a broken wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T06:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Papa and Gaalidas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs not exactly that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides what you two suggested are very cool too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend to watch the Substance video 6, so you understand more what i wanna do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Movie 6 is above: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105815-WIP-OMICRON-Space-Car-Parts-Creation?p=1825280\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1825280\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105815-WIP-OMICRON-Space-Car-Parts-Creation?p=1825280\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1825280\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u0022, if you see the 6, the 5 have some thing too with the decal, but if you have patience, watch all of then, from 1)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForget about the in between flight log, or so.
