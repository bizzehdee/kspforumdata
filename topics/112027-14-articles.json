And sorry, this is not a \u0027bugged stock simulation\u0027 issue. Using the stock mechanics and stock parts, with stock configs you\u0027re fine. this is squarely a mod issue. Stock ISRU had heat mechanics pulled in 1.0.1 specifically because I needed to noodle over how to better handle them in analytics mode without explosions or exploitations (I should know - I did it), so poking it with a stick and calling it a bug is a bit disingenuous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am saying this not to be pedantic, but to make a pretty clear separation between what is supported in stock vs. what is not. i.e. your demo above, Fraz86, basically says \u0027I can edit a config to include non supported values that are not used in any generators in the entire game, and cause things to explode!\u0027. Of course you can... that\u0027s why those mechanics were tabled. Right now, there are no stock mechanics that I am aware of that generate heat and operate in analytics mode (engines and reentry heat are both limited to physwarp). So naturally whatever Nertea does for his mod will have to account for this. That\u0027s not a bug, that\u0027s pushing the boundaries of what we have right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if at some time stock heat in analytics mode makes a comeback, then Nertea can likely piggy back off of that. But there\u0027s absolutely no guarantee what shape that will take. And that\u0027s the rub. You\u0027re extending a major (and newish) subsystem, and asking it to do some interesting things that it simply is not (currently) designed to do. And I expect there will be future occurrences of having the rug pulled out (i.e. if Nertea makes a plugin that does X, then stock ends up doing Y, there will end up being more rounds of reconciliation).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T09:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn idea for a dirty hack: block high warp when parts temperatures change faster than some small rate.
