According to this, I have given out a grand total of 8,454 likes, and received 11,133 likes... OK, awesome!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But here\u0027s my question. There are also two other icons showing, a red down arrow, and a face with confused bulgy eyes... I have one of each. Maybe the down arrow was a warning??? But I\u0027m not sure I ever got one, other than one or another of the moderators occasionally pm\u0027ing me... lol. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone know what those are?\n\u003E \n\nI found that about a week ago, I think. I\u0027ve graded so many papers that time has become irrelevant. Oh, by the way, what day is this?\n\nI also found the gives and likes thing, which is new, pretty cool.\n\nI don\u0027t have the other things you\u0027re discussing, the whole red arrow and face with confused and bulging eyes... so I don\u0027t know. And I\u0027ve got plenty of warnings, so that\u0027s not the reason..."}]}
