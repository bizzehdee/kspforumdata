Flowmode Tweakable","CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:43:59Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving just gone through a bit of exploration regarding how Fuel Cells operate in the game I have a few observations and a suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically, in real life a Fuel Cell is a self contained device with fuel and generator in one. It consumes its internal resources and outputs electrical power and water (assuming its an oxygen and Hydrogen unit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP we obviously are not dealing with H and 0 but some other magical propellent mixture - but regardless it assumes that \u0022burning\u0022 it in the right mechanism can generate electrical output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m OK with that. Its a game-ified solution that works ok in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat doesn\u0027t work for me is that regardless of where you place a fuel cell, it will consume propellent mixture from the farthest reaches of your vessel - including the inner tanks of a complex landing craft. And what\u0027s worse is that there is no way to regulate it or control where the fuel cell device draws its fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after exploring the \u0022Flowmode\u0022 variable, I have discovered that a minor change in the Fuel cell part config will allow a player to either use fuel cells as the currently work AND if desired (by placing a crossfeed blocking part in the correct place) you can create an isolated fuel cell which once it consumes its allocated fuel, will not consume any fuel from the vessel (of course you can transfer fuel to get it going again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe change I have tested relates to the Flowmode setting for LF and Oxidiser resources in the Fuelcell cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpecifically, Changing flowmode from \u0022STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\u0022 to \u0022STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH\u0022 allows this type of behaviour.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion to the DEVs is to make this change stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, if they added a tweakable setting which allowed the user to switch flowmode for a fuel cell part in game, that would be completely and totally awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, I could be off-base here, but thanks for listening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS\u0026gt; yes and for the record I know USI has fuel cells - very nice.

THe fuel flow logic change with jet engines is completely whack to the point of RAPIERs ignoring decouplers (I logged this as a bug in unmodded support). It only makes sense the fuel cells should obey more understandable fuel flow logic.
