I had some more time to play around with KSP and have tried new IR with in-editor part animation (simply marvelous).\n\nI\u0027ve tried to make a vehicle that uses IR to enable stowage, but have also hit a snag with loading forces from vehicle mass on high-G planetary surface (such as Kerbin). I have used twekscaled I-beams as wheel pylons for KF wheels and attached them to \u0022Hinge Pivotron - Basic\u0022 to provide stowed and deployed vehicle frame form. I know IR parts reworked by ZI are not intended to loaded with such high forces, but i hope that new parts will be made for this purpose.\n\nAn other strange issue - for testing purposes i have launched my vehicle in stowed position. After deploying into driving shape, KF wheels did not properly respond to commands. It is as if wheels had their orientation initialized the wrong way upon scene loading. Annoying issue.\n\nHere are some images.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It seems to affect only KF wheels. I\u0027ll go over KF thread to report a bug (if not already posted)."},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T16:45:24Z","Content":"Do I understand correctly that this new rework along with the reworked parts will become the standard release once 1.0 is released?
