Based on KSP1, you\u0027ll still be using the same probe cores near the beginning and at the end of the tech tree, so unless there\u0027s a clear visual evolution of the probe cores communicated, there\u0027s no way to tell the player that camera tech got better unless you specifically go out of your way to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the second, it\u0027s been said before that the point of map view is to be a tool, and that (back in KSP1) they didn\u0027t want players flying the ship entirely on map view. I agree with this. Flying with hull-cameras only requires a lot of work regarding orientation of those to be useful, way beyond the abilities of a new player. Even if you did that work for them automagically, flying first person can be a bit overwhelming and creates a lot of failure points for the entire experience (part of why airlines have control surface status displays on the cockpit, among a lot of other instruments, for example). It also makes extremely hard to communicate bad design choices and their consequences to the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for telescopes... I don\u0027t think it adds much.

In addition, some planets and moons like Eeloo, Pol and Bop could start out with having their orbits unknown, creating a reason for players to use a telescope to discover their orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would then serve as an introduction to discovering planets around other stars, where even their existence is unknown until the player sends a mission to discover them.
