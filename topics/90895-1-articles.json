I\u0027d specifically like to know how to load rovers into the various cargo containers. Do I have to make a ship, get it on the landing platform, and then some how get a rover up the rocket and into the cargo container? Or is there a way to make a rover and a rocket simultaneously?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T22:06:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kevlarburrito\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EQuestion has been answered by the most excellent of communities!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T13:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little curious what you mean by \u0022cargo container\u0022 since stock doesn\u0027t have anything like that.

If that\u0027s what you want to do, you\u0027ll need to put an attachment point - a BZ-52 or just a Cubic Octagonal Strut - somewhere in the bay\u0027s interior, stick a decoupler on that, and attach your rover to the decoupler. You\u0027d probably want to strut it down for extra rigidity of the delivery craft. I suppose you could just go with a radial decoupler too...a TT-70 would probably work okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you have yet to build the rover, Taki117\u0027s already given you the advice you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T14:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to make a rover with a docking port on its rear and a docking port on its top at its center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have the root selector mod go in to the sph and start with a small probe (the hex one) and build the rover from the rear going forward - attach a docking port to the probe pointing so its facing the probe itself then create the body, cockpit and wheels - empty any fuel you don\u0027t need. Once created click on the center of mass icon and place a docking port on the top where its located - its a bit fiddley but you can always launch it and zoom the camera down from the top view and it will always center on mass - then revert back to sph to adjust. Once done click on the subassembilies icon at the top and then click on the docking port after the probe and you should be able to drag the whole rover in to the subassembilies. exit out of the sph and in to the vab. Build your lifter and then attach the craft from the subassembilies to a docking port at the top - this will get it in to space - you then need a craft that can transport the rover from the rear docking port and then prior to landing switch over to the top docking port and bring it down to land. - either that or build some rockets in to the rover itself which can either stay on it so it can lift off of the surface or can be ejected off it once it lands.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kevlarburrito","CreatedById":128583,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T22:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the assistance guys!
