I set up a rocket to get to the suns soi, with landing capabilities in asparagus stages for landings on mun and minmus with a return to kerbin. I looked up if anyone had done a quick sun flyby and returned to kerbin soi. Not much information was found. So here\u0027s how I did it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI achieved 150 km orbit with ~2000 m/s dV in the lower stage. I planned my burn on the dark side of kerbin, using 889 m/s dV. This pushed my craft to just outside kerbin\u0027s soi. Once I left the kerbin system, I targeted kerbin, and pointed my craft at the target, used about ~180 m/s dV and got an encounter. Lucky me, I also managed to get periapsis at 157km with an encounter with the mun on the other side of the orbit. I spent a grand total of 42 minutes in the sun\u0027s soi, and gained all the xp Shannon needed to hit level 3 for the trip to Duna. Hopefully others find this helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
