I got used to the menu, then installed the BioSuit Mk1 texture, cuz that looked sweet. So, I took the .cfg file and put it into \u0022TextureReplacer\u0022. I put it in there next to the @Default.cfg, and it turned out BAD. It didn\u0027t work. I went to my TR menu, and I couldn\u0027t find the skin. Please give me step by step instructions on how to put these in!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
