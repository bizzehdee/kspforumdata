As far as I know in real life escape towers are often the first or the second thing to separate from the launch vehicle as they are not used above fifteen to twenty kilometres so on some launch vehicles they are to blast off even before the first stage burnout. Even after that you can just separate the pod and parachute back down to safety. I am talking about those aborts late into the flight something like higher than eighty kilometres and faster that maybe a thousand metres per second. In real life everything happened suddenly at an absolutely unexpected point and no official abort command was ever given the engine just did not start when it should have and guys got back home alive even regarding that it was not the most pleasant experience.
