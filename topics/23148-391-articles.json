If say (using a common quest ive done in path of titans as my example) you have to deliver 4 branches \u00A0to a delivery point and have delivered 2 and are carrying number 3 but get killed the way it works right now you get forcibly relocated to a random point on the map and that quest and any other quests are failed and removed.

You select your dino and reenter the map. Youre now way across the map and your prior quests are gone. You may have new quests or not depending on if it chooses to give you any.
