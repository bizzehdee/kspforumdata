He adjusted himself in the stiff chair as you already know Munstar 20 was the official final kermanned mission to the mun, but what if I told you another mission was sent soon after that and never returned. It all started during the historical Munstar 3 the first kermanned mission to land on the mun. During the decent they passed over a mysterious crater soon after the equipment malfunctioned showing faulty readings this failure nearly aborted the mission but the anomaly ceased as quick as it began. Puzzled the space program assumed it as faulty equipment and tweaked the lander for the next mission. However the anomaly occurred again during Munstar 5,12,17, and finally 20 all while passing over that same crater. The scientist just had to find out what mysterious processes might be going on deep in that crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A secret unmanned probe was launched as a disguised mapping mission. Strangely during its decent there was no anomaly the probe touched down without a hitch the panning cam showed nothing eventful until MET 9 hours 21 minutes 30 secconds. It was a late night at the RPD (Rocket Propulsion Department) in central Kolorado only a few scientist and controllers were on a shift when a high pitched beep signalled the pan cams motion sensor was triggered the small group of kerbals crowed auround the screen, at first nothing, but then a rock about 20 feet from the Lander began to twitch at first nobody noticed but then it began to shake violently wiggling itself free from the grey dust when it began to levitate this went on for at least a minute then the spacecraft began to shake violently and contact was lost that is the last we heard from that probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A year later the final kermanned mission lifted off from the mun but the scientist were not done with that crater soon after three kerbonauts Philman Kerman, Aldger Kerman, and Joedorf kerman were informed they were selected to be part of a top secret mission to land near the probe they had lost contact with a year ago. During their descent to the Mun like the probe there no problems and touchdown was as Smooth as silk. As the crew suited up for EVA 1 Philman began to feel a little nauseous but shrugged it off as joedorf began descending the ladder he noticed the lander was surrounded by a perfect circle of black soil. Astounded he immeditly took a soil sample but as he touched the ground the soil changed to a bleach white this spectacle only had their attention for a moment. They knew there was a more important task ahead they had to find the probe they were in search of. A minute later a flash of light caught their attention, then they realized it was many flashes. As they approached they soon began to see metallic debris strewn everywhere in the middle they saw the dented dish belonging to the probe under a boulder after salvaging the probes equipment they spotted a rock move slightly when all of a sudden they had a mind shattering headache they began to stumble disoriented and dazed the ship seemed a million miles away but all of a sudden it stopped and they felt as good as ever. Frightened they raced back to the ship and began the automated takeoff when all of asudden an explosion rocked the ship all fuel was gone and life-support was damaged severely as a last ditch contingency they left the Ship and searched for a sample return mission that had landed on the rim of the crater 5 years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they traversed the terrain the ship became a faint dot when all of a sudden a huge explosion blasted out from where the ship once was in a shockwave fasion the soil blackened. The last transmission we got from the crew reported levitating rocks crippling nausea then contact was lost the kerbals were presumed killed in action. There it is that is the real reson we have not returned to the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
