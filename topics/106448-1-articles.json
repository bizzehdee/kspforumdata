It\u0027d be less confusing, and more functional, to instead add more bits and bobs which describe a fuel system label or number so you could go beyond two fuel system chains ... if you\u0027re detail-oriented enough to even want a second chain in the first place.[/quote\u0027]\u003Cp\u003EOoooh so both feed \u0022down\u0022 to zero, but no negative tanks would feed into positive tanks or vice versa? I kind of like that. Though it may be better in that case to be able to switch between different... uh... my brain no make words good. \u0022Class\u0022es of tanks? So you\u0027d have 0-16 for priority values, and then if you so choose you could have alpha tanks, beta tanks, gamma tanks, etc. Gamma will only accept fuel from and give fuel to other gamma tanks, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
