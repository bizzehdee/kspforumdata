What does this mod do?\n\nAs an example that I\u0027ve used since the Kethane days, set your drilling base\u0027s fuel tanks to 8 (16 now. the highest value). Set your tug\u0027s value to one less than that (15). Set your space station (that holds the fuel for passing ships) to one below that (14). Then, use the other levels how you wish on other ships but always keep them at 13 or lower.\n\nThen, when you land your fuel tug at your drilling base, the drilling base just automatically fills it up, no interaction required (well, you have to dock, claw, or KAS your tug to your station). Lift your tug up and dock with the orbital station, it dumps all its fuel into the station, no interaction required. Then any passing ships come by, dock with the station, and (you guessed it) they fill up their tanks, no interaction required.\n\nIt\u0027s a click saver, time saver, and headache saver.
