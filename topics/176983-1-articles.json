You can make as many copies of ksp on your hard drive as you like. Just run the exe from the copied folder. In that way you can have many different installs with different sets of mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve still got working 1.2.1 versions with mods as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoE Smash","CreatedById":189611,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-28T21:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can right click on programs in Steam and set it to \u0022not updated until you launch the game.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you can right click on it again, go to the betas tab and set it to an earlier version of the game that was stable with all your mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you can open the game folder find the ksp.exe or the 64bit version of the exe, right click on it and send a copy of the short cut to desktop and double click on that to launch the game with Steam closed....so you never lauch the game from Steam in the first place.....thusly it never updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly if you haven\u0027t run the game a bunch of times since this happened, there\u0027s a backup save folder in the save game folder that jas like five recent backup copies of your save. Delete or move your normal persistent.sfs file and copy and paste one of the backup saves into the save folder where the one was that\u00A0you deleted/moved. Then rename it to persistent.sfs by deleting the string of numbers in brackets and the space....so it just says \u0022persistent.sfs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have no backup saves left from before this happening, hopefully you have a manual save that you didn\u0027t corrupt by opening it in the updated version of the game....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know why someone couldn\u0027t have told you any of this earlier....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
