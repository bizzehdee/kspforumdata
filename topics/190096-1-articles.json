The gear sink a little way into the ground and then are forced back upwards with excessive force. This means that the entire craft tends to \u0022float\u0022 a fraction of a centimeter above the ground for a few percent of each second -- while all the gear is in the air. Obviously this means that there is no friction during that period, which allows rotation and movement. Unbalanced forces can even cause uphill microbouncing. It was supposed to have been improved in 1.8, but I haven\u0027t tested it out again -- I haven\u0027t bothered used landing legs/wheels for spacecraft since 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-02T12:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst offenders are spring and damper force of wheels and legs, too much of it and they will start dancing on the surface.
