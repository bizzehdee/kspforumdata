This was powered by the [Klockheed Martian Special Parts plugin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84224-0-90-ON-HOLD-Klockheed-Martian-Special-Parts-V2-2-28-Nov-Dev-Thread), which used a derivative of Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy code, and also included a neat deploy-on-splashdown feature, which allows the floatation collar to inflate as soon as the pod hits the water.\n\nUnfortunately, maintenance of the KMSP plugin has been discontinued, and no other plugins exist which fully replace this capability - I\u0027m aware that RoverDude\u0027s USI Survivability Pack implements floatation devices; however, they actually use the original Firespitter buoyancy system, which does not fit my requirements as A) the buoyancy of the part does not change between its undeployed and deployed states and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) no automatic deploy-on-splashdown trigger.\n\n**Request**\n\nI would thus like to request an intrepid plugin author to do one of the following:\n\n - Author a lightweight floatation system plugin that alters the buoyancy of a part depending on the animation state, and has the ability to automatically deploy on splashdown\n\n - If said plugin author happens to be RoverDude, would you consider extending the Firespitter buoyancy PartModule to do the above?\n\nThanks in advance"}]}
