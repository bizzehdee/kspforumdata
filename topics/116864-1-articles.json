(Mass)\n2. **Simple.** (Part count)\n3. **Cheap.** (Cost)\n\n**Additional rules:**\n\n- No cheating, including alt-f12, HyperEdit, or config file editing.\n- No part-clipping. No clipping of functional parts (fuel tanks, batteries, crew pods, engines, science parts, SAS) into each other. It is okay to clip structural and non-functional parts.\n- Weight/part count is counted before launch from KSC. Multiple launches are allowed, Sum up wight/parts/cost of all launches. All launches helping the mission must be counted.\n- No use of unbalanced mods\n- No mining on Kerbin.\n- Use at least normal difficulty on relevant settings\n\n**Scoreboards:**\n\n**Lightweight:**\n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Mesklin[/TD]\n\n[TD][Small Kerbin 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2115560\u0026viewfull=1#post2115560)[/TD]\n\n[TD]4,76[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]astrobond[/TD]\n\n[TD][MM-104-New-2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2114293\u0026viewfull=1#post2114293)[/TD]\n\n[TD]5,85[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Nefrums[/TD]\n\n[TD][Smallmunhopper](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2111556\u0026viewfull=1#post2111556)[/TD]\n\n[TD]6,00[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]astrobond[/TD]\n\n[TD][MM-104-New](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2112293\u0026viewfull=1#post2112293)[/TD]\n\n[TD]6,23[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Nich[/TD]\n\n[TD][Econo 2.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2109132\u0026viewfull=1#post2109132)[3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2109132\u0026viewfull=1#post2109132)[/TD]\n\n[TD]8,60[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Nefrums[/TD]\n\n[TD][Munhopper](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2104570\u0026viewfull=1#post2104570)[/TD]\n\n[TD]16,7[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**Simple:**\n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Red Iron Crown[/TD]\n\n[TD][Munsurfer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2124499\u0026viewfull=1#post2124499)[/TD]\n\n[TD]5[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Kermen[/TD]\n\n[TD][munminmuspartschallange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2110343\u0026viewfull=1#post2110343)[/TD]\n\n[TD]6[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Red Iron Crown[/TD]\n\n[TD][Munmus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2107921\u0026viewfull=1#post2107921)[/TD]\n\n[TD]9[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Kermen[/TD]\n\n[TD][munminmuscostchallange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2112165\u0026viewfull=1#post2112165)[/TD]\n\n[TD]22[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Nefrums[/TD]\n\n[TD][Munhopper](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2104570\u0026viewfull=1#post2104570)[/TD]\n\n[TD]23[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**Cheap:**\n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Red Iron Crown[/TD]\n\n[TD][Moons4Less](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2129946\u0026viewfull=1#post2129946)[/TD]\n\n[TD]7,925[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Mesklin[/TD]\n\n[TD][Small Kerbin 2 (minimal cost)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2120878\u0026viewfull=1#post2120878)[/TD]\n\n[TD]8.108[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Kermen[/TD]\n\n[TD][munminmuscostchallange](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129786-The-Small-Kerbin-2-Challange?p=2112165\u0026viewfull=1#post2112165)[/TD]\n\n[TD]15,122[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]purpleivan[/TD]\n\n[TD][Small Kerbin -
