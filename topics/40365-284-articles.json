I didn\u0027t really consider it a \u0022bug\u0022 before others mentioned it. I just figured it was slow loading issue with KSP itself.

I attributed the issue to KSP itself rather then the mod because the same parts that seem to have the symmetry lag issue also cause the game to take longer to load. When I make ships out of stock and other mod parts that don\u0027t have the lag issue the ship loads right away when I go to launch pad. But when I add those parts, like radiator panels, the game takes noticeably longer to load the ship on the pad. I never considered it a high propriety as it\u0027s still completely playable. The symmetry lag is 2-3 seconds, so while annoying to game breaking. And ship load times is like 10-15 seconds longer than normal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis talk of bugs though does remind me of one I encountered with the 3.75 Fusion Reactor (Big white one). For some reason the part does not have any clipping with the ground. I flew a reactor with an electric generator up to my Mun base and when I went to land it the part went right through the ground but then stopped at the point where it was connected to the electric generator. So I have the Gen just sitting there on the surface with the radiators while the reactor is \u0022underground\u0022. Luckily the ship was designed with landing craft on top so it just decoupled and left it there. Used KAS pipes to connect it to my base for power. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater I discovered that as the panel\u0027s turned to follow the sun though the hit the ground and caused issue, like moving the whole setup around and sometimes causing it to start bouncing.

Is it possible partway through the transmission its rerouting your signal through a different relay node? While you technicly have uninterrupted signal KSP may be interpreting that as ending the first half of the transmission and starting a new one, which KSPI does not like much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hfbs\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hfbs\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERegarding symmetry lag, I started up a new sandbox and there was no bug. I\u0027d report on a new career save too, but it\u0027ll take me a while to get to the radiators.\u003Cp\u003ETalking of which, their placement didn\u0027t make sense to me - in the order of unlocking things, you get solar panels that generate waste heat, but no radiators to dissipate said heat. I just think it\u0027s a bit odd that you have have no radiators in the same node as solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou do get the atmospheric radiators in the same node as the deployable solars as I recall. While true if you only have the statics your SOL its also unlikely to become an issue unless you have alot of them on your craft or you sundive. They have a fairly good dissapation and I dont think you\u0027ll ever reach max capacity on just a couple of them in kerbin orbit. Deployable ones yes but even a single radial radiator will give you enough heat capacity to go for years if it dosent happen to equalize and heat is only calculated while the craft is the active one it seems. If you sundive before geting any radiators and timewarp while viewing the craft you might overheat it but most people will be more advanced in the tech tree befor trying a close flyby of the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-28T00:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2014 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by merendel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
