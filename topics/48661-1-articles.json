Many many many many times for each ship I build I need to click on a part and the VAB will not let me unless I find the exact pixel and very often that exact pixel is not in front of any part even though I can see it and my pointer is on it. This means that simply to select a part I have to pull my entire rocket apart, sometimes meaning half an hour of replacing struts and failing to launch many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gets very frustrating when the solution could be so simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small requester that pops up asking me if I was trying to select the strut, tank, engine, RCS thruster or reaction wheel would be great and AFAIK simple to program, you just remove the part that stops you clicking on the parts behind, pull the info on the parts that could possibly have been selected on that z axiz and put all the options on a menu for the user to select instead of insisting on the user clicking on a particular pixel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI also suggest the same method for the map\u003C/strong\u003E when many craft are in the same spot and clicking could mean many craft, not just the last drawn or closest to the pointer in z-space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have suggested this before and it failed to appear on the \u0060do not suggest\u0060 and also the \u0060already suggested\u0060 lists.

I have no idea how much work this type of thing would require, but it would greatly improve the VAB/map experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
