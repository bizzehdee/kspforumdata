This means that placing something externally and moving it inside the hull via gizmos (clipping in other words) does not lower the drag experienced at all, and that part is still just asd subject to overheat as it was externally.\n\nSo, for example, on a rocket is shaped like [this](http://research.uiowa.edu/files/research.uiowa.edu/files/images/Juno_rocket.jpg), parts attached radially below the fairing, which would seem to be be occluded by the fairing (if flying vertical), will still experience drag?\n\n\u003E Occlusion works for parts in a straight line (attached to the nodes in front/rear). Only the front part suffers maximum drag/heat penalties, and every part behind it regardless of size/shape is occluded and only suffers minor drag when angled. I know this is most likely a bug/exploit, but its how the game curently works so nice to let people know.\n\nSo let\u0027s say I have a Mk2 Lander Can with an LV-909 engine and I use the flat surface under the can to attach some stuff, will that not be occluded because they\u0027re not attached to the lander can\u0027s rear node?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E To perform an S-turn, you don\u0027t only need to bank--you have to pull on the stick while in that bank--it is this pitching (albeit sideways) that should cause the change in the vector.\n\nYes, thanks for clarifying.

Basically, the closer you are to Mach effect territory, the more air you will have for your engines and the higher their thrust will get (the effect is quite dramatic, actually). If you go too slow, they won\u0027t give you enough oomph, so pull down AoA again until you get mach effects and a decent acceleration, then go up basically as fast as you can. But, once you get close to the thermal barrier (about 1km/s at 20kms, less if lower) you have to pull up to go higher, faster and thus avoid burning up.\n\nMost helpful thing I\u0027ve read anywhere since 1.0, tbh ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:43:02Z","Content":"It does seem that the visual flame effects actually mean something now; if you see red, pull up immediately if you want your Kerbals to live."},{"CreatedByName":"Speckix","CreatedById":142306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:19:57Z","Content":"Testing to get new email sent for registration"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:25:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks Slashy, I figured it must be related to t/w.\n\u003E I had been thinking about the Mainsail, but it\u0027s a little worse on ISP and a little worse on t/w as well, so I guess that one would be a no-go.\n\u003E \n\u003E Happy landings!\n\n According to my numbers the mainsail would be worse on all counts.

Some of the test if I was going too shallow and too fast the front of the rocket, eg stock fairing, bit bigger sized due to Scan part, start to gain a LOT of temperature, this temp conducts to other parts, but the result is the fairing blowing up some of the time (without any of the mach or heat effects).\n\nWhich leads to observation number 1: Watchout fairings will overheat too, the visual indication was on the stage sequence\n\nAnyway, some of the test went through ok and I had minimal input on the ascent curve, resulting as mentioned before around the horizon at 35k with is pretty optimal, It actually saved up a lot of fuel, more or less 2500 dV used. and thats even getting 100k or more altitude, the result is that with 35k altitude aiming at the horizon you have very little drag and a very shallow ascent, the apoapsis half around the world, and the final orbit nearly done.
