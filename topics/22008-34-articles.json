I then dropped the \u0022anchor\u0022 (which was a pod all its own, UNDOCKED) with parachutes and when it reached 0 altitude I began raising my Jool station via balloon from 2 km up to 50 km (this was a slow process) locked position and saved, then I dropped the hyper long cables and the game still thought I was attached to the surface so it let me save with the station actually floating 50 km above thee surface! I can return to the station but sometimes the game relies it is afloat and won\u0027t let me save again, the kraken is clearly circling but it does not try to go in for the kill. I\u0027ve done this on Kerbin and EVE and been able to even dock other aeroships with it and get them to think they are docking with something attached to the ground (thus can save). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe anchors though have to be disconnect from the anchor pod, they seem to automatically disconnect passed ~2.6 km, best not to have them docked and it best to either retract the cables once reaching the desired altitude or just drop the hyper long KAS winch altogether\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JewelShisen","CreatedById":71737,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T17:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing my newest Heavy Air Lift Designs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy Lift Airship with 24m long S2 Cargo Bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/350szds.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022350szds.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy Lift Airship with 6x Half Sphere RocketPart containers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/33pbo7o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233pbo7o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T22:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JewelShisen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JewelShisen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIntroducing my newest Heavy Air Lift Designs!\u003Cp\u003EHeavy Lift Airship with 24m long S2 Cargo Bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/350szds.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022350szds.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy Lift Airship with 6x Half Sphere RocketPart containers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/33pbo7o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233pbo7o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh wow....Afraid to ask, but any chance of a .craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrluckypants96","CreatedById":67764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T22:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a bit of an issue with the submarine mod: anytime I create a craft with the sub ballast tanks and drive (or fly with the airships mod) it over to the sea, it just sinks immediately at 0% ballast. if using the airship balloons i can get it to float, but the lift is from the balloon and not from the ballast tanks or the craft itself.
