Kind of, anyway. After messing with it all weekend, I have figured out a solution that gets mechJeb to kind of work. In the nost_crewCompartment part.cfg, change the rotPower from 0 to .1. That shouldn\\\u0027t make it fly any differently, but should help mechJeb to at least point it in the right direction. Or try to, anyway. The ascent autopilot seems to work quite well, and I have gotten it put me in Munar orbit, but Smart A.S.S has a tendency to overshoot by a lot, I am looking in to a solution. I have a suspicion that it has to do with how mechJeb dynamically updates the kp, ki, and kd of itself. It should also come as no surprise that mechJeb does not like doing anything with the landing engines active, so no horizontal landing yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile messing with trying to get mechJeb to work, I discovered an error in my math for calculating the ideal center of mass for the ship with respect to the landing engines, so I am going to attempt to fix that. Hopefully it helps eliminate some of the tendency of it adding forward momentum when trying to land. It might also help with landing stability (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding landing stability, I don\\\u0027t think it is a question of weight/mass. My original mass and thrust values were about 20 times higher than they are now, and the same hopping occurred on landing. The ship was also a lot more unstable. I believe that the current issues might stem from two sources, one being the current way that the game handles physics and inter-part connectivity (which might be fixed in the next release), the other being the location of the landing gear with respect to the center of mass. In order for the ship to turn correctly the center of mass must be located between the four landing engines/rcs thrusters. The rear landing gear are positioned slightly behind this point, making the craft decidedly back heavy. For a truly stable landing do not deploy the landing legs and just land on the landing engines. This provides a much more stable landing platform due to how the center of mass is balanced between them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreation of normal maps is ongoing. I will hopefully have some screenshots to post soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maraz","CreatedById":22308,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T18:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood news, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried some even bigger value for rotPower (1.0) and also added some gimbal (0.5) to main engine.

I am not opposed to doing a Firefly. I quite like the design as it is visually interesting and has a lot of little articulated bits that I would like to try to incorporate into a mod. My big issue is with the physics of it. KSP is a physics based game, and center of mass plays a huge role in the handling of a spacecraft. Anyone who has tried to build an asymmetrical rocket has found this out. In general the net thrust vector of the engines must pass through the center of mass of the rocket or the engines will apply torque and the rocket will rotate. Due to this idea the Firefly has a definitive location for its center of mass. It needs to be positioned very accurately to maintain balanced flight, especially since the engines need to swivel for landing. Looking at a profile of a Firefly reveals the problem with the design in regards to this balance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii590/joshCogswell/fireflyCoM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fireflyCoM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that the visual distribution of mass is balanced on the rear half of the craft, but the front of the craft has most of its mass distributed above the center of mass. This makes it very hard to balance, as any mass that you add to the rear-bottom to balance the front-top will require the front to have more mass to balance the added weight to the rear, causing a horribly vicious cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare to the Nostromo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii590/joshCogswell/nostromoCoM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nostromoCoM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how the visual mass is more evenly distributed around the center of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few things that can be done to cheat it, but it will still be difficult to balance.
