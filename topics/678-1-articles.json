I have one main rocket, that I want to fire after I have done two rounds of 8 mini rockets, with an ascent stage for orbit/deorbit, but I cant because I seem to be stuck at 8 stages. Is there a way to pass this limit or am I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ramrod","CreatedById":1454,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-19T09:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made rockets with up to 12 stages.

This for launch vehicles with quite a few engine stages (5?). You can start messing around with booster stages. They don\u0027t all have to go off at the same time. One of my favorite things to do is have 2 sets of boosters as well as the main launch engines. They\u0027re often necessary if you put boosters on top stages as well.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-21T00:31:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith alot, there are glitches where you dont see the earlier ones, but all you have to do is select the command module, but stil a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"venku122","CreatedById":3217,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-21T19:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a rocket with 24 stages before and I regularly go past 15 or 16 stages with my designs.
