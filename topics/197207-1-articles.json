What\u0027s stopping an AI from, say, mimicking the voices and personalities\u00A0of the dead relatives of those fighting against it, and easily manipulating them into their own demise? Such an attack would completely destroy them mentally and leave them completely unable to fight back. Even more fundamentally, knowing how composers of horror films are able to make simple sounds that strike fear into the audience, an AI could formulate sounds designed to instantly paralyze those listening in fear. Moving away from auditory stimulus, the AI could produce images of the loved ones of the fighters being tortured, indistinguishable from the real thing, or simply produce intrinsically horrifying imagery like a typical jumpscare in a horror film.

There\u0027s no Uber AI who took over the world, but there\u0027s basically no history, people don\u0027t refer to the past because they\u0027re drenched in information (to the point you can receive and broadcast channels on your skin apparently)(or inhale information from air). They still have journalism and election though, they just don\u0027t reflect on the past. The culture is a mess and an aggregate of a lot of weird stuff that no one even tries to prove or disprove, but people seems OK with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the RPG Cyberpunk 203X, in which you have basically an AI which randomly swaps bits of data of anything online, meaning that the longer data is online the higher the chance of it being corrupted. And there\u0027s a nano virus which destroyed paper. So, again, you have no real access to reliable information, all you have is a culture war (and its all oral culture), leading to the emergence of Alt-Cults.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue, when you have an AI that can create deep fakes, is not necessarily the immediate effect. You can probably disprove it because you still have access to facts. But twenty or forty year later, how can you disprove this video of events if all you have are non footage, altered or not and not enough context ? Especially since media (like everyone else) are and can be fooled. Finding what makes sense (if things makes sense), is easier to do when you still have first hand witness, multiple sources, and the likes, But as the time goes, you lose sources (I mean, try to find video of things happening in 2007 for instance), which is normal. We did not keep every piece of paper we wrote throughout history. We kept some. If the share of deep-fakes among what we keep is high enough then, given time, they become indistinguishable from facts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning that an AI planting deepfakes around is doing damage to the next generation past and history, more than it is doing damage to us. Which brings a whole new level of way to messing up with people on a cultural and generational level. I kind of like this idea (not that I\u0027m a big fan of it), because it probably can be the result of non concerting AI working towards this kind of goal (cultural dominance), and exploitings each other feedback loop to pump more and more non sensical deepfakes in our information stream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then, in both setting I described earlier, people don\u0027t really care much.
