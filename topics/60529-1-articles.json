One of it\u0027s most notable features is a whole assortment of 0.625m LFO tanks, more RCS thruster types with different special things, and more 0.625 engines that are balanced. For comparison, the 0.625 mainsail equivalent is outpowered by the already OP 48-7S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll it\u0027s tanks are at the correct volume-fuel and dry mass-wet mass ratios, unlike the poor neglected Oscar-B. It also adds some other stuff like a 1.25m linear aerospike (stronger but less efficent than stock, great for Eve landers) and some monopropellant fed engines which are weaker and less powerful than their stock equivalents to make up for their lighter fuel. There are monopropellant equivalents for the LV909, 48-7S, 48-77, and a tiny one barely stronger than a linear RCS port, but is throttleable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere\u0027s a link to the showcase page: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24593-WIP-RLA-Stockalike-0-9-4-released-27th-November?\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24593-WIP-RLA-Stockalike-0-9-4-released-27th-November?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T19:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Oscar B is the MK2 Cockpit of fuel tanks.
