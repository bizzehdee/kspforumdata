Then I added it into a mod I\u0027m working on for KopernicusTech. In the cfg file, I gave it a Dres template, a radius of 53km, and JUST listed its color map, like if I was making a gas giant. I messed with the K-Tech features in the Tracking Station but just kept getting a Dres clone. Then I decided to, once again, use GIMP, but to edit the Dres texture. I gave Hala the new texture, enlarged it to a 23-something kilometer radius, then did a ScaledSpace version of it. You\u0027re right; I need to change the texture. This Reko texture looks too much like one of the moons in Ibuckshot\u0027s Jungis Planet Pack. My plan right now is to switch the white with the orange, then make the white more orange-ish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I can\u0027t WAIT for the download.
