Most of the craft files cannot be loaded in the VAB. All these are just teething issues though. There\u0027s no doubt that the mod itself is an amazing piece of work. And the Instructional cards are brilliant. It would be great if you could integrate them with KIS. (The KIS mod allows you to store the mod manual as a little book on your craft, so you can read it in game. Would be a flourish in keeping with the overall sheen of this amazing mod.)\n\nIt\u0027s got to be a plugin conflict. If you try from a clean install they will load. If you could help us out by trying to find out which dll or other mod is conflicting it would be greatly appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**UPDATE:** It is possible the latest Raster Prop Monitor version is conflicting with our custom ALCOR/ASET IVA or possibly the Porkjet IVA\u0027s ( less likely ), we are researching the issue. You can help us test that by removing the \u0022ASET\u0022 folder and attempting to load the craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T15:09:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"BinaryBad","CreatedById":117229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:24:11Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s likely that RasterProp and JSI may be wrestling with ASET.
