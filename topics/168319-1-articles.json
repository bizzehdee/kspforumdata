Specifically all liquid fuel tanks would be reusable. This thread will be my attempts to pull this vision into reality, with as much fun as possible (and with a few photos along the way)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end-game (-ish) money becomes fairly trivial, science is complete, and it\u0027s essentially sandbox with occasional needs to run some contracts for cash before you go back to whatever project you\u0027re working on. At least, that\u0027s how it appears to a beginner. The relative ease of bringing fuel from the surface versus the thrust needed to bring mined fuel down from the Mun or Minmus before a final burn (not to mention much more limited insertion windows for extra-Kerbin trajectories) can make some players decide not to bother with the relative hassle of mining, refining, and bringing the entire payload down to Low Kerbin Orbit. So I decidd to add some restrictions to myself so I would not become this type of player. There\u0027s not anything necessarily wrong with this playstyle, I just don\u0027t want it to be mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestrictions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf at all possible, launch all payloads via a single stage.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf not possible, all liquid fuel boosters must be kept in orbit to be reused, whether added as fuel tanks as part of a fuel depot, or impressed into service boosting another payload to another orbit (or planet).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll new liquid boosters must have a docking port somewhere on their frame to allow for refuelling.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSolid fuel boosters can (and should) be discarded.

I\u0027m particularly proud of that landing, because I didn\u0027t practice on Minmus first, and I came in at a bad location after deciding \u0022what the hell, land as soon as it\u0027s bright outside.\u0022 ....not to mention the design flaw where the Terrier extended a few centimeters below the landing legs..... The craft landed on the upper lip of a crater at an angle. It made even getting the EVA report interesting because of the severe tilt.

Everything has a docking port for refuelling, even probes. 2 high gain probes burn first (in case something happens to some of them), followed by a pair of low-gain probes. Along with this a refinery, mining station, an ore tug will be launched as well. This will probably mostly be unmanned, with perhaps 1 Pilot sent in all. He will spend a year putting the pieces of the stations together, dropping the Ike mining station, getting the refinery into a decent Duna orbit, and in general resupplying the fleet with fuel for the return trip at the next Kerbal insertion burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could have sent an engineer, but I\u0027m hoping that Kerbals will pop up in Duna orbit, and that one of them will be an Engineer. If not, then an Engineer will be sent in the next launch window, along with a lander and habitation supplies. It could be\u00A0 a bit risky to send so much hardware at once, but I figure that if I can get the sats set up, dock all the ships together and get them refuelled, it will save a lot of time. Even with the god-awful extraction/refinery rate with no engineer, it won\u0027t matter as much. The initial mission will set up a strong base of operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on how the first Duna Flotilla performs, this strategy will likely be replicated by other planets with launch windows. Though depending on the orbital body, the first window encountered may only see a probe or two deployed to ensure that future missions will have no issues keeping in contact with Kerbin. I could have gone with a Duna landing first, followed by a return, but I want to make sure that I can turn what will otherwise be a one-way trip into one that can set up future operations (and semi-permanent) settlements on Ike, Duna, and in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-08T23:04:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2017 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Maul_Junior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
