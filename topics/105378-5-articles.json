The more parts and other assets you have, both from stock and mods, the more likely it is that the memory issues affect you. KSP 0.25, 0.90, and 1.0 all introduced a lot of new parts. KSP 1.0 also improved memory management, reducing the memory usage of the stock game a bit, despite the new parts. OS X Yosemite changed something for 32-bit apps, making it more likely that KSP runs out of memory. The effect the upgrade to Yosemite has may depend on hardware, especially on the GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, KSP ran perfectly fine on Mavericks (and earlier OS X versions) up to 0.25. Version 0.90 had minor issues when I played it with a few mods, but it was definitely playable. Upgrading to Yosemite made KSP 0.90 unplayable, and I had to stop playing it until 1.0 came out. KSP 1.0 has been about as stable as 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two fundamental issues. Unity 4 doesn\u0027t work too well in OS X, causing memory leaks and wasting a lot of memory. Apple on the other hand doesn\u0027t really care about memory issues with 32-bit apps. For them, 32-bit software has been obsolete for a long time, and they think that only stupid people try running memory-hungry 32-bit apps on a Mac.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy problems are most definitely not hardware related - running on a brand new macbook pro w/8 gigs of memory. I monitor my memory usage, and the 32-bit program is running out of memory far quicker than my machine is. Generally when it crashes, I still have 2-3 Gb of memory unused, which means its a 32-bit application memory issue, not a hardware issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t really matter if I\u0027m playing Vanilla or with mods, eventually the same thing happens. I can play longer in vanilla, but eventually I click on one thing too many, and *POP*! My current workflow goes something like this: go to mission control, accept a mission, reload. Go to VAB, design a platform for the mission, reload (as needed). Go to launchpad (maybe), launch rocket, watch it go haywire, \u0022revert to VAB\u0022, reload. Go back to VAB, tweak rocket, reload (as needed). Repeat above steps. THAT just gets me into space. Quicksaving before any maneuver or UI change is a necessity unless I want to just write off the minutes to hours of my life that it took me to reach that point. Eventually I\u0027ll click on the resource tab or the contracts tab or do something really outrageous like try to maneuver my spacecraft... and yahtzee.
