KSP 1 just made it all worse. Because of that I have a good working copy of 0.25 which, while not having a lot of the fancy toys of the later versions, does allow me to play as long and as complex as I like without locking up. Happy enough with that. I\u0027ll keep subscribed to this thread and read the DevNotes. Who knows, one day Squad might fix it up. Fingers crossed for KSP1.1 Unity5 edition.

At least not every half hour like it is not with the 1.02 update.\n\nIt\u0027s a mix of KSP version, mods, OS X version, and Mac hardware. The more parts and other assets you have, both from stock and mods, the more likely it is that the memory issues affect you. KSP 0.25, 0.90, and 1.0 all introduced a lot of new parts. KSP 1.0 also improved memory management, reducing the memory usage of the stock game a bit, despite the new parts. OS X Yosemite changed something for 32-bit apps, making it more likely that KSP runs out of memory. The effect the upgrade to Yosemite has may depend on hardware, especially on the GPU.\n\nFor me, KSP ran perfectly fine on Mavericks (and earlier OS X versions) up to 0.25. Version 0.90 had minor issues when I played it with a few mods, but it was definitely playable. Upgrading to Yosemite made KSP 0.90 unplayable, and I had to stop playing it until 1.0 came out. KSP 1.0 has been about as stable as 0.25.\n\nThere are two fundamental issues. Unity 4 doesn\u0027t work too well in OS X, causing memory leaks and wasting a lot of memory. Apple on the other hand doesn\u0027t really care about memory issues with 32-bit apps. For them, 32-bit software has been obsolete for a long time, and they think that only stupid people try running memory-hungry 32-bit apps on a Mac."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:50:09Z","Content":"My problems are most definitely not hardware related - running on a brand new macbook pro w/8 gigs of memory. I monitor my memory usage, and the 32-bit program is running out of memory far quicker than my machine is. Generally when it crashes, I still have 2-3 Gb of memory unused, which means its a 32-bit application memory issue, not a hardware issue.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t really matter if I\u0027m playing Vanilla or with mods, eventually the same thing happens. I can play longer in vanilla, but eventually I click on one thing too many, and \\*POP\\*! My current workflow goes something like this: go to mission control, accept a mission, reload. Go to VAB, design a platform for the mission, reload (as needed). Go to launchpad (maybe), launch rocket, watch it go haywire, \u0022revert to VAB\u0022, reload. Go back to VAB, tweak rocket, reload (as needed). Repeat above steps. THAT just gets me into space. Quicksaving before any maneuver or UI change is a necessity unless I want to just write off the minutes to hours of my life that it took me to reach that point. Eventually I\u0027ll click on the resource tab or the contracts tab or do something really outrageous like try to maneuver my spacecraft... and yahtzee. Reload as needed. \n\nSorry, that\u0027s unacceptable. Yes, I couched my frustration in a snarky request for more funny loading phrases. Squad may not take kindly to sarcastic feature requests, but you know what I don\u0027t take kindly to? Paying for something that\u0027s broken. I don\u0027t mine paying for software, especially when it\u0027s as awesome as KSP seems to be, but I expect something for my money, namely a functional product.\n\nI really like this game, which is why I\u0027m willing to deal with the frustration of having to reload as part of my workflow, but I would REALLY like to see Squad invest some time in customer service and give us a game that works."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:02:47Z","Content":"JJE64, post your logs after the next crash and we will try to find the cause."},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:09:27Z","Content":"OSX support is lacking at best.

Can\u0027t pin it down but I doubt submitting all the \u0022required information\u0022 will result in anything so I\u0027m posting the crash log. Yes I\u0027m pessimistic about a fix because it seems many OSX users have been having this issue for quite some time and no solution has been found.\n\n    UnloadTime: 37.262978 msKSP(9491,0xa10021d4) malloc: *** mach_vm_map(size=4194304) failed (error code=3)*** error: can\u0027t allocate region*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debugReceiving unhandled NULL exceptionObtained 28 stack frames.#0  0x0000000134ae3d in array_push_back#1  0x0000000134b651 in mono_add_process_object#2  0x0000000134b28b in mono_unity_liveness_calculation_from_statics#3  0x000000002ea948 in GarbageCollectSharedAssets(bool)#4  0x0000000030b902 in CleanupAfterLoad()#5  0x000000002efe45 in LevelLoading::LoadLevel(int, std::string const\u0026, AwakeFromLoadQueue\u0026)#6  0x000000002efad7 in PlayerLoadLevelFromThread(int, std::string const\u0026, AwakeFromLoadQueue\u0026)#7  0x000000002f4c91 in PreloadLevelOperation::IntegrateMainThread()#8  0x000000002f3cdb in PreloadManager::UpdatePreloadingSingleStep(bool)#9  0x000000002f4308 in PreloadManager::WaitForAllAsyncOperationsToComplete()#10 0x000000002f1e14 in PlayerLoop(bool, bool, IHookEvent*)#11 0x0000000065e65c in -[PlayerAppDelegate UpdatePlayer]#12 0x00000090b176cf in __NSFireTimer#13 0x0000009b0d0006 in __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_A_TIMER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION__#14 0x0000009b0cfab4 in __CFRunLoopDoTimer#15 0x0000009b14b54f in __CFRunLoopDoTimers#16 0x0000009b087531 in __CFRunLoopRun#17 0x0000009b086aa6 in CFRunLoopRunSpecific#18 0x0000009b08690b in CFRunLoopRunInMode#19 0x0000009ac648f8 in RunCurrentEventLoopInMode#20 0x0000009ac64503 in ReceiveNextEventCommon#21 0x0000009ac6442c in _BlockUntilNextEventMatchingListInModeWithFilter#22 0x000000939aa721 in _DPSNextEvent#23 0x000000939a9dc5 in -[NSApplication nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:inMode:dequeue:]#24 0x0000009399e77c in -[NSApplication run]#25 0x00000093913bc0 in NSApplicationMain#26 0x0000000065e3ab in PlayerMain(int, char const**)#27 0x00000000003095 in startStacktrace:Native stacktrace:    0   libsystem_kernel.dylib              0x98c0769a __pthread_kill \u002B 10    1   libsystem_c.dylib                   0x96e86eee abort \u002B 156    2   KSP                                 0x0034a822 _Z12HandleSignaliP9__siginfoPv \u002B 34    3   libmono.0.dylib                     0x0134981a mono_chain_signal \u002B 76    4   libmono.0.dylib                     0x01293ae2 mono_sigsegv_signal_handler \u002B 234    5   libsystem_platform.dylib            0x9054603b _sigtramp \u002B 43    6   ???
