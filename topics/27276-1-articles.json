We can see from facts that it was too risky and too expensive, but that is a consiquence, not a con, the con is the REASON why it\u0027s risky or expensive. I have searched for answers on the internet and this is a short summary of what I have read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPros\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EReusability\u003C/span\u003E - Ok, this one is obvious, reusability of the Orbiter and SRBs freed the System of continuous production (which is the case of for eg. Soyuz).

The crucial factor in the size and shape of the Shuttle Orbiter was the requirement that it be able to accommodate the largest planned commercial and military satellites, and have over 1,000 mile cross-range recovery range to meet the requirement for classified USAF missions for a once-around abort from a launch to a polar orbit. The ability that differentiates so much from other spacecraft is the ability to retrieve (bulk) cargo from orbit, for ground repairs or for retrieving experiments. It has been used for deploying, repairing and retrieving satellites and the Hubble, performing experiments in space and docking to and building of a space station and crew rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAn engineering feat\u003C/span\u003E - It was a symbol of the entire nation and a symbol of it\u0027s technological supremacy.

It just had too many sub-systems and so too many things could fail, and too many things to check and prepare for next mission. For comparison, the heat shield of a typical pod manned rocket was composed of one single ablative heat shield, while the Shuttle had 7 different TPS systems, each guarding the surface according to how much heat it takes during reentry. Also note that 2 of the highest resisting materials (the glass foam tiles and reinforced carbon-carbon leading edges and nose cone) were very fragile. The complicated system added greatly to risk and cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ELack of modernization\u003C/span\u003E - or lets call it.. \u0022Ageing\u0022. Elon Musk stated that the very reusability of Shuttle prevented from evolving at the same rate as other rockets. There were very few real design changes. And most of those were electronics and the material that the ET is made out of. At one point NASA even searched for components for reparation of it\u0027s aged computers that no one else made anymore, on eBay. Thus reusability, the holy grail of spaceflight for so long, ended up ironically stunting its own development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ELimited range\u003C/span\u003E - It was designed for LEO and possibly GEO, but not further.

(by looking into procedures of previous flights). Post Columbia safety improvements cut the failure chance to about 1 in 100, but it gave a huge cost and delays between launches, especially when you look that the Shuttle was predicted to have 50 flights per year (yet it averaged at 4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENon-reusable ET -\u003C/span\u003E The external tank was not reusable and therefore had to be produced for each flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help me finish the list, or just discuss, or just blame me what I got wrong =)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-19T13:52:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2013 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nothke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T18:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to remember that the orbiter had cooling system limitations that meant it had to spend at least 30% (approx) of each orbit in Earth\u0027s shadow.

But over time, it gradually grew bigger and bigger - both because bigger is more flexible, and because bigger allowed independent flight. The increasing need for independent flight came from the realization the Saturn V wasn\u0027t coming back to launch a station in one go and the budget wouldn\u0027t stretch to cover a stream of lesser launches to provide for a smaller station. The same goes for cross range, it steadily increased over time because it increased safety.

Indeed most plausible engine designs that offer both reasonable TWR for launch applications and high specific impulse fall very definitely into the expensive to manufacture bracket, of course, if they can be used reliably for many launches, the cost of manufacture becomes increasingly negligable.

As a result, NASA kept increasing the cross range as Shuttle development proceeded - even before the DoD briefly came onboard. I wish I could find the chart we used for input data, but we looked at this back around STS-100 and found that, on average, the Shuttle used about 40% of it\u0027s cross range capability - and the record was near 80%.

Much of the problems with the Shuttle stems from the decision (by Congress) to cancel the Saturn V (to limit the lunar program and save money*) and the space station, thus forcing the Shuttle to grow into a \u0027one-size-fits-all\u0027 mini space station. But that\u0027s not the end of the budgetary woes - because of the budget cap, NASA again and again was forced to chose what cost the least to develop rather than what cost the least to operate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat NASA tried to leap from nothing to a fully operational Shuttle in a single generation didn\u0027t help any...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Few people realize that the Apollo program was essentially cancelled in 1967 when Congress slashed the budget and capped hardware production.
