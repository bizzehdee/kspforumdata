Instead, use \u0022Landing Guidance\u0022 and select the KSC pad. Cancel it once the crosses meet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Come in hot and high. Nothing is as useless as the altitude you don\u0027t have. \u003Cem\u003E::Edit:: She\u0027s aerodynamic. So if you let the crosses meet, she will overshoot. That\u0027s what gives you the wiggle-room when you reach KSC.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Use S-turns to get yourself down where you need to be (in other words, do it like NASA did. It\u0027s a credit to \u003Cstrong\u003Einigma\u003C/strong\u003E that this thing behaves so well, though I can\u0027t speak to its accuracy having never flown a real Shuttle...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) She will want to dive and has an alarming descent rate, so use SAS/thrusters to hold the nose up to bleed off the speed and keep her actually flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Land her like an airliner, with procedural turns. It\u0027s actually easiest to fly past KSC a couple KM to the left of it, then do a base and \u0022upwind\u0022 turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If you get it wrong, the OMS engines have just enough grunt (and fuel) to extend your glide. Use them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Don\u0027t hold the nose too high on landing. If you\u0027re carrying too much speed, go off the end of the runway. Descent rate is (in this simulation) more important. Those are tiny wheels and won\u0027t take anything above 10m/s when they hit the deck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E::Edit:: Many thanks for the rep, my friend!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much for this!

I don\u0027t think I put quite 20 in there, but there are a couple of the 3.5m SAS/battery units on the tank which slightly lengthen it (I was initially trying to go without hidden SAS).
