was talking about when you posted the reply saying \u0022It can be done\u0022 was the player having to point the antenna, as contrasted with RT pointing it for you.\u00A0 What you describe here still fits under RT pointing it for you, with the phrase, \u0022they just pointed to what ever you set has target\u0022.\u00A0 The only thing that was changed was NOT whether you merely had to pick a target off the menu, but rather it was whether the mod also added the physical effect of rotating the probe to aim it.\u00A0 But that still wasn\u0027t the player having to aim it.\u00A0 The player just had to select the target.\u00A0 The player having to do the aiming still seems impossible to me without a script or mod to turn it for you, since you lose manual control when it goes out of alignment so you can\u0027t fix the alignment yourself as a player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
