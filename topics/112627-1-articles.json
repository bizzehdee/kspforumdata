You decide. Both winged flight and rockets first options.  ETT also has an \u0022End Game\u0022 so you can play the campaign game with a built in goal.\n\nI love to hear new ideas and don\u0027t be afraid to let me know if I have a part or two out of place.\n\nListed on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or **[Download at SpaceDock](http://www.spacedock.info/mod/199/Engineering%20Tech%20Tree)** - **May break saved games.**\n\n**(May 5, 2020, 02:12 PM CST - SpaceDock may be having problems so here is a temporary link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/m7c1pw83jqssmki/ETT20200504.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m7c1pw83jqssmki/ETT20200504.zip?dl=1))**\n\n**REQUIRES:**\n\n- **[MODULE MANAGER - Link](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModuleManager/)**\n- **[YONGETECH - Link](https://spacedock.info/mod/1526/YongeTech:%20Tech%20Trees%20Plugin%20Re-Revived)**\n\nScope\n\nA tech tree based on engineering/scientific principles... mostly, that is challenging to unlock yet fun to play through.\n\nGoals \u0026 Requirements\n\n1. Branches of the tech tree based on engineering disciplines.\n\n2. The Kerbals discover rocket powered flight before they figure out winged flight. (or vice-versa)\n\n3. Unlocking the entire tech tree is not required but must involve flights to nearby planets.\n\n4. Parts that generate science are spread throughout the disciplines and are not based on which branch you focus on (e.g. Flight, Liquid fueled, Solid, Exotic).\n\n5. The player may unlock just the branches that they are interested in.\n\n6. \u0022End Game\u0022, so you can play the campaign game with a built in goal.\n\nHighly Recommended for FLIGHT FIRST option:\n\n- Breaking Ground, [Firespitter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22583-firespitter-propeller-plane-and-helicopter-parts-v71-may-5th-for-ksp-10/), SXT and/or [KAX](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/69426-105-kerbal-aircraft-expansion-kax-v261/) for propeller parts.\n- [Take Command](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/153436-122-take-command-continued-launch-kerbals-in-external-command-seats/) to use the external command seat for barnstorming... I mean science.\n\nHighly Recommended for ROCKETS first:\n\n- Interstellar\n- KW Rocketry\n- MRS\n- SpaceY\n- BDB\n- FASA\n\nRecommended for the tree overall:\n\n- Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb for delta V calculations.\n- DMagic Orbital Science to boost your science output. [@DMagic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57416-dmagic/)\n\nYou can play this tree completely stock, but I wouldn\u0027t recommend it.  I believe it is the most fun with several part packs. The many nodes of the tree limits the amount of parts that show up in the editor which makes it easier to find the part you are looking for.\n\n**There is a lot to be updated.  Hopefully most legacy parts in a part pack won\u0027t need to be moved.  I will start with the part packs that are updated for the latest KSP rev.**\n\nNext Revision:\n\n- Update to 1.9.1\n- Enable Part Upgrades\n- Better stock part placement depending on which mods are installed.\n- Re-integrate Interstellar, KW Rocketry, SpaceY, Luciole, and the remaining Near Future part packs.\n- If someone re-releases LLL (Lack Luster Labs) I will re-integrate it also.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);line-height:22.4px;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntegrated \u0026 Tested for 1.8.1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n- **AIES by @carmics**\n- **Alcubierre Warp Drive @RoverDude**\n- **AmpYear Power Manager by @JPLRepo**\n- **Bluedog Design Bureau by @CobaltWolf**\n- **Breaking Ground by @Squad**\n- **Civilian Population by @linuxgurugamer**\n- **Configurable Containers by @allista**\n- **DaMichel\u0027s AeroRadial (DAR) by @DaMichel**\n- **DaMichel\u0027s Cargo Bays (DCB) by @DaMichel**\n- **Dang It!

When you go to install KSPI just leave CTT unchecked. Or just download ETT from KerbalStuff. ETT was originally created for KSPI and is designed so that it will over-ride CTT\u0027s setting making it redundant.\n\u003E Thanks for letting me know. I will check CKAN\u0027s settings.\n\nIntresting, does that mean your mod includes all technodes used by KSPI? This is important a lot of KSPI-E balance depends on it. For Example, the plasma thruster is affected by 3 techs. One tech to unlock the Basic plasma thruster, one tech to unlock Variable Isp and the last tech to unlock Quantum Vacuum.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T10:18:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 10:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:13:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ok makes sense why there are a lot of nodes that need only 95 but lvl1 RnD says research limit 100. shouldnt that mean that it can be up to 100 not anything under 100? anyway thanks for the help. now i gotta save up that 902,000 to upgrade lol (hard mode)\n\nThat is gonna be quite challenging.

I have changed the unlock upgrade tech nodes to align with the engineering tree, but its all in there.
