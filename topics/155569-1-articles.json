This mod modifies the\u00A0mass and density of asteroids as so they are bigger and denser than stock (a C\u0027ish\u0027 asteroid becomes\u00A0big as an E\u0027ish\u0027 one and so on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to steer the asteroid I have placed 2\u00A0ships on the opposite sides of it and they are equipped with a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. When the ships are detached the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is behaving like it should but when they are attached to the asteroid not even a single drop of monopropellant is used and I have to rely only on reaction wheels for attitude control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow is that? Is there any option that can enable the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to work even when attached to an asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side note I would like to stress that I do have Mechjeb installed too and I tried fiddling with its options but to\u00A0no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T20:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you have multiple ships attached to an asteroid, they all become one ship.

If that is not happening for you, then it is almost certain that some mod of yours is blocking it from happening.
