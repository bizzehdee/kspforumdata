You don\u0027t know the sceduled times of start, landing, and duration.

(I hope i didn\u0027t screw up my math \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) Would you take someone serioulsy, if he would suggest, that This is the actual sceduled time? Not really. It may be nearer to the real result than just assuming that the first measured value is right, but it is still just an estimation. An there is a mathematical way to describe how exact the estimation could be. You have to caluclate the \u0027distance\u0027 of every measured start from the median:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor the first fligth: 55347s - 55458s = -111 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond flight: 55529s - 55458s = 71 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethird fligth:55498 - 55458s = 40 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen square everyone of the values, and add the results: (-111s)^2 \u002B (71s)^2 \u002B (40s)^2 = 18962s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sum has to be divided by the number of measurments minus one.

To now get the \u0027standart error of the mean\u0027, you have to divide this by the squareroot of the number of measuremets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E97.37s / sqrt(3) = 56.22 s -\u0026gt; ca 56. seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now say, that the median liftoff time was 55458\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B156 seconds. The error behind the plus-minus is a value for how sure you can be about the liftoff time. The real liftoff time can be anywere around 55458 seconds, but the probility for it decreases the farther away from it. It would be expected to be in a window of 55458 s plus or minus 3*56 seconds (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B13\u00C3\u00C6\u2019).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you measure the landing time in a similar fashion, and you get 67364\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B142 seconds, the fligth duration would be 11906 seconds. And the error of it would be sqrt(56\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u002B 42\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) = 70 seconds. So the measured fligth duration is 11906\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B170 seconds. The real sceduled flight duration can be anywere around 11906 seconds but probably in a window of plus or minus 3*70 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, if you have frame durations of 59.8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B11.4 frames on the left side, and 55.7\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B11.8 on the right. If take the difference of both, the measured difference is 4.1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B12.3 seconds. So the REAL differencs can be anywere around 4.1 seconds, but probalby in a window of plus or minus 3*2.3 seconds. The null hypothesis is, that there is no difference in frame numbers, so the difference should be zero. Zero is in the window of probablity of the real difference (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B13\u00C3\u00C6\u2019, so between -2.8s and 11s).

But one can\u0027t really track the point if you make the swings that large. So you are right, if there would be a reactionless propulsion effect, it could be very small. But if it is so small, that it will always drown in the statistical error of the measurement, than you have to change the experiment somehow to minimize the error. Or make many many many measurments. For example, if i make one measurement shows a displacement of 3.0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B12.0mm, and another measurment shows a displacement of 2.6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B13.0mm, the resulting analysis shows a displacement of 2.8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B11.8mm. Notice how the error got smaller? The more measurements, the smaller the error in the result. But you shouldn\u0027t change the experiment between those measurments.
