Only a complete moron would mistake anything but a spy satellite for a spy satellite. The hardware necessary to get useful photographs of the ground from orbit is not all that small, and it\u0027s certainly not cheap. Meaning you\u0027re not going to shell out more than the cost of a luxury car just for the optics to take pictures clear enough to tell the difference between a school bus and a house without also launching all the many accessories that camera will need to keep functioning in orbit long enough to be worth the expense of the camera itself and putting it into orbit. We\u0027re talking radiation shielding, power source(s), some basic maneuvering system (it\u0027s no good if you can\u0027t aim it where you want to see) and of course the ability to communicate down to the ground in some meaningful way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT isn\u0027t something any credible government would get confused with a GoPro duct-taped to an Arduino.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as a launch hitting an airplane... that\u0027s a bit laughable as well. Yes, it could happen if you\u0027re not coordinating with the FAA, and of course that\u0027s why you\u0027re not supposed to just launch things into the air at significant velocity or to any real altitude without clearance. But the odds of actually hitting a plane? Pretty remote. What are the odds of you walking outside blindfolded, pointing a finger into the sky, and then pulling off the blindfold to find you\u0027re pointing directly at a plane? You could conceivably check into flights coming into and out of the local airport(s) that day and look to see what the flight lanes in your area are. Planes don\u0027t simply \u0022aim at a destination\u0022, they have prescribed lanes to fly in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the likelihood of it hitting a plane that\u0027s the issue. It\u0027s the possibility. Take firearms for example: it\u0027s illegal to shoot them into the air, not because it\u0027s particularly likely you\u0027ll hit something (on the way up or - of more concern - on the way down) but because it\u0027s POSSIBLE. Any rocket capable of putting anything into orbit (even just itself) is by definition going to be a LOT more dangerous arcing back to Earth on a failed launch than a 115 grain 9mm bullet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is why there\u0027s so much regulation about firing things into the air. The combination of mass and velocity creates deadly consequences if things don\u0027t go as planned. If all the very smart and very experienced rocket scientists at NASA can\u0027t boast a perfect track record it would be foolish to think a private citizen is going to have a flawless first launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you do it? Probably. If you\u0027re smart enough and have enough money, it\u0027s not actually that difficult to hurl things into orbit. Hell, North Korea can do it and their rockets suck more than Justin Bieber. Just keep in mind that they have a hell of a lot more money than you do, and a lot more rocket scientists, and they still blow crap up in ways they don\u0027t intend to on a regular basis. Most of what you send up is coming back down, and if you make any mistakes at all, it\u0027s probably going to come back down in a very unfriendly way for those who are unfortunate enough to be downrange.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T09:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get permission for a high power amateur rocketry launch, at least in the States. There is some paperwork involved, mostly in making sure the FAA can issue NOTAMs for the area, but it\u0027s very easy compared to the challenge of actually making the launch. So basically, if you can build an actual rocket, getting permission to launch it is the easy part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as actually getting something into space, depends on what your definition of getting to space is. In 2004, CSXT managed to put an \u0022amateur\u0022 launched rocket into space, reaching altitude of 116km. This is far from establishing orbit, however. No \u0022amateur\u0022 launch has gotten even close. And here, \u0022amateur\u0022 just means something that wasn\u0027t built for profit.
