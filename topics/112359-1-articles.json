Supposedly these are normal matter (including plasma) that are accelerated to very high, relativistic speeds becoming a cosmic \u003Cem\u003Eray\u003C/em\u003E. This is, in itself, is not radiation as we classically think about radiation (gamma, beta, and alpha particles), the radiation process begins or so we have been told in college physics as a cascade that is triggered by a collision. The cascade is exotic and normal matter along with EM radiation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the sources:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuperNovae (Fermi space telescope)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EActive \u003C/em\u003EGalactic Nuclei - This comes from the supposition that black holes at the center of large galaxies are pushing hydrogen into intergalactic space. The concept that black holes do not produce EM is actually false, at least as the process in total. As particles spiral down into the event horizon they increase velocity and collide just as they do everywhere, near the speed of light radiative collisions end up producing high energy x-rays because the direction of circular motion is tangential to the hole. The x-rays are shot out before reaching the event horizon and these that bombard the hydrogen over the rotational poles resulting in electron/proton separation (electrons being hurled progressively outward) and charged particles and plasma following them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My basic question is why is the Cosmic ray problem not worse than it actually is, or are we in a quite period, just seems like that ray showers should be obvious the second you reach orbit, these babies should be pelting the space ship at rates that would set off ambient sound recordings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have already discussed that in space particles can travel great distances before hitting anything. Light can travel billions of years, for example, and be largely unaffected by the milieu. But should a cosmic ray actually collided with a proton, hydrogen or helium molecule, the exotic matter and other particles are free to travel roughly forever. Obviously space is not filled with exotic matter, there is probably a finite limit on how much can build up before it masters its own destruction. Why are we looking for cosmic rays on the ISS, if we know that Earths magnetic field deflects charged particles, shouldn\u0027t the cosmic ray observatory be planted in a deep cavity on some rotationally attenuated asteroid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[h=4]Primary cosmic ray antimatter[/h] See also: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Satellite experiments have found evidence of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epositrons\u003C/a\u003E and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays.
