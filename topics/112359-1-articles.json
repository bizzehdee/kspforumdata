Supposedly these are normal matter (including plasma) that are accelerated to very high, relativistic speeds becoming a cosmic *ray*. This is, in itself, is not radiation as we classically think about radiation (gamma, beta, and alpha particles), the radiation process begins or so we have been told in college physics as a cascade that is triggered by a collision. The cascade is exotic and normal matter along with EM radiation. \n\nWhat are the sources:\n\nSuperNovae (Fermi space telescope)\n\n*Active* Galactic Nuclei - This comes from the supposition that black holes at the center of large galaxies are pushing hydrogen into intergalactic space. The concept that black holes do not produce EM is actually false, at least as the process in total. As particles spiral down into the event horizon they increase velocity and collide just as they do everywhere, near the speed of light radiative collisions end up producing high energy x-rays because the direction of circular motion is tangential to the hole. The x-rays are shot out before reaching the event horizon and these that bombard the hydrogen over the rotational poles resulting in electron/proton separation (electrons being hurled progressively outward) and charged particles and plasma following them. \n\n My basic question is why is the Cosmic ray problem not worse than it actually is, or are we in a quite period, just seems like that ray showers should be obvious the second you reach orbit, these babies should be pelting the space ship at rates that would set off ambient sound recordings.\n\nWe have already discussed that in space particles can travel great distances before hitting anything. Light can travel billions of years, for example, and be largely unaffected by the milieu. But should a cosmic ray actually collided with a proton, hydrogen or helium molecule, the exotic matter and other particles are free to travel roughly forever. Obviously space is not filled with exotic matter, there is probably a finite limit on how much can build up before it masters its own destruction. Why are we looking for cosmic rays on the ISS, if we know that Earths magnetic field deflects charged particles, shouldn\u0027t the cosmic ray observatory be planted in a deep cavity on some rotationally attenuated asteroid?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [h=4]Primary cosmic ray antimatter[/h] See also: [Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer)\n\u003E  Satellite experiments have found evidence of [positrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron) and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. These do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the Big Bang, or indeed complex antimatter in the universe. Rather, they appear to consist of only these two elementary particles, newly made in energetic processes.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Preliminary results from the presently operating [Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer) (*AMS-02*) on board the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 [GeV](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gigaelectron_volt) to 250 GeV. In September, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters.[^\\[45\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#cite_note-45)[^\\[46\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#cite_note-46) A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron\u002Bpositron events, around an energy of 275 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. The absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500 GeV, but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies, which peak about 10 GeV.[^\\[47\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#cite_note-47) These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) particles.[^\\[48\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#cite_note-physrevltrs413-48)\n\u003E \n\u003E  Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2 GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.[^\\[49\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#cite_note-49)\n\u003E \n\u003E  There is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as [antihelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihelium) nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the *AMS-02* designated *AMS-01*, was flown into space aboard the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle) [*Discovery*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery) on [STS-91](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-91) in June 1998. By not detecting any [antihelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihelium#Antihelium) at all, the *AMS-01* established an upper limit of 1.1\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u21226^ for the antihelium to helium [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux) ratio.[^\\[50\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#cite_note-50)\n\nSo cosmic particles in space are interacting with dark matter, and these little babies are gobbling up all the exotic particles produced. This is interesting conclusion because we cannot see or detect dark matter, but apparently exotic matter can, how is that possible? Maybe dark matter is a private club of select exotic particles that have accumulated since the beginning of the universe and form stable complexes that they can, and only can, interact with. Repulsive of all electrostatic interactions they crawl away from regular matter and tuck themselves in the nook and crannies of interstellar and intergalactic space. Maybe this is the a reason that matter condense qucikly after supernova, the dark matter created pushes normal matter away and finally into denser collections. OK so the matter is not antihelium (whew cause that would be way bad, wait why do we specifically care about antihelium?), but how exactly could you detect antihelium in interstellar space, does it have a signature? During an interstellar journey at near light speeds might we accidentally run into a cloud of dark matter and touch off a Cosmic Ray storm around the ship? \n\nI wonder if Voyagers have detected any signs of dark matter on its journey between the stars?"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T16:44:04Z","Content":"Simple answer is the particles travel pretty much forever, but as they\u0027re being radiated in all directions, their intensity drops off with the square of the distance.

If you have a proton or a helium atom with 200 GeV energy and it collides with a hydrogen, the particles that are generated are still moving quite fast, for example a carbon nucleus weighs 12 times that of a proton, its products should still be moving close to the speed of light. The neutrons that are generated would have a half-life of 883 seconds in the neutrons enertial reference frame but that close to the speed of light they would survive at 1000s of years in our reference frame, if not longer. \n\nHas a serious cosmic ray survey been done outside the magnetic field of Earth?"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:50:19Z","Content":"Why do you expect a single carbon nucleus at 99% the speed of light to be dangerous\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF Thats about 10^-8 Joules of energy, which is pretty irrelevant unless it causes an unlucky mutation ending in cancer (which also has a very miniscule chance)."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T04:37:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My basic question is why is the Cosmic ray problem not worse than it actually is, or are we in a quite period, just seems like that ray showers should be obvious the second you reach orbit, these babies should be pelting the space ship at rates that would set off ambient sound recordings.\n\nThe answer is probably similar to [Olbers\u0027 paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox): There are an innumerable amount of stars in every direction.

I\u0027m not supporting their assertions, I\u0027m just curious. There is more dark matter than we can directly detect, there is more cosmic radiation coming at Earth than arrives and so it would appear that somewhere in between both are *happening*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E BTW gravitation always has a positive value.

There is no antigravitation or we wouldn\u0027t exist because it would rip every matter cluster apart.\n\nI never said that gravity did push, but dark matter is obviously not abundant in our solar system otherwise we would have much more difficulty calculating the orbits, it appears to be repelled by normal matter, but the nature of the repulsion is unknown. Gravity itself could the the cause, since the *darks* cannot interact with say the Sun as it comes into our gravity well it speeds up and is always thrown clear, therefore the time spent in our gravity well is less than the time it would have if there was no gravity. So for example picture an elliptical orbit and then picture the time spent above the center of the elliptical orbit and below, the amount of time matter spends below the orbit traveling. This is probably the source of propulsion, because *normals* can interact to form gravity wells, and *darks* cannot the normal assumes on average a position in gravity wells and the darks assume an average position outside. Another object being thrown from our solar system (actually already thrown) is the Voyager 1 spacecraft. Next year Voayger 2 is thought to exit the heliopause. Thus we have two craft that are heading into the well of mysterious particles. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Antimatter doesn\u0027t behave exactly the same as matter: [CP violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation).\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Also if you have a stuff made of matter and an antimatter particle hits it annihilation occurs. You can detect that annihilation.\n\nHow would I know an annihilation deep in space came from anti-helium versus anti-hydrogen? And why exactly would the darks care whether it came from either? \n\n\u003E I don\u0027t think that Voyagers sensors are built to detect dark matter. Both probes are 40 years old and they are made for planet observation. And both of them don\u0027t journey between the stars. They still have a long way to go until they leave our star system (which is thought to be 1 lightyear in diameter).\n\nOfficially Voyager 1 is out! It passed the bow shock of our sun well over a year ago. So if there is if darks are lurking about it should be changing its velocity. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Interstellar medium\n\u003E On September 12, 2013, NASA officially confirmed that *Voyager 1* had reached the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium) in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected.[^\\[59\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Cowen2013-59)[^\\[60\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Kerr2013-60)[^\\[61\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Gurnett2013-61) By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause;[^\\[60\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Kerr2013-60) a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found.[^\\[71\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Swisdak2013-71) A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013,[^\\[60\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Kerr2013-60) triggered by a [solar outburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) that had occurred in March 2012[^\\[57\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Cook2013-57) (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within.)[^\\[59\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Cowen2013-59) Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012[^\\[69\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-How_We_Know-69)[^\\[72\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Morin2013-72) provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because *Voyager 1\u0027*s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980.[^\\[61\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#cite_note-Gurnett2013-61) In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves.
