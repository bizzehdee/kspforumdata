Earth has ice ages because of its axial tilt and kerbin has 0 axial tilt. So it would be impossible for Kerbin to have an ice age because of its tilt but maybe Kerbin is just in a period where it is upright and the influence of Jool will pull it back into a tilted position and start an ice age. A topic talking about the influence of Jool on the other planets would be pretty interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-20T00:22:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2021 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by awsumguy76801\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
