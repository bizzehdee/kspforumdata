The stock wheels suspension are too stiff for Duna\u0027s surface, making it very easy to roll. In stock you can get around this by adding on weak part between the wheel and the frame, like Spider engines, the more Spider engines, the more supple the suspension. You could make your wheel part with much more supple suspension.\u00A0Another trick I use is to add a Jet engine pointed upwards, this lowers the CG of the rover making it much less likely to tip, you could add this to the bottom frame of yours. Long rover trips on Duna are very likely to induce a roll, somewhere as you just trim the w key to keep the rover moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T00:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I can get the suspension working correctly, it will have more \u0022give\u0022 than the stock wheels.
