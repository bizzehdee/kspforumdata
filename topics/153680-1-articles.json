My encounter was not of the flickering one type... solid as a rock! After some fiddling with my science labs in Minmus orbit, I returned to my Moho ship and after some time warp suddenly, out of nowhere, I realize that I will miss Moho while I\u0027m in visual range! My encounter was gone and I had to burn retrograde about 800ish to regain my encounter again\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E at the same place and the same conditions\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eas before? What the hell happened?!! Game engine error of 800 delta V?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I did land, pick up science, back in orbit, put my pilot in cryonic chamber, and now waiting for transfer window back... even more weird stuff is happening... according to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E I have to wait about 75 to 85 days for window to open, but when I plug that time frame in TWP I get tremendous delta V requirements... and guess what... I don\u0027t have enough fuel!

So it\u0027s 200 days waiting vs 85 days waiting... how? How is such a big difference possible? Moho elliptic orbit? I know where lies my biggest mistake... landing with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.12-1.33 with my Near Future Vasimir and ion engines... that took a lot of fuel because I had to drop it from 31 km altitude with constant braking... but I knew it will be problematic landing, after all it\u0027s not my first time to land with such a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E somewhere... but I want my 800 delta V back!
