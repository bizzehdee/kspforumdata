I build a lot of lightweight payloads (probes) and as a result it is too easy to launch them to the farthest corners of the kerbol system. I rarely ever require anything greater than 1.25m parts and even then a couple of the longest KW 1.25m tanks stacked on top of each other is enough to fling a probe well beyond Eeloo orbit. The only time I go to 2.5m is because my payload is too bulky to fit in the 1.25m KW fairings, so I use 2.5m launch stage to match diameters. 2.5m launchers are way overpowered and I can lift giant payloads into orbit with ease. I have never ever built anything close (including space stations) to needing 3.75m parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith stock aero it may not be as realistic but at least the extra dV required to get to orbits means I get to build bigger rockets. With FAR I find myself sometimes building things inefficiently on purpose just in order to have bigger rockets and use more than 2 stages to get to Jool. Things like deliberately building poorly balanced stages, launching with tanks half full, etc. I find I can just play within the spirit of FAR if I continue to make sure my payloads all fit within fairings, use realistic launch profiles (no straight up to 10km then 45 degree turn) and make my rockets look like rockets (no asparagus pancakes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried playing with the kerbal ISP difficulty thing and tried the setting that penalizes your atmo ISP to make up the difference, and still require 4.5km/sec dV to get to orbit. However I found it a little subpar because you get an enormous ISP penalty for the first 10-20s, then the same old FAR after that. It makes your stages very unbalanced because on the ground your engine is unbelievably inefficient but as soon as you cross 10km or so the inefficiency dies off very suddenly as the ISP ramps up to vacuum levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really interested in playing RSS scale KSP as I believe it interferers with some mods I want to play with and I do not want to get bogged down in playing the incompatible mod game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust curious if anyone else has run into the same thing I have? Is there another solution to keep playing with FAR but make it harder to launch to orbit? I am not bragging about my rocket building skills but I tend to approach it with some realism i.e. weight savings on payloads is critical and they should be as small and light as possible to get the job done.

So it is FAR or NEAR for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it a bit easy to get into orbit. But going back to stock where you don\u0027t have to be concerned about aerodynamic stability isn\u0027t really going to make it harder because i can just build a pancake asparagus monster. Going RSS is a much worthier challenge, which i will tackle eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hary R","CreatedById":111339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T11:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell if lift off and achive with a rocket require less delta V with FAR, aerobraking and landing are more difficult, especialy with the aerodinamic structural failure activated. I do pure stock when a new update is released but went for FAR as soon as ferram update it... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell i\u0027m a spaceplane builder mostly so going with FAR is the way for me. I don\u0027t like plane to behave... not like in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T12:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think what m4v is saying is that for his taste FAR is too realistic and people who are not aeronautical engineers may be overwhelmed by the degree of difficulty it adds. After all, not everyone here has a degree in fluid dynamics, physics or engineering. It all comes down to personal preference. If you want the realistic experience go with FAR, but the stock aerodynamics work much better for people who like to build huge spacecraft, and then there is NEAR somewhere in the middle.
