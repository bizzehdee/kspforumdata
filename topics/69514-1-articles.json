The only mods I\u0027m using are [0.22.x]Soviet Pack 2,0,0 and [0.23.5] MechJeb 2.2. The ship doesn\u0027t explode or anything like that. I\u0027ll just be going through the liftoff as usual and every time at exactly 14,000 Meters, the icon for my Kerbal in the lower right of the screen just disappears. The ship itself remains fully intact and still functions, but I obviously can\u0027t do any EVAs or anything that requires a Kerbal. This problem happens no matter what ship design I use, even if I use a stock ship. I poked around the forums a bit and could only find one other thread about this, which went unresolved. The general consensus was that the Deadly reentry mod was the only thing that could cause this, but I\u0027ve never used that particular mod before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T06:43:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 06:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ExecrablePiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T11:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry removing the Soviet Pack mod and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoatRider","CreatedById":103681,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T12:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso try using the MechJeb \u0022Limit to terminal velocity\u0022 option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tinyboss","CreatedById":74022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T13:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re only using two mods, it won\u0027t take long to narrow it down.

No more random deaths at 14km. I had a feeling it had something to do with the thinning atmosphere and life support systems, but as far as I knew, there were no life support systems to speak of. It hadn\u0027t occurred to me that it might be the Soviet Pack, because I\u0027ve been using it since 0.22. Guess there was some fundamental change to 0.23.5 that caused this. Gonna try installing MJ now, though I don\u0027t think that should cause any problems now. Thanks for the help, guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
