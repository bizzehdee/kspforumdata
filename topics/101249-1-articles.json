Asteroid was not just flung out from Kerbin LEO but was seen accelerating. Asteroid had no attached parts; they all exploded. Asteroid was uncontrollable and not under thrust. VOID Advanced HUD was reporting acceleration starting at about 8 and decreasing with altitude. This is speculation, I know, but it looked a hell of a lot like reversed gravity. Asteroid continued to accelerate albeit at a decreasing rate and is now leaving Kerbin and, I suspect, the solar-system at an impressive speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking 2 asteroids using a craft with both forward and reversed \u0022Claws\u0022 is OK and stable at the time. However following a Save-\u0026gt;Exit-\u0026gt;Reload serious craft wobble ensues. I suspect that the forces on the asteroid attached to the backwards facing Claw are reversed by the reload routine. Following craft destruction forces on asteroid remained reversed and it left Kerbin _REALLY_ fast. That is - the docking routing handles backwards Claws, the reload routing gets it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(End theory)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I did\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECatch 2 asteroids. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProduce a craft with both forward and backward facing Claws (my last one had 3\u002B3) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDock backwards Caws to asteroid (90 tonnes) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDock forwards Claws to asteroid (240 tonnes) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E(At this point I went and had lunch, the craft was stable for an hour at least) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESave-\u0026gt;Exit-\u0026gt;Reload (Because I was unable to change craft or return to the space centre - I get that a lot with Claws, no surprise.) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUpon reload observed wobble. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAttempted to dock extra craft to the asteroid craft because I hoped the additional SAS would reduce the wobble. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI happened to dock my extra craft into the 90t asteroid on the backwards facing Claw. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENothing for about 6 seconds \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECentral craft (the one with 6 Claws) seemed to bend in half.

Claw _are_ buggy as hell but I\u0027m sure now that it the reload routine is getting something very wrong because my asteroids are fine until I have to reload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read about \u0022rogue-forces\u0022 and so tried synchronous-orbit. I read that LEO was best because the rogue-forces would be proportionally less - that was why I was at 80k when this happened. I tried a single Claw each end, 4 Claws each end, then my last craft which had 3\u002B3 and was super-rigid. Then I read that more SAS and RCS _could_ control the wobble so I thought I\u0027d experiment by docking _everything_ and see what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking of trying \u0022Quantum Struts\u0022 but I\u0027m not sure anything is gonna beat antigravity and I\u0027m now convinced that is what I\u0027m seeing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally gutted - it was going to look _SO_ cool.
