By sheer definition of being a root part, it can only have things be attached \u003Cstrong\u003Eto\u003C/strong\u003E it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the game is smart enough to know you want to save the craft as a subassembly whole. It checks the root part for active connection nodes, and if it finds them, it determines that the whole craft will be able to attach to something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is where the game\u0027s logic fails. The root part is only tested for open stack nodes, which are two-way connections. It\u0027s not checked for the part\u0027s surfAttach node, which is used for surface attachment, and thus you can have a situation where your booster rocket, having a fuel tank or fuselage as its root, cannot be saved as a subassembly - because despite having a free surface attachment node, it is not checked for it. This is a bug, which Squad can likely fix in short order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there is the matter of the mod that MedievalNerd speaks of, which changes the root part of the craft. It is absolutely unrelated to the mechanics by which the subassemblies are determined to be acceptable or not, as it changes the root part, and therefore allows a part with free stack nodes to be selected as the root - therefore bypassing the problem with surfAttach nodes. Once a different part has been selected as the root, the same mechanics and problems will apply to it. Presumably, as I haven\u0027t actually tested the root-switching mod yet.
