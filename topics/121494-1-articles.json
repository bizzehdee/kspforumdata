Further, it lowers the center of drag which helps the craft from spinning out on ascent. As long as the boosters are mirrored across the hull, the fins create a symmetrical drag. But once they are decoupled, the drag on each booster is now asymmetrical, and it tilts them gently to the side as they fall away from the hull.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xebx","CreatedById":150598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T22:37:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse sepratron like the real rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote : sepratron are only usefull on powerfull rockets when ejecting booster in lower dense atmosphere area at mach 1-2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn higher atmosphere aerodynamic effects are smaller and won\u0027t push the boosters back to the main rocket, you don\u0027t need the sep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame with smaller or low twr rockets, ejection force is enough or speed is too low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T08:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eseems a bit overengineered to be honest\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no thing like overengineering in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is only \u0022trying new things\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T10:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no special liking of fins, and yes, it is \u0022trying new things\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now use aribrakes on short-burn first stage boosters that kick the rocket up to 1 mach in the dense atmosphere.
