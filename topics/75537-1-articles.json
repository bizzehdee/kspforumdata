NASA\u0027s coverage showed the view of the astronauts from several cameras on the outside of the ISS, and from the view of the astronauts themselves with helmet cams. Everything now and they would switch to the NASA mission control room and you could see the views of the two astronauts up on the big mission control screens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with the new interior or the Kerbal mission control room coming in the next update, I can\u0027t get the thought of seeing the camera view of my little Kerbal\u0027s doing work on my own space stations on the mission control screens! I\u0027ve read on the KSP Wiki that they intend to add crew tasks in the future, and what better a way to monitor your Kerbals doing their tasks then like how they actually do it in real life! Camera\u0027s could be placed as an item on rockets, and we could actually get a much more realistic view of rocket launches without having to play around too much with the third person camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about this more and more gets me really excited so I thought I share the idea on the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T15:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DonOfSpades\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T13:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhoa, i just started a thread about mission control in ksp like 2 days ago. where did you hear they are adding an interior? is that going to be the hub for the contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonOfSpades","CreatedById":113309,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T15:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhere did you hear they are adding an interior? is that going to be the hub for the contracts?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/250\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/250\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Mission Control Screen\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt\u0027s been there for a while, but so far no Kerbal has dared enter that mysterious building at the space center. Oh, plus the fact it didn\u0027t have an inside also made it extra difficult. We\u0027re adding a new Mission Control Screen, accessible through the already-there Mission Control Facility, which will present you with a UI where you\u0027ll be able to pick out contracts and decide whether to accept them or pass them by.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would absolutely love it if they added RT cameras to the game.
