The Ship will have to be built in orbit, unless I can build a working \u0022tug\u0022 system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first proto, was built using struts, to build the internal frame. The next part, would have been the outer skin, but this was scrapped due to the failure of the internal system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next idea, is using a modular method, making each section at a time, though I have yet to start it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequirements\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMecha Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome form of Tug for take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA way to build it in space, eliminating the tugs if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo bay for 2 ships at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELength will be per section 4 standard fuel tanks per section, 3 for the engine block.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuvering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of using the nuclear engine, but I dont want it to explode due to over heating, so I was thinking of using two sets of engines, one for normal movements such as positioning itself, and another for moving around fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first problem is, can i make separate fuel sources foe each set of engines, so that I dont have to worry about fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, is there a warp drive system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, will orbital construction be possible at some point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
