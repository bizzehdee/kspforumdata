If you put the node in the dead center, and you load up something like the pegasus, the cockpit spawns in the center, but the rest of the ship hangs over the edge, so the node is offset for a reason, but should be ok for most rockets as long as they are not too large.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T14:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Devo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Devo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo do I but that\u0027s what happens when developers stop updating plugins.
