The game itself makes those changes based on the amounts entered from the cfg file.\n\n@FreeThinker,\n\nDo you know how the \u0022displayCurrentTankCost\u0022 works? I\u0027ve figured out how to have the game change the cost of the tank when switching fuel types, but nothing affects the Current Tank Cost in the GUI.
