This leads to the encounter flipping around a lot when you don\u0027t already have a good encounter. In your case it looks like it flips to an earlier encounter (when you are still on your way to the AP), so what you can do is put a \u0022dummy\u0022 maneuver node (with 0 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u00A0 at around the AP, then it will only show you encounters after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue: you are not leaving at a transfer window, so if you want to optimize for low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E then you should wait till you are at one. Otherwise you can also fine-tune your transfer by changing the time of your burn (along the orbit around Eve), i.e. change the direction with which you leave Eve\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-16T14:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyour way of getting encounters is... not efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst, as ahhans pointed out, you should wait a transfer window. getting an encounter under your current conditions is possible, but very expensive; I don\u0027t know if it is feasible with your current fuel budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, you are not taking into account orbital inclination. that will create a lot of problems. Your orbit being inclined means that even when you\u0027re overlapping kerbin\u0027s position, you\u0027ll be over or under it. the simplest (though not always most efficient) way to fix inclination is to wait until you are on top of a node (marked as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E, for ascending node and descending node) and then make a burn in the appropriate normal direction until you remove orbital inclination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif your orbital inclination is not fixed, you will have a hard time getting an encounter, because the game will only find encounters close to the nodes - because away from the nodes, there is no way you can ever meet the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfinally, from the magnitude of your manuever, it seems you are in an elliptic orbit around eve - which is good, it\u0027s the most efficient way to get in the system and leave for a small cost. unfortunately, it also makes things harder as far as trasnfer windows are concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alternative, very robust method to force an encounter in those conditions (again, though, not particularly efficient) is to touch kerbin\u0027s orbit with your trajectory (be careful of plane nodes!), and then make a new manuever there, to change your orbital time so that you can catch kerbin on the next orbit. this always works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect your previous target was duna, which has no orbital inclination compared to kerbin and is generally much more forgiving\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wrappy","CreatedById":212186,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-16T16:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for the responses but I managed to get back to Kerbin with just about 500 delta V\u0027s, I knew that this was inefficient and that I should wait for a transfer window but I\u0027m lazy. Honestly I still don\u0027t actually know what happened, I ended up just getting as close as I could from that node with the plan to do a correction at the sun\u0027s periapsis, but then when I got there the closest encounter just disappeared , luckily I seemed to be in a good spot at that point because I was able to get an encounter pretty easily from there. Thank you all for the help and I will try the dummy node trick! Also I know that while it\u0027s better to wait for a encounter window I had heard from a youtuber named Matt Lowne that you can do it pretty efficiently by just doing a burn in low Eve orbit (I was around 110 km about eve), and that seemed to work fine in the end!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-16T20:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe closest encounter just disappeared?

Simply read off the UT (universal time?), then enter this in the \u0022earliest departure\u0022, then it will give you the best time/date to do your burn to leave Eve and return to Kerbin. A big elliptical (or inclined in Eve) orbit isn\u0027t such an issue, since so long as you\u0027re roughly within a few days at the transfer window, the burn won\u0027t cost too much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I suspect you\u0027re on the edge of what KSP actually say is/isn\u0027t an encounter (it doesn\u0027t give you it if its so far away) so I think if you get the basic position much closer, it will also be more stable when you make (small) corrections to optimise the encounter to get you home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor interplanetary stuff, its not massively time critical (unlike, say a Mun encounter where you want to burn at a precise point around the orbit of Kerbin) so you can afford the time to use the manoeuvre planning tool to tweak it so its good, then time warp there and do the relevant burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMakes sense to do the prograde/retrograde as near to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E (or while still in Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) and the normal/antinormal as near to or at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
