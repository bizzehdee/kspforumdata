However, I\u0027ve experienced something else that may or may not have anything to do with anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually seems like it might be vaguely related. With a different tank than below, adding in symmetry to the VAB and tweaking upward in scale caused ludicrous mass increases, then tweaking upward in scale once more caused tanks in the part to disappear. This is also hopefully captured in the output log below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew issue: with certain parts, scaling the part up does not increase the amount of fuel/resources inside the part like it normally does. This happened for me specifically with a couple NovaPunch tanks. It is possible to simply tweak the amount of fuel to full in the VAB to solve this. Mass etc. seemed normal, unlike problem I was having before. Does not have to be in symmetry. Tweakscale 1.43, and I *think* all my other mods are updated. So many!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts it happened with: HH-500-A short tank, HH-500-C long tank, HH-500-B mid tank.

I couldn\u0027t find any problem in the MFT config for the part, or the TweakScale one, or the part itself, so I have no idea what\u0027s up with that. A tank can be added with MFT, and it seems like it has vaguely the right volume,but it doesn\u0027t begin with one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo, steps to replicate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Put one of the interstage adapters in the VAB - no tank in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a ton of mods installed, as you\u0027ll see: here\u0027s an output_log with multiple tests of different tanks in it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_log_TS_MFTstuff.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/output_log_TS_MFTstuff.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this has nothing to do with TweakScale, but it seems to interact with it in some way, so figured I\u0027d post here for lack of any other ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also thought I should mention, though you\u0027re probably aware of it already, that TweakScale works, but not optimally, with the kind of tank switching that the new B9 5.0 pre-release does. What happens is this: Add a tank to a part by cycling through its types, THEN tweakscale the part - no problem. Tweakscale the part, THEN add a tank to it by cycling - tank contains as much of Resource X as it would have at the smaller size. So long as you add tanks, THEN scale, it *seems* to work OK. Hopefully that\u0027s helpful in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM-M-M-MULTI-EDIT! Apparently there are also specific parts from the new B9 packs - the low-profile adapters - that are immune to TweakScale.
