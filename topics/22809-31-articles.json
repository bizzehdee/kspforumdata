The one I switched from had just passed over the SOI boundary 10 minutes prior. I usually set my launches 20 days apart so I tried to time warp but it kept killing the time warp back to 1x anyways, for me it seemed to be that the problem was Kerbin has a poorly defined SOI boundary (I believe it is somehow larger during time warp) which was bouncing the ship in and out of the SOI causing KAC to generate an alarm. I found an easy fix, just go into KAC settings and turn off the Auto detect for SOI transitions. After that time warp 6 hours or so and change your settings back, then you should be good. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T11:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice feedback mstrfalco.

The ones I\u0027ve discovered so far are 47 and 23 earth years out so don\u0027t really mean much. But it did bring up an issue in that KAC only seems to look for an SOI change in the current orbit, not within the current maneuver node. It\u0027s assuming therefore that all craft transferring from one SOI to another would do so in one orbit. I think this assumption makes perfect sense. But it would still be nice to be able to add an SOI change if one is detected via maneuver node several orbits ahead\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-26T01:39:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2014 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T01:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell thats annoying, I didnt change any of that code \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E .

I am in year 1, day 66 of career mode, and when I make an alarm for a Kerbin-Moho transfer it tells me it\u0027s x days out - (I\u0027m not at my KSP computer, so I don\u0027t recall the day exactly). So I set the alarm for 6 hours ahead of the KAC determined transfer window and launch. When I set my maneuver node for the transfer the closest approach way off on Moho\u0027s orbit. So I set another alarm for the transfer window, and it shows another 10 days out - and the closest approach is still quite a ways off. And I set another alarm and it\u0027s showing x days out again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than Mechjeb and enhanced Navball the only mods I have installed are for extra parts mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I noticed with the updates it is now automatically creating an alarm whenever I create a maneuver node.
