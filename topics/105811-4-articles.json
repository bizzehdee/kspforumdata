The craft were bigger and the missions more complicated with MPLs. I put 8 at different biomes on the Mun and one on Minmus with all the science experiments onboard. I then did a Duna mission and after that all the MPLs were full with 500 science. Harvesting that fleshed out anything else useful on the tech tree.
