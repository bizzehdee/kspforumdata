The size of the node is not just a visual thing,\u00A0 bigger nodes are stronger ,\u00A0 the size value goes from 0 to 7 .\u00A0 Use small nodes on small light things and large nodes on big heavy things,\u00A0 although I use all the sizes up to and including 7, for most purposes size 5 is strong enough for pretty much anything you\u0027ll encounter in an average players game .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ianyikos","CreatedById":70660,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T22:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t matter what the size of the node was, but it was only with engines. \u00A0They just came apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
