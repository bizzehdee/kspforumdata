I would also suggest you take a look at KeepFit - Kerbal fitness degradation. By timmers_UK. As a way to get data on individual Kerbal health. This gives a health score which degrades on long flights. Which is balanced out by the crew pod size and exercise opportunity on-board the current flight. This can perhaps help you shape the medical history or roster position of each Kerbal.
