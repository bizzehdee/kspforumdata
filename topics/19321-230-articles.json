It normally isn\u0027t this bad; before they introduced roll gimballing in .24, it was quite easy to fly to orbit by doing nothing by tweaking the pitch settings on Smart A.S.S. Surface mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The Extended Trim mod helps a great deal; it allows you to \u0022set trim to current inputs\u0022 with a single action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* It will of course depend on your definition of \u0022behemoth\u0022, but 20 minutes is very, very slow. Small sporty things can hit orbit in about three minutes; serious cargo planes can do it in five to ten.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* With sufficient aerodynamic polishing, you can create aircraft stable enough to be flown hands-off at hypersonic speed. If you\u0027re really good, they can even do it at high levels of time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* However, lacking that: vectored thrust covers a multitude of sins. Stick a few Vernors around the nose, a few more around the tail, and keep them toggled off until the plane starts to become squirrely. Flick them on when needed and they will greatly assist in keeping things on track. Also useful for stall/spinout recovery and deliberate aerobatic sillyness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
