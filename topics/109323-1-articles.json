I hit the escape key and click Save Game and type in a unique name. Unfortunately, that didn\u0027t work like I expected.\n\nI just completed a tourism mission by killing the tourists -- didn\u0027t realize 7 m/s would kill them -- need another parachute on the Hitchhiker can. So I hit escape, then clicked on load game and chose one from a couple hours earlier. Everything reverted except the missions. I have never deleted a mission report, so I can see that all my various saved games have the same 52 completed and 1 failed contract. They all have different levels of science unlocked and funding, building upgrades, but despite that, every single saved game has 52/1 under the mission reports.\n\nIs this a feature or a bug or did I maybe do something wrong? Is there some way I can undo the failed mission?"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:41:30Z","Content":"That\u0027s very odd that everything else would revert but not the missions. \n\nWhat I\u0027d suggest trying is to quit out of the game, go to your saves, move your current persistent.sfs file out of there, make a copy of the save you want to restore and rename the copy to persistent.sfs\n\nThen start the game up again and see if that fixes it. You might also try doing that with one of your earlier saves, in-case that particular save has something wrong with it."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T10:02:37Z","Content":"Thanks! That did get rid of the last 4 missions. Now all of my old saves show the same 49 mission reports :-/\n\nI do have 1 mod: chatterer. I posted this in the modded support forum.\n\nI did run into one strange thing earlier: several tech unlocks relocked themselves and my science points were returned to me. I don\u0027t know if exactly the right amount were returned, but it seemed to be the right ballpark, so I just re-unlocked and went on with the game. I also noted that I didn\u0027t seem to be getting the bonus money from my Administration policy at some point in the past. Not sure if any of this is related, but just thought I\u0027d mention it.\n\nIt is still fairly early in the game. I think I\u0027ll start a new game and watch carefully, and keep saved files in multiple locations."}]}
