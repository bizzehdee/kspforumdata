Unity 5 uses the same old version of Mono and the same, horrendously old and poorly performing garbage collection mechanism. There have been significant advances in garbage collection mechanisms both in .NET and in more recent versions of Mono but the only solution for now (or the foreseeable future) is to greatly reduce the amount of garbage being created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; The devs have not commented because it\u0027s unnecessary - they\u0027re obviously trying to fix this issue as they are implementing a fix for it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a matter of opinion based on a faulty premise. The devs are not doing anything to directly address this issue, the Unity 5 changes will make no difference except that some of the existing UI code creates more garbage than it should and this may improve during the UI overhaul. It requires a different programming approach to what would be obvious for Mono/.NET. One of the first things that people developing games on Unity learn is that you should avoid as much creation of garbage during scenes as possible. GC based memory allocation has a number of advantages and disadvantages but the most critical thing for game development (or anything that requires consistent, high performance) is that you have little control over when the garbage collection runs and there is no way of telling how long it will take. It makes it too easy for developers to not think about memory allocation and deallocation because \u0022the language runtime handles it automatically\u0022 when they actually have to think about it quite carefully and deliberately write their code in such a way as to reduce creation of garbage to a minimum. Lots of the slightly odd looking design decisions in the Unity API were explicitly made to make it easier to avoid these issues. I, also, would like to see an official comment from Squad that they are aware of the problem (to be fair they have done this part several times) and for them to commit to improving the situation within a reasonable timescale. I don\u0027t mind if this happens after 1.1 but I will be very disappointed if 1.2 (or whatever the next version will be) is not mainly a bug-fixing and optimisation update...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s weird.

As time has progressed, the developers have learned new tricks. Code has piled on top of code. Things have grown more and more complicated. Fixing one bug causes another. etc. etc. The only thing that will totally resolve the issue is time. If the game continues to make money, the developers will continue to improve and so will the game. There will probably come a time when KSP 2 will become a necessity, A complete and total rewrite with all of today\u0027s popular features being the focus of code development. Not just \u0022launching frogs into space\u0022. Patience is key. Support the developers with kind words of encouragement.
