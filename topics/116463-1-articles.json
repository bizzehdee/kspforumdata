The issue is that the game runs very well but every few seconds there is a noticeable pause. How noticeable this pause is varies from person to person, for some it can freeze for over half a second every few seconds.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...as the Unity developers are the only ones who can fix this, not Squad or any other Unity customer.\n\nSorry but, while it is true that Unity could mostly fix this by upgrading the version of Mono used, it is not true that Squad or any other Unity customer can not fix this. Squad could rewrite KSP to virtually eliminate all garbage creation during scenes and manually trigger the garbage collection at points where the player wont notice just like virtually every other person does that uses Unity to implement their game. Yes, KSP is a significantly more complex codebase than most other games (built on Unity or otherwise) but this doesn\u0027t change the fact that there are some terrible bits of coding in KSP that scatter garbage like a 1000kg bomb in the back of a garbage truck...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s with the GC. Unity 5 has an entirely new GC. The devs have not commented because it\u0027s unnecessary - they\u0027re obviously trying to fix this issue as they are implementing a fix for it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003Ccitation(s) needed=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/citation(s)\u003E\n\nPoint by point:\n\n\u003E It\u0027s with the GC.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\n\u003E Unity 5 has an entirely new GC.\n\nAs far as I am aware, this is not true. Unity 5 uses the same old version of Mono and the same, horrendously old and poorly performing garbage collection mechanism. There have been significant advances in garbage collection mechanisms both in .NET and in more recent versions of Mono but the only solution for now (or the foreseeable future) is to greatly reduce the amount of garbage being created.\n\n\u003E The devs have not commented because it\u0027s unnecessary - they\u0027re obviously trying to fix this issue as they are implementing a fix for it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis is a matter of opinion based on a faulty premise. The devs are not doing anything to directly address this issue, the Unity 5 changes will make no difference except that some of the existing UI code creates more garbage than it should and this may improve during the UI overhaul. It requires a different programming approach to what would be obvious for Mono/.NET. One of the first things that people developing games on Unity learn is that you should avoid as much creation of garbage during scenes as possible. GC based memory allocation has a number of advantages and disadvantages but the most critical thing for game development (or anything that requires consistent, high performance) is that you have little control over when the garbage collection runs and there is no way of telling how long it will take. It makes it too easy for developers to not think about memory allocation and deallocation because \u0022the language runtime handles it automatically\u0022 when they actually have to think about it quite carefully and deliberately write their code in such a way as to reduce creation of garbage to a minimum. Lots of the slightly odd looking design decisions in the Unity API were explicitly made to make it easier to avoid these issues. I, also, would like to see an official comment from Squad that they are aware of the problem (to be fair they have done this part several times) and for them to commit to improving the situation within a reasonable timescale. I don\u0027t mind if this happens after 1.1 but I will be very disappointed if 1.2 (or whatever the next version will be) is not mainly a bug-fixing and optimisation update...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s weird. Apparently everyone experiences this, but I had a hell of a time trying to figure out what you all meant by stutter. At first, I thought you were just talking about lower frame rates when building big ships, but now it sounds like something else. How long do you need to play for this to crop up? I don\u0027t really play marathon sessions. More around 3 hours or so at a time.\n\nYou can reproduce this on a stock install with a new save though it is usually more noticeable with lots of mods and a large save file. Just place a command pod in the VAB and then hold down the left or right cursor key to continuously rotate the camera. Keep watching carefully and you should see a glitch in the rotation every few seconds. If you can\u0027t see it there then try putting the pod on the launch pad and rotating as before. If you still can\u0027t see it then try with the Kerbal X stock vessel.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is this something that once I see, I won\u0027t be able to unsee it?\n\nThat\u0027s quite possible. People\u0027s differing perceptions almost certainly plays a part in why some don\u0027t see the problem (or don\u0027t see it as badly) but there seem to be several other factors too...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T14:02:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar**"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T14:20:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ve noticed this myself, but generally only in games that have been running for a while - total gameplay time in a particular save, as opposed to in a particular session of gameplay.
