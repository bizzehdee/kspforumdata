You want just as much thrust as necessary to lift the fuel you\u0027re carrying at about 1.5Gs of acceleration, and no more.

Because the whole rocket scales up, including the payload. Bigger rockets can take heavier payloads the same distance as smaller rockets and their lighter payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe efficiency factor that determines how far a rocket goes is largely the percentage of weight that\u0027s fuel. More fuel for the same weight makes you go further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the mass of your rocket is almost all fuel tanks anyway, how do you add more?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key thing to do is actually not to add fuel, but to ensure you minimise your non-fuel weight at all times. In particular:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Use the smallest fuel tanks you can get your hands on. Down to the FL-T200 fuel tanks have identical proportions of fuel weight and dry weight (i.e. 4 quarter size tanks are identical to 1 full size tank). You get far better efficiency using small ones as you can jettison their dry mass much sooner rather than wasting fuel carrying a partially empty tank for a long time while burning all of the fuel in a large tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Staging fuel tanks good, staging engines bad. For a kerbin ascent you use all engines right from the start. You can drop excess ones but you should not be carrying engines you\u0027re not using. Any on the payload can have a fuel line run up to them so they only use fuel from the lower stages. Any engine you\u0027re carrying that isn\u0027t being used means you\u0027ve had to fit another engine to lift it, so you\u0027ve got twice the weight in engines that you need (and more fuel burned to lift this extra weight. On interplanetary trips where you may need fine control for landing or will be dipping back into an atmosphere the situation isn\u0027t as simple but it\u0027s a good rule of thumb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T21:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot nothing to add that everybody else hasn\u0027t said. Those SRBs ain\u0027t going to get you very far and then your main tank doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to get you the rest of the way. Your lander looks beefy enough to hit the Mun. I\u0027d suggest replacing the SRB outriggers with two F-800 tanks and an LV-30 each, and set an external fuel duct to run from them to the center engine. Use all five engines at liftoff; that Mainsail in the center should get you the rest of the way. If it doesn\u0027t, add a third can of gas.

The first 20km of ascent you\u0027re fighting both the highest gravity and the highest drag. Keeping the acceleration down during that phase is mainly to keep your rocket below terminal velocity to make a small reduction to fuel wasted on overcoming drag however.... If you are comfortable creating a monster you can create a pancake of SRBs around your payload and just force the thing to 100km altitude through sheer brute force. Your Kerbals may be experiencing 10g on the way up but they\u0027re resilient fellows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rough estimate with stock aerodynamic model and terrible rockets I make says that to get any payload to orbit I am going to be burning roughly 3 to 6 times its mass in fuel (depending on how many rocket motors are involved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have established a stable orbit above the atmosphere with your fueled mission section getting to land on the Mun is relatively easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA minor thing but I would change the staging so that the parachutes are in stage 0 and the Munar ascent rocket is a separate stage.
