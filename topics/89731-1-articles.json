My initial (very old) design was a catamaran-style (ie dual-fuselage) craft that later evolved into square frame (built from girders) with engines in back and wings/fuel tanks on sides. After that i tried adding more space/mass for payload by simply repeating that frame in two then three layers, with middle layer housing fuel tanks and engines. Part count sharply spiked to over 1300 parts, and my machine barely held it together during flight. When i tried to get even more payload space, length of girders was a limiting factor since too many parts lengthwise caused serious sagging/oscillation in middle. I wouldn\u0027t mind having 20m long girders. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one example when i experimented with procedural wings and procedural tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iyd43DN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iyd43DN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is another old craft using B9 (Was it back v0.23 ?

This thing could haul into orbit anything, from space probe to half-built space station. With this one i managed to assemble a 300t space station made of orange tanks. Each trip took 2 tanks at once \u002B minor stuff like RCS fuel for tug fleet. Each tank was assembled into space station with four tug drones coupled to radially attached standard docking ports.
