If you couldn\u0027t already tell, I\u0027m new and this is my first post outside the welcome forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter spending a lot of time ignoring them since I started playing during the Steam Summer Sale, I\u0027ve been busy working on SSTOs lately, reading the forums for help and inspiration here and there. Noob that I am, I figured I\u0027d share the results of my work. Unfortunately, I\u0027ve not thoroughly tested exactly what these craft are capable of, so I can\u0027t tell you precisely how much fuel or tonnage can be delivered to orbit with a good pilot, or what other destinations in the system they can reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u003C/strong\u003E tell you that they \u003Cstrong\u003Edo\u003C/strong\u003E achieve orbit, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eare\u003C/strong\u003E capable of docking with a space station in a 150km orbit. Everything spacegoing in this post has a standard-size docking port, so any of them can refuel in space to attempt other destinations. The larger ones can be used to deliver fuel, monoprop and Kerbals to a station, or attempt to transfer a payload from one orbit to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I get into specifics, my design philosophy was to keep things as simple as possible. After doing some research on the forums, I know that better results could be achieved with precision building, flying, engine management, and more patience during ascent, but I really enjoy playing this game with dead reckoning, and building an SSTO that can make an easy successful ascent is highly satisfying to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter unlocking most of the tree with rocket missions to Minmus and the Mun, I started building air-breathing aircraft with a very simple \u0027fighter\u0027: A single-engine jet with cockpit, two fuel tanks and four radial intakes, delta wings, tail, canards. I later upgraded it to a turbojet and added science equipment. Stinger is a joy to fly, even lifts off the runway with no control input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-M1kPWE2ej_A/U_vyp--aSBI/AAAAAAAADe4/8jUlYDd-6xY/s640/2014-08-25_00006.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-25_00006.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI moved on to SSTOs using the Aeris 4A as initial inspiration.

After consulting the forum a bit to learn about how to fly an SSTO, and discovering the wonders of proper flight paths, ram intakes, aerospikes, throttle, engine and intake management, airhogging, strut spam, and multiple canard sets, I put the Aeris-based design aside and tried a medium spaceplane.

But, Jeb managed to get her docked to a space station at 150km, with enough fuel that I could\u0027ve dropped some off. She and Jeb stayed up there for a spell while I went back to work. I went back to the forums and noted the advice about center of mass and center of lift, and realized that FDV-1 couldn\u0027t take off because she might not have enough lift overall, and her CoM and CoL were not close enough together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to try smaller craft again, but after having trouble with engine management on FDV-1, I started looking for ways to simplify things. Enter RAPIER engines! I took Stinger, removed the turbojet, and bolted on two RAPIER engines with some extra fuel and extra lift. I replaced the single intakes with bi-couplers and dual intakes (didn\u0027t really have room for more). After some test launches and transitions to closed cycle with Hornet, I realized that I could probably make things even simpler with a single-engine craft and more airhogging. I would later come back, borrow the airhogged wings from my next project, and put the turbojet back on the centerline:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Lax8ABTS2xU/U_vtIivm_nI/AAAAAAAADdY/G9gBeWjAb3o/s640/2014-08-25_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-25_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back to Stinger again, swapped the turbojet for a RAPIER engine, and replaced the forward fuselage with an FL-T200 and 400 and a monoprop tank. I mounted 8 intakes on cubic octagonal struts to the leading edge of the wings, added a bit of lift and an inline docking port. I still couldn\u0027t seem to get ascent right, though; I couldn\u0027t get Wasp fast enough before I rose too far and the engine switched modes, sucking up all the fuel. I could make orbit, but barely. (Wasp is pictured behind FDV-1 above.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to come back to it later, and using all that I\u0027d learned thus far, I built a new heavy SSTO, FDV-2. I started with a Jumbo-64, ASAS module for additional torque, and large monoprop tank, adapter, and mk2 cockpit. Knowing I\u0027d need a place to mount canards and a way to keep the center of gravity forward as fuel was used during ascent, I mounted an FL-T800 with fuel and ox flow disabled, and forward-facing shielded docking port. Mindful of FDV-1\u0027s failings, I mounted 4 turbojets at the rear of the Rockomax tank using a quad-adapter to keep them as close to the centerline as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kept the basic wing structure from FDV-1, and attached them in two rows, again supporting them with struts. I very carefully placed a total of 4 Mk1 structural fuselages at the rear wingroots on the Rockomax tank, and capped each with an intake and a RAPIER engine, rather than aerospikes, so I wouldn\u0027t be hauling idle engines during ascent. I abandoned monoprop RCS in favor of Vernor thrusters, two facing in each direction. I replaced the static solar panels from earlier SSTOs with 2x SP-Ls arranged radially at 45 degree upward angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I started airhogging and canard spamming in earnest. I mounted 3 pairs of advanced canards to the nose and a set of delta-deluxe winglets to the Rockomax adapter behind the cockpit, and used cubic octagonal struts and quad-couplers with 4 ram intakes to mount groups of them to the leading edges of the wings. I ended up with a total of 20 intakes, including the ones at the rear, and 8 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EZezys43WAw/U_v3ottWjqI/AAAAAAAADfQ/k9CG9ZybGJ0/s640/2014-08-25_00007.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-25_00007.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a great ratio as airhogging goes, but this got the FDV-2 prototype into orbit with way more fuel to spare than FDV-1, she could actually lift off the runway, and with the engines all mounted close to the centerline, she was fantastically stable all the way up, with SAS able to prevent flameout spins on its own. Even better, with so few tanks, she requires very little fuel management through the mission cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor FDV-2B I added a Hitchhiker so I could deliver redshirts--err, additional staff--along with the fuel and monoprop, replaced the delta-deluxe winglets with two pairs of standard canards, and later added two more intake groups for a total of 28. FDV-2B is definitely the most practical SSTO I\u0027ve built, making orbital deliveries on manual control safe enough to be routine, even if it\u0027s not a huge amount of fuel per trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nhrlaQ-a0yk/U_wCQq98VjI/AAAAAAAADfw/E9QiHwEcONA/s640/2014-08-25_00009.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-25_00009.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few successful test flights and orbits, I went back to the drawing board and decided to go bigger. For FDV-3, I wanted to make a super-heavy SSTO. For the prototype, I decided to go with a Mk3 cockpit, two fuselages, Mk3 to Mk2 adapter, Mk2 to Mk1 adapter, and a basic jet along the centerline for its tiny kick at takeoff. (I figured a well-meaning KSC engineer looked at the forlorn pile of basic jets abandoned after turbojets were invented, and decided to give one a home.) For payload and main engines, I went with a copy of FDV-2\u0027s payload and engine section mounted on either side of the fuselage, and for canards and reserve fuel, a copy of her nose tank in front. I also placed fuel lines from the frontmost fuselage to the Rockomax tanks; since engines pull fuel from the furthest tanks available to them, this ensured that all the engines mounted to the Rockomax tanks pull jet fuel from the rearmost sections of the main fuselage first, keeping the center of gravity forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spammed \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything:\u003C/strong\u003E 4 SP-L solar panels, 8 sets of canards, 12 Vernor thrusters, a total of 17 engines, 3 rows of wings, a total of 72 intakes, and ye gods, the struts. I can\u0027t tell you how much time I spent launching and reverting and adding struts, and there\u0027s still some wing flex. But you know what? Despite having 300\u002B parts and causing time dilation on my PC, she flies pretty well, and can haul a lot more fuel, too. She\u0027s less stable at flameout, but with RCS, SAS, and optionally shutting down the outer 4 turbojets, still controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eid7YpXlrok/U_vtGzvmFwI/AAAAAAAADdI/GHi7OdhCz90/s640/2014-08-24_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-24_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor FDV-3B, I replaced the 4x SP-L solar panels with 2x Gigantors, added a centerline tail, a third Mk3 fuselage right behind the cockpit for additional fuel, a structural wing pair right there, and reworked the aerodynamics at the nose: I reduced the number of canards to 5 pairs, and added a set of delta wings to the main fuselage, which extend just barely over the top of the Rockomax tanks on either side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rQ_2uKsV2k/U_vtH43KmMI/AAAAAAAADdk/nN2acLRTt_0/s640/2014-08-24_00011.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-24_00011.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe actually has the same number of parts as, is ever so slightly \u0027cheaper\u0027 than, and performs slightly better than the prototype. One item of note: I discovered that since the main fuselage has more ground clearance than the payload sections, the best way to mount the nose gear is with a large structural pylon. I have to be careful not to punch it off by inadvertently staging a second time. I did it on purpose to see what would happen: She can\u0027t take off without it. Doubt she could land either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith how easy FDV-2 is to fly, I doubt FDV-3 will ever be used for anything other than special occasions, but she is an amazing beast as far as I\u0027m concerned!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after all that, I finally brought Jeb home from the space station and parked FDV-1 outside the SPH, deciding to leave it there as a permanent static display (as pictured earlier). He then flew Wasp up to my space station and back with a much better ascent than before, and parked it right beside FDV-1 afterwards (also as pictured earlier, behind FDV-1). Last on my checklist is a successful mission with Hornet. She really hauls arse into orbit, it\u0027s hard to keep her from breaking atmo too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, onto the ships themselves!

Use groups 1 and 2 to toggle your intakes, using them as airbrakes as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026amp;id=0B6h_jC64zB8dUzdQWTM3SXZ5TXc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E (Some minor strut changes have been made since initial posting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFDV-3B: Super-heavy SSTO. The biggest I\u0027ll be attempting with this old PC. 312 parts and one huge advancement over previous SSTOs: A ladder. Causes time to slow down about 25%, for me. With my imperfect flying, it can deliver 2 Kerbals, 1500 monoprop, ~4000 fuel, and ~5000 oxidizer, into ~100km orbit, with reserve FL-T800. Better pilots will achieve better results. \u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E Ascent profile changed slightly. Also, reuploaded because I failed to re-lock steering on all the wheels and re-save after taking the photo. This caused the ship to depart the runway in an unexpected direction upon takeoff. Oops. \u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Reuploaded after I realized I forgot the forward pair of lateral Vernor thrusters. Double oops. A few other minor changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lAtTR0wkx3c/U_wVvNBSnFI/AAAAAAAADgc/EZWATggcE5w/s640/2014-08-25_00014.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-08-25_00014.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore takeoff, activate SAS and resource display, throttle up to max, close two intake groups with action groups 1 and 2. This leaves a total of 16 intakes open at takeoff to feed the 17 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacebar to get the party started. Only hit it once, or you\u0027ll punch off your nose gear! She isn\u0027t safe to take off or land without it. Use about 3/4 of the runway, then rotate. Careful--it takes a few moments to get the nose up, but once it is, it\u0027s easy to over-roll and start tumbling. After liftoff, gear up and 50 degrees AOA. Open intake group 1 after passing out of the lowest atmosphere layer, and group 2 at around 17km. Toggle the centerline basic jet off with group 9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart pitching forward at 19km. Zero your AOA at 20km. The ship will continue to rise while you accelerate. As your rate of climb approaches zero, pitch up 10-12 degrees to maintain at least a slow ascent. Activate RCS; the Vernor thrusters will help prevent spins. Try to reach at least 1700m/s before passing through 30km. More speed is better. SAS and RCS should keep you from spinning out of control as your engines flame out, but if your flameouts are too unbalanced, quickly kill the outer four turbojets with group 8; that should help stabilize you while still allowing you to eke out some speed from the inner four.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the RAPIER engines will switch modes, and temporarily, some or all of your turbojets will spring back to life. Pitch carefully up to 45 degrees to get your apoapsis rising and break atmo ASAP. SAS and RCS should still keep you pretty stable, but if you didn\u0027t before, you might want to hit group 8 now to shut down half your turbojets. In any case, once your turbojets have all flamed out again, group 3 will kill them all and close all intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your apoapsis hits the desired point, kill your engines. You may need to goose them a few times to keep your apoapsis where you want it as you continue rising through the stratosphere. Eventually, circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking port and Gigantor panels can be toggled with group 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you offload most of your payload, deorbit, and return to atmospheric flight near KSC, the fuel in the FL-T800 should be enough to get you home, and the oxidizer in it should keep your center of gravity forward for stability during descent. (Don\u0027t forget to enable the fuel feed from that tank.) If you want to do a little flying around (or, like me, you have trouble with precision deorbiting), put fuel back in the main fuselage as necessary, filling from the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse your deorbit burn to lower your periapsis to about 40km. Once you\u0027ve done that, hit 3 again to reopen all intakes, then 4 to shut down the RAPIER engines and reactivate the turbojets. That should be plenty of thrust for flying and landing, but if you want more, 5 will reactivate the RAPIER engines and toggle them back to air breathing mode.

I\u0027m at a loss to explain this, and I have no idea if it will happen to anyone else flying it. Makes yawing a bit more difficult. Despite that, I managed a safe landing. Hopefully, if it happens again, the additional centerline tail on FDV-3B will at least help a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026amp;id=0B6h_jC64zB8dbDRMVVlOQlQ1Nms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E (adjustments and fixes have been made since the photo was taken)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew!
