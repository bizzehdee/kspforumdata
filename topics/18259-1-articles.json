Hot objects, emit radiation and the color (frequency) changes with the temperature. Radiating away some of their energy causes them to cool down. radiation comes from all atoms in the material, but only the radiation emitted near the surface tends to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space, where air and water are not abundant, convection is not practical, at least, you can\u0027t just vent the hot air into space or you would run out of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can conduct heat into cold mass and jettison the mass, but you\u0027re going to run out of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to get rid of your heat is to emit it as photons. So a space radiatior uses a large heat conductor, which has a maximum surface area with an unobstructed view of space. (if photons were emitted from the radiator only to be re-absorbed by other parts of the craft, it would be pointless. and since the surface is all the matters, they tend to be thin. And they tend to not have parallel fins. and they tend to be far away from the ship, so that the photons emitted, are not reabsorbed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#edit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also tend to be perpendicular to the solar panels. because you dont want them absorbing solar radiation. Generally you don\u0027t want any parts of the ship absorbing solar radiation except the solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-31T08:03:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2012 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elios","CreatedById":42945,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T09:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConvection flat out doesnt work in a vacuum \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe engineers that built the APU sub systems found that out the hard way when the blew up an APU in a vacuum chamber test \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe heat had no where to go so it started to heat the fuel line which for the shuttle APUs is Hydrazine not fun stuff and BOOM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother fun fact about cooling on shuttle the cooling loop is the things achilles heel its the one system that if it fail would basically make them have to de-orbit on the spot if any one of the 2 coolent pumps failed \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut just about every thing makes heat so you have dump it over board and the only way to do that in space is radiate it out \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can do other tricky things like use flash evaporators but your going to run out of water at some point \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethermal control is a big issue on spacecraft would be nice to see it added to the game at some point\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Binky","CreatedById":35418,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T09:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, there was a problem with the radiators on Skylab due to a malfunction at launch.
