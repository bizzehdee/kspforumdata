Look again, It\u0027s the small antenna that doesn\u0027t snap. I\u0027ll be adding a heatshield on it on the meantime but I\u0027m really curious what is causing this problem.\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the antenna isn\u0027t extended because it\u0027s the small one that can\u0027t be. It\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Enot snapping\u003C/strong\u003E, it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Eheating up\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked at your pictures but it\u0027s hard to tell from them which one is the part you\u0027re referring to or where it\u0027s situated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the final picture indicates it failed due to excessive G-Forces, not overheating... granted it was only 2.5 G so there\u0027s something unusual going on. You need to post some log files. output_txt.log (or player.log if Linux or Mac)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
