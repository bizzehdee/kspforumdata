In this time period, the ISS is orbiting at the day-night terminator which means, that it is constantly or close to that in the sunlight. That in turn puts restrictions on the heat regulation which prevents Dragon from docking. I assume that this has to do with the orientation of the ISS, which needs to e adjusted for Dragon. If Falcon launches on January 6, it will coast for 2 days and dock at Jan 8.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aamick","CreatedById":131356,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T16:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lohan2008\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lohan2008\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter it initially appeared the launch could go ahead Friday or Saturday, sources confirmed late Wednesday that the liftoff might be postponed until late December or January. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://spaceflightnow.com/2014/12/17/spacex-expected-to-set-new-falcon-9-launch-date/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://spaceflightnow.com/2014/12/17/spacex-expected-to-set-new-falcon-9-launch-date/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-delays-station-resupply-flight-rescheduled-for-january/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-delays-station-resupply-flight-rescheduled-for-january/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently there was an issue during an engine test, and with the solar conditions plus the holidays they\u0027ve pushed back to 6 Jan. :-(\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
