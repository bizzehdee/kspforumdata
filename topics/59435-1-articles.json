All you showed in your video was the VAB and launchpad. Try pretending you were just landing on the Mun or something when you noticed this. Use HyperEdit to make things easier if you want.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOften times you leave the text visible for too long on the screen (you left \u0022BEST GLITCH EVER\u0022 on the screen for ~11 seconds). And just generally all the text in general could have progressed a bit faster. People read faster than you\u0027d think.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe part at the end where you say \u0022I should probably feel less proud than I do right now\u0022 probably wasn\u0027t necessary.
