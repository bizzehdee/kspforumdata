But I thought it would fit from messing with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know for certain if you can fit a twin boar engine into the largest cargo bays? I have a ship based on it and I was wondering if it can fit in and out. Specifically has anyone actually done it? The top fits fine by the looks of it. But the bottom where the engines are seems like it colides with the inside of the bay. I don\u0027t know if that matters though as it could not have a solid surface there. Does anyone know for certain if this is an issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll put up a pic later of the engine in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-11-07%2015-25-03_zpsusbiwrhi.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-11-07%2015-25-03_zpsusbiwrhi.png%7Eoriginal\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T20:26:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T20:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt needs to be rotated 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in a kinda counter-intuitive way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T20:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally added the pic to the first post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill that setup fit or will the overhang stop it?
