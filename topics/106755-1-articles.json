It consists of an Mk1 pod, a Service Bay (with Goo and Thermometer inside), and a Science Jr. ... the capsule had an Mk16 parachute on top, and one Mk2-R radial mount parachute on its back side (not seen in the picture). Total mass = 1.4 tons (not counting the fuel tank, engine, or pilot). The rate of descent is pretty slow, on the order of about 3m/s. I\u0027ve never had a building explode from landing on it.
