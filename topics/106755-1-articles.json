But after that, it seemed like the slightest touch from a spacecraft and the whole building would completely explode. What are the conditions required to land on it without the building doing a 9/11?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:04:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Almost entirely tangential to your post: I used to land on the VAB a lot before they made it destructable.

How heavy would you say the ships you tried to put up there are?"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:52:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Almost entirely tangential to your post: I used to land on the VAB a lot before they made it destructable.

It consists of an Mk1 pod, a Service Bay (with Goo and Thermometer inside), and a Science Jr. ... the capsule had an Mk16 parachute on top, and one Mk2-R radial mount parachute on its back side (not seen in the picture). Total mass = 1.4 tons (not counting the fuel tank, engine, or pilot). The rate of descent is pretty slow, on the order of about 3m/s. I\u0027ve never had a building explode from landing on it. This is also the first time I\u0027ve ever had a Kerbal get stuck on a building ladder as such."},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:47:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Almost entirely tangential to your post: I used to land on the VAB a lot before they made it destructable.
