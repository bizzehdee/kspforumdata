With the new building upgrade system and mods that offer alternative launch sites. Would it be possible to create a mod through which one can construct an orbital launch site after researching a specific tech? Or better having to perform a mission (like delivering a space station with certain parts to orbit) to be able to construct ships in orbit from there on (maybe also limiting the parts that can be constructed in orbit to skeleton parts which have to be completed by kerbals with the needed resources shiped up from Kerbin). Is something like that even possible within the games framework?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T10:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-0-25-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v4-4-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
