Being able to seeing your colonies growing and expanding. Of course this might take years or decades of in-game time (for Kerbals, not for the player :-D ).\n\nAn other addition I would like to have is some sort of automation. Being able to assign tasks to Kerbals that they can accomplish while you\u0027re away, or by Artificial Intelligence. Or being able to install a powerful AI on a rover and command it to go exploring the neighborhood.\n\nAlso, Kerbin is a bit desolate for being the base of an intelligent life form that reaches the frontier of Space Travels. And other planets are a bit dull and empty, beside the biomes. So it would be sweet to have some more geological variety. Something worthing spending hours (years of in-game play) on planets.\n\nDuna could even offer some biological samples, like primordial bacteriae.\n\nOf course there is also the multiplayer frontier, where players compete against each other for reaching goals.\n\nAnd you? Would would you like to see coming in a future KSP 2.0?\n\n*Edit: This post is not a critic at the actual state of the game. KSP is one of the most amazing games I\u0027ve ever played (and I\u0027ve played since the Commodore 64). It\u0027s simply a speculation of what could be possible in future for a video game about space science. Yes, KSP could be improved, and it will be with time.

Maybe some on-the-fly procedural generation code that increases the elaboration of a world\u0027s POIs the more time the player spends there... \n\n2) Tie into software like Astrosynthesis 3.0 to allow fast procedural space sector, star system and world generation (though beefed up with more realistic geological and atmospheric chemistry modeling) to come closer to a randomizable, replayable interstellar-level game...\n\n3) Leverage some features found in other sandbox games like Minecraft and Space Engineers, to give players the ability to tunnel into the various worlds and build even more elaborate above- and below-ground constructions...\n\n4) Bump up the astrophysics modeling to allow n-body physics and the ability to leave craters on celestial bodies when they get hit by asteroids, up to knocking their orbits out of whack / total conversion to asteroid debris (so that Space: 1999-style catastrophe scenarios could be possible)...\n\n5) System variables to track the total Kerbal population of Kerbin, and other habitable systems; variables to track the effective quality-of-life and technological standards of these settlements; and a game feature that determines the current level of relative success of your space program as a function of whether or not a greater number of Kerbals are living at higher standards of living compared to how well they were living at the start of the game. If my solar system has a late-stage population of only 1,000 Kerbals with all techs unlocked (because I spent my money on research missions instead of a couple of crucial asteroid-divert missions), that might not be as great of an outcome as having a billion Kerbals at late-stage, with only half the techs unlocked...\n\nProbably 2.0 will require everyone to have evolved toward 128-bit computers based on super-conducting processors manufactured at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points, meaning that 2.0 will risk becoming \u0027historical fantasy\u0027 as opposed to \u0027speculative aerospace simulation\u0027, but it\u0027s still fun to spitball away at this stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"flyboy67109","CreatedById":98767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:50:28Z","Content":"Life support"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:27:31Z","Content":"n-body simulation"}]}
