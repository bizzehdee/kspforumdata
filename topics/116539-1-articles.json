XD I guess I thought of it as this little thing violently reacting and fusing, but it turns out to be more of a calm sphere. It is also a no-go zone, at 150g/cm3 in the core (162.2 at its peak) and accounts for 50% of the stars mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will now make an assumption here, and assume that all cores are 50% of the star\u0027s mass, for extrapolation to other stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, thats at 25-30% of the solar radius. The next 40-45% is the radiative zone, with a density gradient of 20 to 0.2. Could someone help me with density gradiants at 5% intervals? I have a lot of other research and writing to do, (and you would get lots of brownie points). I assume it is logarithmic, and the density dissipates rapidly, but I have been wrong before (like how I didn\u0027t realize that the sun is more like a compost heap rather than a fusion bomb).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the densities that I am looking for are in this area. It is somewhere between 30% and 70% of the solar radii that you can find the density of plasma comparable to density of things on earth, like our atmosphere, then our water, and then our rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will make another assumption and assume that the solar radius of the convection zone is not consistent among other star types. Unless it is logrithmic... Like, Giants and Supergiants probably don\u0027t have massive radiative zones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe convection zone, where crazy scary stuff happens, reaches to the \u0022surface\u0022 and has 2% of the mass in 66% of the total volume. I believe the density is like 1/6000 that of earth\u0027s atmosphere at sea level. Probably not good for a \u0022solar sailer\u0022 that has stubby wings and relies on \u0022atmosphere\u0022 for lift. Unless their are really strong updrafts in this \u0022atmosphere\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if a hardened probe could use this zone as an atmospheric breaking maneuver if it was shot from our solar system to another with no other way to slow down. Or would it need to briefly dip into the radiative zone to get any meaningful \u0022air\u0022 resistance. Would it be called \u0022Heliobreaking\u0022, like how you call impacts lithobreaking when you accidentally hit the ground at orbital transfer speeds?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will make another assumption and assume that this zone increases on the age of the star. Like how a red giant would have a huge upper zone that is mostly puffy. If our sun expanded to envelop earth, would the earth still remain when the sun collapses because the density and drag would not overpower the solar wind and pressure coming from the core? Of course, the earth that would remain would be barren and scorched, but would it still be orbiting? (like, not spiraled into the center. It may have migrated inwards, but i dont think it would be destroyed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow are my assumptions?
