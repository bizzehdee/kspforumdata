I find it hard to believe that we cant estimate the density zones of our own star then apply that to different types of stars as a theoretical model, or very rough estimates.\n\nIf, say, 50% of the star\u0027s mass was located around the core, then the remaining 50% would be in the rest of the 98% of the volume of the star, and would diminish as it went outwards.\n\nThen I could make some rough estimates.\n\nBut say you have a ship from science fiction that has thermal shielding and radiation shielding, or is a drone, would it be able to explore the \u0022atmosphere\u0022 of the sun, and how far down could it \u0022dive\u0022 before it hit any meaningful densities that would impair movement?"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T18:16:12Z","Content":"If you plugged polytropic relation into the hydrostatic equilibrium, replacing dP/dr with something that contains \u00C3\u00C2, it\u0027s doable I guess.

XD I guess I thought of it as this little thing violently reacting and fusing, but it turns out to be more of a calm sphere. It is also a no-go zone, at 150g/cm3 in the core (162.2 at its peak) and accounts for 50% of the stars mass.\n\nI will now make an assumption here, and assume that all cores are 50% of the star\u0027s mass, for extrapolation to other stars.\n\nSo, thats at 25-30% of the solar radius. The next 40-45% is the radiative zone, with a density gradient of 20 to 0.2. Could someone help me with density gradiants at 5% intervals? I have a lot of other research and writing to do, (and you would get lots of brownie points). I assume it is logarithmic, and the density dissipates rapidly, but I have been wrong before (like how I didn\u0027t realize that the sun is more like a compost heap rather than a fusion bomb).\n\nAnyways, the densities that I am looking for are in this area. It is somewhere between 30% and 70% of the solar radii that you can find the density of plasma comparable to density of things on earth, like our atmosphere, then our water, and then our rocks.\n\nI will make another assumption and assume that the solar radius of the convection zone is not consistent among other star types. Unless it is logrithmic... Like, Giants and Supergiants probably don\u0027t have massive radiative zones.\n\nThe convection zone, where crazy scary stuff happens, reaches to the \u0022surface\u0022 and has 2% of the mass in 66% of the total volume. I believe the density is like 1/6000 that of earth\u0027s atmosphere at sea level. Probably not good for a \u0022solar sailer\u0022 that has stubby wings and relies on \u0022atmosphere\u0022 for lift. Unless their are really strong updrafts in this \u0022atmosphere\u0022.\n\nI wonder if a hardened probe could use this zone as an atmospheric breaking maneuver if it was shot from our solar system to another with no other way to slow down. Or would it need to briefly dip into the radiative zone to get any meaningful \u0022air\u0022 resistance. Would it be called \u0022Heliobreaking\u0022, like how you call impacts lithobreaking when you accidentally hit the ground at orbital transfer speeds?\n\nI will make another assumption and assume that this zone increases on the age of the star. Like how a red giant would have a huge upper zone that is mostly puffy. If our sun expanded to envelop earth, would the earth still remain when the sun collapses because the density and drag would not overpower the solar wind and pressure coming from the core? Of course, the earth that would remain would be barren and scorched, but would it still be orbiting? (like, not spiraled into the center. It may have migrated inwards, but i dont think it would be destroyed)\n\nHow are my assumptions? What have I gotten wrong?\n\n\u0022The [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core) of the Sun extends from the center to about 20\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015325% of the solar radius.[^\\[61\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#cite_note-Garcia2007-65) It has a density of up to 150 g/cm^3^[^\\[62\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#cite_note-Basu-66)[^\\[63\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#cite_note-NASA1-67)(about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) (K).\u0022\n\n\u0022The core is the only region in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun\u0027s radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely.\u0022\n\n\u0022Theoretical models of the Sun\u0027s interior indicate a power density of approximately 276.5 W/m^3^,[^\\[68\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#cite_note-72) a value that more nearly approximates reptile metabolism than a thermonuclear bomb.[^\\[e\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#cite_note-power_production_density-73) Peak power production in the Sun has been compared to the volumetric heat generated in an active [compost heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composting).^[^[*^citation needed^*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)^]^ The tremendous power output of the Sun is not due to its high power per volume, but instead due to its large size.\u0022\n\n\u0022The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm^3^ to only 0.2 g/cm^3^) from 0.25 solar radii to the top of the radiative zone.\u0022\n\n\u0022At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m^3^ (about 1/6,000th the density of air at sea level)\u0022\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nhuh, link me the full equation and I will try it.\n\nThanks for the read on the XKCD article, it reminded me of a few things that I forgot.

I probably had to learn it in class, but I don\u0027t remember what equation peoples names link to.\n\nWell, I am off to find out the structure of red and brown dwarfs and see how radically different their density and composition is compared to our sun.
