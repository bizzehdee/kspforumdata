Sounds like the plan is to launch a channel with an official KSP program, and a set schedule of community streamers doing their own shows. Really, it sounds like an awesome idea. I think maybe Skunky focused a little bit too much on the minutia of application process and the details of programming instead of just doing a promo for it, but that was probably what he\u0027s been knee deep in for the past couple weeks. Makes sense he\u0027d talk about those aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artao","CreatedById":65003,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T21:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStream?
