Give all crew-carrying parts a marker that says that they must let Kerbals EVA with a different flag than the vessel flag. Clicking on the Flag button in the VAB/SPH would let you pick both plantable flags and rocket flags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd its not just logos, its spaceships and spaceplanes that you want to give names and still have Kerbals plant your space program\u0027s flag. You can make a flag with the ship\u0027s name on it and use that as the vessel flag, and then you can use your space program or nation\u0027s flag on the Mun or Tylo or Eve or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T20:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea.
