When you fire out towards the launchpad the balls all curve consistently to the right, why is that? My main thought is its because KSC is actually sideways, the effect is actually unity applying gravity to the balls. Just an Idea though, I would love to hear what you guys think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/04ijzqJ.png\u0022 alt=\u002204ijzqJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T02:41:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey do that because you aren\u0027t supposed to fire it inside the VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut seriously, I have never tried it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just found it strange because you expect there to be no physics at all in the VAB, and the balls to continue on in a straight line forever, but they don\u0027t and for whatever reason that really intrigues me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB \u0026amp; SPH you can see a tweaked version of Kerbin.
