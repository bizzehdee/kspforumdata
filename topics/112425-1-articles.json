When you fire out towards the launchpad the balls all curve consistently to the right, why is that? My main thought is its because KSC is actually sideways, the effect is actually unity applying gravity to the balls. Just an Idea though, I would love to hear what you guys think.\n\n![04ijzqJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/04ijzqJ.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T02:41:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree**"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:43:04Z","Content":"They do that because you aren\u0027t supposed to fire it inside the VAB. \n\nBut seriously, I have never tried it. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:46:01Z","Content":"I just found it strange because you expect there to be no physics at all in the VAB, and the balls to continue on in a straight line forever, but they don\u0027t and for whatever reason that really intrigues me."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:38:33Z","Content":"In the VAB \u0026 SPH you can see a tweaked version of Kerbin.
