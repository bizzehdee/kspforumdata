If I could TL;DR it for you all and do it justice, I would. Read that page and then look about the site - it\\\u0027s all extremely well thought-out, as it should be. The man\\\u0027s been an engineer for 30 years."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T09:03:39Z","Content":"I would like to point out that building the USS Enterprise is a bad idea. Worse than helicopter without any blades. The USS enterprise was built to look good, not to be efficiant in space. A better idea is to have some sort of craft closer to the shape of the interplanetary craft out of avatar at the start of the film. And second of all, what purpose would it have. Why spend the money on a giant spacecraft when you don\\\u0027t have a purpose for it. Those are the two main problems with it. There are alot of other problems though."},{"CreatedByName":"Warshawski","CreatedById":9171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T09:27:02Z","Content":"And you clearly didn\\\u0027t even look at the rest of the website. A pity. Did you read all the design specs? The reasoning behind choosing THAT shape? (Hint: It makes sense from the standpoint of an actual engineer.) It is nuclear powered, with ion engines. It is not extra-solar. It is interplanetary, with an absolutely enormous main cargo volume. It houses multiple landing craft which can carry large payloads. It is capable of dropping manned and robotic mining outposts anywhere in the system, and then going out and getting the output to bring back to Earth orbit as well.\n\nIf you\\\u0027d read, you\\\u0027d see that a lot of the Enterprise project is based around giving us a permanent space capability.\n\nMy advice? Read through the entire website first, before passing judgement."},{"CreatedByName":"Johno","CreatedById":1491,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T11:38:30Z","Content":"I just did.\n\nThey guy is nuts. . . but just MAYBE in a good way.\n\nI guess the configuration is no WORSE than any other configuration (aside from a lot of useless cosmetic features, but that\\\u0027s not really a problem if it gets people interested in getting it happening). \n\nThe money is a problem. It relies on the government of the USA putting a ridiculous portion of their GDP (0.27% doesn\\\u0027t sound like much, but it\\\u0027s an enormous amount of money) into a vanity project (which may have applications, but ultimately it exists because it\\\u0027s cool, not because it\\\u0027s actually practical)."},{"CreatedByName":"Warshawski","CreatedById":9171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T17:05:21Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s my take that it\\\u0027s mainly the guy\\\u0027s attempt to get people interested in space."},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T20:00:12Z","Content":"The website will not load for me.

I want to have a large scale space project in my lifetime that will actually make something useful.\n\nI have never watched the TV show Star Trek, so I don\\\u0027t see why it must look like the Enterprise other than as a cool cultural icon. I think if a more efficient design could be made with the same functionality, they should go for that.\n\nPersonally, I would not be bothered if all the money for this project came from social security, medicare, and medicaid because I am too young to ever receive the benefits of those programs (they will be bankrupt before I can use them).\n\nThere are some serious design flaws pointed out in the forums, but I believe that with a redesign, and the 9 planed years of highly funded and focused research that a space ship/port/station such as this would be possible, and I would love to see it happen."}]}
