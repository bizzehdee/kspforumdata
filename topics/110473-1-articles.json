Technology has surpassed biological anatomy and physical capability in almost every way, from physical strength to reasonable intellect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EName anything, and a piece of technology has probably already been created to fit your description. Learning, smart responses, individual thinking, philosophy, even creativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComposers, free thinkers, ideologists, artists, you name it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough technology has evolved with a greater mind indeed, it is true that the human mind is revered as the most complex technology. All of the categories listed above wrapped into one package, along with a few other attributes that machines haven\u0027t been built for yet. It is not built for processing power, but energy efficiency. Our memories may fragment, but that is perhaps because of the sheer magnitude of data out brains try to store at once. A camera, for instance, does not capture a full shutter, but rather a rolling shutter; scanning strips of data one by one for every pixel. Our minds use a frame rate too difficult to put into words, and there is no certainty to whether there is a limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can solve riddles, as an added bonus. Seeking out puzzles to solve is one of the wonders of our mind. Looking at different angles, trying new definitions, looking for metaphors, and getting the pool of satisfaction afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, our overall biological position on the board is okay, but trumped by technology by a marginal amount... but, to what avail? I mean, what is the apex of technological evolution? Speculate all you want about that, but what about biology? Imagine this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnology becomes dominant throughout the Terran system. Not a day goes by without it, and it can only continue to expand. A breakthrough in propulsion research has let us travel the galaxy. We go forth and explore, but run into someone unexpected...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA species that has chosen the route of biological evolution rather than technological. Vessels with regenerative properties, neural binary processing, brains as a memory core, neural interfaces to call out commands, biological weaponry, highly advanced immune responses, and even defenses evolved into them as well, such as built-in weapons or multi-cellular adaptability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis species finds us as a threat, and attacks us. What can we do? Fire weapons, alright. Makes a dent, which heals right back. Our limited technology, and just technology in general will most likely never reach the level of efficiency that biology can possibly reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough that sounds like a baseless and very bold claim... well, actually it is. I have no idea what the limit of technological evolution is, but I honestly suspect that the potential of biological evolution is far greater than the capable reaches of technology. Some may disagree, and that\u0027s fine. I mean, look at it now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut try to look past our own species, as difficult as that may be.

Biology is still a way to turn energy into useful work, just as technology. It just turned out that nature had some organic material laying around and \u0022made\u0022 life out of it.

Just think of how complex an organ the eye is and what it is capable of doing. We can\u0027t reproduce its sensitivity or complexity using current technology. We can make instruments that can be more well-suited for a particular situation, but we cannot make something that does everything the eye is capable of in a better way.

There are visions around of a utopia where humans are all gone and replaced by machines. There are people who wish (really, wish) humans were machines in the most technological, physical sense. I see no gain for us in those scenarios and I would certainly not call it utopia, more a nightmare, as going extinct is not what one would call a victory.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
