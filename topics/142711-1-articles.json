I am building a high altitude plane for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis plane takes of magnificently, the problem is that the second I touch the pitch the plane will flip and go into a full stall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToggling caps lock for more precision doesn\u0027t help a bit. Neither does more reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anybody have any ideas what could be wrong here?

I would also strongly suggest using the MK1 liquid fuel tank instead of a\u00A0rocket fuel tank. I would also suggest a small pair of canard wings at the front end.
