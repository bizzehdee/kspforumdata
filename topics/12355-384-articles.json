Used it back in. 24 and again now that I\u0027m back into KSP after the 1.0 release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway I don\u0027t know if the issue I\u0027m having is a bug with the mod or just the new game version etc but basically I have a rocket that works and is stable when I fly it myself, however when using mechjeb accent pilot, well for some reason it does a flip (a complete flip) when it starts the turn (gravity turn? The first turn right after just accelerating upwards). What is more odd though is that more often than not after its random complete flip it settles back on course and continues on as if nothing has happened. Sometimes it will do two flips then go back on course, and very rarely it will just flip uncontrollably until I revert back to launch pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an epic waste of fuel these flips, and often messes up the circle burn as well because of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo any ideas on what\u0027s going on? I find it very odd that this happens randomly even when I\u0027m using the same rocket each time (in this case my standard mun lander rocket). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the inclination thing seems very odd, I took some \u0022put satellite on this orbit\u0022 missions, set the correct inclination in mechjeb, but the resultant orbit is wildly different to the goals orbit, often times the opposite. I had tried doing a bunch of maths to figure it out but no luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway cheers for any help with this, can provide rocket to test etc if required but I might just be doing something wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just read that others are having issues also, although they mention losing control, my issue is hardly losing control the flips look perfect as in that they are done on purpose and the fact that it seems to easily put the rocket right again 9 out of 10 times seems odd to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou usually have to tweak the ascent curve to fit your rocket.
