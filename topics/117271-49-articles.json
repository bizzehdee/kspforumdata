I find that reduces the chances of the plane snapping round when pitching allowing you to keep your speed. Also, more wing at the back of the plane can stop the plane snapping as extra air hits the rear of the plane if it turns too much and corrects this.\n\nI guess your plane shows that what is good for a missile plane is not necessarily good for a gunship. If you can get you plane to avoid missiles then it would be deadly. I have noticed the AIM 120\u0027s take a few seconds to get up to speed and if you can make a plane that can close the distance to its target the AIM 120\u0027s are easier to dodge.

That was one of the main design considerations. It\u0027s also 6 tonnes lighter than the Anduril, but has a lower TWR as it has half the engine - although the climb to altitude times seem quite similar. \n\nIt\u0027s incredibly responsive in turns, although the control surface area is so large that it can get twitchy under SAS at high speeds, although the autopilot doesn\u0027t appear to have this problem so much. I think the issue is that it is so responsive in turns that when the autopilot breaks as hard as it can to avoid missiles, a lot of energy is lost, simply because it\u0027s pulling Gs way off the navball G meter\u0027s scale for extended periods of time, allowing it to avoid the first missile with ease but leaving it without the energy to get away from the second. This could be avoided by reducing the pitch authority or moving the CoM further forward to reduce maneuverability, but the problem is that this would ruin the extreme ability to make high G turns at all speeds that makes it so good in a gunfight.\n\nWhat I don\u0027t understand is why the Anduril does not have this problem - it seems to have very similar all-speed maneuverability, but without losing the ability to dodge missiles. \n\nCraft file for the El Quicko is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zjdavz6po147sf7/El%20Quicko%20%28Tournament%29.craft?dl=0), if you want to try it. If you do I recommend you try it at least once in an all-guns fight, as it allows you to get a much better sense of it\u0027s capabilities than in a missile fight, where it turns into a useless pile of space-grade poop. I also recommend you reduce the fuel load to ~40%, as that seems to be just enough to give it the edge against the Anduril in a gun battle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-01T19:15:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2016 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary**"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T19:09:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, GDJ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Interesting.

Also, its climb rate is nowhere near the Anduril\u0027s (My Taurus, which I used to test your El Quicko, has a slightly slower climb rate than the Anduril, so I used that as a reference for climb rate). So plain and simply, add more engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T19:37:54Z","Content":"@Blue Canary: I found a similar thing happening to my earlier designs. If the plane snaps 90 degrees to the airflow then it is like hitting a wall. You can use less wing but then the plane will be pointing backwards. I usually move some of my wing backwards to the rear of the plane to stop the plane snapping a full 90 degrees and then the plane and engines have time to catch up with the turn if you know what I mean. True, that affects the turn rate a bit but you can find a sweet spot and then add more control surfaces afterwards to improve it, and then more wing to manage it."},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T20:30:47Z","Content":"[@Triop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145841-triop/)\n\nI\u0027m trying the Kritter\u002B against the El Quicko, so far things look to be leaning towards my fighter.\n\nI was reusing the El Quicko as set up for previous tests, so it had no missiles equipped, but the Kritter kept it\u0027s AIM-120s. \n\nThe El Quicko, with a slightly better TWR, was able to get in the air quite a bit faster, and was able to dodge both AIM-120s quite easily (it can dodge the first shots well, it\u0027s just that it loses the energy it needs to deal with follow up shots, which the Kritter can\u0027t deliver), quickly making it an all guns battle.\n\nThe first fight ended with a mid-air collision resulting in the total destruction of both aircraft, but in the second the more maneuverable El Quicko was able to quickly get on the Kritter\u0027s tail and take out it\u0027s wings with 30mm cannon fire.\n\nIt\u0027s worth noting, however, that had the Kritter had a couple more missiles it wouls have won the fight within the first 15 seconds. Also, the impressive volume of fire it\u0027s 4 cannons put in the air completely outgunned my fighters single M230.
