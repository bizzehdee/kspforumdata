The cheaper way is to mine the\u00A0items yourself and get your engineers to make it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result of implementing my idea into the game would mean: Other planets have more of a purpose then before due to what you mine from them being more useful and versatile but also because you can build bases on them. Adds more depth and more room for being creative. Adds more options for your space program to branch out because space stations will have a purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you guys have any other ideas for space stations ect..\u00A0feel free to add them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-25T12:20:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2016 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ketaz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
