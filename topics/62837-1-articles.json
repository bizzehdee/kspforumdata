I\u0027ve tested this with Infernal and B9 with no problems, so its really only the stock parts that are problematic atm, but those will soon be fixed so this becomes universal. The plan is for the Texture Editor in game to have layering and blending similar to most image editing suites, hence the rather large amount of blend modes that seem superfluous with only solid colors atm, but in addition I\u0027m looking to have importable textures, because having hot rod flames, go faster stripes, or the British Airways Tail Fin sounds like a giggle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbPaint was an inspiration for this, and in many ways at the time of writing is likely to be a preferred choice for most, but the aim is for KSPaint to become more powerful and universal.

True, stock-ksp does load all its MBM files as unreadable, but normal maps will become unreadable as well and some texture related mods do this as well. It kind of makes sense, since this means Unity/DirectX can transfer the texture to GPU memory without keeping another copy in system RAM (=\u0026gt; kinda less memory usage). As for \u0022how to fix t hat\u0022... well, you can\u0027t, afaik. You can either go native and use e.g. DirectX directly to read the texture (you should try to avoid that for a number of reasons) or manually load the texture from disk...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t yet tried it, but from looking over the code:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- where do you prevent the game from copying the texture when the player has not selected a custom color? You know, since this should be the default for most cases \u0026amp; memory isn\u0027t free. Sure you have alpha == 0, but the default value for every part seems to be 3/4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- where do you re-use textures painted in a specific color?

That should be done by Unity / DirectX for you. Thats actually the reason you pass \u0022true\u0022 to Apply\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m pretty sure GetPixels32 does returns a new array and copies the textures data into it. In that case you might not have to create another one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What about other texture formats? That currently annoys me in an own project.

I\u0027m aware that its not just stock parts that are unreadable. I have some rough leads on possible solutions but I imagine this will likely be the hardest part of the mod, so the fact that I have something working around that at the moment I\u0027m counting as a victory, though we\u0027re hardly off the starting block with this yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve set the default to be colored so that you can see the mod working when loaded(This won\u0027t be so in the release, but I figure if people are trying this out it would be good for them to see it working). I\u0027d need to do a check the target color array to make sure it matches the source exactly before defaulting to no Overriden Texture, but with alpha == 0 that\u0027s a guarantee, so quicker to do it that way for now and add the comparison in later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve thought about a single pool of textures from which to draw from and will likely implement this for efficiency at a later point. We\u0027re still in the proof of concept phase so little things like that have fallen by the way side, but are on the drawing table. I\u0027ve currently got the popups using the same popup by reference so I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be a stretch to apply this to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mipmap stuff is very useful to know.
