Posting this on both b9 partswitch and IFS threads (and prolly the reddit as well), not trying to stir the excrementspot, just trying to duct tape this save together so I can finally start playing it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20\n\u003E \n\nIFS tries to play nice and only install it switchers on non IFS tank when no known switcher module is present.  But because IFS come relatively late in the alphabet, other switcher mods install their partmodule before IFS has a change. To override \u003Cabbr\u003Ethis \u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E behaviour, you have to do so  something like\n\n    :BEFORE[B9]\n\nat the back, or in between\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@RESOURCE[LiquidFuel],@RESOURCE[Oxidizer],!RESOURCE[MonoPropellant],!MODULE[ModuleTankManager],!MODULE[InterstellarFuelSwitch],!MODULE[FSfuelSwitch],!MODULE[ModuleB9PartSwitch],!MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX],!MODULE[ModuleEngines]]:NEEDS[InterstellarFuelSwitch\u0026!CryoTanks\u0026!ModularFuelTanks\u0026!RealFuels]:FOR[InterstellarFuelSwitch]\n\nwhich should allow IFS to put its tanks before B9 has a change. I hope this helps, if not ask advice in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E discussion thread\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-17T14:51:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2018 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"LeLeon","CreatedById":118287,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-17T14:13:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 56 minutes ago, FreeThinker said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ## \n\u003E Version 2.13.3 \u003Csmall\u003Efor Kerbal Space Program 1.4.2 can be downloaded from \u003C/small\u003E[here](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/interstellar-fuel-switch/files/2552035/download)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It should be fixed in the latest version\n\u003E \n\n1. Yes, now i have more options. But why do these options include ressources i\u0027ve never seen in one of my mods. Where do he takes these  ressources from?\n\n2. What do i have to change to just see normal fuels like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003Elfo\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E, xenon, mono. Or argon for my NF-engines. Do you have somewhere LiterVolume presets, that can be easily interchanged for wrapper tanks? I only want to use these fine parts.\n\n3. In this picture the part description give me mono/ xenon option, but none of the tanks with this option can be switched to mono, xenon. B9 part switch conflict? And can these volume numbers set in global relation like VolumeLiter to be useful for Xenon, what is much more compressed?\n\n![y4mzt_oT8QObrPymSh5rm-4JQa8U3tGE_ly-D346](https://q90mma.db.files.1drv.com/y4mzt_oT8QObrPymSh5rm-4JQa8U3tGE_ly-D346jF1h7WKtEv22txCY4D9oCS0FWFWf-DfSmIljQ9NPRarbcwtkHV8nKmgBLndHJI5sWrNfWkZojL5Q5S7thoAlE9zJSfOgLfhmeqpSYQgcpWVPicGJfw5blqWCw5V4zCOS14OPHzqF_ioRNW6ZJT-b5hNEDOAivuQ9djHDC4gzq6aeGx1-w?width=714\u0026height=513\u0026cropmode=none)\n\nNormally i try to do small .cfg-changes myself, but IFS is out of my range.
