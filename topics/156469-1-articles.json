This had worked for me for more then a year since I started using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I use my spaceplane as the main means of getting things into and out of kerbin orbit, as long as it can fit in the hold. Now, upon getting into orbit, the plane disintegrates into many pieces when burning in a vacuum. Ill try and get a video of this happening, plays.tv has been acting up for me recently\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also getting an error in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E which I think I should try and fix first. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/gozz7sd045f516n/ckan%20error.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is a screen shot of the error.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rb6n2keu8u6163l/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDxdiag\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
