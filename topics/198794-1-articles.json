I downloaded the Upgrade patches\u00A0and the Installer, but when I open the game it doesn\u0027t show that it is updated. My file with all my KSP\u00A0stuff says that it was last updated today, meaning that I did download it. What am I doing wrong here? Oh and um I\u0027m not using steam, I\u0027m using the developers website.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I did run the patch\u00A0file, and I can\u0027t run the installer. For the patch file, I chose to install the update on the file where my KSP originally is located.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-18T02:15:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2020 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by User_1234\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T01:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand you to mean \u0027KSPInstallerx64-1.11.0.exe\u0027 (or some similar name)\u00A0when you say \u0027the installer\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to run (execute) that file in order to unpack all the files for KSP.\u00A0 \u00A0That installer program will then let you choose the directory where you want the new KSP to be installed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany of us here choose a new directory when a new version is available.\u00A0 Then we copy the old settings.cfg and copy our saved games into the new directory.\u00A0 Sometimes the rules change or bugs appear, and we want to be able to go back to the old version of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upgrade patches are a different way to get the new version.\u00A0 You do not need to use the upgrade patch if you downloaded the Installer.\u00A0 (Those of us on slow internet connections can save time by downloading relatively small patch, and then letting it change what it needs in the KSP installation we already have.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User_1234","CreatedById":206579,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T02:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much!
