However, I think I\u0027ve found a bug, If you\u0027re inclined, I\u0027d like to run it past you. My problem is with the node_collider meshes. If I create a cube in blender, 2m x 2m x 2m, then Texture \u0026amp; UV it and export it alone, KSP will load and render it (even without the node_collider). However, when I then wrap this cube in another, 3m x 3m x 3m, Texture and UV appropriately and name \u0022node_collider\u0022 and export, KSP will render the larger, outer cube. I also cannot \u0022pickup\u0022 the cube in KSP, it\u0027s like KSP isn\u0027t recognising the node_collider...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on blender 2.73 and your latest commit from github and KSP 0.90 on WinDowZ.

The cube, when put on the runway, \u0022falls-through\u0022 the landing pad. Further reinforcing my suspicions. Is it something I\u0027l configuring / rendering wrong? I\u0027ve tried both exporting into \u0022.mu\u0022 and a plain \u0022.dae\u0022 collada export. Both seem to fail-cleanly as it were, nothing in the debug logs...
