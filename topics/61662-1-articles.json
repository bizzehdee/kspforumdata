So if you want to move to a ship that is ahead and to the left, first thrust a little to the left and coast until you are lined up, then thrust a little to the right to come to a stop.

The thing about Minmus, however, is that you don\u0027t need very much up-thrust at all. In fact, it\u0027s quite easy to achieve escape velocity with a few too many taps on the EVA controls, so don\u0027t do EVA there until you\u0027ve got a handle on it. Still, it\u0027s safer to practice on Minmus than it is in space, and it\u0027s still a very good approximation of space conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kBob","CreatedById":102132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T21:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen my \u0027a\u0027 key started sticking I remapped all my movement keys to the arrow keys (full size keyboard with separate arrow keys) the side benefit was I stopped the occasional misspress when my hand would shift on the wasd keys.
