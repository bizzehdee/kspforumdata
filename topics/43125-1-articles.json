It took me a while because I\u0027m using the mission controller mod. I also made a soyuz replica to bring the crew up(Bill Kerman) which costs around 330,000 K. It is made out of mostly stock parts except it has TAC Life support, mechjeb, deadly reentry heat shield, and Procedural Fairings. I didn\u0027t take any pics of the launch vehicle because it was my first time using it and it worked really good. Now here is a pic of the station with the ship on the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/96fLfBA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002296fLfBA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
