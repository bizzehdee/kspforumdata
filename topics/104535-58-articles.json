In 1.2. autostruts become available on all parts and you have option to turn it on/off as needed, but you need to enable advanced tweakables in settings to be able to do that.\n\nSo, yes, if you have some wheels close to IR parts it can cause issues sometimes.

Haven\u0027t use those for a while, it is a bit obsolete, I was using free moving rotatrons from beta repack in latest few releases.\n\nFree moving rotatrons are similar thing as docking washer, although smaller sized part. Having a good usage in assembling variable geometry craft, for example. Only imagination is limit how those free moving parts can be used. Mostly, free moving parts (pivot joints are another set of free moving parts) are best used in combination with other somehow powered parts (can be powered IR part or engines like in your example).\n\nCan\u0027t tell for sure what is going on with those legacy IR parts, it may be bug somewhere or you may do something unpredicted, hard to tell. I can only suggest that you try with new IR part pack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-15T15:38:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2016 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kcs123**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T13:30:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Supergamervictor said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have a suggestion: uncontrolled extendatrons and rails.
