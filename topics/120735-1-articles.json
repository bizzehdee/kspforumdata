Just to clear things out, I\u0027m playing with stock aerodynamics, heatshields, thermals, and 100% thermal heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate my issue, I have two examples (no screenshots, but I\u0027ll do my best to describe what\u0027s happening):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStraight Moon return, ballistic reentry: From an apoapsis at the Moon\u0027s height, I lowered my periapsis to ~40km to aerocapture on the first pass. The craft went down fine, entering atmosphere at 11km/s and slowing down consuming its ablator as expected. At splashdown, I have 0.5 units of ablator left out of 250 initially and max-G force was at 6.5g.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u0022Skip\u0022 reentry: From an apoapsis at the Moon\u0027s height (again), I lowered my periapsis to ~52km to try and make a softer reentry; I also wanted to try a controlled reentry, with a controlled angle of attack to lower G-forces on the craft. The craft entered atmosphere at about 11km/s, went down to about 48km and then up again, until it exited atmosphere. During the reentry, I kept SAS on to maintain a certain angle of attack. The problem is, when I exited atmosphere, the capsule still had an orbital velocity of 7.8km/s, but consumed almost all of its ablator: \u0026lt;1 unit left out of 300 initially. And I still had to make a LEO reentry to get down to Earth. I didn\u0027t make it...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bothers me greatly, because for me, ablator consumption is proportional to heat endured by the craft. The heat itself comes from the transformation of kinetic energy (orbital speed) to mechanical (energy) shockwave when entering atmosphere) to thermal energy (heating while reentring). Let\u0027s forget about mechanical energy and focus on kinetic and thermal: kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed, so the more speed you lose, the more more energy you have to dissipate through heating: KE = 1/2 * m * v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I will ignore gravitational potential energy because both crafts have the same initally, but it does make the issue bigger (PE is higher if you\u0027re higher, so at 130km, it is higher than at 0km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssume m = 3000kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my first example, I had an initial speed of 11km/s, and went down to 0: KE = 180 GJ. All kinetic energy was dissipated, so dissipated energy is 180 GJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my second example, same initial speed: KE = 180 GJ. But I had still 7.8km/s orbital velocity when I exited atmosphere: so dissipated energy is actually 90 GJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I should account for the phase where mechanical friction slows down the craft and produces less heat, but it happens at lower speeds and altitude, so it is not really going to change the result here. Even if it is significant, it is far from half of total energy dissipated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, these results are OK: I didn\u0027t go as deep in the atmosphere for the second reentry and didn\u0027t capture, so it is normal that energy dissipated is lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then, why did I consume more ablator on the second reentry (~300 units) than I did on the first one (~250 units) ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that in the second example, I still had to do a LEO reentry to be able to land on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I see three possible solutions to this problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI s*ck at thermal physics and aerodynamics and I missed something huge when making my approximated calculations, which makes my conclusion completely wrong.

That would explain why, during my second example, in which the craft stays longer at hypersonic speeds (going and up again, without slowing down enough to change heat \u0022regime\u0022), more ablator is consumed while total energy dissipated is twice smaller.

Effectively, the shedding of ablator has a cooling effect on the ablator\u0027s skin. Once up to temperature, the rate of shedding is constant, but the rate of heating is proportional to velocity and air density. As long as the sum of accumulated skin heat is lower than the destruction threshold, and as long as the descent takes less time than the time taken to shed all the ablator, you\u0027re fine. However, your skip re-entry is keeping the ablator up to temperature for too long, partly because it isn\u0027t benefiting from the cooling effect of the lower atmo on the way back up (which the direct re-entry does on the way down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor interest\u0027s sake, from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry#Ablative\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWikipedia\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe ablative heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield\u0027s outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer). The boundary layer comes from blowing of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield\u0027s outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called blockage. Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux. Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated.[17] Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque. Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster) and for re-entry vehicle nose tips.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T17:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vim Razz","CreatedById":43764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T22:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I think that it\u0027s counter-intuitive that the same amount of ablator is consumed regardless of temperature.
