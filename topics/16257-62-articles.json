What you can do is *NOT* put your craft on SAS manually. Instead, enable Auto SAS in MechJeb. That might not be in the official release though.

The most use I\u0027ve had out of the Flight Computer is when setting up my relay network. I haven\u0027t needed it much otherwise. And my sats are using ion drive. All of them. So I start my delay early. This holds try for any low powered thruster.

I already premade a MJ window that shows me my SMA and my target\u0027s SMA so I get that open and target the sat in front of me. Depending on if their SMA is less or greater than mine I do small prograde or retrograde burn. Once I match to their SMA then I switch to the sat behind the one I\u0027m controlling and repeat with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSUALLY works well but a few days ago I noticed one of my sats has been drifting so obviously it wasn\u0027t QUITE matched up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I still have to get it fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T22:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if the damn periapsis and apoapsis did not flutter back and forth to opposite sides of the orbit, attaining a perfect geosynchronous orbit by strictly manual control would be a bit of a pain.

The key to a Geosync orbit is that the Orbital Period is exactly the same as the rotational period of the planet. For Kerbin that is 6 hours exactly. The orbit doesn\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to be perfectly circular for the satellite to remain on station, though if it isn\u0027t then it will appear to drift very slightly back and forth with regards to the ground. So to manually get a satellite in a Geosync orbit simply adjust the orbit until the period is exactly 6 hours.
