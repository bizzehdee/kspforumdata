Steam claims that I love KSP for 622 hours, but I\u0027m sure some of that is AFK time. I was introduced to the game by a friend, but I have to admit, however, that I would never have been able to get past the learning curve without Scott Manley. I\u0027ve always being interested in sciencey things (and also inventing words), and I\u0027ve really enjoyed learning about things like orbital mechanics. At this point, I haven\u0027t gotten bored with all stock parts, but I do roll with engineer. I initially got it to track D/V while building a ship to return from Eve. Unfortunately, it was not able to compensate for my lack of smartness as you will see below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccomplishments: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been to Mun, Minmus, Duna, Gilly, and Laythe. I\u0027ve also landed on Eve and wasted many hours trying to build a return vessel that utilizes jet engines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E because I am awesome. I\u0027ve put off going back to Eve to conquer it because of the shame that shade of purple now induces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can make an SSTO space plane, but not one good enough to take anything up with it. I made a space plane that once I brought to Laythe, flew down to the surface, landed near and picked up Bob (whom I had previously, intentionally stranded), and flew back to orbit to dock with a return ship. I\u0027ve also managed to bring a plane in from orbit and land on the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, those things do not account for all of my time played. I waste a lot of time in sandbox building themed ships from various sci-fi universes that can be brought to orbit and actually function. I\u0027ve also spent time building military style ships and testing them on my star destroyer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESins:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have put off going to most other planets and moons because phase angles are so annoying to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never killed a kerbal because I abuse the quickload and whatnot. Once, I actually went in to the game files to \u0022resurrect\u0022 Jebediah on my saved game. I feel like this goes against the way the game was meant to be played, but I can\u0027t help myself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am horribly inefficient with ship design, particularly the lifter. My ships are always just way too big with way more fuel than necessary. I definitely suffer from moarboosters syndrome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this was not too long.
