There seem to be a fairly large number, and almost all of those are never set anywhere, so I cannot learn from example. Also, when not set, they default to some number, but I don\u0027t know which ones. The config file documentation page on the wiki unfortunately does not mention the thermal systems at all. Is there a more up-to-date resource that modders use?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a closely related topic, I\u0027m also looking for an explanation of how exactly ModuleAblator works and what the various fields in it do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T14:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe default thermal values can be seen in physics.cfg, which is reasonably well commented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T15:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose don\u0027t seem to correspond to what few cfg fields I know of, though.
