I tried deleting all of the files that came with the new mod \u0026 rebooting the game \u0026 then reinstalling the mod but the duplicate parts are still there.\n\nI prefer not to name the new mod because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pretty sure the error is my fault, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m running Window 7 in 32 bit \u0026 KSP 1.0.4 in 32 bit.

Also you should follow the How to get support thread and add your Unity player.log. That would probably help quite a bit."},{"CreatedByName":"Turk_WLF","CreatedById":115580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T14:55:48Z","Content":"It appears that I have found a work-around answer, it seems that I had a double posting of the part(s) within my PartDatabase.cfg.
