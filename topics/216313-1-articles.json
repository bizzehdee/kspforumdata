Whenever I get on, I choose a save to load,\u00A0 the loading bar at the bottom fills up, but then it shows the opening screen with no UI, it just shows whatever ship spinning. I have tried deleting the game from steam and re-installing it, and clearing the Cache from steam. I do not have any mods, or extra files downloaded in the KSP2 files. Thank you and I hope this gets fixed so I can go back to playing this amazing game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
