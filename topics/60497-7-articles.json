The hover function may be too OP for the Church award (although after more thought firespitter heli rotors have that built in) but idk whether the engine auto-balancing is too OP for the other challenges or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, that one looks fine. It mostly looks like a helo. As for TCA, dunno, never used it. In the old challenge firespitter hover was allowed and you can tweak engine throttles now so I don\u0027t see why not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
