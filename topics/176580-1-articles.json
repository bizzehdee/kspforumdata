A lower-density memory foam is pressure-sensitive and molds quickly to the shape of a body pressing against it, returning to its original shape once the pressure is removed.

Gonzalez, October 12, 2010\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have summarized all the reviews and here is the resume: almost all customers accentuate on its comfort, as well as the fabric, as good as real expensive ones but at a decent price. The pillow also unzips, so you can machine wash it when necessary. It is not as compact as an inflatable one, but it is the only demerit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wasn\u0027t sure about the quality for the cheap price but the pillow is exactly what I wanted it to be. It\u0027s not too soft or too firm just perfectly made. I bought it for my dad and it keeps his neck aligned with a good night\u0027s sleep. Very happy with the purchase and definitely recommend it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nView my Twitter to see more picture:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/PillowBest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://twitter.com/PillowBest\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDigital Review, August 22, 2010\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAs a result:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
