The conditions are satisfied when:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027re out of the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your blue path ends in a circle at the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and you have an orange path around the sun after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can achieve these conditions while still very close to Kerbin, so it\u0027s not that hard to do the contract then fire slightly retro to get back to orbiting Kerbin, then land the ship if you so desire. The other options are to do this with a throw-away probe or do it while you\u0027re on your way to Duna or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Catty said, later on you\u0027ll get similar contracts for other bodies, usually starting with Mun. These can be done with flyby passes because the way KSP physics works, you\u0027re always on an escape trajectory as soon as you enter the SOI of a new planet or moon. But of course you can also land there and then do the contract on the way home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T13:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically it means, the same trajectory that you would use to enter the orbit of the sun.

The game does not appear to be entirely consistent about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you can still use the engine to get to orbit, but activate it via the staging menu and meet the terms of the contract. Two ways to do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 1: Place the engine in the staging sequence in accordance with the point in the flight profile where you will \u0022test\u0022 it. To use it before that during ascent, activate the engine by right-clicking the engine and selecting the Activate Engine command. Then later, you can \u0022activate\u0022 the engine normally by staging it with the space bar, and the contract will complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 2: Place the engine in the staging sequence in accordance with the point in the flight profile where you will use it during ascent. To test it, add a new stage at the appropriate point in the flight sequence (using the staging icons at the bottom right of your screen) and drag the engine\u0027s staging icon into it. (You can continue using the engine during this period.) Then, at the appropriate point in the flight, you can \u0022stage\u0022 that engine AGAIN using the space bar and the contract will complete. NOTE: The first time you stage after rearranging the staging sequence in this way, you will probably have to hit the space bar TWICE. (But only the first time after rearranging; after that, staging will behave normally again.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
