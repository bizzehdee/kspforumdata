I understand an know about xScience and other mods \u0022like\u0022 science alert. I have downloaded them, I use them, but I don\u0027t prefer them. I am also aware that modders have other things to do besides make things for us. I am the first one to advocate for modders before entitled players who think modders work for them and they should pump out things immediately after something goes wrong or squad releases another iteration of the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am actually starting this for a few reasons. One the entitled children I spoke of complained so much the Science Alert thread is closed. So I would have asked there if anyone has updated science alert for there personal use to work in 1.1.3 because I just cannot play a career mode and enjoy fully without science alert. But alas people are children and I can\u0027t do so.\u00A0And I have concluded that I can play KSP without any other mod but KJR and Science Alert are the only two I REALLY need.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond is anyone working on a complimentary version of science alert independently? Are there other alternatives out there i just can\u0027t find?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally if not can someone please please please work on some thing thats like Science Alert because I really miss it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely, A desperate, long time\u00A0player, who knows nothing about coding, designing, texturing, and mod making and appreciates every single mod maker out there because without mods KSP would\u00A0just be an awesome\u00A0game and not the game I have grown to love.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-24T22:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d prefer if science experiments were constantly active. That way we wouldn\u0027t need any alerts and they would gather \u0022data\u0022 (AKA unlock points) every time a vessel opens a new biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey eat EC when active anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-24T22:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like mods like ForScience and AutomatedScienceSampler that automatically do the science that my vessel and crew are capable of doing. I believe this should be stock. You would load the right crew and the right equipment and then you\u0027d get little science blurbs about what you\u0027ve learned as you pass through biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
