So I was thinking specifically about radio waves, but a wave at any part of the light spectrum will do. I presume the best evidence we have for its behavior is the double-slit experiment. But the drawings of how a wave works still describe, essentially, particles moving in one direction, and then the other, rhythmically. Now, I can stretch my mind to conceive this, but then I start trying to imagine it as something moving in 3 dimensions; a signal being fired in 360 degrees*3 simultaneously...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022300?cb=20120516004015\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022200\u0022 src=\u0022https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/filmguide/images/f/f8/Rko-logo-746550.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20120516004015\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does one even try to visualize something this in the form of waves? Is is all a SINGLE wave? Is it millions of tiny ones, all going in slightly different directions? What the heck would this look like in 3 dimensions? Or even two for that matter, if you could see every nuance of the light being sent? Can this even be conceived without \u0022ascending\u0022 to the 4th dimension? I never had much of a struggle with this when thinking of it as a laser beam or a flashlight (which was what science books always used for this), but then trying to think of more complex examples, the idea of a light wave suddenly feels much more theoretical. A single \u0022noise\u0022 expands outward from the source as a rapidly expanding sphere. Even if looking at it from 4D, how can that possibly look like a wave?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-03T06:36:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2018 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-03T08:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/67603-vger/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002267603\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/67603-vger/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@vger\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we describe EM radiation as a wave or a particle, we are just painting those concepts over our observations.
