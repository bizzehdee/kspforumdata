It has 8 wheels arranged symmetrically, angled forward and backward.

During initial atmospheric entry, the air brakes deploy and keep the lander stable with the heat shield pointed into the fire. Once the heat shield is no longer needed, it decouples from the bottom of the rover and falls. then the air brakes keep the lander slowed (slower once the heavy heat shield falls) until i pop the 4 chutes at the top. then, the landing gear deploys and the whole thing touches town very slowly while still holding the rover below. At any time during this descent, one science junior can be used, and the other after landing so I don\u0027t lose the valuable science from the heavy materials bays. the lander (right under the airbrakes) also has deployable solar panels to assist in transmitting after landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the rover drops out from under, and drives off to do it\u0027s rover-y stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys want more detail of the construction (and action shots of me jumping off of stuff) I used this to make a rover/eve lander tutorial video (these are screen caps):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5YUou_qMDU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a video of the rover mission in my career mode from launch from kerbin, entry, (redoing that because the first one exploded), landing, and science here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dpy1jCSNKik?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E i\u0027m not posting it as an embedded video, one is enough, but you could see my launcher there if you want.\u003Cp\u003EI can also get some more pictures let me know, there should be enough detail for you guys to figure out how to recreate this (or improve it, since my engineering is that of a drunken, concussed idiot) but i could provide more if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso PLEASE i could use some pointers, i\u0027m always looking for help.
