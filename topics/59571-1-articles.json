I am trying to build a space station. First, I launched a probe with the six-point connector. I put docking ports on the remaining five points, making sure they faced the correct way. On the side opposite of the probe core, I attached the second stage of the rocket to the port. A\u0027ter l launched it to 100Km, I went and designed a solar panel array. After finally succeeding to get the array next to the core, I tried to dock. I right clicked the target port and set it as the target and right clicked the solar panel array\u0027s port and selected \u0022control from here.\u0022 And that\u0027s where things go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I touch the target port with my port, I get no magnetic effect. I don\u0027t think I could get any slower than I did to make contact. I didn\u0027t even know I made contact until the core started to rotate. I loaded the quicksave and tried to hit the port harder, but I only pushed the core away. I have tried one final time without success and almost used the solar array to deorbit the core (I reloaded the quicksave and ended the flight afterwards).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have checked the persistence.sfs file and all ports seem okay. Which leads me to ask if you can dock two ships if one has zero electricity. I launched the core with every intention of it\u0027s batteries dying while up there. If I can still dock with no power on the core, why aren\u0027t I able to now? As I said, the ports are facing the correct way.
