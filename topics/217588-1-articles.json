(after the obligatory orbit decay, missing orbit lines, restarts and resets) I forgot that Kerbal parachutes don\u0027t exist yet in KSP2, so I wasn\u0027t able to return to the ground. (although the \u0027Return to Kerbin\u0027 objective is a little subjective) It was the first of the \u0027Val-level\u0027 mission I\u0027ve been able to do. I spent this morning reveling in my glory, only to ponder how I could improve on my success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am in the process of replaying my mission. (adding parachutes, optimizing trajectories...) To my great surprise, my craft seemed almost magical. 20 FPS on launch was delightful, and my craft seemed to breeze through the atmosphere (~5FPS is what I\u0027m expecting with a simple craft). It wasn\u0027t sluggish, and my parts manager opened almost instantly. Is there any chance that a bugfix was implemented overnight?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a little hesitant to save my game and reload so I\u0027ll finish this out, but i\u0027m curious if anyone else has noticed anything different\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Polaris0352","CreatedById":202097,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-07T15:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you playing via Steam? If so, did you notice a download for KSP2 before you launched? i think if there was a hotfix dropped, it would be the talk of the town. If your performance has gone up, just run with it! It also makes me happy to see that you\u0027re enjoying the game. Doing a big upgrade on my potato so I can hopefully see performance similar to yours. 1-3fps when facing Kerbin is kinda rough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-07T15:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have definitely seen similar behavior on\u00A0 quitting the game and restarting it myself.\u00A0And while it would be grand if the devs were issuing hotfixes for some of these bugs unannounced, I think by far the most likely explanation is that there are currently memory and/or processor leaks in the game such that once they are triggered its performance steadily erodes with time during any particular session. In a similar vein, I have had planes that were performing just fine suddenly become so draggy they wouldn\u0027t go transonic anymore after I made some trivial adjustment in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and after that no attempt to reverse what I did in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to make them work again. Only reverting to a previously saved version restores their performance. I am basically dealing with both of these issues by saving frequently and restarting the game frequently, which definitely seems to reduce the frequency with which several of the worst bugs occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
