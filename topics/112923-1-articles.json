In most cases a Sun-synchronous orbit needs a precession of 1 year, and as you mentioned, KSP doesn\u0027t model precession (because of absence of planet oblateness), so any orbit will have zero precession, so Sun-synchronous orbits are not possible unless precession doesn\u0027t matter. I don\u0027t know whether just coplanar to the planet orbital plane is a sufficient condition, but at least with the perfect condition of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, equatorial orbits around Kerbin do sound to me Sun-synchronous (but they\u0027re the only cases)"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T23:57:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Only equatorial orbits (i.e. with zero or 180 degree inclination) can be Sun-synchronous.\n\nThis is inaccurate.

Equatorial orbits can **never** be sun-synchronous because they view the sun in different positions at any given latitude on each orbit since the position of the sun relative to the orbit changes on each orbit due to the planet\u0027s orbit around it\u0027s parent."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T03:47:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It doesn\u0027t matter.

As a result, the sun is always directly over Kerbin\u0027s equator with no latitude changes (or seasons) over the course of the year. Also, in KSP, a ship\u0027s orbital plane doesn\u0027t change over time. Thus, if you put a ship into a polar orbit that\u0027s edge-on to the sun initially, then 1/4 of a year later the ship\u0027s orbital plane will be broadside on to the sun. The same thing happens to all inclined orbits. The orbit\u0027s LAN is fixed until you change it by maneuvering the ship.\n\nFor these reasons, you can\u0027t make a true sun-synchronous orbit (as in the ship crossing the equator at the same local time every orbit) in KSP. In KSP, an equatorial orbit is the closest you can do, and tehcnically this is actually sun-synchronouse because the angle of the orbital plane to the sun never changes, but it\u0027s of no real use and the altitude can be arbitrary."},{"CreatedByName":"Lime","CreatedById":137978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T13:52:17Z","Content":"Just did it when at apoapsis it\u0027s always in the sun.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
