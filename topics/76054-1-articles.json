It is well tested and is extremely reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cOIPp7B.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022cOIPp7B.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, at 20 m/s, I put on the brakes, and went to eat lunch. I came back and the rover had parked smoothly (as it usually does) and I let brave Hadfen go on an EVA. Everything was also normal, and he returned to the rover after getting some pics of Kerbin. After turning off the brakes though, something strange happened. The rover was on a 10 degree drop, pointing down, however it was backing up at increasingly fast speeds!!! I performed a feat of anti-gravity!!! After wrestling with the rover I managed to start rolling in the right direction of gravity, and when I reached the halfway point down the hill, gravity was back to normal. After more tests I found the entire upper area of the hill was anti-gravity. I even restarted the game, but still the same results.

It\u0027s very easy to find on Mun; just look anywhere that the rims of 2 overlapping craters intersect.
