I\u0027d argue that I\u0027ve had a MUCH richer and rewarding experience than those who have. I frequently argue against using them for new players, for this reason - to help them discover the fun that I\u0027ve had, doing it on my own with a little guidance/research on the forums. \u003Cp\u003E3 reasons why I care whether anyone else uses them: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - I want other people to be lifelong fans of the game, as I am, so that it can continue to develop and be amazing for years to come. The easy-mode mods cheapen the experience, IMO, making my beloved KSP a more \u0027disposable\u0027 product, just like any other game that is played through and discarded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - I don\u0027t want the developers to cater to the lowest common denominator in their player-base and cheapen this game to another mass-market piece of crap \u0027simulator\u0027 that requires no player skill whatsoever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - I admit to taking a fair bit of pride in the skills and effort required to make an un-assisted trip to Minmus, or build a working SSTO without assistance. Seeing a few hundred new players bragging about dropping a massive base on Eeloo within a few weeks of starting has been irritating, to say the least - ESPECIALLY when they criticize others taking a much longer time to accomplish this without assistance. I admire seeing great things made by fellow players, but as soon as I see the letters \u0022TWR\u0022 or \u0022d/v\u0022 show up, I lose all interest in what they did - I know that it was snapped together and almost guaranteed to work from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are all playing our own game, yes, but we also belong to this community, and our feedback is heard by the developers. I\u0027ve seen a number of game changes made over the years based on forum consensus, and we do have an effect on how this all turns out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOof - that\u0027s taking \u0027avoiding easy mode\u0027 to it\u0027s extreme. If that\u0027s the way you like it then fair play to you - you\u0027ve certainly got either a lot more tolerance for trial and error or are doing a whole lot more pen-and-paper work than I am. I\u0027m not getting drawn into the MechJeb debate (other than a passing raised eyebrow that the debate has popped up yet again) but I\u0027ll happily admit to using KER, delta-V maps and launch window calculators. Even before career mode, my games were \u0027career like\u0027 and I\u0027m not a big fan of excess time-warping. End result - relatively few interplanetary journeys and the ones I do make, I prefer to get approximately right first time rather than revert them and lose the many months of game-time that have elapsed whilst my Duna probe (or whatever) was in transit. Similarly, the fact that I\u0027m playing a lot of actual game (rather than time-warping) between interplanetary flights gives me limited tolerance for trial and error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my very first interplanetary flights, I looked up the delta-V requirements and phase angles but did the delta-V calculations myself and - literally- used a protractor against the screen to judge the phase angles. These days, I prefer to use KER and Alexmoon\u0027s calculator - having dates rather than angles for my launch windows is a wonderful thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m playing easy mode then so be it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T20:01:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lubo","CreatedById":136723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use Mecjeb and KER, i get the cheating point of view, but for me the increase of figureing the game out and just have more fun(or lets say less frustrating moments) is worth it\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
