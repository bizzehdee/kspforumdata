Why is using any mod cheating?\n\nFact is, ALL space flights are automated. The only time a human takes over is when docking with the I.S.S. or when landing on the Moon (Manned flight)... last time, Armstrong saw that his landing spot was rocky so took over, when he did finally land the \u0022Eagle\u0022... he had about 8 seconds of fuel left. ALL probes sent out to explore are automated. They have to be. If a human took over because he saw on his monitor that the probe was slightly off course, it would be too late given the time lag between Earth and probe.\n\nSo... stop your accusations right there, buddy.

I\u0027ve been flying KSP ships since 2011, and can pretty much outfly anyone. But it does get tedious, so mechjeb for boring launches. Also, I tend to use mechjeb in manual assisted mode (SAS) mode more than anything else. By this, i mean i\u0027ll do things like:\n\n1) enter the pitch, heading, and roll and click execute, so that mechjeb holds it for me. \n\n2) use mechjeb\u0027s prograde/retrograde/radial/.... buttons to do manuvers by hand (but that way I don\u0027t have to align the dots, i let hte computer do it for me).\n\n3) enter maneuver nodes by hand, but then click the \u0027node\u0027 button so it aligns the ship. I do the burn myself tho.\n\nBasically I use MJ to reduce the tedium a bit and improve the responsiveness of a ship (stock SAS controller is so squirrely -its not fun for me. Noone would design an actual ship to be as horribly over/under damped as the stock system). \n\nMJ\u0027s interplanetary tool is also a must. If you want to compute good launch windows, you need to code it yourself, or use the standalone tool, or use the standalone tool that was imported into mechjeb. \n\n-Seyv\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T19:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Seyvern**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:29:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Neither, I\u0027d rather have the rest of the highly trained crew keep their heads out of their butts and work through the situation like they\u0027d rehearsed, with help from the competent people in mission control.

I\u0027d argue that I\u0027ve had a MUCH richer and rewarding experience than those who have. I frequently argue against using them for new players, for this reason - to help them discover the fun that I\u0027ve had, doing it on my own with a little guidance/research on the forums. \n\u003E 3 reasons why I care whether anyone else uses them: \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 - I want other people to be lifelong fans of the game, as I am, so that it can continue to develop and be amazing for years to come. The easy-mode mods cheapen the experience, IMO, making my beloved KSP a more \u0027disposable\u0027 product, just like any other game that is played through and discarded.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2 - I don\u0027t want the developers to cater to the lowest common denominator in their player-base and cheapen this game to another mass-market piece of crap \u0027simulator\u0027 that requires no player skill whatsoever. \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 - I admit to taking a fair bit of pride in the skills and effort required to make an un-assisted trip to Minmus, or build a working SSTO without assistance. Seeing a few hundred new players bragging about dropping a massive base on Eeloo within a few weeks of starting has been irritating, to say the least - ESPECIALLY when they criticize others taking a much longer time to accomplish this without assistance. I admire seeing great things made by fellow players, but as soon as I see the letters \u0022TWR\u0022 or \u0022d/v\u0022 show up, I lose all interest in what they did - I know that it was snapped together and almost guaranteed to work from the start.\n\u003E \n\u003E We are all playing our own game, yes, but we also belong to this community, and our feedback is heard by the developers. I\u0027ve seen a number of game changes made over the years based on forum consensus, and we do have an effect on how this all turns out.\n\nOof - that\u0027s taking \u0027avoiding easy mode\u0027 to it\u0027s extreme. If that\u0027s the way you like it then fair play to you - you\u0027ve certainly got either a lot more tolerance for trial and error or are doing a whole lot more pen-and-paper work than I am. I\u0027m not getting drawn into the MechJeb debate (other than a passing raised eyebrow that the debate has popped up yet again) but I\u0027ll happily admit to using KER, delta-V maps and launch window calculators. Even before career mode, my games were \u0027career like\u0027 and I\u0027m not a big fan of excess time-warping. End result - relatively few interplanetary journeys and the ones I do make, I prefer to get approximately right first time rather than revert them and lose the many months of game-time that have elapsed whilst my Duna probe (or whatever) was in transit. Similarly, the fact that I\u0027m playing a lot of actual game (rather than time-warping) between interplanetary flights gives me limited tolerance for trial and error. \n\nFor my very first interplanetary flights, I looked up the delta-V requirements and phase angles but did the delta-V calculations myself and - literally- used a protractor against the screen to judge the phase angles. These days, I prefer to use KER and Alexmoon\u0027s calculator - having dates rather than angles for my launch windows is a wonderful thing.\n\nIf I\u0027m playing easy mode then so be it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T20:01:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lubo","CreatedById":136723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:12:57Z","Content":"I use Mecjeb and KER, i get the cheating point of view, but for me the increase of figureing the game out and just have more fun(or lets say less frustrating moments) is worth it"}]}
