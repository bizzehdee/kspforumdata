Anyway, I\\\u0027ve pretty much decided on 4 sided truss beams instead of 6. They are easier to work with in a number of ways. I find it easier to avoid geometry colliding all over the place, with sticking out bits. Lining up angles and so forth is easier. UV maps are simpler. Basically, it makes it easier for me to model, and it makes a bit more sense too; the current beams look awkwardly in the middle between cylinders and square sectioned beams, and I felt cylinders with more sides ( say, 12) wouldn\\\u0027t be much easier and would only add polys and complicate UV maps. With smoothing, they might look good, but... That can be Truss 3.0 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\\\u0027ll do all the parts I\\\u0027ve done so far with the new beams, and with more complexity in other areas.
