When I start, I make sure I have the lightest, most efficient possible lander to begin with, because I know the rocket needed to lift it into space is going to be huge. I don\u0027t think there is need for so many engines, decouplers and parachutes. My landers usually use 2 parachutes, and I use the engies to help slow the craft down the last few m/s. My landers also tend to include enough fuel to circularize the parking orbit as well as conduct the interplanetary injection burn, this means you only need to put the lander in LKO and it can do the rest. This helps because when you\u0027re in low kerbin orbit, lining up for your interplanetary burn, you don\u0027t want to have to maneuver a large booster stage. It also avoids creating space junk. It also means that when you arrive at your destination planet, most of the spaceship is empty tanks, which make for useful low density parachute attachement points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think it would be a good idea to redesign the lander. It has far more thrust than it needs, yet it is very complicated and difficult to rig fuel lines to use the extra thrust from those engines to power the booster stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway you asked for a rocket to get this lander into space, so I have attached a craft file with your lander and a booster that gets it into orbit with plenty of delta-v to spare. It is a very simple booster. It may take some time to orient the rocket in space without using the thrust vectored engine. The flight plan I used was also very simple; full throttle, pitchover 45 degrees at 12km, then 90 degrees at 30km or less, then circularize at desired parking orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Not sure if it\u0027s letting me attach the craft file.
