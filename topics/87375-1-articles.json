Not sure if this was ever talked about on these boards but I want to bring up the subject of the \u003Cstrong\u003Efirst man in space\u003C/strong\u003E. Let me start by saying this is a slightly serious discussion from someone who\u0027s studied space and astronomy in college, I don\u0027t believe in crackpot theories like the fake moon landing or anything. I also have a huge respect (probably more than most Americans do) for what the Russia has done for space exploration in general. I am just curious as to see how other people feel or think on this subject. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few months ago I watched this documentary on amazon about Vladimir Illyushin and how he was the first man in space. Now yes, this was only a documentary, and documentaries can be made to convince their side of the few and etc. (like the fake moon landing ones). Most of them out there are total BS. With that being said, I\u0027ve done some of my own digging and research into this question; was Vladimir Illyushin really the first man in space and not Yuri Gagarin? From one side of the story, I\u0027ve heard that most of the documents on the early days of the Russian Space Program have been declassified. There were not \u0022official\u0022 records of him ever having gone to space, and there are many accounts/witnesses that have said Illyushin did not go to space. Russia pretty much recognizes Gagarin as the first true man in space. All is good, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we start piecing things together, however, it does seem logical to think that Illyushin really did go to space or they tried to get him there. The story of it is, he did in fact go to space, but a problem occurred during reentry and he ended up crash landing somewhere in China I believe. Evidence to support this is the facts that he was supposedly in a car crash two days before Yuri Gagarin went to space. Isn\u0027t that kind of odd? Not only this, but the Soviet Union, their political system was nuts back then. They were a very scandalous country still shaped in the ways of Marxism-Leninism. They could and would have covered something like Illyushin\u0027s crash up if it were to cause some kind of political implications or negative image against the Soviet Union. Furthermore they were so notorious that they could have threatened everyone and anyone who could have known of Illyushin going into space. Even after the USSR disbanded, people still feared them hence why declassified documents give a different opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you all feel, here on the KSP forums? Has anyone else thoroughly read/researched this topic? I do this there are a lot of crackpot theories behind the death of Yuri Gagarin. I personally don\u0027t think he was assassinated as part of a cover up or anything, he was a national image of Russia. I do believe however, that it would have been possible that Vladimir Illuyshin was the first man in space and it could have been a cover up after a failed reentry and crash landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T10:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am missing the most important bit - why try to hide it when he did go to space?

Like some of you have been bringing up, I am on the boat that they could and would have covered it up because of their national pride. Even to this day, even after the end of soviet Russia and their new world relations, think about it. Wouldn\u0027t Russia look kind of stupid admitting after 50\u002B years that Vladimir Illyushin was actually the first man in space? They would have to rewrite history books, tear down statues of Gagarin, and ultimately make themselves look bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to think about is, how would a rumor like this even surface?

It sounds like this conspiracy theory may actually have some truth to it. Why do I care about any of this? Well, don\u0027t you all feel Illyushin should get the credit then for being the first man in space if he really was?
