The reason being that returning from Minmus has the potential to put you in a highly inclined orbit that could take a lot of dV to then match to your station. It is possible to intercept Minmus without changing your plane to match it, with a little bit of fiddling, and once there you can pull off pretty much any maneuver at a significantly reduced dV cost. At any rate, let\u0027s look at an approximate value for this round trip:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin - Minmus: ~920 (~1200 if you match planes first)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus insertion: ~100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous and docking: ~100-200 (depends on your ability, could be more or less)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer to Mun: ~300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar insertion: ~250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous and docking: ~100-200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape Munar SOI: ~250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularization in LKO: ~900\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous and docking: ~150-250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the low end, that\u0027s a total of: 3070 m/s dV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just as much as an interplanetary trip.

For that lander to have expended only 30% of it\u0027s fuel and landed on all those bodies, it would have required a wet/dry mass ratio of over 60 to 1, which while impossible enough on it\u0027s own, would have given a TWR so incredibly low that \u0022landing\u0022 would not be the appropriate word.

How big was this lander you brought? How much dV did it have? I find it extraordinarily hard to believe you returned while still carrying the lander, with more dV than you started with.

The Mk2 long jet segment has the best dry mass ratio for pure liquid fuel of any part. The short one is actually a slightly worse ratio and all Mk3 are less mass efficient than the long Mk2.
