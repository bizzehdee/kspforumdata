With 4 RCS thrusters you could use them to precisely and carefully land 8t, though I would go with less, a Minmus hopping lander is certainly possible in less then 5 tons and you\u0027d use most of the fuel up during operations before you came back to dock. You might also use some of the I-Beams if you have them to create angled guides (like a bowl) to guide in the lander and create a fence around the docking port so the lander can\u0027t tip over onto your base. A Rockomax Brand Adapter 02 under the docking port could also provide a blast shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T01:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done the opposite on the Mun.
