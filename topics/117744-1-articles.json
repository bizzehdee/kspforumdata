That\u0027s what does it right there. Clipping parts inside the bay doesn\u0027t do it, it\u0027s the doors hitting stuff on the outside when you open them. Or even just having the POTENTIAL to hit stuff on the outisde, such as a retractable ladder crossing the door opening, even if you never open the doors while the ladder is extended.

When a part(s) explodes, all the unnatural heat of the bay will disappear instantly, so F3 will say some part overheated but F11 will show what\u0027s left of the rocket at ambient temperature.
