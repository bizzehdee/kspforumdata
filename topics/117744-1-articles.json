I am overheating and blowing up, in the space, with my engines not in use.\n\nHow exactly am I overheating when I haven\u0027t been using the engines at all? And secondly, how do I deal with heat properly? I\u0027m using radiator and thermal panels, but am I using them incorrectly?\n\nI don\u0027t normally cheat, but used \u0022ignore max heat\u0022 to get the screenshot.\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\n![34eaxdh.jpg](http://oi59.tinypic.com/34eaxdh.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T12:58:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 12:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tazm**"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T23:56:14Z","Content":"Wow, entering Kerbol without overheating is unheard of, how did you do it! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nSeriously though, this looks like a bug. You will sometimes suffer from residual heat from ascent but not at this degree and the radiators you\u0027re using would have easily tackled that.

I tried different configurations of radiators, but with no luck.\n\nBy the way, at the time of this screenshot, I had Minmus in sight, and I hadn\u0027t fired my engines since approximately 90 kilometers above Kerbin.\n\nI don\u0027t think I have any clipping, but I do have a probe brain, battery, barometer, and thermometer stuffed in that service bay.\n\nOverall, I didn\u0027t really struggle with reentry. I struggled more with the aerodynamics. I would often flip out of control. But I learned how to build to protect against that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T00:27:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tazm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T00:18:19Z","Content":"Kind of off topic but Kerbol is the Sun; I think you mean Kerbin, which is the Earth-like planet where you take off. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAnd as it has been said above, this seems like a bug.

I\u0027m using radiator and thermal panels, but am I using them incorrectly?\n\nI see your problem: You\u0027re using a service bay and its doors, if opened, would impact some other parts on the outside of the rocket. That\u0027s what does it right there. Clipping parts inside the bay doesn\u0027t do it, it\u0027s the doors hitting stuff on the outside when you open them. Or even just having the POTENTIAL to hit stuff on the outisde, such as a retractable ladder crossing the door opening, even if you never open the doors while the ladder is extended. Furthermore, even if you only open the doors in the VAB, not in actual flight, if they touch something then that bay is doormed when you actually fly the rocket, even if you don\u0027t ever open the doors again.\n\nWhen you have a cursed bacy, what happens is, as the rocket is cooling down from running the engines, the bay will suddenly get super hot, from zero to fusion temps in a split second. While the bay itself is immune to this heat, it will heat up all parts in contact with the bay, whether inside it or outside it. Whichever of these parts has the lowest maxTemp will then explode. When a part(s) explodes, all the unnatural heat of the bay will disappear instantly, so F3 will say some part overheated but F11 will show what\u0027s left of the rocket at ambient temperature. You can only really figure out what\u0027s going on if you revert and let it happen again with F11 on from the get-go. Because this bay superheat appears, kills, and disappears, I call it \u0022Kraken Heat\u0022. And it affects ALL bays: 1.25m and 2.5m service bays, and Mk2 and Mk3 cargo bays both long and short.\n\nThe surest way to cure this is to redesign the ship not to use bays at all. But if you must use bays, then you need to redesign the ship so the doors can never touch any external parts of the rocket during their animation or in their open position. And be VERY careful in the VAB/SPH because even touching stuff in there is fatal. If your doors ever do touch something in the VAB/SPH, it\u0027s best to junk the bay, remove the interfering parts, and start over."},{"CreatedByName":"Tazm","CreatedById":149365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T12:45:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I see your problem: You\u0027re using a service bay and its doors, if opened, would impact some other parts on the outside of the rocket.
