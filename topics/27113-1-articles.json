NASA was aware of pressurized oxygen-rich fires in the past, but they only thought about them as a space-only risk. Their contingencies dealt with fires in space, not on the ground during tests that had a 100% success rate relating to fires at that point. It was a failure of imagination that lead to the test being rated low-risk instead of high-risk. Had the test been properly rated as a high-risk test, NASA may have taken a closer look at the plugs-out test design as well as their capsule environment design. They would have at least made sure there was a much larger safety crew on site with proper equipment and emergency routes to save the astronauts. Of course, the fire might not have happend had the contractor properly QCed the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other major contributing factor to the accident was management and quality control at North American Aviation. At the time, NAA\u0027s management hierarchy was a mess and there was no clear line of communication when problems arose or when NASA submitted notes for changes to module design. This lead to some design flaws and miscommunication between NAA and NASA over proper module operation. This problem was completely outside of NASA\u0027s control and would not have changed even if NASA had taken their time. In fact, NAA went through a forced restructuring as a result of the Apollo 1 fire, guaranteeing better QC and program management for the rest of the program until NAA merged with Rockwell-Standard in 1967.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T15:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jokurr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jokurr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it was not a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crace\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and NASA took their time getting to the moon, say by the mid-late 70s instead of the end of the 60s, they probably could\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve gotten there for a significantly reduced cost.
