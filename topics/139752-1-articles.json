no answer to this question. \u00A0Aerocapture Pe depends on many factors that are different every time you do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe planet you\u0027re doing it at. \u00A0All their atmospheres are different.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe desired Ap altitude after the aerocapture pass. \u00A0IOW, how much braking effect do you need? \u00A0The lower your desired Ap, the more braking you need, so the deeper you have to go.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe relative velocity (both magnitude and direction) of your ship compared to the target planet when you enter it\u0027s SOI. \u00A0The steeper the angle at which your ship\u0027s trajectory crosses the target planet\u0027s orbit, the greater the difference in their velocities,k so the greater braking effect you need to end up with the desired post-aerocapture Ap, so the deeper you have to dive. \u00A0But the greater the relative velocity, the faster you hit the atmosphere, so the greater the heat. \u00A0At some point, the heat will prevent you from going as deep as you need to get your desired Ap, so it pays to make very efficient transfers that have you arrive with minimal velocity relative to the target.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe design of the ship. \u00A0Draggy ships don\u0027t need to go as deep as sleek ships to get the same braking effect. \u00A0Also, because sleek ships don\u0027t slow down very quickly, the spend more\u00A0time going fast in the atmosphere, so experience more heat for a longer time, which can also limit how deep they can go. \u00A0Similarly, dense ships are harder to slow down than less-dense ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these variables make it pretty much impossible to predict in advance

estimate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, the ONLY way to successfully aerocapture is to set your Pe where you think it might be close, hit F5 to quicksave, and then give it a try. \u00A0If
