I even agree to some extent. I\u0027ve always been prepared to answer question or offer help and assistance. But there is one thing I will NOT do. And that is spoon-feed people an answer. Especially when the effort to ask the question here is more than is required to find the answer yourself. Instead I will point people in the right direction where they can find their own answer. And yes, that can sometimes be rather direct or harsh.
