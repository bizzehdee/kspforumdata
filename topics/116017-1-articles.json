TO be honest you would have to increase the cost of the tank to reflect the fuel added. The other problem is that the module can do this multiple times making it a potential SSTO and destination cheat. So unless you decouple the device in the first stage it becomes a cheat. (I do this to breeze through early game when new game releases come out, it makes the drudge easier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever if you exceed the weight of the launch pad you may end up damaging it, of course you could just hit the activate button after you launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think all of these defeat the purpose of the game, they want you to struggle in the design of your craft to make them efficient so that you will reach space and orbit without need a Size2 tank and engine. For example the last revisions make hard game harder even for experienced players (working through the orbit phase right now, so the weight limit is definitely on my mind).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T05:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is indeed a little overcomplicating things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, there\u0027s nothing stopping us from making an empty rocket under the limit and refueling it on the pad right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise Squad has to make the crawlerway have it\u0027s own upgrade levels and versions only for the people that want this bit of more realism.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AG5BPilot","CreatedById":146044,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T10:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn real life liquid fuel rockets are fueled at the launchpad, and most of the weight of the rocket is the fuel.
