My conclusions are slightly different: your only real problem is in your final (lander) stage: there is no way you\u0027ll get home with it, even though your transfer stage will be virtually full of fuel when you ditch it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two sets of reaction wheels at the top of the lifter stage are unnecessary and you can remove them altogether. You have plenty of fins for aero control and gimbal for upper atmosphere/vacuum control. The single reaction wheel at the top can easily get you lined up for the transfer burn on its own. That also lets you get rid of the struts holding the craft together around those weak reaction wheel joints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with about 1000 m/s left on the Twin Boar - so your transfer to Duna can be done with the lifter stage. That leaves over 2km/s just to get into Duna orbit. The problem is that without docking ports, you can\u0027t use the transfer stage to refuel for the return home. Your lander has about 1700m/s, which is just too tight (you\u0027ll certainly need some of that to land on Duna, so you\u0027ll be nearly dry on returning to orbit). If you use a pair of docking ports to attach to the transfer stage, and a basic probe core to stop if from being automatically treated as debris, you can meet up in orbit, transfer fuel across and be laughing for the return home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: just re-read the original post.

If you plan on doing that, you can put parachutes/drogues on the 2.5m section, airbrakes too if you want, and leave the final stage light and clean (plus a couple of photovoltaic panels) so it can get home on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-09T21:37:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2016 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T09:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like that rocket, it flies much nicer than mine do , it looks good and is also quite a real-world design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only echo what the others said, that NERV is the way to go. \u00A0 \u00A0I did a quick bit of maths a few months ago that showed that a Terrier makes sense if fed with an FT400 or smaller, \u00A0but if the burn duration gets any longer than that, you get more delta v for your combined engine \u002B fuel mass by switching to NERV. \u00A0 The only problem you might have is that an LV-N/Mark1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E Fuselage transfer stage will make your rocket even longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never actually been to Duna with a rocket however, \u00A0 since I\u0027m better at building partially reusable spaceplanes like this this -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/WhippyNerv-II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/WhippyNerv-II\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161005091747_1_zpsga6hsa9o.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20161005091747_1_zpsga6hsa9o.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT - just did a test design for a NERV transfer stage. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMK1 liquid fuel fuselage with a NERV right behind it, radially attach mk0 liquid fuel fuselage.
