If you have a ship with each scanner type on it, it will never get much above 80% as the BTDT scanner takes a long time to even scan 1% of a planet. I know, I flew a plane at 1500 meters altitude for about half an hour and my complete percentage only went from the 0.8% I already had to 1%. I dare say no one will ever scan a complete planet with the BTDT, maybe one of the smaller moons like Gilly, but I don\u0027t think there are any anomalies on Gilly, so it would be pointless. The BTDT scanner only returns useful information when it\u0027s near anomalies.\u003Cp\u003EJust put the four other scanners on a ship in orbit and start at 750km altitude. When the display says 25% complete, reduce altitude to about 250km and let it scan the rest until it says 100%. Then you can turn off scanning in the settings screen for that planet to reduce CPU usage, though I think it\u0027s not much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main scanning satellites only have the hi-res and biome scanners on them; I can send a BTDT lander later to fill that part in.

After that, what \u0022processing and working\u0022 of the data will you be able to carry out in the mod? As far as I know the mod just pulls elevation numbers from the game files (the sensors are not actually measuring the virtual terrain)- these same numbers have been used to create Kerbal maps. So pulling the data from KM for an area that you have overflown in the game really isn\u0027t fundamentally different from getting the raw data dump from the mod, and any specialized analysis that you perform has to be done outside of the game. My method also has the added bonus that you can do it right now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might seem pedantic, but I\u0027m just trying to figure out the basis for you self-aggrandizing hyperbole since what you are asking for from the mod is not really any different than what you can get from KM in the interim.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
