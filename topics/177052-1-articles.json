For what it\u0027s worth, it\u0027s a very fun hobby.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have funds to build from a kit, the 1-2ft (~30-60cm) -ish sized rockets launched with engines at the low end of their range tended to be the best experience for value. Loading higher power motors into a rocket make it go higher and faster, which mean you get to see it for less long, and it drifts on its parachute dramatically farther away. Most rockets that are lost are lost to parachuting into distant trees! Since they go pretty high, there can definitely be stiff breezes up above that you don\u0027t feel on the ground. It\u0027s not a big deal, and chasing after them is part of the fun! But if you\u0027re going on a budget, losing a rocket to the wind is pretty obnoxious. When you use a bigger rocket with a smaller engine, it\u0027s helpful to get a shorter-end delay for the parachute charge so the chute will still pop at the rocket\u0027s apex. Most kits will provide recommendations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChoosing your motors can be hard at first. Fortunately, experience in KSP will make it a lot more intuitive! Another bit of good news is there\u0027s some very common and standard sizes. Most rocket engines are Estes brand, or atleast conform to their standards. The way they\u0027re designated is by a letter and 2 numbers. From a super simple perspective, the letter tells you how high the rocket will go (total impulse), and the first number tells you how fast (roughly proportional to thrust within a given letter). The second number tells you how much delay there will be between the engine burning out, and the parachute-popping charge from firing. All of the common starter engines (1/2A , A , B , C) are the same diameter, which gives you a good degree of flexibility. Naturally, choosing an engine too \u0027small\u0027 causes the rocket not to lift and too large causes... more exciting problems! Here\u0027s a list of some favorites for comparison: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www2.estesrockets.com/pdf/Estes_Engine_Chart.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www2.estesrockets.com/pdf/Estes_Engine_Chart.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you glue together rockets, proper glue choice is important! For a first rocket, I\u0027d recommend 5min epoxy. It has its own troubles, but they\u0027re less than that of the cyanoacrylates (crazy glue), the urethanes (rubber cement) or the longer cure epoxies (which are a better choice in the long run). I wonder if anyone has experience with gorilla glue? It came out after my time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPacking chutes is really an art form. Most rockets will have instructions, but the one thing I\u0027ll add is that a light dusting of baby powder really helps them open up consistently. If you do a smaller rocket with a streamer, powder up that thing too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing beats the smell of burning gun powder SRBs in the morning!

Anyways, it was a tiny thing that was barely large enough to contain its engine. My family and I were out in the desert, and figured if we were ever going to try overpowering it, this was the day! So we loaded the poor 1/2A rocket with a high thrust A, and hit the ignition! There was a faint \u0022zwip\u0022 noise and the thing simply disappeared! No smoke trail, nothing.

PVC will hold the pressure nicely. I cannot stress this enough, though: do NOT use a metal nozzle or cap with a PVC rocket. You MUST use a substance (like clay) with a lower burst pressure than PVC. Otherwise you stand a very, very good chance of creating a pipe bomb. PVC shrapnel is lethal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is to create your own COPV by wrapping a paper tube in narrow, helical layers of duct tape under tension. If you get it right, that will have enough strength to allow you to pack propellants, and you can use a cast clay nozzle or something even sturdier, since the burst mode of a duct-tape COPV is benign.

specific to model building, almost fifty years ago in Keith Laumer\u0027s book, \u003Cem\u003EHow to Design and Build Flying Models\u003C/em\u003E, but I\u0027ve seen it touted by G. Harry Stine (one of the fathers of model rocketry) as well.\u00A0 I got the impression it was an old technique, dating back to the invention of water soluble glues (casein glue was the first Elmers, introduced in 1947 by Borden -- mainly known for their milk products -- but the production and use of casein glue goes back to Egyptian times).\u00A0 Modern white glue is polyvinyl acetate in water, and has as its main advantage over casein glue that it won\u0027t spoil in the bottle (casein glue is still sold in powder form, used mainly for sizing artist canvas).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I learned it was to rub the first layer of glue well down into the wood grain or paper surface, then when it was just barely still tacky, make the second application and join the parts.\u00A0 Aside from overall joint strength, the other advantage is that the glue grabs very quickly when applied this way -- plain Elmer\u0027s will tack hold in ten or fifteen seconds from joining the parts, a process that takes up to a half hour if you apply the same total amount of glue and immediately join the parts.\u00A0 Clamping can almost be eliminated for model construction purposes, total glue amount applied can be reduced (which, once again, helps with finished frame weight), and the finished joint is stronger than balsa, spruce, light-ply, and most hardwood ply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-04T00:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223427010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177052\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533302920\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just means that you apply a double layer of glue -- first, a layer on both surfaces to be joined (which you then allow to air-dry), and then a wet layer on one of the surfaces before joining and clamping.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, yeah I\u0027ve seen that.\u00A0 Numerous tests have shown this to be slightly weaker than one layer of glue.\u00A0\u00A0 The first layer of glue soaks into the surface and starts to cure, and the second layer doesn\u0027t stick tho the first as well.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 As well as the first layer still being wet.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Letting the first layer cure a bit weakens the bond some, but if it\u0027s still fresh, it\u0027ll have soaked in but will still bond better with the second layer.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Not saying it won\u0027t work, just that it\u0027s slightly weaker than both being wet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this two layer technique is really only necessary for porous surfaces, like the end grain of wood, where the material itself would absorb so much of the adhesive, that the joint itself would be starved of glue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adstri","CreatedById":174024,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T23:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to make bottle rockets.
