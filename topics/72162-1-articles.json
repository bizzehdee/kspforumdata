As it is, that also means a lot of clicky-clicky. Please give the interface a workover. Wall of text follows, key points are bold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell, the best way to maximize the science point per mission is to perform repeated experiments at every landing site, either by bringing redundant science equiment or a laboratory. \u003Cstrong\u003EIn order to return as many results as possible, they have to be \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etaken\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E from the equipment\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Estored\u003C/em\u003E in a suitable module (probably a lab).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my case, I ended up doing both. With a Lab integrated into the lander, one piece of every instrument would suffice. However, I find running and collecting larger batches of experiments to be much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch \u003C/em\u003Emore convenient than doing many collection/cleanout cycles (which also means switching between vessel and EVA, the latter requiring me to re-orient the camera each time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can run all experiments by action group, that\u0027s the easy part. It also triggers like 20 results and \u003Cstrong\u003EI have to click \u0022Keep Data\u0022 on each\u003C/strong\u003E. Then some Kerbal has to go out and collect the results. With my first landers, he had to walk around the ship in order to touch on every experiment [1]; later designs cramped all science equipement into a small area so everything is easily acessible from a single spot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I get him into place, and \u003Cstrong\u003Edo a context menu -\u0026gt; collect data for every single instrument\u003C/strong\u003E. In case of materials bay and mystery goo, I get an additional \u003Cstrong\u003Epop-up warning\u003C/strong\u003E telling me that this will render the experiment inoperable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing such a LabLander, I recently touched off all biomes on the Mun during a single mission. At the third or fourth site, I found myself wondering wether I had already taken a soil sample or not, and clicked \u0022Review Data\u0022 on the Lab. BAD IDEA. \u003Cstrong\u003EReviewing 100\u002B results with the current interface is definitely no fun\u003C/strong\u003E at all. I ended up just collecting a few more samples for good measure and be done with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least in my case, the mass-production of science has the effect that I hardly look at the results anymore. For all I know, there may have been a lot of funny descriptions of the Goo\u0027s behaviour yet at some (early) point in the game I stopped paying attention. It\u0027s just another result that needs to be filed; who cares what it says?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] Materials Containers should be set to be collectable from a little further away. Probably the caclulation is done from center of object to center of Kerbal; in case of the materials container, which is the most bulky science part, \u003Cstrong\u003Ea Kerbal can touch the container with his helmet and still be out of reach\u003C/strong\u003E. This might actually qualify as a minor bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T15:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy vote?
