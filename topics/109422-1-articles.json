Sorry for spelling mistakes, I\u0027m a terrible transcriber. I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. As always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - some details may change or be entirely incorrect.\n\n**Squadcast Summary for 2015-05-16** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/5074814)\n\nUpdates/1.0.3 plans\n\n\u0022Thank you, everyone\u0022 - the 1.0 launch kinda blew everyone\u0027s mind, the reception from critics and the KSP community has been awesome - Squad\u0027ll make sure they provide you with way more fun stuff to play with. Updates planned for quite a while, lots of cool stuff to add and free updates to give out. Work on multiplayer has been going great - so far, a stable server exists, it\u0027s all working ok. With regards to more planets, the game is kinda stressed in that regard so don\u0027t hold your breath.\n\nUnity 5\n\nNice progress on updating to Unity 5 - probably going to have to flat out re-do the UI from the ground up though, which is good as it means they can be more efficient (the current UI is a relic of the very first versions when they didn\u0027t really know what they were doing). Hopefully, U5 will fix the current stability issues with OSX and Macs as Squad tracked down the problem to something within Unity itself. Windows 64bit - maybe? No promises, but they\u0027ll do their absolute best to make it the best it can be. \n\nMiscellaneous \n\n1.0.2 aero feedback - quite a lot of it, not all of it consistent - someone has to be wrong here. Squad are figuring out the best solution to make everyone happy, still working on aero, balance and bugfixing, on top of U5. Video and pictures of the dev teams skydiving adventures do exist, they\u0027ll be posted later. Also, Devnotes Tuesdays will return, don\u0027t worry.\n\nThat was Squadcast Summary, I\u0027m OWK and you\u0027re welcome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T01:06:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T00:47:15Z","Content":"Thanks OWK!

It\u0027s more stable, but no guarantees that everything Squad will need for 64 bit Win KSP will be bug-free.

Then again, the parts of Unity that C:S and KSP use aren\u0027t that much in common.\n\nBetween improved performance single-theaded, the potential for multi-threaded physics when you\u0027ve got more than one craft in the physics bubble, and the improved odds of working Win 64, I\u0027m really looking forward to the U5 KSP port.
