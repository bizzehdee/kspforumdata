This works fine when I stage it, but when I try to configure a custom abort sequence under action groups, I noticed that the structural pylon has no actions (unlike the decoupler). I\u0027m guessing this was just a simple oversight - I don\u0027t know if this has been addressed before, but it seems like it should be an easy fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for making such a great game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T20:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe structural pylon is an odd one, it still uses the old decoupler part, instead of the part module.
