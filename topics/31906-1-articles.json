Me Again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, i bring to you the U3 DragonFly. With a large delta wingspan, and two powerful turbojets to power it along, the U3 is at the cutting edge of kerbal technology! It even boasts a twin-cockpit configuration which allows one brave and possibly idiotic kerbal to pilot it, and one to operate the camera systems. If you have not figured it out already, this plane is based of the U2-\u0022Dragon Lady\u0022 which is also a photographic reconnaissance aircraft. Anyway enough beating around the bush, time to watch that video!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2Dlzd1yVjw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003Cp\u003ESee you later guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamGaming\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
