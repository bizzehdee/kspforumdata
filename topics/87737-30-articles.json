I can tell you what mods I *don\u0027t* have installed, that some reddit posters felt were guilty for them: DRE, procedural fairings. Looking at the others, they\u0027re mostly eye candy and information aids, none looks guilty. F3 just says it was overheating, and there were no heat bars before the explosion.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAnyone else getting this wanna compare? I\u0027d like to ask for it to be fixed, but I can\u0027t even confirm if it\u0027s a stock bug or a mod one, having someone compare mods installed could narrow down the problem and see if it\u0027s stock or not.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaged to replicate by quicksaving a perfectly fine ship which explodes upon load.
