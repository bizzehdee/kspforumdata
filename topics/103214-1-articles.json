After docking the crew transport ship, the station has around 950 parts...\n\nAlso, I added too many lights...\n\nSo now it\u0027s a pain to manage. The FPS is manageable (it\u0027s not a first person shooter after all...). But parts and menus take a very long time to react.\n\nQuestions :\n\n- What options can I reduce to impoove the situation a little bit ?\n\n- Are there mods to remove parts on the fly ? I\u0027m thinkng about broken struts, useless engines, RCS, batteries and solar pannels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T20:58:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T08:13:56Z","Content":"[Kerbal Attachment System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29) will allow kerbals on EVA to remove parts - but you\u0027d have to figure out where to put them.
