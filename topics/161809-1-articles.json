Most jet engines, in fact I think all of the stock ones (except the gigantic Goliath), require a stack node to attach to, they cannot be attached freely (called \u0027radially\u0027 in the game). What you will need to do is select a part that can attach radially to either the wings or the fuselage and that will leave an open stack node at its back for an engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: the Mk0 Liquid Fuel Tank can be attached (in mirror symmetry would be good) under the wings or to the sides of the tail connector, and will then have an open stack node on the front and on the back - the front one can take a small air intake, the back one can take a Juno jet engine. Mk0 is a good choice for this size of plane, and with two of them you should have plenty of power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-08T22:51:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2017 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espotted the engine\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jonpfl","CreatedById":177671,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T22:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw some video from an older version that just popped on those engines without a fuel tank. \u00A0Or could I be mistaken?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njonpfl\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T22:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngines need to connect to a node, the green circles.\u00A0 There are several ways to accomplish getting one on there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry cubic struts:\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u002255px-Cubic_Octagonal_Strut.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/3/30/Cubic_Octagonal_Strut.png/55px-Cubic_Octagonal_Strut.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor radial attachment point:\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u002260px-Radial_attachment_point.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Radial_attachment_point.png/60px-Radial_attachment_point.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T22:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223085290\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161809\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496962314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177671\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jonpfl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, jonpfl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw some video from an older version that just popped on those engines without a fuel tank. \u00A0Or could I be mistaken?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the Junos are relatively recent additions to the game, so it can\u0027t have been a very old video.

See how your center of thrust marker (the purple ball) is beneath the line of your center of mass (the yellow ball)? Your engines are pushing on the underside of your plane harder than the top side of your plane. Usually this means that it will constantly tend to pitch upwards, pivoting around the center of mass. You might try raising the engines up some so that they are in line with the center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore immediately, if you can\u0027t lift off of the runway at all I\u0027d say that it\u0027s because your rear wheels are too far back. You need to be able to lean back to bring your nose up when you are trying to lift off. The force allowing you to pitch upwards in this case would come from the air pushing down on your horizontal tail fin causing the plane to rock backwards with the rear wheels as your pivot point. But there\u0027s too much weight in front of the rear wheel and not enough leverage behind them so you can\u0027t pivot on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMove the rear wheels forward more -- just about in line with the engine nozzles should work.
