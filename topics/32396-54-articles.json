I\u0027ve double checked when I fixed a certain issue and I have a suspicion about what\u0027s going on: you copied a save directory to create a test (or even just EL) save, and then created the relevant craft. If that is true, then the problem is the way EL locates the Ships directory (and thus the VAB and SPH directories in there): EL checks the \u0022name\u0022 of the save (which, apparently, isn\u0027t visible anywhere) and constructs the name from that. Unfortunately, if you copy a save, even though the visible name changes, the name EL sees does not.
