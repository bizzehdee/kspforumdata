So my first module was the Zarya, I attached it to the Proton-K rocket and added some struts to stabilize the docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is, that after liftoff the module began to shake, so the rocket is hard to controll. After the gravity turn, it goes on with shakes till the rocket break in half a little under the docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried many things, like use decoupler instead of the docking port on the Proton-K (on the Zarya I need the docking port), tried with other docking ports, with more struts but nothing helped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the craft files (only proton-k rocket and with module).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?64i2sskhc53iizn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?64i2sskhc53iizn\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone has some tipps or solution for me.
