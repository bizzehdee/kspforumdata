Try something like \u0022game booster 3.4\u0022 (Google it) It gets good reviews.

It seemed a better suggestion then going through a manual process. I do it manually but that is my thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck your task manager. When I boot up Windows only uses 550mb and only has 29 processes running. I also like to set the KSP.exe priority to high.

I am not going to be printing when I am playing; print spooler off. All the bells and whistles; off. I even go so far as to remove the internet connection from my PC and run with out AV and firewall. Not recommended I know but I like to live dangerously.
