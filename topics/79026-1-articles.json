I\u0027m trying to figure out the tweakables system and I\u0027ve seen threads here that have explained most of it. What I\u0027m trying to do is immediately react when a slider is changed but I\u0027m not sure how to link a KSPField to a KSPEvent. I\u0027ve seen plenty of examples of having it automatically change a variable, which would be fine if I knew the variable had been changed. Is it possible to do this? An example of what I\u0027m trying to do would be like moving the thrust limiter while in flight, the engine immediately reacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T18:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not aware of any callback or event that is triggered when that happens so here is how I would approach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[KSPField]\u003Cbr\u003Efloat currentValue;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Efloat lastValue;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Epublic void Update()\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Eif(currentValue != lastValue)\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Eprint(\u0022Value changed!\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003ElastValue = currentValue;\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pseudo code, syntax needs checking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this method will trigger multiple times as the player moves the slider as Update() is called multiple times a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T18:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I can filter multiple updates easy enough for what I\u0027m doing.
