I then gave up and tried to simply delete the mods and play without them but soon found that I could not get rid of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and Outer planets. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E Went away, however. If I watch the files while KSP is loading, I can see them re-downloading into the folder. So I decided to leave it and forget anything happened. BUT, when I went into the game I found that all of the \u0022Thermal\u0022 Parts were missing, the storage bays reverted back to their old models, and a duplicate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank without a texture. I have tried many times to uninstall the mods but no luck. Can anybody help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-02T21:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223426698\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533244090\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duck McFuddle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Duck McFuddle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anybody help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi the simple fix ids for you to delete your current install and reinstall KSP completely, it sounds very much like you have deleted\u00A0 Squad files from the squad folder, and as such your game is broken .\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce reinstalled\u00A0 mods should only go into the GameData folder, NEVER into the squad folder,\u00A0 and you should never have more than one Gamedata folder. for example \u00A0 KSP/GameData/Gamdata/anyCoolMod\u00A0 will prevent many mods from working. \u00A0 KSP/Gamdata/Squad/AnyCoolMod\u00A0 will probably break your game.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The only file path any mod should have is KSP/GameData/Any CoolMod.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Also for a normal or abnormal player you should have no reason to alter add to, or remove the Squad folder or it\u0027s contents .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-02T21:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did you install these mods?
