I think if I had to choose one it would be inflatable-only.  \n\n2) Okay, feel free to check my maths here. I\u0027m not going to Kerbal-scale anything, which may be the wrong thing to do. Also the assumptions made here can be terrible, and I\u0027m liable to forget how to count without warning.  \n\nWe\u0027ll assume a Bigelow B330 is an even **20 tons**, and when expanded can be considered to be a cylinder with height 13.7m, diameter 6.7m and thickness of 0.46m.  \n\nThe volume of the cylinder as a whole is (V= pi r^2 h) = 483.01 m^3  \n\nVolume of air is 359.47 m^3 *(Yeah, I know it\u0027s supposed to be 330m^3, I\u0027m just going by their numbers)*  \n\nSo volume of \u0022structure\u0022 is (483.01 - 359.47) = 123.54 m^3  \n\nDensity therefore is rho = 20,000 / 123.54  \n  \n**= 161.89 kg / m^3**  \n\nWith the (presumably fairly wrong) assumption that the density of the transhab layers remain fairly consistent throughout the sizes.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\nTorus volume is V = (pi r^2)(2 pi R) (r and R are major and minor radii)  \n\nThe Nautilus-X Centrifuge (probably the second size up) was supposed to have a 12m diameter (ignoring that I don\u0027t actually see how this works out to something plausible).  \n\nAssuming you need to stand up, that\u0027s a 1.8m internal space (Six foot. Similar to a submarine, I\u0027d have problems), with two 0.46m walls.  \n\nThat makes r = 1.36m and R = 4.64m\n\nSolid doughnut V = 169.4m^3  \n\nair R is the same, air r = 0.9  \n\nVolume of air = 74.19m^3  \n\nSo structural volume = 95.21m^3  \n\nAssuming it\u0027s all made out of the same stuff:  \n\n161.89 = Mass / 95.21  \n\nor the second-largest torus should be **15413.5 kg** or so.   \n\nHalving this is pretty normal for KSP (since Kerbals are half-sized), so I think a **7.5 ton Torus** should be fine here, as you\u0027ve suggested.  \n\n3) I\u0027m really not sure about whether Greenhouses are desired or needed. Between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and Kolonization there are quite a few options for this, so that might be a little superfluous (unlike strictly-hab parts, which are in short supply).  \n\n4) Still strongly believe that the tori should primarily provide hab **multipliers** - for any serious deep space exploration in KSP, multipliers are vital, and there aren\u0027t many good options. Having hab multiplier = anti-gravity is a good shorthand, I think, since it means that anything going out beyond Duna will likely take a larger torus (for Dave and Frank to run around in).  \n\nI do like the idea that large torus parts serve dual roles - they can be near-Kerbin space habitats/hotels/space camps (the Tourism Contract Pack for one gives you good reasons to lift 15\u002B Kerbals at a time, and anything that involves serious colonisation would require large amounts of kerbals-per-ship), but they can also serve as deep space exploration with a small crew. The nice thing about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS is that this is how the crew spaces work - so leaving seats free is an elegant way to change the part\u0027s use.  \n\nIn terms of crew sizes, four to six is pretty normal I think. Four allows for two scientists, one engineer and one pilot which is pretty good for most things, but especially with UKS this can balloon pretty fast - Pilots are used for proxy logistics, Engineers for transmitting power, etc. Indeed, there are (somewhat hidden) efficiency losses for having less than five kerbals bimbling around a base.  \n\nObviously the usage examples above are mostly from my games, and may not be applicable more broadly. Still, they\u0027re the only examples I have, so I don\u0027t think it hurts to give them.  \n\nThe B330 module is supposed to have a six person crew, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a bad reference point.  \n\n5) Perhaps the storage % can be hidden slightly by increasing the default amount of hypergolics on board? This is assuming that you\u0027re including the kind of integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E that the Bigelow modules are supposed to have.  \n\nI think that\u0027s always going to be a problem though. It\u0027s fine when the space can be used for inventory space, supplies or whatever, but you have to fill it with \\*something\\* I suppose. Is it possible to leave them with some amount of empty space? (I.e., start with the \u0022battery\u0022 mostly empty)."},{"CreatedByName":"snekposter","CreatedById":139710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T21:24:42Z","Content":"this is one of the best mods ive ever seen. i have a question though, what is the texture sets zip file? just additional textures?"},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T21:35:02Z","Content":"Incidentally, assuming I haven\u0027t made some stupid error with the volume calculations, it does mean that a torus is really inefficient in terms of habitable volume (which isn\u0027t surprising I suppose).  \n\nThat does mean that the multiplier effect for countering zero-g should possibly be the main effect of the torus, whereas the inflatable habs would give more of a bonus to habitation time."},{"CreatedByName":"CrazykennyNL","CreatedById":166714,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T22:13:26Z","Content":"Loving the mod so far.

I think any light would be electric, or perhaps via a heliostat.

I think if I had to choose one it would be inflatable-only.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Okay, feel free to check my maths here. I\u0027m not going to Kerbal-scale anything, which may be the wrong thing to do. Also the assumptions made here can be terrible, and I\u0027m liable to forget how to count without warning.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E [snip]  \n\u003E   \n\u003E **= 161.89 kg / m^3**  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E [snip]  \n\u003E \n\u003E or the second-largest torus should be **15413.5 kg** or so.   \n\u003E \n\u003E Halving this is pretty normal for KSP (since Kerbals are half-sized), so I think a **7.5 ton Torus** should be fine here, as you\u0027ve suggested.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 3) I\u0027m really not sure about whether Greenhouses are desired or needed. Between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and Kolonization there are quite a few options for this, so that might be a little superfluous (unlike strictly-hab parts, which are in short supply).  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 4) Still strongly believe that the tori should primarily provide hab **multipliers** - for any serious deep space exploration in KSP, multipliers are vital, and there aren\u0027t many good options. Having hab multiplier = anti-gravity is a good shorthand, I think, since it means that anything going out beyond Duna will likely take a larger torus (for Dave and Frank to run around in).  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I do like the idea that large torus parts serve dual roles - they can be near-Kerbin space habitats/hotels/space camps (the Tourism Contract Pack for one gives you good reasons to lift 15\u002B Kerbals at a time, and anything that involves serious colonisation would require large amounts of kerbals-per-ship), but they can also serve as deep space exploration with a small crew. The nice thing about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS is that this is how the crew spaces work - so leaving seats free is an elegant way to change the part\u0027s use.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E In terms of crew sizes, four to six is pretty normal I think. Four allows for two scientists, one engineer and one pilot which is pretty good for most things, but especially with UKS this can balloon pretty fast - Pilots are used for proxy logistics, Engineers for transmitting power, etc. Indeed, there are (somewhat hidden) efficiency losses for having less than five kerbals bimbling around a base.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Obviously the usage examples above are mostly from my games, and may not be applicable more broadly. Still, they\u0027re the only examples I have, so I don\u0027t think it hurts to give them.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E The B330 module is supposed to have a six person crew, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a bad reference point.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 5) Perhaps the storage % can be hidden slightly by increasing the default amount of hypergolics on board? This is assuming that you\u0027re including the kind of integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E that the Bigelow modules are supposed to have.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I think that\u0027s always going to be a problem though. It\u0027s fine when the space can be used for inventory space, supplies or whatever, but you have to fill it with \\*something\\* I suppose. Is it possible to leave them with some amount of empty space? (I.e., start with the \u0022battery\u0022 mostly empty).\n\u003E \n\n1.) Splitting them up isn\u0027t doable; you can\u0027t have a multi-part rotating centrifuge, so docking/welding is out of the question (see Infernal Robotics/all those types of problems).  Nor would I want to have the overhead from all the extra parts needed to do it in that fashion.  It will be a single part either way; the question is more whether the largest torus should inflate or be solid and intended to be built solely through EL.  Whether they are animated to spin is a second question that I haven\u0027t quite addressed yet (non-spinning = could include docking ports/solar panels on the exterior of the ring).  (My original intent for the largest torus was rigid, non-spinning, to be used as a large storage part and docking ring)\n\n2.) Noted, and interesting.  See below for a continuation of the skin-thickness based calculations as they would apply to the rest of the parts.  And yes, tori are very inefficient from a skin-mass perspective; they have a lot of surface area for the amount of volume they contain.  Cylinders/spheres would be better at the surface/volume ratio, but problematic to build large enough to work as a proper artificial gravity centrifuge.\n\n3.) Yeah, I\u0027m a bit hesitant on them as well.  I\u0027ll likely just include converters in a few parts where I think it is appropriate... a stand-alone greenhouse part kind of goes against the mods\u0027 purpose anyhow.\n\n4.)  Mostly was curious as to how many crew the part should hold in a stock game (though this will effect how the balance is done for LS, it will not be the determining factor).  I would say that the maximum I would consider would be 30 crew for the largest torus... but even that seems absurd to me (but possibly necessary).  As to life support/hab/multipliers -- I intend that a very reasonable vessel should be able to do an Eeloo round trip without hab time issues; so a crew of 10 should get about 10 years out of the largest torus \u002B one or two other hab parts; however, none of that work can be done until I know the crew capacity for these parts.\n\n5.) Inflatables will not have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (at this point in time, might change).  People stated that they\u0027d rather only have a single end-cap on them, and these end-caps are needed for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and solar panels.  No end-caps = no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/solar/radiators.  Sadly, the container system does not support \u0027emtpy\u0027 containers;  It has to be filled with some resource, the \u0027lightest\u0027 of which is ElectricCharge.  I personally have no problem in greatly reducing the \u0027volume\u0027 of the container for those parts to something more reasonable... but that volume is intended to be configurable for stuff like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage or additional life-support supplies (although I suppose the end-users can always patch higher volume in if they really want to use those functions / I could include such patches to be activated on a mod-triggered basis).\n\nI guess technically these modules could start \u0027empty\u0027 or \u0027partially empty\u0027 of a particular resource, but the volume has to be allocated for one resource or another in order to be user configurable (e.g. have 20,000l allocated for propellant, but start with only 1,000l of it filled).\n\nOn that note, I -might- be able to find a way to include \u0027empty\u0027 volume in the containers.  Initial thoughts on implementation would be a bit hacky (using a dummy zero-mass resource, similar to how I handle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage setup)... but might be a worthwhile addition in the long run.  Would rather find a \u0027proper\u0027 way to handle it, but my previous attempts at doing so never went satisfactorily.\n\nTable of module mass/volume based on using the skin-thickness from the B330 module.  I have scaled the wall thickness down to kerbal levels (0.46m \\* 64%), but left the mass per m3 the same (162kg/m^3). \n\n|  | rad or R | h or r | raw vol (m3) | dry mass (kg) | wall depth | inner radius | vol minus walls | wall vol | kg per m3 | crew | mass per crew | m3 per crew |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| b330 | 6.7d | 13.7 | 483.0143727 | 20000.00 | 0.46 | 5.78d | 359.4728752 | 123.5414975 | 161.8889232 | 6 | 3333.333333 | 59.91214587 |\n| hab-a | 2.5 | 5 | 98.17477042 | 6601.58 | 0.294 | 1.912 | 57.42429247 | 40.75047796 | 162 | 5 | 1320.315486 | 11.48485849 |\n| hab-b | 3.75 | 7.5 | 331.3398502 | 15513.41 | 0.294 | 3.162 | 235.5780742 | 95.76177594 | 162 | 10 | 1551.34077 | 23.55780742 |\n| hab-c | 5 | 10 | 785.3981634 | 28165.93 | 0.294 | 4.412 | 611.5343835 | 173.8637799 | 162 | 15 | 1877.728823 | 40.7689589 |\n| hab-d | 1.25 | 2.5 | 12.2718463 | 715.69 | 0.125 | 1 | 7.853981634 | 4.417864669 | 162 | 3 | 238.5646921 | 2.617993878 |\n| hab-e | 3.75 | 1.25 | 115.6594266 | 7777.30 | 0.294 | 0.956 | 67.65140076 | 48.00802582 | 162 | 8 | 972.1625228 | 8.456425095 |\n| hab-f | 8.4375 | 1.5625 | 406.6151716 | 22456.69 | 0.294 | 1.2685 | 267.9936292 | 138.6215424 | 162 | 15 | 1497.112657 | 17.86624195 |\n| hab-g | 15.625 | 1.875 | 1084.307124 | 50767.51 | 0.294 | 1.581 | 770.9274452 | 313.3796789 | 162 | 20 | 2538.375399 | 38.54637226 |\n| hab-h | 23.75 | 2.5 | 2930.038807 | 105076.99 | 0.294 | 2.206 | 2281.415413 | 648.6233938 | 162 | 30 | 3502.566327 | 76.04718043 |\n\nNote that those are raw/dry masses, and only a rough calculation at the moment.  Any resources included would increase the total mass.\n\nCrew capacity still undecided;  what is listed there seems close to reasonable to me, though I would still rather not have 30 crew in a part.  Would much rather assume that the parts are very accommodating/fully equipped for the specified crew number, but have much lower crew capacity  (e.g. opposite of the stock hitchhiker, which is little more than 4 seats in a can with little/no accommodations).  Will certainly require more thought on the crew capacity end of things.\n\nWith this balance the largest torus still ends up at \u003E100t dry mass if setup as an inflatable... but I suppose it is a -very- large part.  If it were non-inflatable, I would probably give it a ~150-200t dry mass; more or less depending on if it were a hab or storage part (higher for hab due to living accommodations)."},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T18:54:43Z","Content":"To be honest, I think I\u0027d be happy with the largest torus being over 100 tons.  \n\nPersonally, I usually find the standard rocket classifications (Mass-to-LEO/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2 tons for \u0022small\u0022, 2-20 tons for \u0022medium\u0022, 20-50 tons for \u0022heavy\u0022, and 50-150 tons as \u0022superheavy\u0022) are pretty useful in KSP - 2 tons is plenty for most unmanned probes and Project Mercury/Gemini, Medium will give you enough for a one-kerbal direct ascent Mun lander, Heavy really starts to be needed for landing multiple crew and building significant space stations, or assembling interplanetary craft in orbit (but you can get by with a medium launcher if you\u0027re careful). Superheavies tend to be a luxury, useful mostly for modded parts (e.g., base parts, big nuclear reactors) and/or extravagant, late game missions that can afford to avoid orbit assembly.  \n\nIt also tends to be very difficult to build superheavies with 2.5m parts, so you\u0027re usually looking at the 3.75m and 5m diameter to open these up.  \n\nWith that in mind, a 100\u002B ton payload is fine I think. It\u0027s more than manageable in KSP generally, and means you need large-scale parts to launch it.  \n\nIt should also be really, really useful. If you are applying mod modifiers for counteracting gravity, then this should have an amazing modifier... but launching and propelling this is going to be a pain, as it should be.
