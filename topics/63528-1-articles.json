But, that being said, I\u0027ve probably still got a lot to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been addicted to mods for about 3 months, and even though there are some really awesome ones out there. I always feel like I\u0027m lacking a part that would be really useful or convenient. So, I was wondering if anyone could point me towards some decent tutorials for Blender, just to get me started. Or just give me a direction I should be heading towards, as far as creating things for KSP goes. I\u0027d like make some things that are tailored to the needs of a specific job, and possibly even release a part pack if I get to a point where I feel like they\u0027re good enough to release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, thanks for reading, everyone.
