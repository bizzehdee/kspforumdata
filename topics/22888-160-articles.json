Thats just a joke but the pack isn\u0027t that hard to navigate. The craft files are included in the download so I suggest using those at first to see where everything goes. Once you see how they work then you can play with them in other places. I will say look at the descriptions of the parts they are helpful about where to use parts and when all else fails these crafts really existed.
