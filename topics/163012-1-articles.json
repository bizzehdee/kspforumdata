Once they are outside their intended field of operation, they r rendered unable to do anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I think about what can be considered as sentience is an ability for a being to learn or adapt to a various condition. We, human, is a sentient being since we can adapt and respond appropriately to our environment. An AI that\u0027s considered as a sentient must be able to learn and adapt to different situation in order to make them able to operate without any user input and making decision on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it\u0027s still quite confusing about the ethical stuff when it comes to killing AI. For human standpoint, killing AI might be viewed as simply shutting it down or wiping out their memory, from AI standpoint, it\u0027s a flat-out murder. This is because we tend to view them as a tools or programs, created by humans, so we tend to devalue their existence as lifeless, not to mention that humans tend to think that \u0022I created you, so I have a right to kill you\u0022 as well as most AI that\u0027s being existed now lacks a real-life representation that give them an impression of being \u0022alive\u0022 than just a harddrive and computer screen. Now the question is, what will a sentient AI think about us? Do we just a mere organic creature in their eyes? A master? Or just a mere arrogant being that only just ordering them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, it depends from the point of view. A human killing an AI might not break any laws within human society, but might be sentenced to death by AI community. Same like if an AI killing a human, human society will respond to shutting down that AI... and probably all the other AI, even if they haven\u0027t commited any murder (mainly bcs human will obviously think \u0022this one is defect, so the others might become like this too\u0022) while the AI would try to defend themselves against that as a natural response like someone being sentenced to death bcs other human is killing others (its like we\u0027re being sentenced to death bcs humans are killing each other on the other side of the world)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to see how the AI and human relationship goes when each of them devaluated the life of each other, I suggest you watch this first (part 1):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0K6Cb1ZoG4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore this (part 2):\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNiO2sTe2wo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts actually a prelude of matrix series, but it should give you an idea what happen when both sides consider themselves sentient while consider the other as a mere tools/creature\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, please don\u0027t kill me, I\u0027m just an AI of orbital WMD satellite~ \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-08T02:22:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2017 02:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-08T02:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*this was a triumph\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-08T02:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming we do create artificial consciousnesses and outlaw their destruction, I\u0027ve always wondered how we\u0027ll handle a question that doesn\u0027t arise with organic consciousnesses: \u0022suspend\u0022 buttons.

\u00A0Why can\u0027t it reside as a simulated neuron inside a computer? \u00A0Why can\u0027t they all reside as simulated neurons inside a computer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, what it boils down to is that any mind is nothing but information. \u00A0There really isn\u0027t such thing as a \u0022simulated\u0022 mind. \u00A0That\u0027s like saying that the number seventeen that I write on a computer monitor is a\u00A0\u0022simulated\u0022 number seventeen, while the number seventeen that I write on a piece of paper is a \u0022real\u0022 seventeen. \u00A0No, they are both the number seventeen, they are just encoded in a different information storage medium.\u00A0\u00A0It doesn\u0027t matter whether it is composed of cells, or artificial cells, or the state of a flip-flop, or as electrons trapped on a floating gate field-effect transistor. \u00A0Information is information. \u00A0The number seventeen\u00A0is always just the number seventeen, there are not different kinds of number seventeens.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Likewise, I am an information pattern that is constantly changing. \u00A0It matters not at all what information storage and processing medium my information pattern is recorded on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, copying a mind is the same as writing a second number seventeen. \u00A0Now you have two number seventeens recorded. \u00A0Which is the \u0022real\u0022 or \u0022original\u0022\u00A0number seventeen is ridiculous question, because there is only one piece of information that is the number seventeen. \u00A0Yes, it can be instantiated multiple times, but every number seventeen is by definition exactly the same as any other number seventeen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about the soul? \u00A0Well, if\u00A0the soul DOES exist, and it is directing our actions, then the presence of a supernatural soul WILL be eventually scientifically proven at some point. \u00A0As neurologists map the brain and brain activity closer and closer, they will have to notice eventually that causality\u00A0is getting broken inside our heads. \u00A0Energy will not be conserved, for example, chemical compounds will found to miraculously be formed or broken with no energy lost or input from the outside environment.\u00A0 As you can probably tell, I find the concept of the supernatural soul pretty ludicrous, but you can\u0027t rule it out- yet. \u00A0We haven\u0027t looked closely enough at a thinking brain in action yet to show that everything within it follows the laws of physics, but why the heck would it not?!?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ESO, anyway, to answer the original question:\u003C/u\u003E To murder an AI would be to destroy its unique information pattern beyond practical recovery. \u00A0To simply suspend or disrupt the operation of its information pattern against its will\u00A0would be the same as physically assaulting a human and knocking him/her unconscious. \u00A0So you could destroy the computer that houses the AI and not really murder\u00A0it, as long as you just backed it up first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe do start running into thorny ethical questions when we start to operate multiple instantiations of a specific being\u0027s information pattern. \u00A0Initially, the two patterns would be essentially the same but as each was subjected to unique stimuli, they would start to diverge. \u00A0At the end point, you would clearly have two different, unique beings, so clearly at some ill-defined point you have to start considering each separate instantiation its own person. \u00A0So ethically and legally, it might be simplest to just not allow multiple copies of the same being to exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223118419\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499838802\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n24 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven in this case the law protects not animal\u0027s sentience, but human\u0027s feelings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI.e. still treats the animal like an object, significant for human subject.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnimals don\u0027t know what\u0027s \u0022cruelty\u0022, they just eat each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the same argument, laws\u00A0against child abuse are just to protect other\u0027s feelings, not the child\u0027s feelings. \u00A0You can\u0027t prove that children have sentience. \u00A0Of course, that\u0027s ridiculous. \u00A0People enact laws against animal cruelty for the same reason we enact laws against child abuse: it is insanely obvious that all animals, human or otherwise, have feelings, and it makes us feel bad when we see them suffer. \u00A0The fact that it makes us feel bad doesn\u0027t take away from the fact \u003Cu\u003Ethat it makes us feel bad because we recognize that animals have sentience, \u003C/u\u003Eand we empathize with an animal in distress or pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-12T06:18:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2017 06:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by -Velocity-\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T06:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223118426\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499839811\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274097\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022-Velocity-\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, -Velocity- said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou\u0027re constantly dying and being reborn as a different person. \u00A0That does not match our real-life experience of consciousness at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, there is sleep.
