This has happenes sometimes, when I go to space center, leaving a vessel on the mun or in orbit around kerbin, and then return both through flying the vessel in the radar station and when I try to rendevouz with the vessel in orbit. It looks fine until I get within about 200 meters. As I approached, it started flying in a random direction speeding passed me, with target m/s increasing. This made me break and reverse, which made the target vessel glitch back to where it was. I tried approaching it again, but this time it exploded as I got within randomly 200 meters. It isn\u0027t a gigantic station. In fact it is only a couple of pods and some containers, and the still attached rocket that broughy it into orbit. The weird thing is, this vessel does not explode, when I fly it through radar [Edit: I just flew it again, and it does explode]. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the mods I\u0027m using: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActiveTextureManagement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBAE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnectedLivingSpace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2Essentials\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModRocketSys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASAmission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearFutureProps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothkeSerCom\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCSBuildAid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShipManifest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceY-Lifters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStationPartsExpansion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStationScience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure where to find the version numbers for them, however, I assume they are all up to date, since they where all downloaded within this passed week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T13:55:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 01:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Faergen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
