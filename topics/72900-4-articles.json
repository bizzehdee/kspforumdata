This requires a one-time conversion from the old method to the new method and I\u0027m a little worried about releasing this too widely. I would like to get a few more people to test this out, ideally coming from v6 (or earlier), from v7, and starting out fresh. Any resource scanning that you have from earlier releases of v7 will be lost \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E, but regular SCANsat data should be recovered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis release also implements Kethane resource scanning (Kethane and Ore, from Extraplanetary Launchpads, for now), so I would also like some feedback from users with and without Kethane installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe package includes the updated SCANsat.dll file, the SCANsatKethane.dll (necessary for all Kethane scanning), the OpenResourceSystem_1_1_0.dll (which \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E be included somewhere in your GameData folder), and four Module Manager configs. These include scanners for the two default Kethane sensors, EPL\u0027s ore magnetometer, all three KSPI resource scanner modules, and the Modular Kolonization System scanners (ORS-type only, I\u0027m not sure what the story on continued Kethane support for these resources is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MM configs aren\u0027t necessary for displaying existing Kethane data on a SCANsat map, but they are necessary for all background scanning and for any kind of scanning with ORS resources. The Kethane grid doesn\u0027t update nicely after background scanning. You have to push the \u0022Rebuild Kethane\u0022 button on the big map, then either save/load, cycle the grid on/off from the map view, or maybe just wait a while for the grid to update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if anyone runs into any bugs, especially as concerns recovering old scanning data and any problems when playing without Kethane installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can count me in. i would be glad to help any way i can\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T19:58:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy to help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T20:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis all seems to be working fine.
