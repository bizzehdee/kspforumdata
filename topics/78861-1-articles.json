By pushing it back, using the kerbal EVA jetpack?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have some pictures. Where my space ship was at the Mun, during my rescue operation. What had happen was rather embarrassing. I made the corrections need to get back to kermin. However, I did not account for the Mun to pull me back. So I ran out of fuel. Had a kerbal inside and some scientific data I wanted. So my bright Ideal was to spend nearly 2 1/2 hour. Pushing the space ship back. What gave me this idea? I started to think about what you would do. If your car ran out of gas not far from your home. In my case I would just push it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So by channeling Jebediah, I manage to push the rocket all the way home. (Succesfully)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The second question is simple. Should this technique be called the Jebediah maneuver?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stranded in space, no fuel, and carrying very important scientific data. The kerbal scientist scramble to find away to recover the rocket and Kerbal. However, Jebediah Kermin was tired of listening to the science geeks. So took matters into his own hand. When he started to push his rocket back home. Scientist tried yelling at Jeb, only to find he had cut communication. After several hours of watching the trail and clock. All the scientist were struck dumb when it worked. Several scientist retired that day, while others still deny it being possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb only had this to say. \u0022Eh?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb had gone home with his beautiful wife.
