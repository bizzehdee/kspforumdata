In .90, it would remember my joystick settings, so I could plug in the joystick later (even during flight!) and it would immediately work. I game on a laptop, so it\u0027s not feasible to have my joystick plugged in all the time, and I constantly have to re-setup my control settings when I forget and start Kerbal first.\n\nJoystick: T-flight Hotas X.\n\nFixes/Workarounds:\n\nDon\u0027t unplug the joystick"}]}
