The killer is the temperature -- around 462 degrees Centigrade (862 Fahrenheit).

On the other hand, getting down should be very, very easy. Terminal velocity is low enough to land softly without propulsive landing or even parachutes. (The earliest Russian Venera Venus surface probes died before reaching the surface because the descent under parachute took so long that the batteries were exhausted before reaching the surface. Later Venera probes used parachutes to slow down -- then cut the chutes 50 km up and floated down to a soft landing without a parachute.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd did I mention the atmosphere contains sulfuric acid clouds?

Slowing down is easy -- imagine the overpowered KSP airbrakes -- except it really works on Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce down, almost immediately you\u0027ll need to grab your surface sample, and ascend back up. Probably some sort of lighter than air system would be best. An inflated balloon should be able to get you up in the atmosphere pretty quickly, above a lot of the pressure and heat.
