KSP\u0027s Eve is a cakewalk be by comparison.\n\nWhile Eve\u0027s atmospheric pressure of 5 atmospheres causes Kerbaldom severe rocketry problems, the real life Venus\u0027s atmospheric pressure is a staggering 92 atmospheres. Pushing a rocket upwards through that soup would require a lot of energy -- or a completely different ascent strategy.\n\nAnd you need to build your entire spacecraft like a submarine, with a reinforced pressure hull to keep the whole thing from imploding.\n\nHowever, dealing with the atmospheric pressure is probably the EASY part. The killer is the temperature -- around 462 degrees Centigrade (862 Fahrenheit). Typical solder melts at 183 C or 361 F, so you\u0027re going to have trouble with electronics -- and probably everything else, too.\n\nIf you can solve the temperature problem -- and that\u0027s a HUGE \u0022if\u0022 -- I imagine you would want to make use of the dense atmosphere to ascend by using either wings or some sort of balloon. On the other hand, getting down should be very, very easy. Terminal velocity is low enough to land softly without propulsive landing or even parachutes. (The earliest Russian Venera Venus surface probes died before reaching the surface because the descent under parachute took so long that the batteries were exhausted before reaching the surface. Later Venera probes used parachutes to slow down -- then cut the chutes 50 km up and floated down to a soft landing without a parachute.)\n\nAnd did I mention the atmosphere contains sulfuric acid clouds? Yet one more challenge to be overcome.\n\nGiven the extreme temperatures, if you wanted a surface sample, it would need to be a very fast mission. No loitering on the ground. We know how to get down -- pre-chill the spacecraft before deorbit, brake in the upper atmosphere, then use very low drag descent systems to get down quickly. Slowing down is easy -- imagine the overpowered KSP airbrakes -- except it really works on Venus.\n\nOnce down, almost immediately you\u0027ll need to grab your surface sample, and ascend back up. Probably some sort of lighter than air system would be best. An inflated balloon should be able to get you up in the atmosphere pretty quickly, above a lot of the pressure and heat. Then some soft of rocket or rocket/plane combination to get you the rest of the way to space and give you orbital velocity.\n\nIn KSP, almost every problem is a matter of getting enough delta V. On Venus, however, survival is the biggest problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T08:10:36Z","Content":"You might want to ask a moderator to move your thread to the [Science Forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/45-The-Science-Labs).

Ponder how difficult it is to land on Eve and return, how much the engines are penalized. Realise that Eve has about 5 times the atmospheric pressure of Kerbin. Now visualize the fact that Venus has 92 times the atmospheric pressure of Earth. Oh, and by the way, that air is boiling at 500\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, and it is raining concentrated acid.

Even bigger than a Mars sample return. In the concept I linked, they try an [Apollo-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit_rendezvous) mission, with a separate Venus orbiter/return vehicle, and Venus lander/ascent vehicle. The ascent uses three stages of solid rocket, and gets launched from a balloon, inflated with helium from tanks. I guess, given the [very thick atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus), a giant balloon would be cheaper than a rocket powerful enough to push through the soup.\n\nGetting a sample-drilling machine to work at the surface would be a major challenge. Silicon IC\u0027s won\u0027t work at the high temperatures of the Venus surface. You\u0027d need either a very heavy, inefficient refrigeration system, or a very fast surface mission packed with ice, or a new / exotic type of high-temperature electronics. \n\nThe overall mission size isn\u0027t bad -- they think it could be launched with a single Delta IV M\u002B (the single-core with SRB\u0027s -- smaller than the three-core \u0027heavy\u0027.
