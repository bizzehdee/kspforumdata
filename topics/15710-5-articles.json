The parachutes we have are calibrated to land a command pod, and perhaps a little bit of extra weight (like an ASAS module, however heavy that is), on Kerbin. So even if your just landing a command pod on this new planet (so nothing to get you home), a chute isn\u0027t going to cut it. At least not the ones we have now. Your going to need a retro burning engine, or wings and probably an engine to keep your speed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI align the Mun when I launch because of my prefered method of getting there, and it would be very expensive if the Mun was at any other point.

Each stage of my rockets is designed for a specific part of the flight, with what is intended to be a little bit of extra built in, in case a stage has problems or I mess up, so it\u0027s not uncommon to be jetessoning a little bit of extra fuel once that stage is no longer able to be useful (normally once a given configuration is too heavy, and I need something more maneuverable). However, launching to a planet on the other side of the system would certainly not be optimal.
