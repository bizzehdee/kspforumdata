I regret nothing!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a mod could do this, make the user control that is. However, if the mod changed the default style it would only apply to mods who are using the default style exclusively.\u00A0 The GUI I made for AGM uses almost entirely custom text styles, largely because I hate all green text... it makes my eyes hurt.\u00A0 I did however carefully choose colors already used by KSP, so it does match.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity 5 also has Asset bundles which also adds another problem as I don\u0027t think those use the styles.
