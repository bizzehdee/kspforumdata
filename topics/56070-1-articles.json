That\u0027s really great and it is going to be the first time that there is a reason to have a station besides refueling and a few other very specific uses. The one failing I see here is that this is a one size fits all solution. The removes the need to build a complex station, it keeps us at skylab levels of complexity. I\u0027d like to encourage ISS levels of complexity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about a specialized lab? Use tweakable settings or make the separate parts so that we can launch labs that specialize in one field of science and get a bigger percentage of our total science. Maybe there are certain science points thatcan ONLY be earned through such a lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I could launch a weather lab. This lab could only improve results from certain sensors, lets say thermometer, barometer, and atmo-samlper but it would improve them beyond what a normal lab could. Then I would have a reason to launch more labs, house more crew, and collect more energy which would lead to a use for larger space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T00:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see how to increase the complexity of the lab without also increasing the complexity of the science system.

So, a single lab module might give, e.g., 10% bonus. Two modules, 20%. Three, 40%. Etc. It would probably need to be capped or have diminishing returns, I guess. So maybe: 1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 10%, 2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 15%, 3 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 18%, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all for having different types of modules as well.

Some sort of training facilities at KSC, give them more attributes than just courage and stupidity, build on the attributes with a combination of training and experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.23 labs look do like a cool step in the right direction.

Maybe additional modules could be added to the lab that\u0027s coming in 0.23 and would each require one additional Kerbal to crew them. So a full station ends up including the main lab and three more modules with whatever it takes to power it all, plus five total Kerbals for a full crew. A lab shouldn\u0027t just increase transmitted value though. It should increase the base value of an experiment because it\u0027s happening in a better facility in microgravity. So if you get a full lab up and running, you could repeat previous experiments, but with better results because of better equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
