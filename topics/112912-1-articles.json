But What about polar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a nice group of contracts right now for setting up a satellite in polar orbit, and a RT2 interplanetary relay. I think they will work good together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit I am asked to get is a roughly circular, roughly Mun sized orbit (12M by 7M), and is polar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two main questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I am not sure how long a mun/minmus eclipse would last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Right now the orbit looks like it would never be eclipsed by Kebin. But I suppose relative to the sun the orbit will rotate around and eventually be getting eclipses? And these will be really long as I am quite far out. So the only solution is a highly eccentric orbit? Where I am high over one pole and very low over another? Do I just not even worry about battery power then, as it going to be out of position for most of the solar system then anyways?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELowing my P in a high orbit should be easy, I am imagining, as I am already traveling slow relative to a smaller orbit, so less V to negate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible for an orbit to be so eccentric that while your P is above 73K, the sides of the orbit are actually closer to the planet? An orbit that is 12 million KM wide and less than 140K tall?

The other solution is just to have 4 of them on the same polar orbit high enough, and \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E preparing for the night time - in this case, at least one pair of opposite satellites will work regardless of the night time and then you\u0027ll have full coverage for relay.

You probably don\u0027t want your relay satellite to get too high, as the long range dish antenna has a really small cone angle. Say for connection to Duna when you use 88-88 (it already has the largest angle among those that can reach Kerbin), because of the closest distance between Kerbin and Duna, if you point your Duna satellite to target Kerbin (not a specific satellite), then you need your relay satellite\u0027s Ap to be \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125218-How-close-does-Duna-get-to-Kerbin?p=2014398\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2014398\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eless than 6Mm\u003C/a\u003E in order for the relay satellite to accessible from the satellite orbiting Duna.
