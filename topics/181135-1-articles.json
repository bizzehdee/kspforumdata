I have a Mun rocket I\u0027ve already successfully ran several missions with - but when I fired up KSP today, I ended up spending \u003Ci\u003Esix\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0hours\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0without a single mission actually reaching Kerbin orbit because it just doesn\u0027t seem to want to work the way I used it before. Maybe I\u0027m messing up the ascent, but I\u0027m not sure.

So instead I hung a number of girders off the tricoupler\u0027s exact center (offset tool until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid showed zero engine torque), onto which I attached three extended radial decouplers that clip through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks to the outside.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis stage is capable of outputting a max-throttle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.7 up until 81.88 tons.

My problems with this are twofold. First, if I deviate more than about 3-4\u00B0 away from prograde, the rocket starts rolling. Not flipping due to lack of stability, rolling around its lengthwise axis\u00A0in a clockwise direction, turning the pitch into yaw,\u00A0which introduces an inclination change, which causes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to start yawing in the opposite direction, which makes the roll even worse until it eventually stabilizes. If I turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, it keeps rolling for about ten more seconds before stabilizing.\u00A0I\u0027ve noticed this on other rockets before, but they all started rolling at far bigger \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, never this soon. Because of this, I\u0027m having a hard time doing a proper gravity turn, only managing\u00A0to turn 20\u00B0\u00A0before hitting the target apoapse. I\u0027ve spent\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehours\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0trying to figure out why this is so. The rocket\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stable (barely) with the winglets it has and adding more winglets doesn\u0027t help. Launching without the SRBs doesn\u0027t help either. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid indicated a ~5-6 kN torque which I fixed by nudging around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks on the booster (they weren\u0027t centered properly, for some reason). Now I still have a torque of 0.6 in the science payload, but that\u0027s not it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich leads me to my second issue. Even once I dropped the transfer stage\u0027s radial tanks to reduce drag, I\u0027m still losing so much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E during takeoff that it costs me about 4000 m/s to circularize at my usual parking orbit of 120 km. While the transfer stage still has more than enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left for a munar encounter, it doesn\u0027t have enough left afterwards for me to deorbit it into the Mun like I\u0027ve done with my previous launches of this design. Yet when I tried reducing my apoapse to 80 km as per the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map, I hit apoapse so quickly that I ended up 30 seconds late at starting the circularization burn. I\u0027m losing a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecolossal amount\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E somewhere, I just don\u0027t know where.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then, what are my options? The booster stage still has a few tons of weight capacity left, should I use that to give the booster stage more fuel? That solves the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget issue, but what about the rolling?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and ever since I switched the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E mounting from a regular decoupler to an extended one, the SRBs are pitching inwards after separation and hit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks if the rocket isn\u0027t aiming perfectly prograde, despite me having mounted them literally at the bottom of the decoupler to center the decoupler force on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. I even offset the SRBs one notch lower, no difference. When I was using the regular decoupler, mounting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E on the very bottom caused it to separate without pitching, why isn\u0027t this the case with the extended decoupler?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-05T02:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the rolling, the KSP control algorithms are kinda bad when it comes to 3-way symmetry.

If I just attach parts on the tricoupler\u0027s triplet attachment nodes, there\u0027s torque, but if I select them with an offset tool and click on any of the arrows (not drag, just click), the torque in this stage goes to zero. So KSP isn\u0027t placing them properly. The booster stage and the transfer stage are torque-free: rotating them with the rotation tool changes neither the strength nor the direction of the torque. If I rotate the service bay with the science payload, however, it rotates the torque\u0027s direction too. Rotating anything underneath that service bay doesn\u0027t change anything.\u00A0So the torque is definitely at that bay.
