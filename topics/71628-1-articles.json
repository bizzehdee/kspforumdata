As the rocket get built, could the physics be combined for the craft as a while instead of individually. Understandably this would require a rewriting of some of the physics coding. But as we all know, when the part counts get higher, it takes much longer to process, and drops the frame rates horribly. So instead of modeling 200 parts, the craft would be modeled as 1 part, and as the stages are released, the weight, density, and aerodynamics would change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports would be an exception though. Since a docking port connected to a docking port isn\u0027t a structural connection, it would act as quote breaking point in the part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust as a suggestion though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T02:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of combining parts so that they\u0027re handled as one part by the physics engine is one that has come up several times in the past -- so many, in fact, that we had to put it on our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E so that the Suggestions forum wouldn\u0027t get absolutely swamped with them.
