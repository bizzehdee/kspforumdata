My computer died and we didn\u0027t get a new one until just the other day. So I finally have KSP again! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) and I jumped 2 updates, from .24 to .90, so It\u0027s taking a bit to get used to, but it\u0027s amazing. Also it\u0027s a pretty decent computer with an i5 in it. Glad we got this computer before 1.0. Also, tomorrow I\u0027m getting my own laptop (this desktop is my parents) and this laptop is even better, with an 8 core i7 and a geeforce GT 720 or something similar.

I got that laptop for $499. it cost $1350 new, so I never would\u0027ve imagined getting a computer like it, but we got it at a computer refurbishing place. This guy turned his house into a computer store and refurbishes computer equipment. So if you are looking for an upgrade, my advice is to find a small computer shop like that, maybe trade in your old rig and get a refurbished computer. You might just end up with a better computer than the one I mentioned earlier! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T19:33:19Z","Content":"Should\u0027ve asked me to build ya one.
