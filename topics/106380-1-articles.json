I did a little happy dance when I saw that mentioned in the 1.0 changelog. Is going to open up an awful lot of modding potential with regards to the building upgrades ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, Nathan. Where can I find information on this class? I don\u0027t see it in the reference [here](http://anatid.github.io/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/annotated.html).\n\nIf you\u0027re using visual studio you can use the object browser to view the declarations of all the public and protected members of the class that you can override, which I think is all the documentation that would be available to any of us at this point. The function names should be pretty self-explanatory though (I remember looking at them when 0.9 came out and wishing they were virtual).\n\nThere\u0027s only a handful of modders that focus on career mode (myself included) so documentation tends to be rather sparse, since it\u0027s all pretty much community written. If you have any specific questions though, feel free to ask and I\u0027ll see if I can help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T03:51:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"}]}
