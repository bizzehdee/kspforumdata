I told him that I was pretty sure that more repairable parts were planned, but it got me thinking...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really dislike the way wheel repairs work, it just feels so abstract and easy, but I do think more difficult repairs on a wider variety of parts could make a really interesting addition to the game. So I came up with this idea, which I think would be fairly easy to implement:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Certain parts are marked as \u0022repairable\u0022 (wheels, panels, whatever seems logical and balanced).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. All repairable parts have a grab-point(s) like ladders do.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. In order to repair a part, an EVA Kerbal must grab it first.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would make repairs non-trivial (and therefore interesting), without making them too difficult. And if you wanted to add a repair animation later, you could do that pretty easily since the Kerbal is already attached to the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
