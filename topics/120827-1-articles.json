It is a 60T overkill beauty, because it is the Kerbal way. Getting it to LKO was a challenge. After several adjustments (otherwise known as revert to VAB), made it. Did the transfer burn to Mun. Landed about 1km from Mun Base Alpha. It was supposed to be closer but it happens. While the drills were doing their thing, I bracket switched to a nearby scout ship equipped with scanners. It was landed very close to the base. As the scene appeared on the screen, I watched my base explode skyward then crash into the Mun surface leaving a trail of debris everywhere. F9 why didn\u0027t I remember F9? So the base is gone. Yeah, yeah, I know, it serves me right for using HyperEdit to set it there in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am guessing this was caused by physics being applied to the sprawling high piece count base. So, is there a mod that applies scene physics gradually so this doesn\u0027t happen?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T20:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement helps, but only so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
