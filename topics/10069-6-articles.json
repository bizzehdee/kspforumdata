Yet, we gladly explore anyway!\n\nThe intrepid vessel, *Minmus Peak VIII*, reached this pinnacle and measured its altitude at 5283 meters.\n\nAlong the way, we discovered yet again just how strange this planetoid can be. As we began to approach the summit, we noticed a tiny vibration beneath our feet. The vibration felt much like the tectonic tremors on our homeworld, except for being a series of singular impulses and extremely regular. We measured the period of the vibration to be nearly 21 seconds. Even more unusual was the way the amplitude of the vibration apparently increased as we gained altitude. By the time we found the summit of Minmus Peak, the tiny tremors had become substantial jolts, sending our craft (and ourselves) up to seven meters above the ground!\n\nBecause of this strange, regular, tremor, I propose this location not be named Minmus Peak, but rather *Heart of Minmus*.\n\nI made a video of the phenomenon. Unfortunately, YouTube is being uncooperative today. Hopefully I can rectify this tomorrow."},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T07:20:32Z","Content":"And the altitude?!?!?\n\nWhat a cliff hanger!\n\nMy computer fried itself so ive been out of action last week and this week.
