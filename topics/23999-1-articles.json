When I typed numbers in the input boxes of the dialog, things worked fine. When I wanted to backspace or delete stuff from the input box, that worked, but those keys also performed their primary function in the same time (reset focus and docking view, respectively). This led to much hilarity, especially when I tried to input decimal numbers, which use \u0027.\u0027 and I warped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong, or is this a known issue of some kind with MechJeb?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macbernick","CreatedById":57485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T09:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a known Unity feature.
