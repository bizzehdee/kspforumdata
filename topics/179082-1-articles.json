I\u0027ve discovered that it was none of the mods I installed, as I removed them all to test. What I found was that any UI scaling above 170% on my 4K monitor would cause some UI elements to disappear, this included the currencies on the space center screen, as well as the UI for any mods that used the KSP skin instead of the unity smoke skin. At 170% scaling the UI elements appear broken with only parts of them appearing on screen. The highest scaling I can set without UI glitches is 160%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
