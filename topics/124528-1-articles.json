Do any of them actually decrease the resource utilization of the game or improve performance over unmodded installs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, obviously there are the extreme (and obvious) viewpoints about mods out there and while I fully respect and value your opinions and your rights to play completely unmoddded or with nothing left of stock, what I\u0027m really looking for here is input from the folks who are somewhere in the middle. So please don\u0027t post the extreme view points (we all already know that some of you don\u0027t need no stinking mods while others of you would prefer to mod it til it crashes, fix it, then mod it some more... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ll start with my own story: I\u0027m currently running about 44 AVC mods installed by CKAN and maybe 5-10 more that CKAN doesn\u0027t handle. Most of the mods I have installed are pretty stable and the modding community here seems to be very supportive. However, so far I have found that they do have impacts on performance and I have removed a few because they seemed to make the game slower or less stable. I have yet to find a mod that significantly improves stability or resource utilization. My philosophy leans a bit more to the mod it til it crashes end of the spectrum, but I have also removed some mods because they seemed to break the game - like one that has a big command pod that includes engines, fuel, control torque, and rcs to provide a one-part, 4-kerbal (or was it 6?) with awesome TWR and 5-6k deltaV... yeah... I don\u0027t play this game because I want to make it THAT easy... Ok - that\u0027s me... what about you guys? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T22:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMod it \u0027til it crashes\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...except that KSP crashes even when not modded, so forget that actually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T23:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer to the question is, when the game crashes all the time or starts getting much crappier performance, that\u0027s too many. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very hard to generalize because different mods have radically different footprints and stability.

If your game is messed up, delete mods until it\u0027s not messed up any more. A good rule of thumb is that fewer is always better, all other things being equal, so don\u0027t install a mod unless you actually, specifically have a need for it.
