I think its not enough to have more ways of generating science points. Collecting science should impact the gameplay much more than it currently does. At moment science is just used to unlock the tech tree. It has much more potential than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start a game, you know almost nothing about the kerbol system. All you know is their orbits and their masses and a rough image, like a very low resolution texture.
