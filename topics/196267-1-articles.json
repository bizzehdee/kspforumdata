I tried downloading KSP 1.10 on my Mac book pro with version Mac OS Catalina and it didn\u2019t work and got stuck loading about 3/4 of the way through. I also tried downloading 1.9 but that didn\u2019t work either as the screen started flickering. Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, how can I fix it? Thanks, really appreciated. I need 1.10.
