Still think that jumping straight to 1.0 from alpha (.90 wasn\u0027t a real beta, not with the number of new systems planned for the next update) isn\u0027t the best decision, hopefully Squad will prove me wrong and release an amazing 1.0 that is balanced and bug free.\n\nKind of disappointed with the secret project, not because being able to upload a craft file and have it 3D printed isn\u0027t awesome but because the price (minimum $99) is way too high for a fragile model with no moving parts. Now if there was a KSP building set where I could snap the parts together and rebuild the rocket whenever I felt like it (and go out and buy new parts to add to it) I would be all over it for that price. At least the KSP papercraft templates let me build a rocket however I want (including multiple stages) for a much better price.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T00:37:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T00:14:09Z","Content":"Four pages already?

Updating to a new Unity version would be a non-trivial task. \u0022Close enough to the release date to not to want to upgrade Unity\u0022 isn\u0027t a very high bar. Even if the release was still a month or so off that would still be too close.

As much progress as is being made (great stuff, by the way ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)), it is important to remember that there is no real rush. The community still gets an update so it\u0027s really all the same. All the same except for critic reviews; it has been said before that this game would be shredded to pieces by critics as a result of its high memory usage. With that in mind, I personally believe that implementing the current developmental features and THEN doing another update to patch/tweak/optimize whatever is required is still the best course of action.

As we\u0027ve seen already Unity has a fairly large share of its own bugs that the dev team has likely developed workarounds for, and with a major new engine release (not just an incremental bugfix) there are likely to be many new bugs in Unity that will require another incremental bugfix. There\u0027s nothing in the current version of Unity that\u0027s really holding the game back (64-bit windows support notwithstanding), it\u0027s best at this point for Squad to focus on finishing their game (especially balance and bugfixing) and wait for any major issues with Unity 5 to be worked out before updating."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T00:59:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think when you are starting out with KSP, \u0022experiential learning\u0022 is a fun part of the game.
