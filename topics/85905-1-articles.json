Do you use the RSS ratios and scale down? Do you just make it up and test until failure? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, in terms of the Earth based universe, my telescope would weight 363 kg. I could choose between 232-273kg depending on which ratio I go for. It isn\u0027t a lot of a difference ... and in the perspective of the MORE BOOSTER universe we play in, it would make no difference at all ... I think. Maybe furthermore, I would position my part relatively early in the tree (pre 2m parts), but again, it isn\u0027t like the early engines aren\u0027t quite capable of lifting much larger payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about costs?
