Looking at real planets beats looking at made up ones every day. I had a small refractor when I was a kid and I used to go and stand on the shed roof most nights looking at the stars etc. Now I have a Helios 6\u0022 refractor but I havent really used it much yet. Yes the best thing I saw was Saturn, although the moon and Jupiter are great as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a very good choice for the cloudy nights! What about making a reusable space craft with an internal bay and launching a made up space telescope from it into high Kerbin orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T21:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat Jaedinator said. I\u0027m also doing a Duna base thing atm which has a kethane mining component. Kethane is just a great mod, if you can\u0027t think of anything to do, set up a mining outpost somewhere and an orbital refuelling station. That should keep you occupied for a while and when resources come in stock you\u0027ll already be pro at mining and shuttling fuel into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eget remote tech, set up a local satellite network round Kerbin (easy) then extend it to reach another planet (slightly more tricky). you have to work with signal delay ie the craft won\u0027t respond to your controls for a couple minutes but the remote tech flight computer helps you plan for that. Then attempt to land a craft under remote control (ie with signal delay). I\u0027ve not actually tried that last part as I recon it will be difficult but a good challenge and I\u0027m sure someone has done it. Duna would prob be ok as you can rely on parachutes once you\u0027ve done a deorbit burn, I\u0027d give much respect to anyone landing on Ike with signal delay!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
