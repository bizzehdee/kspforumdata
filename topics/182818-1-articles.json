My vehicle was a mk2 shuttle with an external tank and its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was a little low after the separation of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s (about 0.8-0.9). However I noticed that the AP continued to rise even with such a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. I then continued with a launch profile where I tried to keep the AP within a minute away. I had the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in about 0.9-1.1\u00A0during much of the ascent. All the time my AP was rising. I assume this is because as I increase my horizontal speed the ground \u201Cfalls\u201D away from me even if my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is below 1.0. Is this the way it works?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I got a stable orbit around 95km but I was wondering that such a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E during a ascent\u00A0is probably not the most efficient way of launching (previous test run with about 1.5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E gave a 250km orbit). What kind of ratio should I aim at after the separation of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if it wasn\u2019t the most efficient profile it was a real pleasure getting a nice\u00A0orbit with such a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E!
