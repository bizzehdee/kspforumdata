I\u0027ll fix that in just a sec...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe config node typo ensures that the RSS powerCurve gets put in the module and not in the part itself. (I probably should have seen that happening before but it\u0027s hard to read everything in the debug screen)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT. There is another change and that\u0027s to the powerCurve keys in the RSS settings file. When you were walking over the parts and replacing the powerCurve in solar panel module it\u0027s not loading the keys in properly. The original fix I put out worked ok by converting the first set of parameters to exp notation. I don\u0027t know why that wasn\u0027t enough when RSS loaded the keys in itself. I had to convert the second set of parameters too and that apparently fixed it. floatCurve.Load() seems to have problems that the config manager does not.... oh and it doesn\u0027t like comments in the powerCurve keys either so I got rid of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ok, just double checked and the only other change I made was some now-unnecessary debugging stuff. It\u0027s not important. Just fixed the typos, converted all key values into exponential notation and removed the comments. And also put back in the 3rd and 4th parameters since I had no idea at that point what was going on and didn\u0027t know if those values missing were maybe causing this somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, summary on the settings file is that powerCurve.Load() doesn\u0027t like comments and for some reason was misinterpreting keys/values if they weren\u0027t all in exp notation (if the range key was too high?)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T06:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T06:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.

First I found the planets were actually quite under wieght as well as being small so the densities actually work out to realistic values. Kerbol\u0027s mass was scaled up since the default mass is to small to actually create a fusion reaction for a star. The size is the same as our Sun but that can be changed without affection to much right now. Down the road that might affect angualr momentum converstaion in the systenm but for now we can ignore. Don\u0027t know what do about tilt values. Using kelpers 3rd law I filled in the new ortibal periods of the planets and moons as they would be in real life if the kerbal system existed. The big difference you will noticed is for the tidally locked moons of Jool. The longs orbit/rotation is now 33 days is you can end up in the dark for many days so prepare your batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As for the rotation periods their is no standard formula for that. The best you can do work out the conservation of angular momentum for planet moon systems. You will noticed the planets without natural satellites have very long rotations since they don\u0027t have a lot of excess energy. The closer the moon the shorter the period of rotation of the planet. So the 6 hour period for kerbal is not unreasonable. With that amount of energy in the kerbin mun system I would imagine lots of tectonic plate action of earthquakes, volcanoes, and pretty intense tides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.infradead.org/~jsimmons/RealSolarSystem.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.infradead.org/~jsimmons/RealSolarSystem.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T01:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot a mock MESSENGER mission working:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/f5HcX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
