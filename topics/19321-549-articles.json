Your example is easily replicable. Mine, on the other hand, is strange enough to make it hard. It at least starts with creating a stack of short span, body length wings and then the problems start from there. I did finally throw together a test. I recreated the problem craft with more small wings stuck together. I didn\u0027t recreate the exact geometry but I got close enough. The canards I used are from the first try at the original, the body is exactly the same (started from the same craft file). the new plane actually flies straight, returns to 0 roll without input, and pitches up without roll(although yaw still needs work). The mass of both planes are close, 148t problem, 146t new. ref area is 216 m2 vs 179 m2, scaled chord 6.05 vs 3.5, scaled span 2.83 vs 2.65. with those numbers the problem plane should fly much better. More span, more wing area and such for the same mass, right?

But, what I know is that data for PW is calculated in different way than it is for stock a like wing parts. For stock wings it is enough to provide data in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch like it is described at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E github page. It might involve importing to blender to get more accurate data for it. PW use plugin to provide those data to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E each time you change shape, length or width of wing. I can only assume that equation involved in this provide similar but not exactly same results. Info about it is buried somewhere in PW code, I bumped by accident on it while looking for something else on github page and there was recent change on that part of code in pull request. People involved in development of PW can tell more about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, some differences from stock part can be expected, but is difference is really that much ? If you use PW on both sides of craft there will be no asymmetry in lift. There was issues in the past with PW symmetry, IIRC it happened along with KSP update to higher version, but that was solved long time ago. There was bug with wrong flap deflection on symmetry PW part too, but it is also solved, there is no longer issue with it in KSP 1.3.1 and latest available PW version on github.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWay too litle info is provided to tell exactly is it PW bug involved or not, I will not say exclusively that there is no any, but I can tell why I think that is not. While screenshot tells that there is asymmetry in lift, it does not tell good enough how much asymmetry is in wing weight for one side or another. It is hard to tell with eyeball and fuel tank as middle part is quite heavy compared to wing parts to figure out weight difference. On first sight I was thinking that PW is on left side, not on right side, but regardless, you need to have symmetric weight as much as possible to exclude it as possible reason of instability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor more accurate data use only lightweight as possible \u0022hull\u0022 part, make it as root part of craft, something like I-beam, truss part or hollow Mk1 struct part. Less weight as possible for that central part would give more accurate data. Then attach wings on such part and adjust weight so both sides weight the same. Put that aside or create subassembly of it. After that create craft using such adjusted parts when you are sure that there is no weight asymmetry involved. Another thing to consider is to get at least one structural part more on hull behind main wings, to make whole craft more sideslip/yaw stable. You need to test such things on stable craft designs in first place, to be able to tell if bug is involved or not. For now, based only on provided picture I can only speculate and tell that craft on picture is yaw instable and when you try to compensate yaw you usualy get \u0022parasite\u0022 roll involved too and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223247625\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002219321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513646839\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngrybobH\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, AngrybobH said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127158-kcs123/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022127158\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127158-kcs123/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@kcs123\u003C/a\u003E While I normally appreciate any opinion, even (or especially) if it proves me wrong, your post seemed kind of hostile. It also was not helpful in the slightest and gave me the impression you did not read what I had posted. As for the strange dihedral angles, the main wings don\u0027t have that that much and not out of line with other craft I have created that fly quite well. If you are referring to the center \u0022vertical\u0022 wings, the angle there is to dial out roll when yawing. Also, not strange or out of line with real world aircraft (see sr-71, f/a-18, F-4 \u003Cs\u003Eflying bandaid\u003C/s\u003E phantom, etc). And, finally, yes I create planes with aesthetics in mind for the original concept after, of course, intended purpose but, we all know(or should), that the difference in concept and the actual thing that works can be very different. This particular plane has been redesigned several times trying to dial out roll right under ALL circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAngrybobH, what part of my previous post you found to be \u0022hostile\u0022 ?

It is not always a case, you need to understand why some real life crafts looks like they looks in the first place and reasons behind it before you start to copy such designs. For example, SR-71 have anhedral or \u0022inwards\u0022 angle on vertical tail surfaces not due to better aerodynamic stability, but to help with radar \u0022stealth\u0022 performance by deflecting incoming radar beams upwards as much as possible instead to reflect it to beam source. It does not help to stability at all. A lot of other fighter planes you mentioned have anhedral tails on purpose to make it more maneuverable and that is often not on the same road as stable craft designs. Some of planes could not be controlable without help of fly by wire systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo improve craft on above picture you can do following things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nget rid of most vertical surfaces you have put there for aestetic reasons, especially those on bottom part of craft. Those only reduce tail clearance when comes to takeoff/landings.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPut light dihedral angle on main wing, 1-3 degree should be enough\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nput small vertical surfaces on wing tips strictly perpendicular to whole craft hull, not with wing. In comparison to main wing you should have 91-93 degree, but 90 degree in comparison to hull\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nleave only vertical tail surfaces that are above engine, you dont need ones in the middle at all, but make those above engines approximately 1.5 - 2X larger than those ion the middle currently are\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are only design flaws I was able to detect from provided pictures.

The second plane rolls right for no good reason without input at all speeds and rolls right with only pitch (up or down) input.
