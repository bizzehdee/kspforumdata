It does look very, very promising though, I hope you put together an entry.\u0022\n\nWell... then there\u0027s another rule that should need clarifying... Suppose I just slapped on another 4 \\*empty\\* 200-32 tanks (ie, 6 fold symetry around the orange tanks, instead of 2 fold) and then added FL-T800 tanks with symetry to the front and back... The empty tanks would barely affect the weight distribution on such a massive craft, but I could then pump all my leftover fuel into them... would they then count as payload?\n\nI wouldn\u0027t have been draining from those tanks, and the fuel pumped into them would of course have been deadweight the whole flight (unless you consider that it may have had a use in balancing the craft).\n\nBasically, can I put empty fuel tanks into my payload, and then pump remaining fuel from the lifter into them?\n\nAnyway... I designed this as a cargo carrier, so the CoM and CoL are right where the payload is, it flies just as well with the aeroshell empty. It shouldn\u0027t affect balance at all... it just makes estimating how much fuel to remove from the main tanks into a non-issue.\n\nI would hate to try and put 202 tons into orbit, but then fly a slightly worse ascent, and come up with a 69\\*70 orbit...\n\nI should be able to make the changes and try again tomorrow... and I can stop at a 70km orbit instead of 79x79.\n\nI\u0027m also wondering (if I\u0027m trying to maximize payload fraction), if it might be worth it to put some LV-Ns on it for the final circularization burns....\n\nBasically, I need to figure out how much of the burn can be done by LV-Ns...\n\nIf one part of the burn used 20 tons of fuel... if a pair of LV-Ns could do, they\u0027d be using 340(is the the new KR-2L Isp?)/800 = 8.5 tons... saving 11.5 tons at the expense of 6 extra tons of engines...\n\nI was already contemplating doing this, and had an idea where to stick the LV-Ns to not add to drag (see my post on interstage fairings not working in the SPH).\n\nIts worth noting that this desing wasn\u0027t designed with payload \\*fraction\\* in mind... but rather just \\*payload\\*\n\nI don\u0027t know if adding more jet engines can help, as I lose a lot of liquid fuel during ascent... with the need to ascend, dive past mach 1(since passing mach 1 will increase the engine output, and if it models it correctly, drag coefficient starts to drop post mach 1), level off, and ascend again- slowly at first but then to a 20 degree pitch.\n\nI\u0027m sure someone can beat this design... its still the early days of 1.0... but based on postings I\u0027ve seen so far... I do seem to have made the most progress with heavy cargo spaceplanes.\n\nStill.. maybe a small and light spaceplane will out-perform my behemoths...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:26:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:34:42Z","Content":"Excellent challenge!\n\n I\u0027m in the process of analyzing this very problem, and (like a dope) I left the results at work! ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\n Hopefully I won\u0027t brain-fart tomorrow and can submit a competitive entry.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:58:08Z","Content":"There should be a separate section for people using any kind of non-visual mod, IMO.\n\nWe got some nice entries here, that is cool.\n\nI went for a fixed design approach, to see how far I could get without changing it."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:02:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...Basically, can I put empty fuel tanks into my payload, and then pump remaining fuel from the lifter into them?...\n\nI would greatly prefer that entrants not do this, as it is not in the spirit of the challenge. Launching an empty tank as payload and simply transferring whatever fuel is remaining into it once orbit is established removes a large part of the challenge of designing the lifter and payload to match each other. The payload is meant to be inert and unchanged, and replaceable with some other non-fuel payload in the same spot with similar results. When drafting the challenge I considered specifying ore tanks as the payload to sidestep the issue but I felt this was too restrictive in very small and very large designs.\n\nOf course, I am not really able to police that rule effectively so I am depending on the honor system and honest competitive spirit of the participants to do it for me. Hopefully I won\u0027t be disappointed.\n\nAt any rate, I don\u0027t think this restriction is overly burdensome for you, your design looks like it will be very competitive and by the sound of it you\u0027re already enjoying thinking about how to best solve the problem. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There should be a separate section for people using any kind of non-visual mod, IMO.\n\nThis is primarily a design challenge, and an iterative one at that. Information mods reduce the tedium of calculation for those that want numbers, and autopilots like MechJeb or kOS provide repeatability and prevent good designers with more modest piloting skills from being penalized. The main objective is to discover how lean a lifter can be made with the stock parts and physics, not who can fly the best by the seat of their pants.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T23:08:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:56:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Radam, your entry is interesting but doesn\u0027t decouple its payload so I\u0027m afraid I must disqualify it.
