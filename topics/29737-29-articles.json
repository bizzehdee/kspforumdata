G-force alone isn\u0027t an issue, ever - the issue is the actual amount of stress, and that\u0027s already covered by structural failure. If applying 1MN of force to a full fuel tank doesn\u0027t break it, than applying 1MN of force to the fuel tank when it\u0027s empty shouldn\u0027t break it either. There are some exceptions, as always, but that\u0027s true in general. Structural failure should be all that\u0027s necessary, at least for unmanned crafts. I personally would like it if a plugin started restricting controls at higher accelerations if you had kerbals on board and no probe body, but straight G-force damage just makes things annoying without adding value to the mod, or at least that\u0027s what I\u0027ve found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs anyone working on a next version?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know.
