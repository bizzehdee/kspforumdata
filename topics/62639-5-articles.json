Some people may have tried to learn to fly in KSP via trial and error frustrating, and learn better when they can watch, in real time, MJ perform maneuvers they aren\u0027t capable of doing or doing well. Granted, MJ may not fly the most ideal of efficient maneuvers alot of times, it gets the job done in most cases, which allows the user to learn how to do these things. Once they are capble of emulating MJ, they can gain more experience and perhaps improve to beat MJs performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

I down loaded mechjeb strapped it to my rocket that I was going to dock with and shot it into orbit chasing down the first vessel. Watching MechJeb do the work for me of setting up the various steps and then executing them with something I built showed me exactly where my faults were and what I was ALSO doing right! Suffice it to say, it taught me how to dock efficiently, to the point where I can do it manually if I desire it.

Mechjeb is like that for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe equivalent of the attitude some people have on this forum towards mechjeb is like extreme mountainbikers complaining some people have training wheels on their bike or ride on the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Surely the most fun on a pushbike is going down a mountain with a 50/50 chance of survival. If you don\u0060t do that and have training wheels while you learn then that takes away the \u0060I acomplished something hard\u0060 feeling. Also the challenge of riding a pushbike.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people say the challenge is to to design bikes, some like to ride familiar paths, some like to do extreme mountainbiking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone are exclusively right and none are wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe problem with Mechjeb discussion on the forum comes when people say \u0022The way I play is the only valid way and the only way that deserves respect\u0022 or variations on that theme.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf people say \u0022I don\u0060t use mechjeb because for me (reasons) but I can see the value for some players\u0022 then that would not cause issue.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060m tired of the same Mechjeb discussion.
