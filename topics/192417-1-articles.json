That is why we call them experts of this or that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also realize that writing skills are actually more important than science in scifi, since scifi is primarily entertainment, not a science textbook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike knowing how to write engaging dialogue will either make or break a reader\u0027s interest in a given character. And I am learning it by giving myself\u00A0homework\u00A0and the process is intriguing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is good-bye. Finally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decide that I should only focus like a laser on my goals and what is necessary to achieve them. All else is waste, even if interesting at the time what good is it if it does not get me closer to the goals I desire and need to achieve?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will mean sacrifices. As much as I enjoy watching TV scifi (Babylon 5 mostly), I can and will get my goals acomplished without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith it? Impossible. Too much time lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there you have it folks. By the way, thank you for your knowledge, kindness, and generosity you have given me over the months I have been here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have given it, then you know who you are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per my usual, I leave music as a parting gift.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPdLu8GQprE?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime for me to go and do what I desire to do instead of merely desire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-14T23:40:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2020 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-15T15:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee you again in two weeks )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoninFrog","CreatedById":203049,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-15T20:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Doesn\u0027t read post and watches video with volume off]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s with all the random lights exploding?\u00A0 Dees is garbaj!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
