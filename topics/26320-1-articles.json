Although my rocket design is not perfect, I\u0027ve been messing around with moonbases, landing on other planets and building some airplanes. Roleplay has really been an enjoying part of my game aswell. For example: Recently, my mission to Duna went wrong. The goal was to land a scientific rover on Mars to discover a good site for a potential Duna base, and then fly back to Kerbin. However, during the landing sequence, something went wrong, and the rover aswell as the rocket were damaged. The rover is now almost incapable of moving, and the rocket can under no circumstances safely launch. It just so happens, our brave Kerbonaut, Bob Kerman was inside the rocket. Thanks to a miracle, he survived. Instead of just restarting the mission, I decided to go ahead and begin a rescue operation. I\u0027ve never been able to make a spacecraft that is able to fly to Duna, land, and get back. The last 5 days I\u0027ve been busy attempting to save the brave Kerbonaut, and I\u0027ve had several failed attempts (which I could talk about for hours \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) at getting him back. Rather than just looking up a tutorial, I decided it would be more of a challenge to do it without one. Roleplay always seems to do well in Sandbox games. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I decided to join the forums, so I could share all of my epic creations and progress on missions similair to the above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T05:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
