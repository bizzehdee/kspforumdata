The plan is to have track pieces that you put together, like a model railway, placed using the kerbtown plugin. Train wheels grip a central, T shaped bar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I have a working bogie part, which still needs refinement before I move on to track making. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ideas, or offers to help are most welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original idea (discussed in the first few pages) was a system inspired by the kerbals\u0027 ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals lock on to the ladders, move straight from one to another, even at a slight angle. A similar system could be employed to make a train wheels jump from one rail segment to another. These segments will be placed via kerbtown, with the possibility of adding a resource-using construction system later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA radially place able train bogie (wheel frame) part will enable your creations to use the track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u0022ladder\u0022 based concept was superseded by the current idea, which is based on monorail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue with creating a rail system is terrain. Real life railway engineers can modify terrain to make a better path, but obviously we can\u0027t in KSP.
