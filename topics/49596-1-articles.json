So, I whipped together a quick little part: a probe that allows you to take \u0022Computer Reports\u0022, which are exactly the same as crew reports but don\u0027t actually require any crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called the \u0022Stayputnik Mk. 2\u0022 and it\u0027s on the tech tree under \u0022Large Probes\u0022, as it\u0027s a 2x larger version of the Stayputnik Mk. 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may or may not actually work. Let me know if it doesn\u0027t work. I can take reports in Sandbox mode and get the messages about how it doesn\u0027t actually accomplish anything, but I don\u0027t actually have the appropriate tech in Career mode yet to try and science with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, let me know if you think of a good way to balance this, gameplay-wise. I think right now the main downsides to the part are high power draw and low torque, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s going to be enough. It might make science too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.co.nz/#!CIsWRYBT!F5rE5zRuwFIkYzd0cciaVmzs2lV1IYsMCEmX4AZgtoc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload from MEGA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: WTFPL\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-20T04:59:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2013 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Interfect\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T05:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease add photos and a part list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T05:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sharpspoonful\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sharpspoonful\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease add photos and a part list.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart list for one part?? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a size 2 Stayputink probe that does reports....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T06:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGawd, the \u0022no pix no clix\u0022 culture is whacked.
