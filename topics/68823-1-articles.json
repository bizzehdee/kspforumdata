Spaceplanes really only get a look-in for LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo probes go first (BTSM although I don\u0027t use it or career mode), starting from the lowest deltaV requirements and building-up. Manned only happens once probes are in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have loads of information/management mods which are not a requirement for the missions (SCANSat can be faked just by looking at Kerbalmaps) but the only part-specific mod I use is Procedural Fairings, just because I want things to look plausible (and I definitely use asparagus staging). Just now I\u0027m re-visiting the later, heavier launches and redesigning for the ARM parts, although they\u0027re so over-powered they make separate designs for low- and high- deltaV requirements look a bit redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, as I have commented elsewhere, one of the things that stops me completing is that I lose patience waiting for transfer windows and am more likely to start again for a new version/programme structure!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T17:37:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mission progress usually goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPad testing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEquatorial Kerbin orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPolar Kerbin orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPolar Mun flyby\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPolar Minmus flyby\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMinmus landings \u0026amp; Orbital science station\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMun landing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EManned missions to fly by Duna or Eve and land on Ike/Gilly\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhatever I feel like\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T17:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince I like finding ways to break game systems, I pretty much try to find ways to (reasonably!) get the tech tree unlocked as fast as possible. Minmus having biomes now made that much simpler. Mission 1: low polar Minmus orbit, 9 EVAs (1 per biome) to get reports and surface samples. Mission 2: massive Mun expedition with a combination lander and science lab with spare fuel on board, milking all 15 Mun biomes dry of every bit of science they have to offer. It works surprisingly well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
