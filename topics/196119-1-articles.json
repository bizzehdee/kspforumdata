My guess is that it\u2019s a mod conflict. I get bored with the stock game, so I modded my game to make it more exciting.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, I digress, this is just small science station with two main parts, a command pod and MPL. \u00A0First thing I noticed is that electric charge readout went to NaN. \u00A0Then I went up to get one of the kerbals off the command pod and when I used right click to see the screen for the command pod, it came up, but none of the buttons worked. I couldn\u2019t\u00A0select anyone\u2019s inventory or transfer crew.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the spirit of KSP, I came up with plan B, EVA. I got a\u00A0Kerbal on EVA, but the second I let go of the command pod and started floating I notice while I could engage my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, I could see them puffing away on the screen, it had no effect on my direction of travel. \u00A0I just kept floating away. I could make her spin, but that was it. \u00A0I tried this several times, once I noticed my command pod shaking in the game as I went flying at Mach 9\u00A0away the second I stepped out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went back to a save and tried to de orbit my ship, I made plans for this, but I noticed that the ships controlls were not working well. \u00A0Then, I found out, like my Kerbal, I can change my ships orientation, but when I blast my engines full tilt, it has no effect on my orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of ruins the game for me. \u00A0Kerbins are expensive and hard to replace. Plus I don\u2019t like killing them. I\u2019ve lost a number of games due to technical issues. I\u2019m tired of reloading and starting from the beginning.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve seen some stuff about this, but I didn\u2019t understand it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-05T17:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat is your mod list?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-05T22:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like a mod borked your save, perhaps irredeemably. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E With that in mind, I have moved your question to the support sub, and good luck with your issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torchster","CreatedById":205589,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T01:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s pretty long.
