I decided to build one and after polishing it a bit I\u0027m ready to show it off. Works in 1.2.2 currently using the Infernal Robotics plugin, TweakScale,\u00A0and ColliderStrikesBack for intra-vessel collisions. Doesn\u0027t explode with cheats off either thus it would work for campaign players.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis one is jammed full of features!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSelectable drive modes.....\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Left wheel drive with low torque (slips easily, may be good for traction on slick surfaces)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Right wheel drive with low torque (Right drive engaged but not locked, left disengaged)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Right wheel drive locked (Right drive engaged all the way into lock, left disengaged)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Left and Right Wheel Torque Biasing Drive (Both engaged but not locked)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Left and Right Wheel Locked (Left engaged, Right engaged fully into lock)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* 3-Way custom gear ratios \u00A0(Move pistons individually and asymmetrically)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout the 3-way ratios... Since each piston is independently movable you can underdrive the left or right wheels by retracting a few on only one side. This would produce a yaw effect for turning or allow you to essentially have more than one rear end speed if you do it for both sides. Start with 4 out for slow crawling speeds and shift 4 more out for high ratios.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShould be all we need for some serious fun!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurn on subtitles (CC) for a walkthrough as the video plays.

Regarding colliders strike back I simply put the DLL in the game folder, nothing worked, upon restarting a few times I think module-manager or something updated it since it started working randomly.\u00A0If it matters I\u0027m also running Linux rather than the Windows build and using a KSP install\u00A0that I\u0027ve upgraded up to 1.2.2 rather than a fresh install.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI actually went driving with two of my differentials in a 4x4 configuration but each using a separate drive, basically copied the existing design twice into a project with a small frame around it. Main problem is the heat shield wheels are too heavy. I can\u0027t drive it in standard gravity without the input drive simply pushing the input gear out of the way because it\u0027s essentially acting like both wheels are locked as in my demo.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever by lowering gravity down to 0.20 or so and firing the rockets on one set of wheels to get extra grunt..... \u00A0it will drive and slowly pick up speed. I got it up to around 30m/s but almost drove it into the lake. I\u0027ll post up a video of that but first I want to try getting it to work without any hacks or rockets. And for that to work it must again get smaller.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also noticed beyond a certain size the gear teeth\u00A0are more like a clutch and will never bind but slip instead even with the axles locked together. This may be interesting behavior for those looking to build a lossy clutch drive without direct linkage. Once the gears teeth get larger beyond a point they bind rather than slip and I assume that\u0027s due to the 0.03 physics delta being too large to pass through the object. Just a hunch though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore to come \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T07:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re talking about colliders phasing through each other ... that\u0027s a serious design flaw in the game: collider integrity is based on part mass.
