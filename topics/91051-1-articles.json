Our brave friend gets shot away into space on a chair where he can then do space-stuff, like spinning around rapidly or pretending that he isn\u0027t afraid. This version also has a docking port included so you can dock to your space station, ofcourse rcs is included. After all your objectives in space are completed you can just return home, the small shuttle has excellent flight characteristics and is able to make very short turns. And if you are coming in short on your target you can just flap your wings very hard to generate some extra speed, SAS might also trigger this. But no worries the shuttle can fly very stable without SAS activated aswell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./?snvrlz2n21ewp78\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www./?snvrlz2n21ewp78\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/GtqRx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
