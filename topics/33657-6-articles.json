Flight and cohesiveness isn\u0027t a problem. I can get that sucker off the ground and screaming through the air with no trouble. The problem is stability. I suspect that the piloting systems by default calculate adjusting the gimbal mainsails by assuming they\u0027re at the bottom of the craft. Might be, maybe not.

I\u0027m a big man.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a big appetite?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about gimbaling is that it\u0027s not very effective if your engines are level with your center of mass, because it becomes impossible for the difference in vectors from gimbaling to create a torque around that point. (It\u0027ll do a translational motion instead, which doesn\u0027t do you much good as SAS doesn\u0027t even try to do that.) Without a way of adding a torque, you can\u0027t keep yourself aligned. In reality we\u0027d simply throttle down the engines on one side of the ship and leave the others going at full throttle, but KSP doesn\u0027t allow for that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn engine at the back end won\u0027t have that problem, and neither will one far in front of the CoM; \u0022puller\u0022 designs have been done by quite a few people without problems. A similar effect happens with flaps on a spaceplane; if they\u0027re even with the center of mass then you can\u0027t use them to pitch the plane, but canards at the front are just as effective as flaps at the back if they\u0027re far enough from the CoM. So, your rocket shifts a little during thrust, and it can\u0027t gimbal to fix it (possibly even making it worse, if it tries to gimbal anyway), and RCS can\u0027t even come close to providing enough force to make up for that. In-atmosphere, flaps can help make up for that, and outside an atmosphere your SAS can do the job. Putting even one good engine down at the bottom would help a lot, as would moving them further upward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings us to this episode of Crazy Spatz\u0027s Knee-Jerk Design Workshoppe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; You don\u0027t have any flaps or SAS, from what I can see. The SAS, especially, should go on every design; put an SAS on top of each of your eight mini-stacks, and an ASAS controller somewhere in he middle. This\u0027ll make it MUCH easier to stay stable while thrusting, without using any RCS. Even if you do have an ASAS tucked away in there somewhere, a large ship needs a lot of SAS torque, so add more anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; I see 8 batteries, but I don\u0027t see anything that draws power (although presumably you\u0027ve got an unmanned controller hidden somewhere on there). You also don\u0027t seem to have any way of generating electricity outside of the engines themselves. One RTG goes a long way, although I also like throwing on a few of the non-deploying solar panels as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; That is a metric buttload of struts. While I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve taken the MOAR STRUTS mantra to heart, they\u0027re not perfectly rigid. Things CAN still flex a little bit, so it\u0027s not impossible to still get destructive resonances. And struts, unfortunately, make your part count go up quickly. As we all know, part counts are the real limiting factors in KSP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; It\u0027s hard to tell if the gray cylinders you\u0027ve attached the engines to are structural fuselages (which are just empty dead weight) or the type 1 jet fuel tanks which don\u0027t carry oxidizer. Either way, you should replace them with standard rocket fuel tanks if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; The thing about RCS jets is, they\u0027re sort of the reverse of the gimbal thing I said above; for RCS, you want the quads to be exactly alongside the CoM if possible. If all of your RCS jets are forward of the center of mass, then two things will happen: you\u0027ll burn through fuel faster, since it\u0027ll be trying to fire more than one jet for each rotation, and you won\u0027t be able to do any translational motion (which really only matters if you\u0027re trying to dock with something in space, but is just good design in general).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5a\u0026gt; And that brings us to the diagonal issue. You\u0027ve got eight sets of two RCS quads apiece; assume for the moment that you took my advice and they\u0027re EXACTLY alongside the center of mass. Let\u0027s number them 1 through 8, with 1 being the \u0022north\u0022 end. Now imagine you want to pitch your ship northward during flight (i.e., you hit the up or down key, whichever one\u0027s that direction). It\u0027ll fire the jets on 3 upward and 7 downward (or vice versa), obviously, since those ones have jets pointing in those directions. It won\u0027t fire 1 and 5, since they\u0027re perpendicular to that axis and so can\u0027t create a torque around it. But it\u0027ll also fire 2, 4, 6, and 8, even though since they\u0027re 70% closer to that axis they won\u0027t be as efficient. It\u0027s even worse for translational RCS motion, since jets 2 and 4 would be partially canceling out each others\u0027 effects, and 6 and 8 doing the same. Likewise, pushing left or right will fire 1 and 5, and not 3 and 7. But, again, 2, 4, 6, and 8 will fire. In other words, you\u0027ll burn through RCS fuel faster than you need to, no matter which way you\u0027re trying to rotate, because the four diagonal sets will always fire but have less effect for the same amount of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6\u0026gt; There is NO rule #6.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T05:06:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T05:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOH, ok.

That causes massive asymmetrical torques, which might explain your problems, although without trying out the craft file for myself it\u0027s hard to be sure. This sort of thing is easy to test if you can make it to orbit: turn off SAS and RCS, turn on time acceleration for am moment then set it back to x1. If the ship immediately starts torqueing again, it\u0027s a clipping issue. This is a lot harder to test on the ground, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, the gimbal issue I mentioned can lead to this, albeit not in what I\u0027d describe as a crazy amount of torque. Even if your design is perfectly symmetrical, a minor perturbation can lead to that sort of effect if there\u0027s no restoring force that can pull it back, and the game\u0027s physics model has just enough inaccuracy in it that small perturbations DO happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T06:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh!

To be clear, though, you CAN get the clipping issue even if you don\u0027t explicitly disable the clipping check. You see, the game only does the full clipping check when you first place an item, but if you then move it to a new location, it does NOT do the full check at the new location. This loophole was used by people who wanted to stack multiple jet intakes, even without the F12 option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, if the physics engine thinks two objects are trying to occupy the same location, it\u0027ll try to separate them by pulling them apart. If for whatever reason they can\u0027t be separated, and one\u0027s bigger than the other, you get a net torque that can\u0027t go away. Now, there are exceptions to this; you can usually place a small object (like an RTG or an avionics package) INSIDE a fuel tank and it won\u0027t cause problems, and you won\u0027t even need to override the clipping to get it to work. But girders and struts can cause these sorts of problems depending on your exact design; it\u0027s just yet another reasons why you\u0027re usually better off using a smaller number of large parts than to try building something out of lots of small bits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T06:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent.
