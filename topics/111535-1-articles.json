I don\u0027t agree with the possibility to process the same experiment in multiple labs, so I limit to 1 per planet/moon (would use a mod for that if it exists). I also use a life-support mod, it\u0027s not very simple to keep the Kerbals alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a single player game; play how ever makes you happy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-19T20:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223246846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022111535\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513561082\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022181766\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbalfreak\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/17/2017 at 8:38 PM, kerbalfreak said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game mechanics and config files still the same \u003Cem\u003E[snip]\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is no longer entirely true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally, the lab would convert the experiment into data but would return the experiment; you could grab a surface sample from somewhere, convert it into data, and the lab would both process data for additional science and give your sample back.\u00A0 Now, converting an experiment into data in the lab consumes the experiment; if you want to run an experiment in multiple labs, you need multiple copies of the experiment, plus an extra if you want to return or transmit one of them\u00A0to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
