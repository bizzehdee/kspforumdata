The console messages only say \u0022 X science was returned from the surface of Eve\u0022 rather than what biome on Eve. Also when looking at the results history in the research centre it only lists the science returned per experiment per planet/moon.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the large arm available then take only that as you get significantly less science with the smaller ones. You get quite a lot of science but it can take a long time to find a feature to scan. It\u0027s also not yet known in what biomes you will find what features and I believe some biomes\u00A0have none. So you could spend hours looking in a biome when there\u0027s nothing there. For Kerbin I used an aircraft and it still took 30 minutes of low level/speed flying over a mountain region to spot a feature.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-04T13:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223611775\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185114\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559626201\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151656\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zosma Procyon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Zosma Procyon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a limit to the number of sets of the new deployable science parts?
