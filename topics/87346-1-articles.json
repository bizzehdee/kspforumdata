The Mk1-2 Command Pod (2.5m) is based on the Apollo Command/Service Module (3.9m) 3.9 times 0.64 is 2.496, which is rounded to 2.5m (as the diameter of parts already varies by this much anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does Kerbin need a rescale? Realistic Aerodynamics is a planned feature, and obviously that means getting rid of soupy atmosphere. The problem with this is that you\u0027ve removed almost 1 km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. This makes a problem already faced in stock even worse, the scales of the rockets. You have tiny little rockets attached to your payload, and it just doesn\u0027t look like it has the right amount of fuel! It looks WAY too small. In stock, this is just noticeable as a slight imbalance in the rocket\u0027s size vs what the rocket can do. (You can get away with SSTO rockets that look like Mercury-Redstone)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you set the Kerbolar system to 64% of current scale, the universe and the spaceships fit into the same real-life equivalent scale as each other, whilst still allowing Kerbals to use smaller ships to accommodate their smaller size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo facilitate this change a few things would have to change/be added.
