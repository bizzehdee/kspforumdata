Which is all that everyone has been doing sofar. This will have a hidden cost of 12.500.000.000.000 $ (12.500 $ billion) over 125.000.000 lives lost (actually too late to do anything about that).

When the proportion of renewables gets too high, you need to start building dedicated load-balancing stations, like pumped storage, batteries, hydrogen electrolysis, flywheels, and so on. These have a loss in efficiency associated with them, as well as a very large capital cost. While most reputable publications will take this into account, some of the more militant and biased sources will completely neglect them, and act like we could replace our entire generation portfolio with wind for 10x the cost of replacing 10% of our portfolio with wind.

Another 67 are under construction, and more are to come....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very poorly thought-out; it\u0027s in fact hasty generalization with a nice disguise. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E This assessment of probability makes the critical mistake of lumping all nuclear fission reactors together, regardless of country of operation, country of origin, and the design itself. Chernobyl can actually be more-or-less written-out of safety assessments of current nuclear facilities. We learned from it that certain types of graphite-moderated reactors are \u003Cstrong\u003Ebad, bad news\u003C/strong\u003E, and on top of that, that any reactor with a positive void coefficient is \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally, ultra bad\u003C/strong\u003E design (positive void coefficient means that when coolant boils in the reactor, there is an \u003Cstrong\u003Eincrease\u003C/strong\u003E in reactivity, which makes the entire design prone to run-away operation and meltdown; a cornerstone of reactor design is having a negative void coefficient, or if you have a positive void coefficient, you have extremely robust quick-acting passive safety systems to accommodate it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to the generalization. I could say, with the very same logic, \u0022There are currently 19 CANDU reactors in Canada, plus 5 decommissioned reactors, making for a total of 24. None of those reactors has ever had a meltdown. Therefore, the probability of a Canadian-owned CANDU reactor having a meltdown is zero.\u0022 An incredibly simplistic and utterly worthless bit of drivel, just like that writer\u0027s attempt to assess probability. We can and should instead take a far more nuanced approach to assessing risk. What type of reactor is it? Has that particular type of reactor had failures in the past? How would such a reactor behave in a meltdown situation? (Not to toot my own country\u0027s horn overmuch but if you actually ask all those questions, you\u0027ll find that CANDU designs are remarkably safe and not prone to uncontrolled reactions at all. In a worst-case scenario the heavy water moderator in the calandria will evaporate, and while the core would be irreparably damaged by that point, the fuel isn\u0027t critical in light water, so pumping light water in to cool the reactor wouldn\u0027t positively effect criticality. This is actually one of the major problems that light water moderated reactors have, in that the fuel is critical in the water you\u0027re desperately trying to pump into the reactor to cool it, leading to something akin to a vicious tug-of-war.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point I\u0027m trying to make here is that saying that all nuclear fission designs are inherently unsafe based on two cases of \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E badly designed reactors is off-base. What that should be is more of a cautionary piece of data of what \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E to do. Strict oversight and public inspection of nuclear facilities is an absolute must. I\u0027m practically beating a dead horse here, but Fukushima-Daiichi was what we get for having terrible regulation of nuclear facilities, and on top of that, choosing the \u003Cstrong\u003Ewrong\u003C/strong\u003E types of nuclear reactors because the other ones on offer aren\u0027t American enough. I\u0027d use it as an argument for tighter regulation, not using light water as a moderator, and actually keeping your bloody containment facility up to scratch. The better reactors we\u0027ve made all have a fall-back \u0022oh hell everything went wrong\u0022 setup where pressure can be released in an orderly manner from the containment building while passing over activated charcoal filters to remove most of the radioactive material from the air before its released into the environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty simple lesson.
