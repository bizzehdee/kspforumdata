Picture this, a sonic boom is caused by the compression of sound waves. that cant keep up with a supersonic object. when an object is at a supersonic speed, the sound waves coming from it form a cone behind the object. the only place you can hear any sound the plane makes is inside that cone. As soon as you enter the cone, the sonic boom is heard. The faster the object, the skinnier the cone. Here is a friendly picture\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://photos-2.dropbox.com/t/2/AAC-Hf8dy_pSWTjzvRGf6gDWC30KJz14ev3Vv7P6d98iLg/12/294972804/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/Photo%20Jun%2027%2C%207%2006%2002%20PM%20(HDR).jpg/CITb04wBIAEgAiADIAQgBSAGIAcoAQ/Ado3alcWrirvSXmr6pwqX1GH7OnNSxzcfSq7qT9z5WQ?size=1280x960\u0026amp;size_mode=2\u0022 alt=\u0022Ado3alcWrirvSXmr6pwqX1GH7OnNSxzcfSq7qT9z5WQ?size=1280x960\u0026amp;size_mode=2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be added to an update for my very simple Mach Gauge Mod. I am very inexperienced with c#, so ill never accomplish this even in my dreams. The only time I want the sound cone thing to be active is when you in fly by mode in camera tools. this is so standard third person view isn\u0027t effected. I have created a checklist of what the code should do\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-should only work with cameratools active, and aircraft must be traveling supersonic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-plane sound only heard inside cone\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-sonic boom sound effects I have four of them, just make it randomly choose and play one upon entrance of the cone of sound waves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-use vessel.mach to get mach number, dont calculate it please\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you have any questions let me know.
