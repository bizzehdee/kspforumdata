Eve, Duna, Jool, Sarnus, all the planets in the Kerbol system. One team of scientists and engineers from the Royal Hexanian Institute for Science, lead by Dr. Wernher von Kerman have built a space centre on the east coast of Kafrika, to fulfil one objective; explore the stars.\n\nThis is the story of the Royal Hexanian Space Program.\n\n**Part I - Learning to Fly**\n\nParts coming soon!"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:33:15Z","Content":"**Crew roster**\n\n**Group 1 - The Original Four**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![6ZWvPos.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/6ZWvPos.png?1)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Occupation** - Pilot\n\u003E \n\u003E **Ribbons** \n\u003E \n\u003E **Notable Achievements**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![bieuuZK.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/bieuuZK.png?1)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Occupation** - Engineer\n\u003E \n\u003E **Ribbons** \n\u003E \n\u003E **Notable Achievements**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![P6oihFd.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/P6oihFd.png?1)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Occupation** - Scientist\n\u003E \n\u003E **Ribbons** \n\u003E \n\u003E **Notable Achievements**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![WT1aKB1.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/WT1aKB1.png?1)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Occupation** - Pilot\n\u003E \n\u003E **Ribbons** \n\u003E \n\u003E **Notable Achievements**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T21:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaintedLion**"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T23:44:13Z","Content":"**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9The Royal Hexanian Space Program**\n\n**Part I- Learning to Fly**\n\n**Mission 1 - Green Knight I**\n\nWith the dawn of the Royal Hexanian Space Program, some information about the lower and upper atmosphere was badly needed, as well as training for the staff, who had only flown small remote controlled aeroplanes (before crashing them).
