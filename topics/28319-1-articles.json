With the big change in .20 it doesn\u0027t work so smoothly. For some reason no matter what I have as a beginning part I can\u0027t get it like it used to. Is anyone else having this problem or know how to fix it?

All you have to do is EVA the kerbalnauts in your manned pod and End Flight on them. You can then fly the vehicle as normal, since you still have the unmanned probe body providing control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ozymandias","CreatedById":67245,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T05:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the welcom! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with that is that eva\u0027ing kerbals on kerbin leads to death or wacky ladder nonsense both of which I would like to avoid.

After that, go to the tracking station, control the craft that should still be on the pad at this point, (wrinse and repeat as neccessary) and you should be good to fly with an empty pod!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ozymandias","CreatedById":67245,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T06:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoooh, I see now.
