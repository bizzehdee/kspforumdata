happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy planes have a tendency to pitch up and flip (leading to disintegration) in some conditions even though the COL is behind COM and the AOA is small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong description:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I built this blackbird replica: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gZ5G6G5.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/gZ5G6G5.png\u003C/a\u003E which worked fine with no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I wanted to build a spaceplane version so I added oxidizer, replaced the engines with rapiers and other small modifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to SPH the COM moved back a little but was still in front of COL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no problems taking off and flying at subsonic speed but every time it reached Mach 1 it exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt didn\u0027t matter the height, the thrust, the angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo better see the problem I accelerated very slowly at higher altitudes to see the problem happen more slowly and what I saw was that when reaching Mach 1 it suddenly displayed large scale stall and there was a sudden pitch up which was the one causing the high dynamic pressure to disintegrate the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t understand why this was happening because the COL was already behind the COM, the angle of attack was small, I wasn\u0027t even touching the controls and at transonic and supersonic speeds the COL should move to the back and the nose should have a tendency to pitch down not up... but anyway the logical action was to try to move COL more back so I did and now my spaceplane version looks like this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BltpfiX.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/BltpfiX.png\u003C/a\u003E and can go past Mach 1 without exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI no longer have pictures with the exploding version but if needed I can modify it and take some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 1: \u003C/strong\u003EBut I still don\u0027t understand: why was this happening in the first place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter solving this problem I encountered another problem which I have with all my spaceplanes and FAR, including this model for example: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2yvoOgN.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/2yvoOgN.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt heights above 20.000 meters and speeds above Mach 4 my spaceplanes have the tendency to suddenly pitch up, usually when I try to pitch down and then flip and of course explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution I have found to this problem is to try to enter 20.000 almost perfectly level and then let the pitch increase and not correct it more than once and just go to rocket mode and space as quickly as possible in order not to flip, but this means that I loose deltav because I don\u0027t gather all the horizontal speed that I could get from air breathing mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 2:\u003C/strong\u003E So why does this happen and how can I solve this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slow constant pitching up happens in both stock aerodynamics and with FAR always so I am not asking about that (although I am not sure why that happens either) the problem is the sudden pitch up even though AOA is small, and the COL is way behing COM and I don\u0027t pitch too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe COL is so behind COM that I have some trouble when landing because then I no longer have problems with the plane pitching up, at low speeds and altitudes it behaves normally, which means that it will keep trying to go nose down so I have to keep pitching up so landing is a bit ugly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried moving fuel to the front continuously while moving up to move the COM even further in front but it still happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I enable all the FAR stability helping tools it\u0027s even worse: it\u0027s almost guaranteed that when I will try to pitch down it will suddenly flip up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed an experimental spaceplane with the engines in front so that the COM will be close to the front of the plane and the center of thrust be also ahead thinking that as an arrow is stable because the COM is in front and when my planes flip the have a tendency to go with their rear forward maybe this will help but it didn\u0027t, still the same flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have screenshots but I can take some and upload if necessary (it looks ugly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis eight engine stock cargo design : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6pza3pG.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/6pza3pG.png\u003C/a\u003E which also has the COM in front seems to work fine but I didn\u0027t test it enough, I only used it once and I might have not stayed enough gathering horizontal speed to check if this problems was still happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this shouldn\u0027t be the problem because high speed planes like SR-71 and XB-70 usually have the COM close to the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem also happens during reentry so when I return I have to point the nose prograde until I reach bellow 15.000 m and bellow Mach 4 and only then I can begin to safely and slowly pitch up, but I would like to reenter space shuttle style, pitched up but like I said that is impossible even if I move all my fuel in front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also thinking that maybe the fact that Blackbird has forward chines that cat like canards and XB-70 also has canards maybe I should add some canards too but not only it would ruin the look but like I showed already other spaceplanes I built have canards and still have this problems and the spaceshuttle doesn\u0027t have canards and can reenter at high pitch angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for such a lengthy
