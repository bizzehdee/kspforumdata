If you play opening both branches at the same time it may be possible to make around Tier 7 with RD-17x/18x/19x discovered, but if you play one branch at a time you will have to stick with the chosen side only. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowWhite","CreatedById":121477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:25:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Will you do a kerbalized entire atlas series because that would be amazing!
