Up first was the design of a converter-lander craft, which I ultimately dubbed the \u003Cem\u003EMidas 7\u003C/em\u003E. I went ahead and tested the design of the lander on the launch pad last night and so far it looks like the thing should work just fine. She should be able to launch, transit to Kerbin\u0027s moons and land all under its own power; at over 3500 m/s of on-board delta-v I\u0027m thinking the design could be utilized for outer planets as an orbital platform as well. Only problem there - she uses KAS connector ports, not docking ports, which is not insurmountable. I still need to go ahead and design a booster for it but with the payload mass (just shy of fifty tonnes) that\u0027s a pretty trivial exercise, especially given how far along I am up the tech tree. I probably won\u0027t be able to launch it until I\u0027m in a spot where I need it, though; I still haven\u0027t collected on that \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1350,000 contract for Minmus ore miining yet and at this point I\u0027d probably need the cash first...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second design of the night was the \u003Cem\u003EMagpie 7\u003C/em\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/djSFTjp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022djSFTjp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s designed to be able to haul down loads of ore from LKO.

The basic numbers of the plane\u0027s desired wing area, wing loading and aspect ratio are correct, so I\u0027m thinking my first bit of corrective action will be to give more sweep to the main wing as well as the tail to try and bring that CoL back a bit. I\u0027m thinking the design will need more fuel before its all said and done as well; I\u0027m still about eight tonnes shy of the FAR single-Turbojet recommended limit and the back tank is dry in that screenie, so I\u0027ve got some room to maneuver there.
