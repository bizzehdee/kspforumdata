In the VAB if you move the craft so that the launch tower is near or outside the large circle painted on the floor then it works fine, but placing it too close to the center will give the bug. As for other markings, if the launch tower base is touching the grate of the launch pad I get this bug, but outside the white painted square encompassing the grate seems to work just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T19:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ephysics joints are getting a much needed fix in the next update so it should be much better then and less unpredictable...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horman","CreatedById":81208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T21:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about letting the Kerbalnauts spawn at the astronaut complex, so they might be driven to the launch tower by astro van? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T04:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love how much more immersive this makes my launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny plans for a 3.75m stack clamp that would work with the new ARM parts?
