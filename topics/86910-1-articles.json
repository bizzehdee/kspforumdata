They are slightly more than 1.25m tall, and with fold up panels to allow them to expand upwards by approximately 1-1.25 meters, they could be turned into passable space station sections, and the design would theoretically let you lock them in place for added strength. Still working on a couple of concepts for how the mechanisms would work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T03:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cally","CreatedById":125549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T04:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d help, but I know nothing about modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d love to see this! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weeble","CreatedById":117348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T20:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt just wouldn\u0027t make sense to use an mk2.
