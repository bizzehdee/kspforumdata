to a HD crash i had to install KSP again, pffffff\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I had to sift through al the parts to remove everything that\u0027s related to airplanes: wings landinggears etc

parts, agencies, etc to get an Ksp that plays with only rocket stuff in it (sandbox mode)????\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnybody tried this before, is there a listing of parts and other

list, I did do that at one time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI basically got rid of all wheels (except rugged ones), all adapters/fuel tanks I never used, most of the small engines, a LOT of structural stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow in sandbox mode with only rockets ?\u00A0 Take out all plane parts (careful to keep control surfaces for your ascend vehicles), most batteries, most \u0022Pods\u0022 that you\u0027ll never use having full tree unlocked already.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRemove all science parts, you don\u0027t even need the antennas unless playing with remote tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to push even more, just get the mod with the adjustable fuel tanks and only keep the bare minimum.\u00A0 Heck I completely deleted the Nasa folder once (0.25 I think) except for those\u00A01 engine (Cone shaped one)\u00A0and the big white tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt also depend on how you build your crafts.\u00A0\u00A0 I only kept a\u00A0 modded 2,5m 250kn nuke instead of the stock 50kn one and a bigger Ion engine to save on parts count.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPretty sure I had the whole thing down by 60-70% at one time.\u00A0 Did not improve performance much, but tidied the list lots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T12:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay

what you\u0027re doing is adding a layer on top of KSP rather than trying to alter KSP itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also means that you can use procedural ModuleManager goodness to save tedium-- e.g. instead of deleting each wing piece or science experiment individually, you could say \u0022delete all wings\u0022 or \u0022delete all science experiments\u0022, that sort of
