For the most part though, I got similar results as Zephram Kerman did on his trials. At this point, I think I\\\u0027m at the limit of what I can accomplish with MechJeb\\\u0027s settings as they are now. If I could some how program various degrees in pitch to correspond to various altitudes, then I could probably engineer more definitive results. But with the slider not having values assigned to its position I feel like I\\\u0027m working in the dark. Of course, I could be just missing something as I haven\\\u0027t even had MechJeb for a whole day yet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-22T17:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally!

(Basically, as the slider gets moved to the right, for steeper angles, the graph peaks move left towards ground level and below it.) On the other hand, if your manual curve shape works better than MechJeb\\\u0027s, it might be just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best shape for MechJeb seems to be around 1/3 from the left.
