I see your point, although getting to mine the water and not immediately having to convert it would give some flexibility to the game. For example if you scoop up water from Laythe\u0027s oceans, you might not be able to extend your solar panels in that precarious situation.

So I kept that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Nuclear Fuel is meant to be uranium aka nuclear fuel rods. Those are necessary for the nuclear reactor/nuclear thermal rocket to work.

The nuclear fuel resource would be in the NTR/reactors so they wouldn\u0027t need special tanks (except a couple that you could use for refueling purposes). I am a proponent of ditching odizider use in the future for NTRs, but that would require a different fuel tank logic (you\u0027d need to be able to change the entire tank to LF only).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

The only evidence pointing to LH2 is the LV-N\u0027s high Isp when using it, but it mixes it with oxidizer so that number is inflated one way or the other.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the evidence is somewhat contradictory myself. Isps seem too high on average to be RP-1/LOX for most of the KSP engines, and as you noted LV-N wouldn\u0027t get anywhere close to 800 seconds with hydrocarbon propellant. On the other hand isps seem too low on average to be cryogenic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the NASA ARM/SLS pack gives us a convenient point to anchor our speculations. Many of the new engines are obviously modeled on RL analogs. I think the Kerbodyne KR-2L is based on the Aerojet Rocketdyne J-2X, a cryogenic engine originally planned to power the SLS upper stage. The Kerbodyne KS-25 is clearly based on the Rocketdyne RS-25, a cryogenic engine which powered the Space Shuttle will power the the SLS core stage. I think the KR-1 is the same as the Dynetics \u0022Pyrios\u0022 advanced liquid booster (powered by two LOX/RP-1 Rocketdyne F-1 engines) which may or may not replace the Shuttle-derived five-segment SRBs boosters on later flights of the SLS. Apart from the obvious visual and naming similarities the parallels are not perfect between the Kerbal and RL engines. The KR-2L has better vacuum isp than the KS-25 even though the RL RS-25 has slightly better isp than the J-2X. The KR-1 has substantially better vacuum isp than the mighty F-1. Interestingly the model used for the KR-1 is smaller than the one used for the KS-25 (even though the RL F-1 easily dwarfs the RS-25s used on the Space Shuttle), and they have the same isp, but the KR-1 has slightly higher thrust (per engine). In comparing the performance of the KSP rocket engines to their supposed RL analogs, they generally tend to have slightly lower isp on average and a lot less thrust. Generally propellant tanks have substantially lower mass fractions than in reality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that Squad scaled isp and thrust to suit gameplay, and only went with a single liquid fuel for the sake of simplicity. So even if Kerbal rocket performance is worse the RL, they may not have been scaled down enough to compensate for the Kerbol system\u0027s reduced delta-v requirements. Our attempts to retcon things now seem doomed by the possibility that Kerbal rocket performance was never intended to be consistently realistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be interesting if there were separate cryogenic/kerosene-analog fuels, dedicated upper stage engines, and if the sea level isp/thrust/mass flow rate relations a little more realistic.

What do people think of having a main gatherable fuel resource (H20) that requires a catalyst material to process into fuel? The catalyst could weigh 1/50th what it produces in fuel, but would be 10x more expensive by the pound (1/5 the cost of its final product). There could also be very rare deposits of it which could be mined and brought to a refining module with water to make fuel. Can any of you chemistry nerds suggest an analog? It seems like it could make for a nice compromise between the 1 vs 2 resource crowds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat could be cool about it would be making it possible to mine fuel from the Mun and from asteroids, but at a cost, while planets have small catalyst deposits that could make for truly sustainable colonies. Maybe Duna has small catalyst deposits near the equator, but ice can only be found in abundance near the poles, making for difficult transfers. Laythe might have endless water, but catalyst must be brought from Val or Tylo to make use of it. Eve might have both, but you would need to gather water from sea\u0027s or geysers and transport it to catalyst deposits on land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to think maybe mono-propellant could be made from water (Hydrogen Peroxide?) without catalyst, but at a much lower efficiency, and perhaps xenon is only gatherable from atmospheres with the use of intakes and a special processing unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question is does having 2 fuel resources kind of necessitate an attachable fuel line?
