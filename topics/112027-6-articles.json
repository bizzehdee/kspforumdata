I entered engine first and tried to stay that way. No problem at all. Nothing exploded.\n\nThen I built a 2.5m ship (Mk1-2, 2.5m service bay with some batteries and monoprop tanks inside, a fuel tank, a poodle, some landing legs, a couple of solar panels and a couple of stock fixed radiators, antenna, rcs, and a large retractable ladder). I flew the ship out to Munar-type distance (11Mkm) and then set my periapsis to 20km. I entered engine first and tried to stay that way. I flew in a ball of plasma for a long time -- I think they cut back on the drag again. Some parts got really hot, and the ladder exploded. The radiators seemed pretty useless, both in space and on re-entry. But the ship survived, even though it was under-chuted. The Poodle has basically no thrust now at sea level (probably a good idea) and it mostly just served as a way to burn off my fuel load. I blew a bunch of struts on the landing gear hitting at about 11.5 m/s, but everything except the ladder survived.\n\nIt seems to me that for most purposes, the heat control in stock can be ignored, at least for a typical Mun return mission.\n\nAccording to the notes they cooled off the Nerva engine some more, too."},{"CreatedByName":"Starbuckminsterfullerton","CreatedById":117494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:27:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, Nertea, I gave the new 1.0.3 stock radiators a whirl... they\u0027re decent enough for the average player, but not really competition for your premium devices ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Not in terms of looks, and not in terms of functionality.\n\nWait...

If you have multiple equally hot parts the radiators cycle through them. The number to watch in the action menu is \u0022Internal Flux\u0022, that\u0027s where the heat flow into the rads (and out of parts being drawn from by rads) is shown. It also looks like the rads quickly reach the temperature of the hottest part on the vessel, which is OK as they have a high heat tolerance.\n\nThis strikes me as a good setup. I was thinking if rads were added they\u0027d just take in heat by conduction and thus should be placed on the hottest parts that can take them (and some of the hottest parts don\u0027t allow surface attachment), making nuclear clusters trickier.
