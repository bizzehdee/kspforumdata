The only way for them to be re added to 1.1.3 is if somebody re exported and completely rebuilt the parts hierarchy using the new wheel colliders and modules. As it stands a set of landing gear for 1.0.5 is totally incompatible with KSP version 1.1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMachinator","CreatedById":164681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T18:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what I\u0027m asking for - is there a lookalike for 1.1.3 or am I going to have to wait for Adjustable Landing Gear which in turn means waiting for 1.2.x?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T15:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe effort would be put to better use making the Adjustable Landing Gear mod work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T17:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222746017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221473273679\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164681\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaMachinator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, DaMachinator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what I\u0027m asking for - is there a lookalike for 1.1.3 or am I going to have to wait for Adjustable Landing Gear which in turn means waiting for 1.2.x?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBaha is taking a break, so any new ALG is going to be our own work ( we don\u0027t have model source, so we might as well start over ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
