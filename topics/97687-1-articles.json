I was taking and driving cars that I\u0027m pretty sure weren\u0027t mine. Doing little missions. Shooting people. Reloading. Doing stealthy takedowns. Skinning gorilla \u0027nads so I could make a bigger wallet. All of the additional content was more of the same. This big, jungly island. All green everywhere. Hey, wait, that isn\u0027t realistic and next gen - that\u0027s lens flares everywhere and brown artfully mixed with gray! There\u0027s no green in real life!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I realized that I was playing Farcry 3, and GTA V hadn\u0027t come out yet. And that \u0022content\u0022 in an \u0027AAA\u0027 game (they must call \u0027em that based on the battery, which is the smallest and weakest of the commonly-used classic long cell formats) is largely just pixels with different colors. So, given that Farcry is green and has you skinning gorilla nads and you can unlock scopes and ACOGs and different grips for your guns (or is that Battlefield 4?), I\u0027d give it an extra 15 minutes of content, multiplied by 1.5x for the 50% more color (green) it has over duochrome \u0027next gen\u0027 games...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso botching a mission is exactly and entirely gameplay. As is building rockets (that\u0027s half the bloody game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only place I\u0027d accept any sort of reduction multiplier is when you\u0027re at maximum warp and mashing the \u0026gt; key to warp faster.. Top warp is a bit slow for interplanetary even in non-RSS scale KSP...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T17:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy best estimate is that I\u0027ve played 2500 hours or so of KSP. Since I have the store version (and since I\u0027ve been playing since before Steam was an option anyway), I can\u0027t really give a more precise figure than that. Now in the US, at least, most games go for $60 for home systems ($40 is about the price ceiling for games on the 3DS). Factoring in PC game prices is a lost cause since they tend to go down to 10% of their original asking price within a single year. Since I\u0027ve had a fairly even mix of titles between my 3DS and Wii U, I\u0027ll put my average price per game at $50 (though if I were completely fair it\u0027d be lower still since I have slightly more 3DS games than Wii U games at this point). Now here\u0027s where it gets interesting: the majority of the games I buy are much longer-lasting than your typical 10-hour game. I like to play JRPGs and WRPGs both, and my game library reflects this. As such, my value per hour for my collection (even limiting it to this generation and excluding PC games) works out to about $1 per hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, by the original poster\u0027s reasoning, KSP is worth around $16,250. By my own scale, however, it\u0027s $2,500. Either way, that\u0027s a huge difference from what I originally paid for it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E EDIT: Concerning the argument going on above, any statistical measure is derived and thus is only valuable in an abstract sense anyway. Generally the most \u0022valid\u0022 measures are not ones that are easy to obtain. For example, the most scientifically useful measure of how much value an entertainment product has to you would be a combination of how high and how many endorphin spikes you experienced while playing/watching it (indicating how much fun you were having on a chemical level). That\u0027s not exactly easy to measure, of course. Measuring by a less precise figure like dollars per hour of value, by contrast, is (even though it also has far greater potential for false positives and false negatives both).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T17:21:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
