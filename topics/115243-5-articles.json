When I started it wasn\u0027t even a thing (only part mods were possible), so I learned how to do many things in KSP through trial and error plus research. When I first tried MechJeb I found it made the game too easy for me as I was letting it do everything, eventually I stopped using many of its autopilot functions because I enjoy performing certain maneuvers and the chance of failure that manual piloting brings. As MJ\u0027s functionality grew, I made sure to watch how it performed maneuvers that I had already found ways to perform manually, seeing if it knew anything I didn\u0027t (sometimes it did and I learned better techniques, sometimes it didn\u0027t). I then moved on to having MJ handle repetitive stuff for me; there wasn\u0027t a lot of enjoyment to be had from piloting a tanker rocket to orbit for the 10th time. My current playstyle is less about running a huge space program and more about single missions and testing, so I haven\u0027t been using MechJeb lately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you choose to play without it, its fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you choose to play with it, its fine too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUnder one condition\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to learn how to play without it first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause NOBODY should be allowed to drive a car without a license.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JetJaguar","CreatedById":146965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKER for me, I\u0027ve never used MechJeb.
