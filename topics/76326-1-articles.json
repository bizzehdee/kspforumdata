(All stock parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get this one plane to do it but I have no idea how I managed it. As you can see, the intake air required is about 9 times more than provided, but both engines are still giving out the same thrust with maximum throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I try to create a new plane from scratch, I can never replicate this phenomenon. I can maybe retain full throttle on the new plane until I have 90% of the air required before going into a flat spin. Unlike this particular plane which can retain full throttle until 10% of air required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume it is something to do with the construction but I cannot pinpoint exactly how to replicate this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/777183914932629531/3DA6DE4A1A9F14E83D086FA6349EC389D3467924/\u0022 alt=\u00223DA6DE4A1A9F14E83D086FA6349EC389D3467924\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T13:24:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by eempc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T12:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84217-Explaining-burnout-asymetry\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERecent thread about how intake air is allocated.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you fortuitously placed your engines and intakes in such a way that the engines have an equal number of intakes between them in the .craft description.
