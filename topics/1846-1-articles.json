Designed to lift 8 VF-2 High Speed Spaceplanes into a high altitude to allow for them to reach orbit without a large expendable launch vehicle. The VB-8 is 100% reusable and after deployment glides down for a soft splashdown in the Kerbific Ocean. I had to switch from a single hull to a dual hull design after being nearly done which SUCKS.

Ill just answer everyone in one place. It has a ton of rcs modules and the VF-2s cockpits are also command pods so the ship is incredibly maneuverable. I edited the .cfg of the radial decoupler to have a force of 20 so that might cause a problem. The ship was staged to activate the VF-2 engine before release but due to the nature of the VB-8\u0027s design the exhaust from the rocket would cause the second wing to explode. It is planned to allow parts to activate on release which should allow this design to deploy them safetly. I may make a new design to work around this constraint but I am currently very busy and ksp must take a backseat to other priorities. The VB-8 was from the beginning always planned to be used in the atmosphere . Deploying the VF-2 in space wouldnt be very interesting since they would just drift slowly away from the launcher. WHEN I HAVE TIME I may try a space launch since the launcher has a half tank left over once it reaches deployment altitude and I also purposely bleed vertical speed to avoid exiting the atmosphere. Send me a pm if you have any ideas you would like me to make and film\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-22T04:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReplace those 2 columns of 2-m fuel tanks with 2-m fuel tanks from Nova\u0027s pack.
