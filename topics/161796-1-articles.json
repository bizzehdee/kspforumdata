I just tune it out at this point, but I figured I\u0027d ask since it has been several years since I last did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick recap - Literally the entirety of the time I have played KSP, from the very beginning, I have gotten a crackling, stuttery, static sound when loading up the game and sitting in the editors. I THINK the last time I brought it up it was said to be a unity issue, but has any solution been found? This has been the one constant over the ~6 computers I\u0027ve played KSP on. Also, the crackle continues spastically even when framerate is a steady, limited 25 fps in the editors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso on the topic of sound, coil whine. I know this is something brought up semi-often, just hoping maybe someone that does have a solution might stumble across this. I\u0027ve reduced my poor, abused 970\u0027s coil whine by getting a better psu (only because my old one took itself and my mobo to computer hell ...Rest in peace...) and messing with slight over/under clocks, but does anyone know any other tricks to getting rid of it? KSP is the only game I\u0027ve ever played that causes coil whine, even under horrible loads. My current solution is music, but it\u0027d be nice not to have to wear headphones to keep from going insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rob593","CreatedById":178374,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T04:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the sound stutter is a known Unity bug which has not been solved as of yet, it effects different systems to differing degrees, I don\u0027t get it bad and am using Realtek if that helps, in addition KSP does occasionally stutter sound (due to the garbage cleanup if I recall the old dev posts) but its largely been removed or reduced in recent versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the coil whine, an FPS limiter should fix that, you can get it in KSP pretty bad during loading screens\u00A0but shouldn\u0027t get it too bad whilst in game, if you turn on an FPS overlay,\u00A0you will probably notice the FPS spike at the same time as the coil whine, the whine will be worse the higher your FPS goes. Cap the FPS\u00A0to 30, 60 or 120 depending on your hardware and this should solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
