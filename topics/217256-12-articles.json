That\u0027s actually a really apt question, as we had a major breakthrough on wandering apoapses last week (and it probably deserves its own post in the future). The issue, as many have pointed out, is that we have a lot of people on this team with different skill sets, working in parallel on a lot of different systems. Our artists and part designers have their own schedules and milestones, and that work continues to take place while other performance or stability-facing work goes on elsewhere. I like to be able to show off what those people are working on during my Friday posts - it\u0027s visual, it\u0027s fun, and I\u0027m actually quite excited about grid fins! They\u0027re cool, and the people who are building them are excited about them, too.

It seems to me that the constant advertising of several people making models for the game is just wickedness. It is unlikely that any of us slept and saw the fins in the game, we expect something completely different. If you want to brag about something - show something related to colonies, we haven\u0027t seen anything with them for over a year. Or something about science. Why did a specialist in writing texts come to the topic to make excuses? I remember at a bad job the boss suddenly added important purchases for an important project to me and for some reason suddenly sent me to talk with the customer, despite the fact that neither one nor the other was on the list of my duties and I was not really brought up to date. As a result, I received a lot of criticism for nothing.

As is nearly everyone who takes the time to give feedback. Those who just don\u2019t like KSP probably aren\u2019t active in the community here or elsewhere. I was sold on the concept of expanding KSP with colonies and interstellar with meaningful gameplay loops with resources. As much as I love KSP, I\u2019m the type of gamer who likes a little more direction in my sandbox games. Not actual quests or story, just a more clear progression. And career mode in KSP1 was always lacking to me. The new ideas for KSP2 along with better visuals and less need for mods really sold me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would like all at Intercept Games (and moderators y\u2019all are appreciated) to understand that very little negative feedback comes from trolls.

I feel like however the reason for the negativity seems to somehow keep being missed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI paid $50 for an EA game that was years delayed. I was told it was to help the community be involved in the balancing of the different systems. From all of the trailers and communication pre EA launch I was sold a complete game at launch, and then with the EA launch it was marketed as a barebones sandbox but with a solid foundation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game currently is broken and overpriced. I and a lot of others feel like my excitement for a sequel was abused to get a quick buck out of me. The game is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E what was promised, and the speed of progress in early access is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0what was promised. (Remember the \u201Cshort while after launch\u201D we would have to play the game without reentry heating?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had fun with the bugs on release. I appreciated the first two patches. My irritation went from \u201CI was robbed\u201D to \u201CI\u2019m early but not wrong and happy to help support this game\u2019s development.\u201D So I feel largely good will was being restored. Slowing down the patch release cycle at this time could not have been worse timed. The good will the first two patches made was quickly eroded.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems the strategy has gone to \u201Cunder promise over deliver\u201D recently. While many wish this was always the strategy, switching now is going to come with negativity. No one will give a clear answer on when to expect anything, not just science but even things that we were told were just around the corner like reentry heating. Until progress is made on the roadmap and bugs become rare there will be negative feedback.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo simply we are negative because what we bought does not match the description we were given for years. EA in a sequel that was supposed to be a regular launch is going to be more critical than the first game. Communicating more or less will not lessen or increase the negative feedback because it is not the reason for the negative feedback. Some in the community are negative because the game is not what we thought we were buying. The way to win us back over is by fixing and expanding the games features down the roadmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe more time between updates will help development a lot. And if it does the \u201Cunderpromise overdeliver\u201D will start winning over the communities goodwill.

For my part, I tried a simple Munar orbit rendezvous landing mission, which is something I\u0027ve done at least 100 times in KSP1 and could basically do in my sleep, and in the process I encountered 1) Such rapid corruption of my Munar orbital parameters that I had to use up all of my transfer stage\u0027s fuel just to stay in bleepin\u0027 orbit, 2) Crazy phantom forces on both lander and orbiter upon activating physics, such that my previously stationary lander was break dancing upside down repeatedly after I reloaded it using F9,\u00A0 and my orbiter spinning crazily as it went on a collision course with the ground based on no actual impulse, 3) My lander vanishing into the ground whenever I tried to switch back and forth between it and my orbiter to set up my orbital rendezvous,\u00A0 4) My fairings breaking my ship every single time I tried to jettison them, to the point where I just gave up on them entirely, and 5) One thing after another just ceasing to work properly as I did repeated saves and reloads of craft that were in flight. This is really not OK for a game that has supposedly been in development for 4 years now with a pre-existing code base that did not behave nearly so badly.
