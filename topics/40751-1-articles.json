So I dug through the forums a bit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eattempt 2... I imported the .dae into unity, installed part tools and tried to follow various tutorials. I added a physics collision mesh thing, clicked convex etc. I added textures as before. I wrote the file, got the .mu, and the texture exported out. Popped them into my folder aaaaaaaaaaaand fail. Now in the game it is invisible, implying no texture, and there is still no collision mesh, I still can\u0027t remove/undo/click on it once it\u0027s attached to something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone please explain to me what it is I\u0027ve missed?

For some reason, any new part I put into the game keeps being replaced by a model from an existing one (romfarer\u0027s subeam laser), wiping it out in the process. So the model for that keeps showing up, even though I haven\u0027t referenced it at all in the cfg, and the model in the new part folder has not changed in any way. It\u0027s almost like I\u0027m overwriting the cfg file for the laser (which I\u0027m not, totally different directories).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogically, the only reasons I can think of for pulling up another model, are an incorrect ref in the cfg, or using the incorrect 3d model file.
