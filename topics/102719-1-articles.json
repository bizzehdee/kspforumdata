List your favorite musician(s) and your favorite song(s). Recently for the past several months I\u0027ve been ADDICTED to HollyWood Undead. I love all their songs and each and everyone of them are so talented. Danny, the man who has a great voice, Chorus. Johnny 3 Tears (My favorite), J-Dog, Funny Man, and Charlie Scene.\n\nMy two most favorite songs:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Mt8kuqPmFI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n and\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTSTljhx60Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n (Note, that the song Believe is Explicit)\nMy next favorite is Linkin Park. I\u0027ve been listening him since I was a child, Rap and Rock is my favorite kind of music. Chester Bennington is really good with the vocals, and Mike Shinoda, who is really good at the rapping. My favorite is probably\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wF1sgXqF90?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nMy favorite Rapper has got to be Eminem. He is so talented at rapping, and I have been listening to him since I was born. I grew up listening to him. I don\u0027t have a favorite song from him, but here is one that I like: [Bad Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71xeMTazmMo) (This song is explicit)\n\nLast but not least, this one is a Heavy Metal Band. Known as Sabaton, who sings solely about War, History, and Historic Individuals.\n\nThey don\u0027t swear in 98% of their songs, but they sound really good. Here is my favorite:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj_uCV3HvGY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWell, that is it.

I\u0027ve always been a big fan of instrumental stuff, which is most of what they do (some stuff has vocals as an instrument, and a handful of songs have actual lyrics). It\u0027s music for stuff like movie or video game trailers.\n\nFrom an actual band, I might have to go with Streetlight Manifesto. I actually still need to get their latest album, but there is nothing in the first four that I don\u0027t like, and a few songs that I really like. Again, a lot of it is the instrumental stuff. I probably listened to each album two or three times before I paid any attention the lyrics.\n\nHonestly though, I pay very little attention to particular bands or artists. I like a song or I don\u0027t, and sometimes I\u0027ll look at a group to see if they have other songs, but collecting discographies or albums is the exception for me, not the rule. The criteria for me is usually that I like music that sounds fun to play. I was in bands all throughout school, and I have a special weakness for Saxaphones (my instrument).\n\nFor example, my current favourite song would be \u0022Everybody\u0022 by K-391 (\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MM0lWsvieaE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n). The Saxaphone and Trumpet combination is fantastic, and reminds me of the stuff I used to do when I had more access to other skilled players. It just makes me want to invite over a friend who plays trumpet and whip out my Sax and just jam.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T14:06:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cochonrambo31","CreatedById":104452,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T14:08:01Z","Content":"**KEIKI KOBAYASHI**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjzMXd0cVh4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_-G9W5QXGo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ej7k1DMIAE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZ6ABV_Q9qU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"segaprophet","CreatedById":14087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T14:38:43Z","Content":"~\n\n[**ISIS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis_%28band%29)\n\n~\n\n![ISIS_wr_LPUS_gf_in.jpg](http://www.printmag.com/wp-content/uploads/ISIS_wr_LPUS_gf_in.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T14:39:35Z","Content":"Yeesh, you scared me, segaprophet!"},{"CreatedByName":"segaprophet","CreatedById":14087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T14:40:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeesh, you scared me, segaprophet!\n\nLook em up on youtube, you might love em. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T14:49:03Z","Content":"I could see that leading to some misunderstandings. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T15:47:54Z","Content":"I listen to a lot of \u0022old-school\u0022 rhythm and blues.
