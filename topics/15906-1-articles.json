I have three crewmembers in one ship (w/satellite to deploy) and Jeb just joined them with his own ship to help with the deployment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I would go ahead and perform my first orbital crew swap while I was at it. So, I EVA\\\u0027d Jeb to \u0027Existing Ship\u0027 and he grabbed a ladder. I tried pressing ESCAPE to go to the Space Center and select the other \u0027Rendezvous Ship,\u0027 but Space Center was not a clickable option. I tried clicking the hatch on the other ship and couldn\\\u0027t get the crew out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been able to swap crews on the Mun using the same process, but couldn\\\u0027t during this instance.
