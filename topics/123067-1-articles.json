The contracts that want specific locations (e.g. perform gravimetric scans, take temperature readings, etc.) say so specifically, and put icon markers on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022science data from X) contracts don\u0027t care about locations. There are two kind, \u0022 from the surface of\u0022 and \u0022from space around\u0022. The former requires a landed ship, the latter can be anywhere that\u0027s not landed, be it high up in space or just centimeters above the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that it doesn\u0027t have to be NEW science-- you can re-do a science experiment that you\u0027ve already done before. You\u0027ll get zero credit for it on science points, but it satisfies the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a handy thing to do is to make a tiny, cheap satellite with, say, a thermometer on it, and just park it in orbit around the Mun. That way, whenever you get a \u0022 Science data from space around the Mun \u0022 mission, all you need to do is to switch to the satellite, take a temperature reading, transmit it, and you\u0027re done.
