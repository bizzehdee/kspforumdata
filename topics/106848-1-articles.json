The atmosphere is not soupy compared to 0.90 but it is in comparison to 1.0. It made SSTOs harder, rockets harder and most importantly it broke my stock Ranger which now can\u0027t aileron roll at all. So I\u0027ve modified Physics.cfg to the 1.0 values. The original file was made by Squad, I take no credit for it, I\u0027ve just modified some values.\n\n**Installation**\n\n1. Download the file\n\n2. Go to the folder where KSP is installed\n\n3. Copy it inside the folder with KSP.exe\n\n4. When asked, replace\n\n5. ???\n\n6.
