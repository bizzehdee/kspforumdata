It isn\\\u0027t light that was \u0027thrown out\u0027 by the Big Bang, because there was no \u0027out\u0027 for the Big Bang. The Big Bang wasn\\\u0027t an event that happened at a place. It occurred everywhere in the universe simultaneously. During that time, the scale factor of the metric was much smaller than it is now \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dat least a thousand times smaller, and before recombination much smaller than that indeed. Because of this, the universe was much denser than it is today. It was still infinite, just like it is now, but everything in it was much closer together. Because of this, near the time of recombination, all of infinite space was filled with a dense, hot hydrogen plasma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat else is filled with a dense, hot hydrogen plasma? The sun is. In fact, at the end of the Big Bang, about 370,000 years after the moment of creation, the entire universe was pretty much the temperature and density of the outermost layer of the sun. And just like the sun, it glowed. All those electrons and protons bouncing around interacted like crazy and shed off their momentum as electromagnetic radiation \u00E2\u20AC\u201D at the time, visible light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then came a moment \u00E2\u20AC\u201D pretty much all at once, everywhere \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dwhen the scale factor reached a point such that the density of the universe was no longer quite great enough to sustain this hot hydrogen plasma. Suddenly electrons and protons could get together and form atoms that would last for longer than the nanosecond or two it took for some wandering particle to smash into them and knock them apart as had happened constantly before. When this happened, the mean free path of a photon shot up dramatically, and the universe became, for the first time in history, transparent to light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cosmic microwave background is that light. It\\\u0027s the light that was being emitted by \u003Cem\u003Ethe entire universe\u003C/em\u003E at the time of recombination, at the end of the Big Bang. At that time, nearly fourteen billion years ago, it was visible light, blackbody radiation of about 3000 \u00C2\u00B0K, not at all different from sunlight. But over the history of the universe, the scale factor has continued to grow, meaning that light has gotten \u0027stretched out\u0027 (not really, but sort of) to the point where it\\\u0027s now a thousand times less energetic than it was then. That\\\u0027s why we can only see it with sensitive instruments, when in fact it was once exactly as bright as you imagine it would be if you imagine a sun that\\\u0027s infinitely large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Gyroscopes.

This is one of these points where the notion of \u0027reality\u0027 and \u0027existence\u0027 start to require lots of qualifiers; if you get a bunch of physicists in the same room and ask them OP\\\u0027s question about virtual particles, you\\\u0027ll get a bunch of different answers (and yes, I\\\u0027ve done that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) The problem of the energy density of the vacuum is still controversial, and most probably ties into the bigger problem of quantum gravity - regarding which, as you probably know, we\\\u0027ve been stuck shooting almost in the dark for the last few decades \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sneakeypete","CreatedById":3989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-01T02:58:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas an engineer i\\\u0027m quite a fan of the engineering approach; Close enough within tolerances.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-01T03:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGyroscopes are like magnets, IMO.
