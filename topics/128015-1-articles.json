There is no stable orbit around the space shuttle on the outside and once you get inside the shuttle some of its mass is now above your head and the gravity they are causing is cancelling out the gravity caused by the material below your foot.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn fact if you think about it, gravity is actually trying to tear the space shuttle apart instead of trying to get it to coalesce into a tiny ball. The reason is that different parts of the space shuttle are individually in different earth orbit and the orbital speed difference means they want to fly apart.

Things run on rails in time warp, and you can\u0027t run an N-body system on rails because there aren\u0027t any rails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason KSP can run on rails is because the only things that have gravity are themselves completely impervious to all forces, and the SoI system guarantees that only one body at a time can exert gravity on a ship. Remove those constraints and \u0022running on rails\u0022 becomes mathematically impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you want to have an asteroid with gravity, you could do that by actually modeling it as a planet, using Kopernicus; basically, just a really really tiny moon. You can fudge the SoI; the radius is calculated based on the mass by default, but you can override that to provide your own value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you do that, then it will act like a KSP planet: permanently on rails, you can\u0027t budge it a millimeter from its prescribed orbit, and you\u0027d better make sure that its orbit doesn\u0027t intersect anything else\u0027s or you\u0027ll get weird buggy behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T22:29:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
