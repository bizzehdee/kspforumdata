I delve deeply into lore, stories, and character depth, but I also enjoy creative and enjoyable gameplay. I sometimes test games out for developers, but mostly, I am just having fun and enjoying being a retired old man. I have been expanding my Steam account the past couple years, though the account is 14 years old, and always on the lookout for good Steam friends as well.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManGamerOMG/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManGamerOMG/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am very much into science, and run a non-profit 24/7 YouTube channel. It does not have a huge following, with only 1,400ish subscribers, but it is science based, with NASA, USGS, NOAA and other agencies. The benefit from retiring from an agency, is having wonderful friends in the right place. If you are into that kind of thing, come by and say hello. There are no advertisements and the channel will never be monetized. \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/c/MatthewShipleyInformationNetwork\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/MatthewShipleyInformationNetwork\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is me in a nutshell.

Magic is science that is yet to be explained, and in doing so, we find new magic that we never knew about. In everything we have learned so far, there is so much more yet discovered and deciphered. I just did one of my daily updates on the YouTube channel, so I am in a good mood. An hour of catching up on events and looking at current graphs and data, as well as maps and so forth. Always ramps me up. I am sure many find it boring, but it is what I enjoy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the welcome.
