Sometimes, they even work! \n\nMore often than not however, they end in explosive failure or hilarious Kraken attacks. Or both.\n\nHere you may see the results of my ferret-like attention span.\n\nRemember kids, R.U.D.\u0027s are B-A-D!\n\n\\*That\u0027s \u0022Rapid Unplanned Disassembly\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n**Modular Cities:**\n\nAs if a new career run and building a [supermassive aircraft carrier](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111518-Tempting-Fate-the-KSV-Kraken-Pic-Heavy-Updated-3-19-15%21) for Laythe weren\u0027t enough, I got inspired by JAD\u0027s wonderful [Minmus Acres](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus) project, and have added city-building to my list of Career-Mode to-do\u0027s.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/QzLcX)\n\nThese are some prototypes I\u0027d worked on in Sandbox - each \u0022block\u0022 is a structural baseplate, fitted with B9 landing gear (with the motors and steering enabled), and docking ports mounted 2x per side. The blocks are controlled independently by OKTO cores, and can be linked together in any configuration.\n\nHowever, even with the sturdy landing gear, weight does play a part. The massive City Tower module is heavy enough to push the wheels down, and cause docking trouble. In my test above, I was only able to secure it with one port.\n\nAlso as a rule: *never* retract the landing gear, or your city will become lodged in the terrain (particularly the heavy blocks).\n\nThe intent is to use EL and Karbonite to build them in-situ, and with the B9 gear they can be driven to more scenic locations for link-up, if the terrain is navigable.\n\nStill working on the idea, so input is always welcome. I\u0027ve been considering lately what it would take to adapt the [Civilian Population](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112142-90-Civilian-Population-1-2) mod to work on a smaller scale using stock-alike parts (such as the Stockalike Station Parts pictured above). Ideally the end result is a fully functional expandable Kerbal City, for any world with the resources to build one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T06:51:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kieve**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T07:56:41Z","Content":"**Walker Experiments:** (The first of many)\n\nThis time I am squarely pinning the blame on [Fengist](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109365-Mun-Walking-an-attempt-to-circumnavigate-the-Mun-on-foot) for what follows.\n\nI decided to try my hand at IR walkers. Why? Because:\n\n1. They\u0027re awesome. I mean, do I even need to explain this?\n\n2. I have a habit of setting stupidly impossible Kraken-bait tasks for myself. Adding robotic flailing deathtraps to the list just feels natural, at this point.\n\nSo let\u0027s begin with the Hex.\n\n![ljaBNYF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ljaBNYF.jpg)\n\n![Ih1AYlO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ih1AYlO.jpg)\n\n![o8M8yqZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/o8M8yqZ.jpg)\n\nNow right away, I\u0027m sure you can already tell this is going to end badly. We\u0027ll get to that.\n\nBut why start with 6 legs? Level of complexity. Bipeds may be the coolest, but they\u0027re also *by far* the most difficult. Balance, center of mass, momentum, it all gets a lot trickier when you try to do it on just two legs. I mean, look at all the falling down Kerbals do! Plus I have a [Hexbug](http://www.infmetry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/HEXBUG-Micro-Robotic-Creatures4.jpg)sitting on my desk, and that helped provide some reference.\n\nHowever, Hexbugs aren\u0027t known to attempt a backflip, and explode.\n\n![KTy1ij6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KTy1ij6.jpg)\n\n![ZtTlK59.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZtTlK59.jpg)\n\nEven Jeb seems mildly concerned. On the emotive meter of most Kerbals, that would be \u0022Terror-induced heart failure.\u0022\n\n![zaha2FS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zaha2FS.jpg)\n\nYes, that\u0027s right, I created something that makes even the great Jebediah Kerman worried.\n\n![deVsaLm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/deVsaLm.jpg)\n\nAt this point I don\u0027t even know what\u0027s exploding. It\u0027s just kind of a big flailing fireball of failure. Let\u0027s move on.\n\n* * *\n\nMeet Hex\u0027s 4-legged counterpart.\n\n![oY6cCk3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oY6cCk3.jpg)\n\nJeb: \u0022We\u0027re doing this again?\u0022 \\*/gulp\\*\n\nYes Jeb.

Randomly.\n\nIt was like watching a chihuahua have a siezure.\n\n![OzFgiLr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OzFgiLr.jpg)\n\nThen I noticed why: The leg joints were locked up, for some reason. Not certain where I went wrong in the assembly process, but those washers with the red stripe on top? \n\nYeah, those should turn. And they don\u0027t. So the leg just gets stuck vertical, and doesn\u0027t pivot as it should. I\u0027ll have to go back and spray some WD-40 on it I guess.\n\nLet\u0027s go smaller.\n\n* * *\n\n![qzpDuFH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qzpDuFH.jpg)\n\nDisclaimer time: I modified the tweakscale file for IR.\n\nMy interest in robotics has tended towards the miniature scale, rather than behemoth-sized (I love Battletech, personally, but I\u0027m not planning on recreating a 75t Timber Wolf / Mad Cat in KSP).\n\nAnything useful that comes out of these experiments is liable to be a compact probe rover, designed to crawl over difficult terrain where wheels would just slide. So, pretty much what NASA would use them for.\n\nBut getting back to my previous statement, IR\u0027s settings for tweakscale are... weird. They don\u0027t align with your set of 1.25m/2.5m/3.75m scales, and the smallest they go is .75m. What scale *is* that, even?\n\nI dug into the .cfg for it and shuffled some numbers around, added a few settings, and now the docking washers line up just fine at fuel-tank scales, plus a \u0022Small\u0022 .5m and \u0022Micro\u0022 .25m setting, for really tiny work.\n\n![PpcjxVa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PpcjxVa.jpg)\n\nIt hasn\u0027t helped with this tiny elephant however. It behaves even worse than the four-legged Hex, just wallowing around and doing a whole lot of nothing.\n\nI built something vaguely similar to this with my old Lego Mindstorms kit, and actually got it working. I wish I\u0027d kept it together because now I can\u0027t remember what I did to make it functional...\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s have our last failure for the night.\n\n* * *\n\nThis is actually just a *test* of a test.\n\n![ztuTiRV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ztuTiRV.jpg)\n\nI wanted to work out some foot-ankle-leg dynamics, and slapped this together. The washers in the lower-rear of the leg are powered, and meant to tilt the foot as the walk-cycle progresses.\n\n![mlh6yw1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mlh6yw1.jpg)\n\nAnd it worked, too. I mean, it was bolted down tight with the docking clamps, so all it really *could* do was wave the shin-piece back and forth.\n\nThat seems a shame. So I decoupled it.\n\n![4jeFe9W.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4jeFe9W.jpg)\n\nNow this may look like a failure to you all, but it actually gave me some design insights.\n\nY\u0027see, the way the two halves of the calf/shin framework were moving, they looked very much like legs already in stride.\n\nOf course, it was laying on its side going absolutely nowhere at the time, so that\u0027s not particularly helpful in this case. But it\u0027s made me reconsider my notion of where to place the powered cams, and how the entire leg operates in relation to the walker\u0027s body. Legs are the heavy bits, requiring the most structure and support, as well as doing all the actual work. Building the motive cam into them, rather than the relatively lightweight body, may help attain a stability that my attempts have thus far lacked."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T15:38:20Z","Content":"If it\u0027s any consolation, you\u0027re going through the same exact painful process I did. First, thinking you can just build one and second, realizing it might be a good idea to put it on a test stand.\n\nRight now, one of the biggest problems I see with your designs is something I\u0027ll get to in the not too distant future in my post, the feet. The angle of attack for your toes is probably too steep. Take a look at both my designs and those of Parallax again. You\u0027ll notice our \u0027toes\u0027 are more horizontal than vertical. Any time a landing strut angle is anywhere between vertical and 45 degrees it tends to grab the ground (braking action). If it\u0027s on a forward toe and grabs the ground, you instantly pitch forward. Too much angle (too horizontal) and you\u0027ll end up sploding the strut when you put the foot down, or even more fun, sploding the runway and going nowhere in the process.\n\nIn order to get away with a steep angle strut, your leg motion has to be really good and the foot has to \u0027rotate\u0027 through so that the heel strikes first and then the toes. Take a look at the \u0027advanced\u0027 design in my tutorial. That\u0027s an example of what I mean by rotating through. If the toe hits first, you will come to a screeching halt. I\u0027ve even flipped Octo end over end by not having the angle right. The reason Octo has hinges on the ankles is so that I can adjust the angle of the feet depending on my speed and direction of travel to make sure the heel hits first and the toe stops it from falling forward without becoming a brake. The heel angle is just as important because at some point, you\u0027re going to want to go backward and it\u0027ll have to act as a toe.\n\nYour 4 legged Hex, if it\u0027s just shuffling around, change the toes and I think you\u0027ll find you get propulsion.\n\nThe last piece of advice, I didn\u0027t see any reaction wheels, or not a lot. They\u0027re pretty essential for even multi-leg walkers. Since designing a ball-and-socket hip join in KSP is a nightmare to even think about, turning your walker will have to be done by either reaction wheels or some other force like RCS. Even Octo has 4 rather large reaction wheels to help it steer when moving.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T04:34:48Z","Content":"**Walker Experiments:Cheezebot**\n\n![XHbz2Io.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XHbz2Io.jpg)\n\nI was on a voice chat with my girlfriend while working on this, and remarked that he resembled a cheeseburger (this was before adding the legs).\n\nI\u0027d originally planned to do a single B9 light for an eye, but after noting [certain similarities](http://www.thereplicapropforum.com/gallery/data/918/batteries-not-included-flotsam-07.JPG), I went with something a little cuter.\n\n![BXvQjHo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BXvQjHo.jpg)\n\nPractically nothing here except legs and reaction wheels.\n\n![7G1N70S.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7G1N70S.jpg)\n\nThis was my experiment that followed the last set of walker images. I honestly didn\u0027t expect my attempts at a biped to function at all (not that I expected much better from the previous multi-legged attempts either).\n\nTo my astonishment however, Cheezebot actually walks pretty decently - if only in reverse. He has a \u0022falling down\u0022 problem though.\n\n![wOALfYz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wOALfYz.jpg)\n\nBut with the feet mounted on powered hinges, he\u0027s got little problem picking himself back up again.\n\n![KQMGVzT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KQMGVzT.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\nSo what did I learn? Well, for starters, I may as well just dive in with biped bots. Yes, they\u0027re more complicated, trickier to balance, and more difficult to control, but there is one big thing in their favor: *I understand them better*.\n\nI played with robotics, and LEGOS in particular, a lot right through highschool, and spent my senior year designing a cam-operated biped with [Mindstorms](https://lh6.ggpht.com/-F5Dna_plGC4/UChV0GCF20I/AAAAAAAACPk/SXKOyAQFpic/w600/RIS2.0-Box.jpg) tech. As far as walk-cycles and leg motion are concerned, I have a big head-start in that area. I may as well follow through.\n\nAlso, I managed to completely flub one of the key design elements I was intending to crib from - in the previous walker leg, the \u0022motive\u0022 washer is *between* the Knee and Ankle sections, and provides a fair amount of torque without running the risk of \u0022flipping\u0022 a joint (when the cam shafts flex out of alignment enough that the leg rotates past its intended range of motion). You can see that in the last pic of the previous post, in fact - the far section has flipped and is on the wrong side of the test foot. Cheeze has this issue pretty bad, and a large part of that is because the powered motive washer is located directly at the knee.\n\nAs for the \u0022walking backwards\u0022 thing, I\u0027ve a sneaking suspicion that a lot of it has to do with the phasing in the walk cycle. Right now, one washer and one cam linkage powers both the upper and lower leg, and the result is a force that pushes to the rear. Weight balance is also a factor - the legs are heavy, and most of the weight falls behind the foot rather than in front of it. As Fengist pointed out in his biped tutorial:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Once upon a time, I read somewhere that bipedal walking was the art of falling down and not getting hurt. Each step you take you essentially fall forward. Before you land on your face, your other leg moves forward and stops you from falling, it then, makes you fall forward again. When designing a walker in KSP, that\u0027s exactly what you have to achieve. To fall forward, stop, then fall forward again.\n\nCheeze is currently balanced such that he\u0027s always falling backwards.\n\nTime to head back to the drawing board..."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T06:35:02Z","Content":"I love that look! I never thought of putting the gyros on the legs... brilliant. Or, for that matter, the rotors on the knees. \n\nOne thing your design is going to prevent though is more speed. One of the reasons I use the pistons on the lower leg is by extending them, I get a much, much longer stride. Octo normally runs at around 10-12 m/s. By extending the lower pistons, I can achieve 18\u002B. The same was true with the Mun Runner. If you re-watch that video, you\u0027ll see it at one point making 20\u002Bm/s with upper and lower pistons extended, and that was on Kerbin. I was hitting 22-24m/s on the Mun.\n\nYou may want to look over the IR parts. There is one piston you can bury inside the leg so that it only sticks out a short bit.\n\nDunno if you\u0027ve tried but the larger landing struts may give you more extension on your heel and keep you from falling backward. Both work well enough, but I\u0027ve blown up a lot of the one\u0027s you\u0027re using just stomping around on the runway."}]}
