But it\u0027s made me reconsider my notion of where to place the powered cams, and how the entire leg operates in relation to the walker\u0027s body. Legs are the heavy bits, requiring the most structure and support, as well as doing all the actual work. Building the motive cam into them, rather than the relatively lightweight body, may help attain a stability that my attempts have thus far lacked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T15:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s any consolation, you\u0027re going through the same exact painful process I did. First, thinking you can just build one and second, realizing it might be a good idea to put it on a test stand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, one of the biggest problems I see with your designs is something I\u0027ll get to in the not too distant future in my post, the feet. The angle of attack for your toes is probably too steep. Take a look at both my designs and those of Parallax again. You\u0027ll notice our \u0027toes\u0027 are more horizontal than vertical. Any time a landing strut angle is anywhere between vertical and 45 degrees it tends to grab the ground (braking action). If it\u0027s on a forward toe and grabs the ground, you instantly pitch forward. Too much angle (too horizontal) and you\u0027ll end up sploding the strut when you put the foot down, or even more fun, sploding the runway and going nowhere in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get away with a steep angle strut, your leg motion has to be really good and the foot has to \u0027rotate\u0027 through so that the heel strikes first and then the toes. Take a look at the \u0027advanced\u0027 design in my tutorial. That\u0027s an example of what I mean by rotating through. If the toe hits first, you will come to a screeching halt. I\u0027ve even flipped Octo end over end by not having the angle right. The reason Octo has hinges on the ankles is so that I can adjust the angle of the feet depending on my speed and direction of travel to make sure the heel hits first and the toe stops it from falling forward without becoming a brake. The heel angle is just as important because at some point, you\u0027re going to want to go backward and it\u0027ll have to act as a toe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour 4 legged Hex, if it\u0027s just shuffling around, change the toes and I think you\u0027ll find you get propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last piece of advice, I didn\u0027t see any reaction wheels, or not a lot. They\u0027re pretty essential for even multi-leg walkers. Since designing a ball-and-socket hip join in KSP is a nightmare to even think about, turning your walker will have to be done by either reaction wheels or some other force like RCS. Even Octo has 4 rather large reaction wheels to help it steer when moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T04:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Century Gothic\u0027;\u0022\u003EWalker Experiments:Cheezebot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XHbz2Io.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XHbz2Io.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was on a voice chat with my girlfriend while working on this, and remarked that he resembled a cheeseburger (this was before adding the legs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d originally planned to do a single B9 light for an eye, but after noting \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thereplicapropforum.com/gallery/data/918/batteries-not-included-flotsam-07.JPG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecertain similarities\u003C/a\u003E, I went with something a little cuter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BXvQjHo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BXvQjHo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractically nothing here except legs and reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7G1N70S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227G1N70S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was my experiment that followed the last set of walker images.

Yes, they\u0027re more complicated, trickier to balance, and more difficult to control, but there is one big thing in their favor: \u003Cem\u003EI understand them better\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played with robotics, and LEGOS in particular, a lot right through highschool, and spent my senior year designing a cam-operated biped with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://lh6.ggpht.com/-F5Dna_plGC4/UChV0GCF20I/AAAAAAAACPk/SXKOyAQFpic/w600/RIS2.0-Box.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMindstorms\u003C/a\u003E tech. As far as walk-cycles and leg motion are concerned, I have a big head-start in that area. I may as well follow through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I managed to completely flub one of the key design elements I was intending to crib from - in the previous walker leg, the \u0022motive\u0022 washer is \u003Cem\u003Ebetween\u003C/em\u003E the Knee and Ankle sections, and provides a fair amount of torque without running the risk of \u0022flipping\u0022 a joint (when the cam shafts flex out of alignment enough that the leg rotates past its intended range of motion). You can see that in the last pic of the previous post, in fact - the far section has flipped and is on the wrong side of the test foot. Cheeze has this issue pretty bad, and a large part of that is because the powered motive washer is located directly at the knee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022walking backwards\u0022 thing, I\u0027ve a sneaking suspicion that a lot of it has to do with the phasing in the walk cycle. Right now, one washer and one cam linkage powers both the upper and lower leg, and the result is a force that pushes to the rear. Weight balance is also a factor - the legs are heavy, and most of the weight falls behind the foot rather than in front of it. As Fengist pointed out in his biped tutorial:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fengist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fengist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnce upon a time, I read somewhere that bipedal walking was the art of falling down and not getting hurt. Each step you take you essentially fall forward. Before you land on your face, your other leg moves forward and stops you from falling, it then, makes you fall forward again. When designing a walker in KSP, that\u0027s exactly what you have to achieve. To fall forward, stop, then fall forward again.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheeze is currently balanced such that he\u0027s always falling backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to head back to the drawing board...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T06:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love that look! I never thought of putting the gyros on the legs... brilliant. Or, for that matter, the rotors on the knees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing your design is going to prevent though is more speed. One of the reasons I use the pistons on the lower leg is by extending them, I get a much, much longer stride. Octo normally runs at around 10-12 m/s. By extending the lower pistons, I can achieve 18\u002B. The same was true with the Mun Runner. If you re-watch that video, you\u0027ll see it at one point making 20\u002Bm/s with upper and lower pistons extended, and that was on Kerbin. I was hitting 22-24m/s on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to look over the IR parts. There is one piston you can bury inside the leg so that it only sticks out a short bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno if you\u0027ve tried but the larger landing struts may give you more extension on your heel and keep you from falling backward. Both work well enough, but I\u0027ve blown up a lot of the one\u0027s you\u0027re using just stomping around on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
