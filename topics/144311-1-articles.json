Voila you have made an ancient computer give you your Email, The same thing could be done for such systems as social media, News, Wikipedia, Maps, Uber, and many\u00A0other services used nowadays, Simply bypass all the complex media and have the computer fetch the raw data and display it as text, There was never a need for sophisticated formatting and fancy graphics. And with the extremely low price of such hardware as we might have used 20 years ago, It should be\u00A0more than possible to produce a computer that can handle most aspects of daily online life and cost\u00A0$5 or less.
