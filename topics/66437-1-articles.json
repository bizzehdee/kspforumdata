In a typical lab centrifuge the g-forces involved are in the range of several thousands so most likely just the pressure acting on the container will shatter it even if you could eliminate all vibrations.

Also the acceleration time can be a factor, if you push it too fast it might again cause turbulence.

When we use in a lab a big washing machine-sized centrifuge to spin bottles that weight around a hundred grams or so, using a rotor that weighs several kilograms, the opposing bottles still need to be balanced so that there\u0027s less than one gram of weight difference between them.
