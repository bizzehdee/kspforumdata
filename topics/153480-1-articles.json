Unlike landing a rocket where (generally) you only have to deal with vertical speed, landing a plane requires that you contend with to speeds. Vertical and horizontal. The vertical speed is what kills you. unfortunately the only way to identify vertical speeds is with the what i assume is a logarithmic analog dial at the top of the screen. this can be somewhat troubling to read, but if the arrow is pointed at 5 when you hit the ground you should be safe and to do this we feverishly have to tap S to acquire a somewhat \u0022smooth\u0022 control over pitch when touching down . try practicing around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E where the grass is flat.

That\u0027s what all the grass around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is for. I especially like coming in from south of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, just to the west of the runway. Lots and lots and lots of kms of nice flat grass to land on. You can wait and wait for your speed to drop to something reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #2: More wing. The more wing you have, the slower you can go and still have control. To land easily\u00A0you need to be going slow,and you need to have a lot of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #3: Know your plane. How fast does it have to be going before you can lift off? Your landing speed has to be about the same number. How easy is it for you to maintain perfectly level flight? How slow can you fly without losing control? Because that\u0027s how you land. Bring the plane down to 5m above the ground, turn off the engines, and fly level. When the plane drops those last 5 meters by itself, you will be nicely landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #4: Many of the training planes have not had their wheels adjusted properly. If the springs are set too hard, you will bounce and crash. If the friction has not been adjusted properly, you may spin out and crash after you are on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #5: If you are simply practicing landing, make sure you take most of the fuel out of the plane before you take off. Landing a plane that\u0027s full of fuel is\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Emuch\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Eharder than landing a light empty plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #6: Know your landing area. What\u0027s the altitude of the runway? What\u0027s the altitude of the grass? Is the altitude of the grass different near the beach south of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E? Just how lumpy is the grass?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #7: Practicing ditching may actually be easier than practicing landing. You can be going faster when you ditch in the water. What\u0027s the exact altitude of the water? Turn off your engines, fly down to 5m above the water, and fly perfectly horizontal again. Do your best to keep the nose up so that it flies level until you touch the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip #8: Use the retractable wheels to practice.

Plant flags at both ends of the runway. This helps you visually line up from a distance, as well as giving you something to target for approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Know your terrain and line up on the runway from a long way out. The grasslands to the west are all less than 300m altitude, so make that your target altitude for approach.

Sure start practicing landings with a plane that requires the least speed to stay airborne ( I especially like the stock Albatross for that), get to know what is that minimal speed a plane needs to stay level at low altitude (depends on weight and flaps if you have them, so take care you do test with the proper setting), then fly the approach from the perfect position (align with the runway far from it, have an altitude so to follow the proper glideslope that will bring your plane to to touch at the runway threshold). For the above, I like this add-on a lot: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/77062-11-navutilities-ft-hsi-instrument-landing-system/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENavUtilities\u003C/a\u003E. Make the flare (increase pitch) just before touching, so to further reduce both horizontal and vertical speed, but keep an eye on the variometer (vertical speed indicator) as you must not gain altitude. If done right you\u0027ll lose all excess horizontal speed while overflying the threshold 1-2 meters high and keeping vertical speed = 0, so the plane will lose lift just there and come down smoothly. Use brakes, engines reverse, chutes, to lose any horizontal speed you still have.

Standard attitude keys (ASDW\u002BQE) are fine enough while flying, but may be hard to use in those hairy situations like landing. Even with precision control on, is easy to overshoot the mark; and is always possible touse a wrong key and roll while you needed to use rudder or else. I\u0027m used to fly with a pretty good stick, such devices really help with flying planes in KSP as with other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T01:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically what you want to do is maintain horizontal velocity for as long as possible, until you\u0027re at the \u0022almost\u0022 touchdown altitude (I find a 10 degree dive works pretty well; planes with less wing loading can go shallower), at which point you level out and gradually pitch up to keep your vertical speed at zero while your horizontal speed drops.

In stock, it\u0027s surprising how slow you can fly without stalling. Most planes can land well under 100 m/s.
