Because I spent the good part of the night building an SSTO lander that can dock with this station, anaylise/transmit the data, undock and do it all over again. But this is pointless isn\u0027t it? So would I benefit more by returning this data to Kerbin? Or.. will I be able to get some use out of this shuttle/lander?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T00:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is High over, Low Over, lying at, Landed at and Poles.
