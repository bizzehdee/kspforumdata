Right now, it uses AGL when over land and switches to ASL when it detects that its over water (AGL can actually go below sea level in KSP). Honestly, I see no real use case for going back to the bad old days of always using ASL, but if someone can make a convincing argument for adding it back in, it would be easy enough to do as an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Selentic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Selentic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s another one, unless it\u0027s intentional: the heat settings for the controllers are still set to the old default of 3600 - which means you can de-orbit them... unattached. \u003Cp\u003EI noticed this when Bill dropped a Radio-GAGA he was trying to bolt to the capsule while sub-orbital - and the thing landed at KSC to be picked up by StageRecovery. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see you\u0027ve discovered the advantage of using solid neutronium for the SmartParts outer casing... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though, I\u0027ll go through and do a pass over all of the SmartParts max temperature and breaking force to bring them more inline with stock KSP electronics.

The way the fuel sensor is set up right now, it\u0027s impossible for one fuel sensor to interact with another. The code simply lacks the ability to \u0027fire all smart parts\u0027. If you go through and manually fire the action groups, rather than staging, does it work properly? It almost sounds like your action groups have been corrupted. Also, another suggestion, try having only one fuel sensor per stage, rather than mirroring them across both tanks. You\u0027re using AG\u0027s, so it shouldn\u0027t matter in this case, but a single fuel sensor per stage should be sufficient here, since you\u0027ll otherwise have both sensors fire the selected action simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any chance you can replicate this using stock parts and upload it somewhere?

When i made them i hab only two decouplers in one ag but after the lauch of this second vessel now there is everything in all definded action groups. So basicly they mixed all the seperate action groups into one big one and then put this big one in all definded action groups. So if i press \u00221\u0022 all the definded stuff in every action group will be activated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T22:26:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firov","CreatedById":57445,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ManuxKerb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ManuxKerb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPost\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManux, it definitely sounded like an issue with action group corruption. No SmartPart modifies action groups directly, so if you\u0027re sure the action groups are being corrupted through no action of yours, you may want to file a bug report with Diazo on his AGX thread here, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use AGX myself, so I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t be of much help here. What you can do in the interim until Diazo has a chance to look into your action group troubles, is configure the fuel sensor to stage instead. Just make sure you have a single fuel sensor per stage and you should be good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
