A real asteroid entering towards earth does not ever slow down before hitting the surface. Either 1. It burns up before ever reaching the ground OR 2. It hits the ground at several km/s, causing an incredible crater and the sonic boom created is far past enough to shatter windows from 10-20 miles away. An asteroid in the game would behave no differently, other than the fact that they don\u0027t ablate on reentry. Hence even the shallowest reentry is likely to have the asteroid hit the ground at a minimum of 500 m/s, especially the larger ones."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T03:30:52Z","Content":"You forgot a third, they can explode in midair, like Tunguska for example.\n\nBut yeah anyway, okay.\n\nWould be cool if the asteroids did ablate away on reentry though."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:03:01Z","Content":"According to last week\u0027s Devnotes, they are being rewritten for U5 in v1.1; ablation sounds like a neat idea.

So if the rocket isn\u0027t pointed exactly prograde, no matter how bit the lead part is, the sides of the craft behind that part will get some airflow and therefore heat, and radially mounted parts will get the airflow regardless."}]}
