These would allow players to specifically tune the gimbal limit in certain directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my case, I\u0027m messing around with asymmetrical shuttle-style designs. The Vectors are the obvious choice of propulsion considering the fact that they were added specifically for shuttle replicas, but they have a real problem overcompensating for roll, causing a vessel to wobble a lot if not being kept stable manually. Disabling roll actuation solved the wobbling issue, but left the vessels with little to no roll control. Reducing the gimbal limit also toned it down enough, but also reduced the pitch and yaw control by too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose the addition of actuation limiters instead of or in addition to actuation toggles. This way, the issues of not having enough gimbal range and having\u00A0too much roll compensation are both dealt with, provided the player is willing to get into the nitty-gritty details of their designs (which I am thanks to my over-the-top OCD). It could also be applied to control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-24T02:44:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2020 02:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by JMBuilder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gavin786","CreatedById":196260,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-27T07:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore fine-grained control is always welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeen thinking about your post, and previous one I just wrote about helicopter controls, very similar requests, we need more and finer-grained control options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSerious players bump against frustrating limitations to perfection, not because it is out of spec in the device but because we cant set the right limits, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able for any control actuation, and this also is true for helicopter blades, to be able to rather than having a single global limit \u0022authority limit\u0022 to have individual limits for each axis.\u00A0 However, this gets hard for beginner players and very complex for KALs etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really think a proper stock scripting system, that can be used as an alternative/extension for KALs and also parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a part is right-clicked, simply have another tab, which introduces all the values as a script, then many more can be added for fine-grained control for advanced players while still having the basic set for newcomers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there is when right clicked, still the standard set of options we know and love, and where the # is to turn to numeric, another value which turns to script mode, where all the values are just as as a script with \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E// hello i am a comment\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026lt;setting\u0026gt;
