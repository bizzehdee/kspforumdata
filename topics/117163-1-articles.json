What\u0027s next, Deepak Chopra\u0027s crappy pamphlets?\n\nActually, that\u0027s a good idea. Two of the most important parts of science are these: first, you must be willing to examine unpopular ideas to see if they\u0027re true; and second, you must be able to figure out if something is quackery. So, definitely, something ido66667 should include in his new hobby is practice at detecting and disproving quackery.\n\nPor ejemplo: when Albert Einstein was mucking about with relativity, and discovered that the math led to an expanding universe, Einstein wasn\u0027t very happy. A static universe was the prevailing belief at the time, mostly because it\u0027s easier to deal with emotionally. People wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging. Einstein did something stupid at this point, and he really should have known better: he theorized an additional, as yet unknown variable, called the \u0022cosmological constant\u0022 that would balance the universe and produce a static, non-expanding solution.\n\nIn short, Einstein grabbed a Magic Number out of thin air to get the result he WANTED to get. As soon as I read about this, I knew Einstein had screwed up. And I was twelve at the time. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s actually a bit disheartening when one of the great minds of science gets owned by a twelve-year-old kid......\n\nBottom line, ido66667: your study of physics should include practice at NOT doing the above. So by all means, read up on some suspicious theories and see if you can find out what\u0027s wrong with them."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T04:48:22Z","Content":"No. The astronomical observations available at the time Einstein formulated General Relativity indicated that the universe was not expanding. This was simply because the measurements were limited to our own Galaxy (which is not expanding). It wasn\u0027t until later on that Hubble got the distance and velocity measurements of external galaxies that showed that the universe is expanding.

This was simply because the measurements were limited to our own Galaxy (which is not expanding).\n\nAnd that was a mistake on Einstein\u0027s part. When the formulas don\u0027t square with the observable results, there are ALWAYS at least two possibilities: either the formulas are wrong, or the observable results are wrong. Einstein didn\u0027t bother to ask. Mistake.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So Einstein was just trying to make sure his theory matched the then-known observational data.\n\nThe history books state pretty clearly that this wasn\u0027t Einstein\u0027s motivation for the Cosmological Constant. He believed in a static universe. Pretty much everybody did at the time; the thought of a non-static universe made people uncomfortable. When the concept of the Expanding Universe was first brought up, people didn\u0027t merely reject it--they refused to even look into the possibility that it was true.

You might also say if there are any particular areas in physics that interest you.\n\nThe old Feynman book you mention was probably *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*, which comes in three volumes. It was published in the sixties, and they are showing their age a little, but I would still recommend them for a reader with a moderate level of physics.\n\n*Landau and Lifsh* *itz*, as recommended by K^2, is also excellent, though as he says it is very maths intensive. I would think of them as a more advanced text, because of that. If you have sufficient maths knowledge I would recommend them. The earlier volumes are even older than the Feynman lectures, and the later volumes are younger, but in some ways they have aged better. It\u0027s also a very theoretical text, with less emphasis on applications of physics that I personally find interesting.\n\nIn first year at my university we used *Fundamentals of Physics* by Halliday, Resnick and Walker. It\u0027s more up to date than the other two, both in content (not that there\u0027s much to update at that level) but also in pedagogical approach. If you really want to learn to do physics, as well as learn about physics, the sample problems will be useful. It\u0027s a less advanced text than the other two.\n\nI actually found *A brief history of time* quite interesting when I read it as a teenager. I think I was in a minority there, though, and it\u0027s not really a textbook. It also limits itself to astrophysics and cosmology, where the other books I\u0027ve mentioned are broader.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T20:10:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kermunist**\n  \nEdited because the forum censored a famous physicist\u0027s name!"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T00:29:34Z","Content":"Uh, since Feynman was mentioned, may as well link the free version of the lectures:\n\n[http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)\n\n(I\u0027m hesitant to recommend current textbooks because they tend to be hugely expensive.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Course of Theoretical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics) by *Landau and Lifsh* *itz*.
