A static universe was the prevailing belief at the time, mostly because it\u0027s easier to deal with emotionally. People wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging. Einstein did something stupid at this point, and he really should have known better: he theorized an additional, as yet unknown variable, called the \u0022cosmological constant\u0022 that would balance the universe and produce a static, non-expanding solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, Einstein grabbed a Magic Number out of thin air to get the result he WANTED to get.
