Just the way the contract system works. I toyed around with the idea of using Vessel ID to lock vessel to contract but the problem is that lots of people mass select tons of contracts at the same time, be a nightmare to listen to about 100 complaints about why this contract doesn\u0027t work? All because they selected a bunch of contracts at once to do with different vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrime example. You grab a Duna Contract and Eve contract. That would require 2 vessels. But you select both at same time and launch first vessel. No that first vessel is locked to both those contracts.

All it changes from 1.06 is how the Orbit Goal is calculated. What I\u0027m looking for is to make sure the orbit goal does not complete before your actually in orbit. usually this means going to another SOI like Mun or Minmus. Kerbin does not seem to be effected from what I can tell. Also if anyone can test to make sure the crash goal is working better now that would be great. As MCE gets bigger and bigger in code it gets harder for me to test everything reliably. Thanks for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think was happening is that when you launch your not in orbit. So kerbin was never effected, but when you went to mun or any other body your always in orbit of something no matter what, so the goal needed to be defined a little better. So now I added the target Body to the mix to make sure when it checks the orbit, its also checking the body its suppose to be. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I thought I had this set up in the original code, but it seems like it was not working so I moved some things around and will see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T10:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noio","CreatedById":119519,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T16:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eanyone want to test it out?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy to help.
