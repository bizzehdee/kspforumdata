A quick chart to show this in comparison with the stock engines. All regular props share the same curves, and the FS oblong tail jet uses the curves from the stock basic jet engine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VcJm4lL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VcJm4lL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is easy to recognize that the \u0022Nose engine \u0022(meaning the Firespitter props) performs significantly worse than any jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that the engines have vastly different thrust levels, and these charts only show factors of this efficiency. Running at 250m/s only yields half the original power of a prop engine already, steadily decreasing after that...that usually is barely enough to keep you steady, so you can expect speeds in the 100-200m/s area (that is with FAR, probably less without) for FS prop engines, which kind of restricts you already to low altitude flight (3-4km max) due to air friction and gravity overcoming your engine\u0027s power. The moderate ISP increase shown in the left chart is more of a theoretical nature. And it only affects fuel consumption in stock KSP anyway, IIRC. Only the big Lancaster engines can go faster and higher due to their sheer plus in raw thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese charts also show nicely why the stock turbojet has such a dramatic power boost on medium altitude (ranging from ~12-17km), as there lies the peak in atmospheric density and the usual air speed approaches the efficiency maximum of 1000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Bricked: If you have trouble with an unstable plane, it is 1000% easier to give you tipps if you provide a screenshot. Firespitter planes fly just fine with FAR, so it is very likely that there\u0027s a flaw in your design. Sometimes those flaws can be tricky to spot and seemingly minor, but have huge effects in the aerodynamics model of FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T10:37:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Senshi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snjo","CreatedById":57198,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T23:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Senshi Nice work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can probably tell from the curves above, I didn\u0027t put too much effort into making each engine different in those regards.
