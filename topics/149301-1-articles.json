It\u0027s immensely satisfying to use the cameras in Hullcam VDS to monitor Jool and it\u0027s moons. It\u0027d be super cool if we could detect reductions in light coming from other stars in the game as their planets transit them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s definitely possible to see eclipses and partial eclipses\u00A0of Kerbol by planets in the Kerbol system, but I\u0027m not sure the game would allow the player to detect eclipses of other stars by their exoplanets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone tried this? I don\u0027t think there is an existing tool in-game that would pick up the reduction in light. Maybe a new type of solar panel that is calibrated to show amount of energy produced (which would be vanishingly small) when pointed at other stars in KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
