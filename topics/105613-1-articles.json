Its basic function is to limit the amount of time that can pass before the game forces the video card to draw a new frame (if it hasn\u0027t already, of course), sometimes waiting for it to catch up, if need be. I\u0027d suggest trying it on lowest setting and then highest setting, and seeing which is more like the gameplay you want, and then fiddling with it a little more to see if you can find a sweet spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had Max Physics Delta all the way to the right (0.03). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i have it all the way to the left (0.12) and the ingame clock stays green, but the stutter and audio glitch is still there and seems more severe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T06:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, neither is the gameplay that i want and i can\u0027t find a sweet spot where it is better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T06:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this a steam or standalone version of KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso can you please use Process Explorer (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx\u003C/a\u003E) to monitor CPU, Memory and GPU usage during your gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome time ago I help a guy which was expiriencing similar problems but with different game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case the cause was the fact that for some reason games textures were saved into GPU Shared Memory (part of system ram that was made available for graphics card in order to extend its memory capabilities) instead into dedicated GPU Memory (the actual physical memory of the graphics card).
