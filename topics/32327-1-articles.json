As far as I know. o.O You can accelerate time forward (obviously...) but not backwards. I can look into having a negative timeStep but I doubt it will work. Theoretically you can go backwards in time, but actually retrieving data that was trashed by time moving forwards will be very impractical if not impossible. It\u0027s much easier to create new data based on data you currently have, but extrapolating data backwards can only go so far before it doesn\u0027t accurately reflect the data that existed at a certain point in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to your problem should be quicksaving after each node is performed, that way you have a backup for accidentally going too far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T20:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess just F5 and F9 for the quicksaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to copy Save files, in order to make true save states? This way if in the process of doing a mission it becomes un-survivable, or stranded, I can always revert to a different save-point in the past. Or is that too far from realism for KSP? I love the realism, but I SUCK at planning. So too often I find I make it most of the way to where I\u0027m going and run out of fuel, or I forgot the electronics, or batteries, or struts, or docking ports, or the wrong sized docking ports.... you get the idea. Most of my planning stage is just \u0022Here, I want to try this and see what happens.\u0022 But I don\u0027t want to destroy all my hardwork (ie: my space station or existing missions) by moving them to a different orbit only to strand it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, if I have to use QuickSave for the small errors, I still have a good save-state for big errors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T20:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s two ways to do this, effectively. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
