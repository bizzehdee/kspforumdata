Fuel bar-graphs in the staging list on the left side don\u0027t take into account shared fuel sources. For instance, let\u0027s say you have a tank in the center with no engine on it, and 4 radial tanks of the same size as the center one, each of which has an engine, all drawing fuel from the center with fuel lines. When the center tank is depleted, all 4 engines show as having 50% fuel left, when you\u0027ve only consumed 20% of your fuel supply. It doesn\u0027t take into account that the 4 active engines will only each get a quarter of that center tank\u0027s fuel, and instead shows the bar graph as though all 4 engines get 100% of it, each. So they don\u0027t give you an accurate representation of capacity/duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Micro-freezes in the VAB while working on larger ships.

Nav ball and resource panel reset back to being stowed away. I would like for their state to be persistent in the save files.

The \u0022control surface\u0022 parts always default to connecting perpendicular to the wing you place them on. WHY?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The textures for the \u0022Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank\u0022 look dated and out of place. The \u0022steel drum\u0022 look doesn\u0027t match the more NASA-like appearance for most of the other parts. I don\u0027t mind it as much on the \u0022Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank\u0022 since that one tends to be only useful for landers and the like, but on rocket stages, the riveted steel look doesn\u0027t match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. The black areas of the textures on the new 3.75m parts don\u0027t align with snap-positions. I always try to use the textures to help me place struts and fuel lines evenly, but they\u0027re slightly rotated off center on these larger tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.

Now that we have 3.75m parts, with a lot more mass, I feel like we need a double-sized RCS block, so we don\u0027t have to spam lots of little ones to make a large ship turn. Probably also a double-sized Sepratron, for the same reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.

No actual wheels inside?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. I feel like we need 3.75m versions of some of the things we enjoy in the smaller sizes currently: A low-profile (flat) adapter (in addition to the cone adapter); RCS tank; bi/tri/quad adapters; etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.

Some related things are grouped together, others not. Once you memorize where everything is, it\u0027s not a huge deal, but shouldn\u0027t this make more sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15.
