Simple, but a bit difficult. To finish? You need to pick one kerbal, and crash land near KSC. But, from there you have to get to the North Pole. However, since you\u0027ll likely need KIS and TAC life support mod, you\u0027ll have to make runs to your kerbal. This challenge is over when you reach the secret UFO easter egg in the arctic. From there, you may rescue your kerbal or try to walk him back. You cannot use a rover or spaceplane to get to the arctic, you must do this on foot. Note that you can get into a plane or rover to get food, but not to use it in your journey for any other reason than to resupply your kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you need TAC Life Support for KSP 1.0.2 and KIS for KSP 1.0.2. Note that Kerbal Konstructs and Kerbin-Side are optional mods you can use to set up a base in the arctic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget that you cannot use timewarp at some points, because you might crash into the terrain and have to send another kerbal. You CAN, however, fly or drive your kerbal to where you died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get to the mountains in my first run, using a bit of timewarp, I accidentally crashed my resupply ship into my kerbal. Second run, I got a bit further, but to challenge myself, I set up some turrets in the mountain area. I nearly died by the turrets, but, when I sent in a ship to draw the turrets\u0027 fire, my kerbal got hit and died. The ship was shredded, but I managed to use my parachute and RCS pack to save the kerbal going to resupply Edzer Kerman. However, Katuki was taken down by an orbital launch platform near the mountains. Also, Katuki is one of the most experienced pilots, next to Jeb, that I mainly use. So, now I\u0027m between a rock and a hard place. Jeb is on EVA at Duna, he\u0027s stranded though. Bill was killed earlier because his parachute didn\u0027t deploy. And, Bob is on a mission at Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to save Jeb and Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T04:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mrherponaderpsherp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENeeded\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T00:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh god, I don\u0027t think anyone has the time for this.
