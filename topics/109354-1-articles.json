Got it from the KSP homepage. Always been able to download a fresh copy. As long as you have your information from when you got it and where (KSP Homepage, Steam, ect...) them you should be able to get a fresh copy of the latest version when ever you need to. Since I run a lot of mods, I find i need to do a fresh install on occasion do to game corruption cause I messed something up on the install of said mods.

I have always just grabbed the latest version on the home page and have never used the launcher itself, instead just useing KSP.exe to start my game. Off the top of my head tho I don\u0027t think the launcher itself checks for mod updates, just updates to the core game. I just troll the forum here and watch for updates on the mods I like.
