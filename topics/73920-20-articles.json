I saw a post where you mentioned adding that, and thought you had in the latest download. Might not be this mod then. Additional info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. 32-bit Windows, with other mods on ship (RealChute, TAC LS, Deadly Reentry, but no major parts mods like KW or B9 installed in game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Looking at the messages tab before switching to the ship, it does look like a fuel leak was reported, so it must have happened just before switching sway from the ship. So the randomness part of this is answered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Here is the log file from just after the ship spun itself apart, sending the capsule on a very fast out-of-SOI trajectory. Interestingly, the ship is stationary for a very short bit before it starts spinning (it doesn\u0027t spin from the very start). At this point I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s not your mod, but if your eyes see something wrong...(log file sent to your outlook email address). Thanks for the quick response.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T00:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I just replied.

I\u0027m betting that is the problem (because of a design thing I did with batteries inside a modular girder segment and a goo canister mounted outside the girder segment) and it is nothing to do with the DangIt! mod. It\u0027s just the leak and the spinning happened at the same time and led me to the wrong conclusion. Thanks for the timely response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Nope, not that either. Problem ended up being that the save file had SAS turned on, so reloading seemed to cause all sorts of torque. Turning it off in the save file fixed the problem.
