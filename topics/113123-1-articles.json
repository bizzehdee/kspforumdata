Nothing you unlock will give you a full-fledged \u0027mission planner\u0027 like the type you are probably envisioning.

Since playing this career i have pretty much ignored maneuver nodes when transfering but they are extremly usefull for setting up early career \u0027free-return\u0027 flybys (you basically do not have to use fuel to return to Kerbin) and are almost essential for rendesvous and rescue work. Eventually you just have to have them, but for a long time you can indeed just eyeball flybys by burning prograde when Mun/Minmus are above horizon (or even eyeball it using the map). Minmus is a touch trickier since you have to match inclination once you eject from Kerbin, but it\u0027s a cheap maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnway, lvl3 Mission controll gives unlimited contracts (up from 7 at lvl2), and lvl3 Tracking station allows asteroid tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something that can be done to simulate planetary transfers at least. It requires that you place a small probe just outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, then once it\u0027s a bit away from the planet, match Kerbin\u0027s orbit as best as you can. The probe will lead or follow Kerbin at a short distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you want to do some \u0027flight planning\u0027 switch to this probe and place a maneuver node along it\u0027s path to check what kind of Dv you might need, how long the trip will be, and where can you expect to find the target. When using this method allow for the fact that the probe is already outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI and whatever you intend to launch will have to bother with escaping it\u0027s gravity first and will thus be late. It can still give a rough idea of what to expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a feature that is missing from stock KSP. It\u0027s silly that only a vessel that is already in orbit of something can use maneuver nodes to plan course changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:34:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cwalrus","CreatedById":146367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips - but the question remains: So far, I can\u0027t see that Level 3 Mission control has done anything, other than unlimited contracts...
