Here come a rescue mission with a habitat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mode7","CreatedById":40585,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T14:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost did the same thing. I built a little munbase but I wanted a kind of lifeboat for the guys on the mun, something that could get them all home in a hurry. Built a massive lander that seats 8 and returns to Kerbal in two pieces. nearly crushed the munbase with the lifeboat on landing. Had to snatch the controls away from MechJeb at the last second and do a manual landing. Close call but no injuries, did roast one of the solar panels at the munbase though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grand Lander","CreatedById":31521,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T11:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh dam ills going to take control but i though it would make it lose power faster and dropp plus before landing i was looking for the panic button lol Failed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
