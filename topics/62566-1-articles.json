The idea is that you wouldn\u0027t create a new part in the VAB, but the game would automatically convert an object you get to space into one part. It would keep a list of all the parts and allow you to select one part and separate it from the rest of the ship (not detach, but make it a separate part, not a part of the main craft) so that it could be used properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it would have some major limitations, mainly physics. This would mean that if you are in, say, 500m range of your 20000 part station, it would convert that one part into all those 20000 separate parts if you moved too fast (so that crashing into it will still only damage it, not atomize the whole thing). Alternatively it would check which direction you are going in so that it could only convert some sections into the original parts, meaning that the game wouldn\u0027t crash every time you accidentally miss the \u0022x\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot more details that would have to be worked out, but I\u0027m not going into them just yet. At first I would like to hear if this could potentially work at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t expect it to become a part of the game, but rather a plugin and/or something to consider for KSP 2. But I will still hope that this idea would work and will be introduced one day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
