I\u0027m playing a heavily modded (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E lists 113 mods) game on very hard difficulty: i.e. hard settings with some additional challenges. I use KCT, CommNet (and RT 2.0 for signal delay when it\u0027s out), life support, etc. I never quicksave or revert flights (except maybe if there was a kraken), so it\u0027s nearly as realistic as it gets without becoming too tedious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not one of the artsy and beautifully written fanfics with a rich story and carefully scripted drama.

This is going to be just a sort of a glorified what-did-you-do-in-KSP-today thread, which may or may not coincidentally be an interesting reading. I may get bored of it at any moment, decide to start a new game again or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, without further ado...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFirst Things\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KFRt3qc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KFRt3qc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nARGUS opened its doors on day 1 of what they called \u0022the first year of space era\u0022. At the\u00A0press conference, they revealed that the full name of the company was Argus Flying Things Corp.\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0 Gene Kerman\u00A0explained that this pretty simplistic name (and also slogan) was a necessity because words like \u0022rocketry\u0022 or \u0022spaceship\u0022 were yet to be invented. The new company\u0027s mission was to become the biggest and most successful space program on Kerbin. This was a great challenge, but the creativity of Argus\u0027 engineers and courageousness of its astronauts gave grounds for optimism as well as the fact that there were no other space programs on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fILvy7S.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fILvy7S.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first missions were very usual and even boring, with occasional fun moments when the rockets went bang. On day 117, Argus managed to launch the first satellite into low Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rw6QGUc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rw6QGUc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA relay satellite was successfully launched some 80 days later. Then an argument arose between Wernher von Kerman and Jebediah Kerman about the nature of the next mission. Wenher wanted a fly-by of the Mun while Jebediah was eager to fly to space himself. After a heated discussion, several broken plates and an intervention of Gene Kerman, it was agreed to do both historical missions simultaneously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the Mun mission was to be launched earlier. First, all the necessary technologies were already in place for it while the engineers were still developing a manned (or kerballed?) pod for Jeb. Second, it would take several weeks to build each craft and the prepare for launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225MXQcef.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5MXQcef.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun Visitor, officially designated P004, launched without problems and entered the\u00A0parking orbit while Argo (the manned ship) was still under construction. The Argo\u0027s launch was further delayed a day because the engineers had to fix an issue with its on-board computer systems. While they were working, Mun Visitor left the orbit and went toward the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, on day 232 of year 1, Mun Visitor reached the Mun, provided valuable scientific data and crashed into\u00A0its surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y8lSYLp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y8lSYLp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very same time, Jebediah climbed into the small command pod of Argo, waved his fellow kerbals goodbye and made a speech, apparently, about importance of space exploration or something (Jeb forgot to switch on the microphone and nobody heard what he said, but no one dared to ask).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GVzXCkB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GVzXCkB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Argo took off, but the launch was marred with issues. First, the antenna\u00A0was torn off by the incoming wind. Then the rocket failed to make the correct gravitational turn because its only \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine lacked a gimbal and command pod\u0027s controls were not strong enough to steer the craft. But Jeb\u0027s prowess and coolness allowed him to turn the rocket in the opposite, western instead of eastern, direction, drop the first stage\u00A0and reach space. The mission control room burst in applause when Jeb reported, over the auxiliary radio transmitter,\u00A0\u0022Periapsis seven-two kilometers, orbit established,\u00A0cutting engine\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220g6QU4v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0g6QU4v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter one orbit, Jebediah was instructed to burn retrograde and lower periapsis to 55 km. The Argo reentered atmosphere and began burning. Something was apparently off because, even after expending all the fuel on the second stage the heat was excessive. Ship\u0027s external systems burned one after another: thermometer, the rump antenna, and the solar panel. Fortunately, the parachute and the capsule itself were much more heat-resistant and survived the reentry without a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xwDJAXm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xwDJAXm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Argo\u0027s command pod opened its chute and slowly descended into the sea near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Jeb would later brag about his skillful navigation that put the ship \u0022next door\u0022 to his living quarters, but the truth is, it was a pure coincidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X39KFlj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X39KFlj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus ended the day 232 of year 1 of the Space Age.

What was the plan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The goal was to have a kerbal fly by the Mun and return home. The death of Valentina was unplanned\u0022, admitted Gene. He looked upset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals generally take death lightly. They believe that the entire universe is just a computer game and even if you die, you will resurrect again in another playthrough. But losing an astronaut and a friend was still an unpleasant, perhaps even tragic event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, let\u0027s start from the beginning. How did the launch go?\u0022 asked one kerbal at the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The launch was nominal... Almost\u0022, Gene replied. He continued, \u0022There were some issues with the first stage control and we could not recover the second stage as planned.

Sorry. The first problem was that Crescent arrived ahead of the Mun.

When correcting the trajectory, the ship ended up outside Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, but again on the wrong side of it. Her orbit was higher than the Mun\u0027s, not lower.

It was also considered too expensive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, did the ship burn up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene responded after a pause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It went into the atmosphere three times. In the first reentry it spent all the fuel and lost the last stage. Without propulsion, there was almost nothing Val could do. In the second contact, we lost the thermometer and the main antenna. In the third entry we lost the ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why only the third time?\u0022 kept asking the commissioner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At every reentry the craft lost some speed and some ablative shielding of the command pod.
