If you say it drives off on its own after hitting the ground, then it sounds like there is a lot of force that is being sent into the wheels on landing (especially with sepratrons). If the brakes are locked, it might be too much for them to take, but just shy of causing catastrophy without them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try testing your rover by itself, without the touchdown. Launch it, lock the brakes and activate sepratrons. It\u0027ll probably rip the gear off, but I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also try turning on brakes after you hit the ground. If you\u0027re doing this landing with two ships, you can hop between the two of them. Have a probe core on the rover (or a kerbal), switch to it right before/after it touches down and activate the brakes after the sepratrons are done. Then you can switch craft again while it stops itself. (Watch out for going beyond 2.5km from your ship in flight.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You can switch craft with the bracket keys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T17:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate to ask, but if you\u0027re firing it forwards with sepratrons, how do you plan on getting to it after you land?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
