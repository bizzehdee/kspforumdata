I got this mission to put a probe in keostationary orbit, so I created a probe after taking the contract, put it in space, and then I realised I forgot the thermometer. Fortunately I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I sent Bob up to rendezvous and bring one. Attached it, took my repairs team back to the ground, and finally, I put the\u00A0satellite in the correct orbit. As you can see in the screenshot, it ticks off all the requirements, except for the first one that says it needs to\u00A0be a new unmanned probe that has an antenna and can generate power. Well, ok, sure, it was originally missing the thermometer, but it definitely was a new unmanned probe that I launched after accepting the contract, and it has an antenna and it can generate power, so that requirement should have been fulfilled, right? I tried changing the name and vessel type as this had helped me in the past with similar problems, but it didn\u0027t work. Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022-OnupYTRgJrhXEyijIBsWM29mixJhtw54rT_FwdE\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022944\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OnupYTRgJrhXEyijIBsWM29mixJhtw54rT_FwdEqAX13C4-zL0QHxdmvKqnE4s7HDlZui43=w1920-h985\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T09:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126178-ninjawafflesofdoom/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022126178\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126178-ninjawafflesofdoom/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ninjawafflesofdoom\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can\u0027t see that picture, just a bunch of text.
