The canyon area of the mun is a hotbed of sci.

There is a lot of science on the ground in KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to NikkyD, I typically do no recycle a crew on Kerbin system orbits more than 4 landing missions. You can make the game more realistic by switching out crews on refueling missions an send your spent crews back with sci data. One effective way to do this is to collect them in LKE and then return them back as one group, this way you don\u0027t have to carry chutes and HS to the science objectives. In addition you can carry extra fuel and use this to retrograde break on reentry (at very low entry angle) with a complete science package and conduct science on th ground on Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally keep enough retro fuel on reentry to at least slow my craft down to a speed that its SAS keeps it from tumbling. Also, I also add one crew capacity for each crewman year in orbit. This means for a 5 year mission would set a baseline of one capsule and one storage container. If a minimal Gilly mission takes 2 years then you Since a minimal science mission wants a MPL you need to have on pilot and one sci; the cap has 3, MPL has 2 and so i add one storage container. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe eve landing mission is basically suicide so 1 year of supply per crew i all that is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grumman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grumman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E needs to be an overpowered source of Science, or we wouldn\u0027t get anything done!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is 1% inspiration \u0026amp; 99% inspiration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can however get \u0022Science\u0022 on the cheap from the american association for the advancement of science and place it on your coffee table for the admiration of the uninformed. :^)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strigon","CreatedById":123021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is 1% inspiration \u0026amp; 99% inspiration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eerm...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NikkyD","CreatedById":97466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginal from Thomas Edison \u0022Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:32:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grumman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grumman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E needs to be an overpowered source of Science, or we wouldn\u0027t get anything done!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still think you can get way to much Sciencepoints early on before you leave the Kerbin System \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny time based mechanic is OP if you timewarp forward 200 days...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Two","CreatedById":144535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NikkyD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NikkyD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s because you don\u0027t have cost per month, so time is free.
