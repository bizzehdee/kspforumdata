The Munar Module is a little bit over-fuelled, plus I forgot to add RCS (these will be fixed for future missions) but I got the craft to work. Next job is a Skylab analogue launched on the same booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/U9x0L\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The size of the Munar Module meant a 3.75m launcher was needed. With the revised aero model in 1.0, I\u0027ll probably be making more use of these parts- in previous versions I tended to just mount several 2.5m stacks side by side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
