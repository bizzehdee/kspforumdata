For example, the nuclear rockets developed by NASA (at least the way I understand it) super-heated liquid H2, then expelled it more efficiently than the combustion of the same mass of H2 with O2. This means that no oxidizing agent would be needed. If this was implemented in the game, the nuclear engine wouldn\u0027t need oxidizer to work, and that volume/mass could be used to take more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the \u0022tweakables\u0022 feature lets you change the initial state of parts, It would be easy to allow players to set propellent mass/volumes at construction, and provide defaults for all of one type or all default 9:11 ratios, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, please don\u0027t confuse this with a \u0022resource harvesting\u0022 mechanic, e.g. you have to gather the different propellants.
