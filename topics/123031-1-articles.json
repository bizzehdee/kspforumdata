Not sure if that would result in burning up all the fusion fuel it just mined or not, tho. Either way, I think a spaceplane is a poor choice for that. Highly unmanageable heat loads, and that\u0027s without trying to sort and liquefy He3 or Deuterium. He3 is incredibly hard to keep liquid, and Deuterium isn\u0027t much easier.
