Having flown 10\u002B years of IL2 series it shows the \u0022AI\u0022 just uses the same routines over and over but lacks intelligence. \u003Cp\u003ECall me a sore loser, but I will not compete in a future tournament unless my idea has been implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo hard feelings though, but it\u0027s like having a football match with an arbiter which is a member of one of the teams. It creates a funny feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AI uses a set of routines over and over again, that is true, but I did not say my AI was smarter, I said that the strategy I used when setting up the parameters was crucial on the battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not an AI side strategy, but a design strategy, it\u0027s different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may notice that regardless of how dumb the AI of the BDArmory version being used, my airplane constantly boom-and-zooms, it was hard to have it to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to know more about your idea, and I am convincing a lot of improvements that would also help making this challenge more interesting, esp. on FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sending you my craft via PM right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point of the tournament, good crafts are going to lose, that is normal, you can always improve them for the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to pick up a pace on this and be able to run a tournament very fast, this first one is just a test and my life was not stable enough for me to do that, until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what is your idea?
