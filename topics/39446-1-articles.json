At first, this forum was okay. Everything was just fine. But over time the moderators have transformed into what they are today: absolute screwballs. Some of them close threads without giving a reason. How does the creator and/or commentors know what they did wrong and how to improve on it? It\u0027s like going to an artist and saying their painting sucks. No reasons, nothing to improve on. Same with these signature \u0022Deal With It\u0022 things they use when somebody violates the signature rules. At least tell them what they did wrong so they can opt for a different choice of words or find a way to shrink things down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a whole list of things I could write, but an essay big enough to adequately express and cntain all of my frustrations and hates would be at least 1 terabyte in size. Let\u0027s just say 50 to 75 percent of it would be a very passionate rant about chobit-389. The rest would be a very passionate rant on the cult mentality of this forum and how everybody\u0027s been convinced that this is the best community ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to be active on this forum, visiting 10-20 times a day, but I maybe visit twice a month nowadays. Here are some reasons why, quoted from people from that blog post you linked to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think another issue when using forums is the flock mentality\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6there will be one or two \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csenior posters\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 who have 36746364536 posts and therefore consider themselves experts on all things related to the subject, because, you know, who needs to be educated when you can copy and paste information off of Wikipedia to argue your point? Surely 36746364536 posts are equivalent to a college degree, lol. The problem is, a lot of the other forum users will sort of idolize these \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csenior posters\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and take everything they say as gospel.
