In the same video someone had scaled up some parts to near death star scale and had them rendering at a great distance, basically LKO distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is true would it be possible to make a small thin part and scale it up and attach it to some launch stability enhancers to make the \u0022tether\u0022 of a space elevator?
