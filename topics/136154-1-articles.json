Everyone at Squad has been busy with the pre-release in some way, and all the developers have spent last week tackling the most important bugs that we can fix or work around on our end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of the edge cases we tested and applied fixes for, came back again, under more extreme edge cases and some new issues got caught as well. We\u2019re very happy with the thorough testing and Felipe (HarvesteR) wants to thank everyone who\u2019s been participating in our pre-release. There\u2019s not a lot that gets past a group of testers numbering in the thousands, that\u2019s for sure. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMike (Mu) reworked the mesh creation of the fairings, much reducing garbage creation and thus speeding things up. Thanks to help from Brian (Arsonide) they pinpointed a method which sets the vessel\u2019s colliders up correctly as a cause of major lag. This system has been completely reworked and has much reduced staging and startup frame times. The fixes are currently in QA testing and will hopefully be part of a pre-release build shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETed (Ted) has spent a lot of time triaging issues with Mathew (sal_vager) and Steve (Squelch), ensuring the team has a steady stream of confirmed and reproducible bugs to be working. Steve has been delving into some problems that had been put to the side. Most notably, ATI GPUs on Linux are causing issues and there doesn\u2019t seem to be an easy fix. A workaround to get KSP into at least a playable state is being sought. Mathew has been mostly limited to housework on the bug tracker, looking for duplicate bug reports and confirming newly reported issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore bug fixes on Bob\u2019s (Roverdude) side. One of them is the concept of volume for all resources (this is not currently used in stock, but will be extremely helpful for resource-switching mods), the ability to configure resource converters to work on mass instead of \u2018units\u2019 and a hook to help with dynamic crew capacities in things like inflatable habitats, etc. \u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrian (Arsonide) put a lot into wheel collisions, and the issues that were arising from clipped wheels. A bug in our current version of Unity stops us from setting the wheels to ignore collisions with other parts on the same vessel, like we do with all other parts. This caused them to do some unpredictable things, but Brian found a solution involving layers that allows us to work around this limitation. He also re-exported all wheel models to have proper collision layers, so the individual parts of each wheel will not rub against each other either, which was also causing problems for players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathanael (NathanKell) fixed a bug in RCS where thrust was not properly clamped, and a combination of translation and rotation could lead to more than 100% thrust. Also fixed a longstanding issue where the reported KSPAssembly version was 0.24, now it\u2019s 1.1. Female kerbals are no longer going blue in the face (really!) and the docking tutorial had some cleanup. On the improvements side due to a kind code donation from stupid_chris we now have his Config Node. Extensions in stock; and save game files now store a list of the mods that have been installed and also which are currently active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaniel (danRosas) and Pablo (Paul_Amsterdam) have further refined the KSPedia screens.They had a look at the great work that Trigger did, and got their hands dirty on moving the layout around. All new screens should be available soon on the Pre-Release version. Right now Dan is working on the controller maps for consoles. Jim nailed out more and more typos and tweaks to improve the content. He is really happy with the way its shaping up and people can have a look at it all 150 screens as they are seen in the game here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/av8VK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/av8VK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill (Taniwha) put the finishing touches on the new UI controls and added some bells and whistles to the previously existing ones, giving modders a bit more control. In other areas, he fixed a bug that has plagued him since 0.19.1: green highlighted parts in my screenshots despite having hit F2. Now the part highlighting respects the state of the rest of the GUI. On top of that, he fixed a problem in the date/time formatting code that would throw exceptions if fed NaN time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathan (Claw) has been fixing up some of the miscellaneous graphics and UI bugs and some of the surprises including the sudden \u201Ccrewed parts can\u2019t hold any crew\u201D issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris (Porkjet) finished a new internal view for the Mk2 inline cockpit. He previously \u2018borrowed\u2019 the one from the other mk2 cockpit, but that became quite obvious with the new overlays because the canopy was too small to enable a decent view from the inside so the exterior model required some remodelling as well. It now has more and bigger windows and a bit more headroom. The door on the top is now replaced by a door on each side, to create even more room in the canopy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xBSxltI.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/xBSxltI.jpg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xnrcZMe.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/xnrcZMe.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKasper (KasperVld) is on study leave.

He previously \u2018borrowed\u2019 the one from the other mk2 cockpit, but that became quite obvious with the new overlays because the canopy was too small to enable a decent view from the inside so the exterior model required some remodelling as well. It now has more and bigger windows and a bit more headroom. The door on the top is now replaced by a door on each side, to create even more room in the canopy.\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xBSxltI.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/xBSxltI.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xnrcZMe.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/xnrcZMe.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow.....
