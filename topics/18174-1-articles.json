In this one we have the first lander in the MML series, the MML-1. This versatile lander requires MechJeb (you can take if off if you\u0027re a good enough pilot) and can land anywhere. It also requires the NovaPunch Remix pack, just like the Skylab II and Armstrong Station, for the actual landing engine. This lander is great for those who want a simple design or for beginners to the game.
