I\u0027ve never really found it extremely tedious (because I care more about going to more places than gaining science), but it\u0027s not that fun. It\u0027s often something I overlook when building crafts later in career mode (Because I have enough parts it starts to feel like sandbox mode in my head).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s a bold idea for a rework to the science system. And it makes science actually be science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, atmosphere science needs to be situation-specific. No cold goo at re-entry. Different speeds at each altitude yields different results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current Science currency is replaced with Knowledge. Knowledge is gained from Crew Reports, EVA Reports, Mystery Goo, and perhaps Camera Pictures. Knowledge gain is automatically changed to Reputation as it is released to the public and they see the awesome pictures/results/cool-stuff that KSP has discovered. How does it interact with the Tech Tree?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the Tech Tree is now split into Seven different separate trees. Command, Propulsion, Control, Structural, Aerodynamic, Utility, and Scientific. To advance in any technology, you have to actually do sciencey things to parts in these categories. Researching each category is done differently, but one thing is constant: All categories except for the scientific category can be somewhat researched whenever a part fails (explodes). IRL, when a part fails in a certain situation, it gives valuable information as to how to improve it. Part tests can also give plenty of research into those subjects. For instance, launching rockets will research propulsion, and flying at high altitudes with a basic jet will add research into aerodynamics. You can also simply divert Funding directly into R\u0026amp;D for ground testing. And remember, Knowledge is directly connecting to Funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about experiments? In the Scientific Category in the Tech Tree, there\u0027s several separate paths which represent the different types of experiments. Knowledge isn\u0027t the only thing gained from some experiments. Using Barometers, Thermometers, Gravioli-Detectors, and Seismic Accellerometers will fill out the in-game planet info tab. Materials Science and Goo research and things of that nature will help to develop structural parts, and help to develop MORE science experiments. Sample studies are unlocked in the tech tree, including Atmosphere Sample, Surface Sample, Liquid Sample, and Rock Samples. These help develop exploration-type tech, such as rovers. Finally, Crew and EVA reports can help to develop Command type systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about Reputation? Shouldn\u0027t it be meaningful? Well, negative reputation causes a slow decrease in funding over time. (Don\u0027t timewarp too much!) Positive reputation causes a slow gain in funding that tapers off at a certain point. Not doing new missions or doing cool new things will also eventually lower reputation. (Staying in LKO for decades (or in Kerbal Timescale, months/years), not doing anything and just timewarping for months to Eeloo or Jool. Not doing missions will only make reputation go as low as 0, not negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote I\u0027m not suggesting an implementation exactly like this, but something like it. What do you guys think? Would this be more fun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T23:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022that reddit post\u0022 data-cite=\u0022that reddit post\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy modest ship to Minmus consisted of a Mk1 pod on top of some fuel and an engine, on which 4 detachable \u0022science blocks\u0022 were strapped.
