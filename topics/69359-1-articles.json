Very kerbalesque. Just like anything it\u0027s a learning process. The fact that you got as far as you have only means you will get better with practice. Of the 600 hours I have into this game I\u0027d say at least 250 were put into refining this setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main rover is also a fuel tanker and weighs in at 12.3 tons fully loaded. I can do 23 m/s up steep grades and I\u0027ve had it up to 39 m/s after a down hill. That is with out the rocket thrusters. With the lab attached the weight goes up to 21 tons and the average top speed still stays 21 m/s (about 19 up hill).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes the wheels make a huge difference. Once you get the new rubber tired wheels you will notice a great increase in acceleration/braking and handling. The balloon wheels get very little traction. You inherit another problem though ... inertia tipping your rover forward on braking and popping wheelies on acceleration. Disabling the brakes on the front wheels will take care of much of the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem with going fast with large rovers is the terrain. The kraken has invisible tentacles every where on Mun and they tend to pop out and try and pitch the rear of the rover sideways which usually ends up with it flying over the terrain. I have had to learn to be a good pilot in staging mode to get it leveled out for the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinimus is much better terrain to drive on for the most part but the lower gravity does make any off camber turns or weird shaped ruts in the ground a bit touchy. So I limited speed to 15 m/s average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is awesome, good gravity with rolling hills. Almost like Kerbin. I have a feeling that I will be driving at higher speeds there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate: \u003C/strong\u003EOk had some time for some testing on Minimus, Duna and Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMinimus:\u003C/strong\u003E Very light gravity with a very high mass rover makes it pretty tricky. 15 m/s seems good for the combined system. Have to be real careful with brakes here. The lab likes to buck around if you put them on full ... a tapping was sufficient to calm this and using reverse worked very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDuna:\u003C/strong\u003E Is like rover was born to run here. 20 m/s plus average speed. Just had to watch making off camber turns at to high a speed and be mellow on the distance I let it fly off hill tops. Over all a total blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEve:\u003C/strong\u003E I was surprised at how well the system handled getting there landing and driving. The more gravity the more stable it is. Dropping them from sky cranes popped tires from full height. This was cured by simply lowering the gear first. Driving is amazing. Tons of acceleration and plenty of gravity to keep it stable at 30 m/s. High speed turning and not really much worries about catching air off hills. The biggest problem is the frame twisting from stomping on brakes. Using reverse and the gravity to slow down really eliminates this problem. Oh and I popped a strut from hitting terrain on the under carriage of the lab. No big deal since these rovers are over half strut any way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink it is time to wrap these up for download.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T16:16:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 04:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angvar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling... further comments\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angvar","CreatedById":107332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T02:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI uploaded the craft files and placed a link at the bottom of the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate: \u003C/strong\u003ESo far this set up worked well for the moons, Duna and Eve.
