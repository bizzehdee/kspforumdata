Welp...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF I WANTED TO SAVE I WOULD HAVE SAVED IT! I clicked \u0027Exit\u0027 not \u0027Save half built thing that probably isn\u0027t going to work anyways\u0027! If it is worthy of saving it\u0027s either finished and I\u0027ll give it a proper name or it is a functioning test and the game saves it anyways when I launch it. Additionally, I don\u0027t want to keep clicking an answer because often when I click \u0027Don\u0027t Save\u0027 it actually clicks through the dialog window and picks up something on the ship. Since I just left the scene it gets deleted... Between having my train of thought interrupted and my craft getting pointlessly wrecked, I\u0027m starting to get pretty angry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly sure the game did what you told it to do at some point, and I\u0027d prefer it that way. Is it a possible for a mod to suppress that message and just default the answer to whatever is set in a config?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: actually while I\u0027m asking for stuff, anyone know of good parts from any pack for balancing planes?
