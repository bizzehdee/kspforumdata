While it is great EVA practice and Jeb enjoys the experience, Bob is really starting to complain and balk at the idea of leaving the safety of the command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be little rhyme or reason, once I get back to the ship, I can re-board, climb up and down the ladder. Last night on a Minimus landing, I had difficulty transferring both Kerbals from the pod to the lander, but the actual EVA on Minimus went smoothly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it only happened with command pod and not the landing can for a while, but then Jeb invented the new sport of \u0022Mun diving\u0022 when going EVA out of my lander on a previous mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny hints?

With spacebar, he should just float away with almost no velocity. But if a part close to the door is trying to occupy the same space, the guy is sort of spring-loaded and will go BOING! as soon as you release his grip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ATSinged","CreatedById":59829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T16:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not releasing the grip (intentionally at least). However the part too close to the door theory seems pretty sound, I had a hard time placing the radial parachutes and I may have overlapped the door just a pixel or two. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll check it out when I get home and see if that is the problem.
