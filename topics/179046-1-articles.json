So if I have x2 warp on and you go to x4, I can see that you want x4 (It\u0027s highlighted) but the speed won\u0027t increase till I also select it. If you suddenly decide you need real time again you drop it back down and it would go to 1x, although you\u0027d still see the x4 highlighted from me unless I changed it. I could see that working for KSP, but only if the servers were limited to a small group of players; say 4 at most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-17T18:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2018 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadLeo","CreatedById":107972,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T19:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to formulate your first sentence in another way.

Yes, it is not the same thing, but it is something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerfect case scenario is we get a multiplayer KSP just as it is meant to be played. That is out of question, too, due to syncing timewarp problems. Next best thing is we get just what you said: a way to keep timewarp coherent among all players in the server. Alas, if that\u0027s not possible, even a multiplayer without timewarp would be something, in my opinion. Better than nothing, and a start for the development of the multiplayer system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I simply cannot see KSP multiplayer with too many players. I believe that due to the\u00A0characteristics of the game, it would be complicated to handle several players at the same time if they decide to go crazy on parts. I don\u0027t think KSP multiplayer, however it is implemented, if ever, would play as an open world massive online game such as, for instance, Planetside,\u00A0or Battlefield, which is something some people might expect or want. But it suits well the role of a game to be played in LAN with a few friends. It is not a very \u0022commercial\u0022 way to handle multiplayer, if I can say so, hence we don\u0027t see the devs talking about it. But, as a token gesture to the long term fanbase that has been asking for some solution to multiplayer, I think they could strap some form of it to some of their updates, or even to a DLC if it takes too much work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, their solution might not please everyone. But hardly anything does. Making History certainly didn\u0027t. Even the part revamp they do from time to time doesn\u0027t.

That\u0027s when you miss the picture. The fact that I disagree with you doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t consider what you said to be valid. Except when I point out that I don\u0027t consider a valid argument.

Even if the entire community disagrees with me, which apparently is the case, that only says the suggestion isn\u0027t going to be popular, which by itself may be reason enough for the devs to not implement it, if they ever consider it in the first place, but it says nothing about what I can or cannot propose and talk about. Fine that you consider the suggestion inappropriate for the reason stated above (the assumption it goes against the game theme), HebaruSan also does and stated exactly that, which I countered with reasons of my own. My arguments aren\u0027t more valid that yours, but as long as it is an opinion against the other and all that there is to them is numbers in one side or the other (which is exactly what the pool stands for, to count those numbers), there is no reason for me to ask the topic to be locked because of nothing more to add.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223470294\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179046\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539853827\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164179\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tyko\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Tyko said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EBS\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 or \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EPeer pressure\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 or \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Epassive aggressive\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 or a \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Ebad argument\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 or a \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Estraw man\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\u00A0 \u00A0- wow, did you realize you attacked my idea in at least 5 ways in just two paragraphs?

I am aware that there are other games out there. I don\u0027t think this is an argument because a) I don\u0027t want to play those other games; b) I think KSP is much more than what its surface shows; and c) I don\u0027t think the devs themselves would like this argument either, that in essence implies it is better for people that like the base game but want to extract more out of it to look for the competition rather than sticking with their product in what it can offer.

They denote expectations and entitlement (not in a pejorative sense, mind you, please don\u0027t take it as that)\u00A0over KSP that might or might not reasonably come from what devs let out when they communicate, and because I am not as active in the community as most of the people in this discussion, I cannot infer that with the degree of precision I would like to. But, either way, I think it is reasonable that people feel like that, they like KSP as it is and they will resist any changes they believe are counterproductive to their beloved game. I just don\u0027t think it is reason enough, on its own, to not discuss something. Again, devs may come and say \u0022yeah, it doesn\u0027t fit the game as we envision it\u0022, and then it\u0027s done, nothing more to add on the issue. But, on something so substantial and that have been asked in many ways and for many reasons since KSP came out, I believe it is important that we hear from them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-18T14:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2018 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by BadLeo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
