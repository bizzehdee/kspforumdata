Where problems occur is when two mods change some critical common game variable in ways that are incompatible with each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, though, I can see the possibility of the platform being run on (Mac, Linux, or Windows) having slight changes in the way code runs between them. And being one who has seen the \u0022dark sides\u0022 of MJ\u0027s docking AP, landing AP, rendezvous AP, and ascent AP, I can also understand Sarbian\u0027s frustration when his installation runs perfectly and ours doesn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll state here that I don\u0027t use the AR-202 part on anything. I add the MODULE to a number of my parts in their CFG files to both reduce parts count, and to give some of my stages the ability to de-orbit themselves after putting a payload into orbit. This has worked out well most of the time. Also, there were builds of MJ where the docking AP worked exceptionally well, if perhaps a bit fuel-inefficient with RCS. I\u0027ll take fuel-inefficient over non-working any day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use almost 30 mods in my installation, and I\u0027ve had good results in the past with MJ\u0027s AP modules. Right now, I\u0027m having great results with the ascent AP, especially after modifying the thrust vector range of some critical booster engines that weren\u0027t providing enough corrective vectoring. That was the cause of some wild aerial acrobatics with a few heavier designs. Now, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Eroutinely\u003C/em\u003E putting rockets into 200 km orbit with a starting mass of 1045 T, with ultimate destinations of Moho and Eeloo. I think this already surpasses the capabilities of the \u0022new\u0022 parts from the ARM kit, and MJ handles them without further trouble. BTW, Sarbian, I\u0027m using the \u0022Auto Tf tune\u0022 feature doing this, just limiting the top-end range value to 0.3, and leaving everything else at default settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least in Kerbin orbit, the rendezvous AP works in getting me to the target without crashing into it. I can even re-engage the AP to bring my chase ship in closer if I need to. The only issue I have with this AP currently is the four-step burn sequence (burn to phasing orbit, circularization, burn to target, circularization). But this is a minor thing compared to the problem with docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian knows I\u0027ve had issues with the landing AP for some time, and in a similar way to his frustrations with the docking AP, the LGAP works virtually perfect for me at Mun and Minmus, but fails completely when the very same lander design reaches Moho. If I knew there were temperature variables changing the way equipment behaves, I might understand. This may also be a FAR issue that I\u0027m not recognizing. What I do know is, previous LGAP modules worked perfectly at Moho, but the current code doesn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my installation, the docking AP seemed to be working reasonably well about 70 or 80 builds back (somewhere between build 150 and 170), but started to degrade thereafter. There was a series of builds where the response was quick and the accuracy was within acceptable reason. I\u0027ll try Sarbian\u0027s test of a small probe in LKO to see what happens. Sarbian, I\u0027d suggest testing a much larger craft to see if there are any issues with mass and/or balance. It\u0027s going to take a lot of testing on a variety of designs before some of these bugs are exterminated. A typical ship would be a Mk 1-2 3-seat command pod with a service module (good ole Apollo-style CSM) as a test vehicle. This would represent something more \u0022common\u0022 among all of us, since we have an absolute need to take our Kerbals to stations or other ships. See if this produces the anomalies we\u0027re experiencing. Also try embedding the MJ MODULE into these test pods instead of using the AR-202. There may be problems with embedding the module as opposed to using the part. Don\u0027t know, don\u0027t think there should be, but could be possible...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T20:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to report that Mechjeb worked flawlessly on the SpaceX CRS-3 launch today. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BARCLONE","CreatedById":76024,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T21:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I just went 3-for-3 with a small test probe design in LKO.
