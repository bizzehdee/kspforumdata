The second the ship touched the water the ship crashed dialog popped telling me that I had failed and everyone was dead. Except\u2026 no parts had broken. Not even the engine the ship landed on.\u00A0\u00A0The ship was still intact, clearly floating on the surface of the water. Both the command pod and the crew cabin were intact. So I don\u2019t know what triggered the dialog to pop, but there was no way to clear it once it did so I had to reload my save even though my kerbals had actually touched down safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m wondering now if something did break but it didn\u0027t render correctly or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
