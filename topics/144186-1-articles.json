I\u0027d been making USB saves for days, and it\u0027s gotten to the point now that I can\u0027t save without it becoming corrupted. Don\u0027t think this is an exaggeration. Over the weekend, it happened 15 times in a row. In a full day\u0027s play I managed to get one successful save which I immediately backed up to USB. It doesn\u0027t matter if I save manually, or get an autosave, exit my game manually or crash, the majority of the saves are corrupt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiterally, I\u0027ll go into my game, make some changes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and save, and it\u0027s corrupt. Or launch a rocket, get into orbit, save, and it\u0027s corrupt. I\u0027m afraid of trying to do anything time consuming or elaborate because I know that I\u0027m just going to end up doing it again after the save corrupts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"henny83","CreatedById":166581,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T15:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet again you have got me back to cringing, swear to god if I lose this save my next 40 dollars will be spent on a drug and std infested hooker so at least getting completely screwed ends in satisfaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: wonder how liquided my wife would be to see this post...it\u0027s gonna happen, love that excrements\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing been seeing alot of yall just put the ps4 into rest mode, even in game...cool cool, ummm let it completely sleep to here and there (aka turn it off ). \u00A0I\u0027m just saying I haven\u0027t had problems, other than normal crashes, and those happen mainly when I stream. \u00A0I really think any added stress makes this game even more unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr I\u0027m just lucky, playing with a loaded gun, pointed directly at my nuts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally? \u00A0liquided is sensored, this is a sad world we live in....urinate\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-20T16:07:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2016 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by henny83\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Maim","CreatedById":38222,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T16:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have just been granted a refund on the game from Sony. They are aware of the issue, and are informing their CSRs to be prepared for people to contact them. Further I have asked them to investigate the issue on their side, asking how the game make it through certification in its current state and follow up on the status of a patch. I\u0027m hoping that Flying Tiger will respond quickly and the matter is resolved, but I don\u0027t feel comfortable waiting for that to happen in good faith.

I own it on Steam already, and I fully intend to re-purchase it if/when the issue is resolved, but this port should have never made it through certification. The corruption issue was the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back, but there were other bugs too like frequent crashing, the lack of optimization, or occasional inability to edit maneuver nodes. I\u0027m hoping that questions will be asked, and issues addressed. If I were in your position, I wouldn\u0027t want these issues reflecting on me as the original developer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
