I have gotten so used to having mechjeb on my ships that I stopped placing any form of ASAS on my ships, and this caused a small problem. My ships would start to turn slowly either right or left, depending on how my rocket was rolling on its long axis. I started to think maybe it was a bug, then I remembered something. I had just given a tutorial to a friend on this game, and had not used mechjeb. I was explaining the various parts and keys associated with said parts, T for SAS/ASAS on and off, and F to temp toggle it and so forth. It never occurred to me that, the reason that ship never drifted off of the point I stuck it to was the fact I had ASAS turned on. You would think that since I have been playing this since just after .21 came out, I would know the basics of keeping an ASAS on hand lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, now, I just feel ashamed of myself for forgetting such a basic component. I first noticed this in a big way when I returned home from Moho and had a heck of a time steering under manual control for re-entry. Even with a 3 man capsule on, well, just look at the ship and you will see, even the SAS on that capsule is NOT enough alone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/31/lh7.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/large/31/lh7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lh7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously thought I had a problem with the game, as when I powered up for a deorbit burn, I chose to do so manually, which sparked that ship going every which way BUT home. I finally managed to get the orbital path to line up with Kerbin and then staged out to the capsule alone for landing. Then tonight, I tried to launch an Eeloo mission, a probe, and had NO ASAS on it, but mechjeb. It got squirrelly on me, and I thought I had a problem with KSP. Nope, just a really foolish self who forgot that if I want to fly manual, I need an ASAS on the stupid thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now leave this thread open to all of you, to fill in the ... on what we just need to sometimes do!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T10:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I don\u0027t like to depend on mods when I don\u0027t need to. It\u0027s like getting to work via autogyro. When you finally have to actually drive there, you suddenly notice you didn\u0027t allocate near enough time to do it, and you\u0027re forced to do 105mph down the breakdown lane with two tires up on the guardrail. And a moderately related point: Doing this is apparently illegal and they won\u0027t let you drive again for some months. The class they send you to is tedious and boring, and the \u0022free coffee\u0022 provided is dull and tasteless. The occasional pastry spread accompanying it looked dried and hardened enough to cut teak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my point here is if you have to drive to work, allocate the right amount of time and don\u0027t put two tires up on the guardrail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntonioAJC","CreatedById":16486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T10:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this is why I really don\u0027t like MechJeb and don\u0027t use it.

They should have enough force to turn the ship towards a heading (very slowly) and the engine gimbal should be plenty to keep it on that heading.
