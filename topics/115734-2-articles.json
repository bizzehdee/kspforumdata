No tanks that I know of for Real Fuels simulate insulation. \n\nHeat Pumps does because one of the parameters you can pass through will reduce the conduction rate between the exterior and interior (of any tank the HP part is providing cooling for). IRL the goal would be to bring heat penetration down to tens of watts instead of tens or hundreds of kilowatts.

(non-integral meaning the tank is mounted to the structure rather than FORMING the structure)\n\nBecause it\u0027s basically a vacuum bottle and only receiving heat through a very limited contact area (its mounting points) it has very little heat leakage. In fact, the Apollo\u0027s LOX / LH2 tanks actually required heaters IN the tanks to provide enough heat flux on demand to maintain tank pressure within a pre-determined cut-in/cut-off range.\n\nThe final insulation figures that I settled on were arbitrarily determined by Apollo service module base heat leakage. (i.e. before added heating was applied)\n\nThe following NASA document was a useful reference: [https://history.nasa.gov/afj/aoh/aoh-v1-2-06-eps.pdf](https://history.nasa.gov/afj/aoh/aoh-v1-2-06-eps.pdf) (pages 2.6-10 thru 15)"},{"CreatedByName":"stratochief66","CreatedById":59541,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-13T20:22:56Z","Content":"Still trying to work out how to get my LH2 tanks chilled on the surface of Mars.
