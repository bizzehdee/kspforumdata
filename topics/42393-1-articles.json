Thus the most efficient polar orbit entry is needed. For further efficiency one would capture into an elliptical orbit from minimum safe to max sensor range over a full set of latitudes (your Ap could be outside sensor range as long as you got from \u002B90 to -90 latitude on one side of the body at least). But honestly fuel efficiency is not that critical.

Ideally your sensor craft would complete N polar scanning orbits as the Mun completed one rotation where N is the number of equatorial hexes. The idea is to have no duplicate scans and no gaps. I think this is physically impossible (negative orbit altitude) but 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Mun rotation schemes are possible.
