More so looking forward to seeing Kerbal get city\\\u0027s and seeing there architecture, street planing (with the kerbal way of doing things with no Health and safety) will other parts of the planet heavy populated Mountain ranges, Probably wishful thinking but i would like to see tides on kerbal. Looking how the continents are now there would be some hellish tides. (sayign that the Mun is very far away so prob wouldn\\\u0027t have that much force)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts also good to see the community how it is now Mature and good hearted.
