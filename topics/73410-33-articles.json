But the ultimate effect is that players have not one, but two new dependencies- which happen to be notoriously difficult to install correctly.

You\u0027ll find some older engines without effects, but that\u0027s simply to do with the decision to make RealFuels engines derive from EngineSolver (which derives from ModuleEngineFX). You can use RealPlume, HotRockets, any of their custom setups or derivatives, or roll your own effects. Real Plume has some nice templates for you to start with, even. I do agree that it\u0027s a bit annoying to lose effects, but I\u0027m willing to deal with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ve not found SmokeScreen to be RAM intensive.
