Shouldn\u0027t require any changes to parts, they just use the toggle on/off action.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:04:24Z","Content":"Not a bad idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:19:32Z","Content":"Good idea!
