My last missions consisted of raising SCANSat satellites above Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. For this I have 2 stage rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) First stage separates while ascending. And then I use my second stage to reach orbit I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Then, I have 6 small SRB facing opposite direction on the 2nd stage. Once I am in the orbit I want, I face prograde (so that SRBs will face retrograde) and launch them while decoupling. This works fine, and 2nd stage loses speed and de-orbits it self. Works as described on Kerbin, and for Mun/Minmus I need to point a bit more to the side than retrograde, because otherwise debris just makes another orbit:).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 1) - Does this method sound ok? What could be improved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf 1) is ok, then this will work for all stages once I am orbiting object. However, if I will need to stage during interplanetary transfers, this wont work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 2) - What are the best means to destroy redundant stages while doing interplanetary transfers? Is it better to not design ships that will stage during the burn? Or maybe somehow aim, and once staged, debris will crash into something? (But again, what if staging is needed earlier..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think that careful rocket design will be the key to the success of this, as if you need to stage while doing burn, nothing will help.
