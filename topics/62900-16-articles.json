Any parts that are recovered from one rocket can be used in another. Basically, the more parts shared between rockets, the better. If all of your launchers use the same core parts then they will quickly become fast to build, especially if you can recover parts (either with parachutes or directly). You can also prebuild launchers and scrap them, to ensure you have parts in the inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two basic ways of reducing build times (other than upgrading build rates): using the same parts in many launches, and using recovered parts. The part inventory is the second part. The first part is unseen directly, but is tracked in the background. If you use a part in a build, a number is increased. The part cost is divided by this number before it is factored into the total cost (which is then square rooted). So using the same parts in multiple builds (aka, standardized launchers with similar core parts) will reduce build times (in fact, the 4th time you build a ship it will take half the time of the first one, assuming a new save).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T19:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ogamaga\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ogamaga\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe zip for that version is named MechJeb2-2.1.1.0-198\u003Cp\u003EI just updated to 2.2.1 in the past hour to 90 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a very outdated version you were using, so could be a significant cause of problems.
