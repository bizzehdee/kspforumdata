Though I have a few quick questions(More like 3 topics with multiple questions....) about messing around with it. (Oh BTW, my ability to do art is... no existent... especially electronic art.... so some might seem a bit silly... I apologize if they are)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The downloadable textures are not color coded to the water planets, so if I wanted to just paint a water planet a funky color, like change kerbin\u0027s water to orange, and ground to pure black, is there a simple way to do that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I noticed that the effects only happen above a certain altitude. If I did just change the color of the planets(see previous question) is there a way to make it permanent irrelevant of height? alluding to the previous example, if I was just coloring the water and terrain, it doesn\u0027t effect anything but how it\u0027s colored, no change in patterns, looks or anything just filtered into a new color(So it won\u0027t cause any issues with changed terrain and mesh misplacement), would it be possible to make it apparent at ground level?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What happens if I switch around the textures? Say I put the two Dres textures onto the Mun? will how the textures fit, change the mesh? is the mesh dependent on the terrain textures or completely irrelevant? Does the texture automatically resize itself to fit around the mesh? Does the terrain mesh fit onto one of the textures? Say if I somehow figured out how to make a planet bigger, would these textures still fit or would it cause issues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for your time for reading, and responding if you do so,\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T20:17:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by braininator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI forgot to add water to planets in the first topic\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amo28","CreatedById":82041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T21:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBumping this thread as another request for Universe Replacer 3.2 -- just a hope that someone still has it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fenderzilla","CreatedById":70047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T01:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://quenya101.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/barfing.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022barfing.jpg\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fenderzilla","CreatedById":70047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T02:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes anyone have female kerbal textures? even jeb gets lonely sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T02:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just gonna put this here... again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XQ8f5a1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XQ8f5a1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IfYcPHu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IfYcPHu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/cfah40r57rh74b1/Kerbals.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/cfah40r57rh74b1/Kerbals.rar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T03:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have 3.2 and does it work on mac?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simplicity","CreatedById":57473,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T03:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m just gonna put this here... again.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/cfah40r57rh74b1/Kerbals.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/cfah40r57rh74b1/Kerbals.rar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one suit I use all the time Zekes, thank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T03:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022amo28\u0022 data-cite=\u0022amo28\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBumping this thread as another request for Universe Replacer 3.2 -- just a hope that someone still has it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gojira\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gojira\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes anyone have 3.2 and does it work on mac?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a copy of it, but not sure how to get it to you (or if it is permitted for me to do so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to make sure I handle this properly, as Big Brother has His Unblinking Eye upon me of late. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amo28","CreatedById":82041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T15:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHahaha, Headhunter.
