It\u0027s just a shame the Summer Sale arrived at exactly the same time as the parts to build the machine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if 0.24 changes things considerably, it won\u0027t necessarily break everything. As far as I can tell none of the existing parts are being removed entirely so regardless of whether or not actual saves break, craft files will probably work fine. Obviously all progress on bases, infrastructure and suchlike is lost when that happens, but I often find the most time consuming and difficult part is designing rockets to do what I want them to do. With that in mind, design your SSTOs. If they break, that\u0027s a shame but at least you\u0027ll be better at making them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively either mess around with random stuff for a bit of time each day or wait for 0.24. I have times when I can\u0027t be bothered to do anything big but can happily spend hours doing smaller things like flying planes, crashing things into the KSC buildings, or doing some of the forum challenges (some of which actually take a while to do, both in terms of construction and execution). Waiting entirely on the basis that there is a new version coming out soon isn\u0027t something I see any sense in (I don\u0027t understand the idea of spending the entire time between updates waiting for the next, but that\u0027s just me) but if you have other games to play you could just play them for a while.
