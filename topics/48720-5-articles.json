I had always hoped this point in the development of KSP would bring RT into its own, whenever it occurred. The devs understandably went with the simple solution to maintain their gameplay design (fun but educational and challenging, which it still is), but having the ability/need to build a communications network before going off into deep space is what we did on Earth and it makes sense to do something similar for KSP for those who want that extra level of challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I thought of that I\u0027d like to request for future consideration is a \u0022base station\u0022 dish that is designed to be only deployed on the surface/landed and can act as a Deep Space Network or off-Kerbin base \u0022prime\u0022 communications node that would have a large power requirement but would also allow for a higher/faster transmission rate for large amounts of data. Personally, I\u0027d make it something that can be deployed by a Kerbal picking it up and planting it or that a robotic arm/crane can do the same to (i.e. via KAS) instead of it needing to be attached to the vehicle and some complex deployment animation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T15:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESignal Delay is implemented, it\u0027s just switched off until I finish the flight computer in a future release.
