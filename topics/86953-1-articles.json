The original plane had it\u0027s COL in front of the COM, but now this new plane has a far lighter cargo (the first variant used a 2 ton crew module, this one has a total .75 ton cargo, both mounted directly behind the cockpit). Can anyone tell me what the difference is if the COL is in front or back? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T13:33:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 01:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SelectHalfling0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T12:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can imagine all forces acting on, or around, the CoM. A force going directly through the CoM will push the vehicle in that direction, out of line it will tend to rotate the vehicle. So if all your engines are above the CoM they\u0027ll be pushing the top of the vehicle more than the bottom, making it tend to tip nose-down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoL works the same - if it\u0027s behind the CoM it will tend to make the plane nose-down, if it\u0027s in front it will tend to make it nose-up (off to the side, the plane will roll, etc.). While a plane that wants to go up sounds good in practice it makes the vehicle to prone to flipping which is why standard designs put the CoL just behind the CoM - too far and it\u0027ll be too hard for other things like wings/control-surfaces to counteract and the thing will never get off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T13:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the clarification!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff to build MOAR spaceplanes!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T16:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the tiny spaceplanes I build with the MRS mod and its mini jet engines, those things are very cute!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a cool little drone testbed which I use to go straight up, fly level, run test, land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
