It wasn\u0027t my first, but it was the first special-made to leave Kerbin orbit and park in Minmus orbit. My first two attempts used the standard docking ports, and were far too wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, I planned it in two major sections. The first, humbly termed the Space Station Delta Core, consists of a tug module, a lab/solar module, and a 4-nuke interplanetary drive module. Each section was launched separately, assembled in LKO, and then the whole thing driven out to Minmus. Result, assembled section orbiting at about 1.4M meters over Minmus. No problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell slight problem. Doofus left the RCS on during warp and we\u0027re out of mono-propellant. But still, it all works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection two I got a bit more... optimistic about my abilities. This one consisted of three separately launched subsections. Front-to-back: A tug with a Sr/Standard docking port transition and mono-propellant module, an 8-nuke interplanetary drive module, and a five-Jumbo-64 fuel module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a lot of tweaking on the launch vehicles to ensure the nuke drivers wouldn\u0027t bake the fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://daveworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot251.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot251.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot section two components in LKO. Check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://daveworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot257.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot257.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssembled with a bit of frustration. Check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://daveworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot258.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot258.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest fire. All systems go. Wobble minimum. Here\u0027s that baby in transit to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://daveworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot259.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot259.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet it to Minmus orbit. No problem. Orbiting about 100km above section one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempt to match planes. Wayyy too much wobble for accuracy. So I figure, let\u0027s just do it in pieces. Decouple the fuel section and the driver/rcs modules from the tug. My intent was to spin the tug around and pull the driver from the long end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBig mistake.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, before performing docking maneuvers, I hit F5 to quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBigger mistake.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) 8-Nuke Driver Module has a probe core. And it has fuel. And engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt now has no solar nor batteries. It was using the launch vehicle power at LKO. And the tug power in transit. Oh man. Well no problem except...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) 8-Nuke Driver Module now has no functional SAS. (See #1) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The fuel module has no control either, and it managed, somehow, to bump the drive module and set it to ROTATING LIKE A PINWHEEL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I sit, in my nifty little tug. And I just quicksaved, and I\u0027m watching the Wheel of Death rotating a few meters in front of me. The one that contains all that nifty mono-propellant that I ferried out here. And the 8-nuke drive section full of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my fuel module, with four/five full jumbo-64s, is now slowly flying off in the other direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few minutes crying in my beer, I think to myself, maybe I can manage this. I am an absolute, utter, imbecile that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat followed was two hours of seizure-inducing, baldness-initiating, coronary-risking repeated attempts to dock with a spinning, asymmetrical module with the long-end swinging around like a battle axe. I won\u0027t lie, I turned to MechJeb for some of the maneuvers, because I just couldn\u0027t do it alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took it in baby steps. Halt velocity relative to the spinning wheel of death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInch forward just shy of battle axe end. Stop and consider next steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI died a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI F5\u0027d each time I felt like I made progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cursed some of those saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I managed to finesse a manually-controlled \u003Cstrong\u003Ecollision\u003C/strong\u003E that did no damage but slowed the spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I did it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, I managed a minimal relative rotation. MechJeb was of no use here. There was too much movement for him to adapt. It was up to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got in there, shoved my way in front of the short-axis docking port, and hit F5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen followed 30 minutes of hair pulling as I tried to manage fifteen degrees of movement (don\u0027t ask) at once. I\u0027m a noob at docking. It wasn\u0027t fun. I made about 20-30 attempts. I tried MechJeb again. He would line up properly, then go into a panic attack and hide in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, what did it was a combination of me and MechJeb. I\u0027d hit F9. Turn him on quickly and switch to CHASE camera. He\u0027d get me lined up, then start to go ape-poo and I\u0027d turn him off, turn on SAS, and hit H. Turn MJ back on, get a little closer, go ape-poo, turn MJ off, turn on SAS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse and repeat for those deadly remaining 5 meters with slight rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the screen refreshed on a united section, I wept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://daveworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot264.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot264.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wept man-tears, hugged my wife and children, and went out and got drunk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat fuel module can just go to Moho for all I care.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoustonDave","CreatedById":102118,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T01:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: Managed to dock that monstrosity with the other section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://daveworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot266.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot266.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeed to shuffle the bits for optimal use though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow.. wonder if I can go find those fuel tanks..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T03:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you know that if you go into warp for just a fraction of a second, all rotations are canceled?
