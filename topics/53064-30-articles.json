Vanilla KSP physics totally allow for very generous room to get very large payloads in orbit without much difficulty. So I think the biggest shock when switching over to RSS/FAR is that you really need to plan ahead and reconsider every single part of your payload. Do I really need this? Can I remove this part? Ever kg counts as it\u0027ll chew away at your final and total DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is TWR needs to be kept in check.
