Big time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Anyway I\u0027m having trouble making a decent rocket that will attain an orbit, the problem is thus: Lets say I have a 4 stage rocket.. or 3.5. So thats Large drives at the bottom, lots of fuel and SRBs as stage 1, stage 2 is 2 fuel tanks, liquid engine, stage 3 1 fuel tank liquid engine... However pretty much every time I detach to stage 2 my engines are broken. That is, they go grey when I try to light them. So I\u0027ll detach that useless stage and go to stage 3 but then I have the same problem.. Engines go grey when I try to light them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I can post some pics or make a little clip if that doesn\u0027t make much sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (Maybe this is the wrong forum, but I didn\u0027t think it was a bug so thought maybe here was the place..?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a clip to illustrate what I\u0027m talking about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSaIJQONNZA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cd7890","CreatedById":13,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T20:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat clip shows that fuel cant flow through SAS modules that would be your problem\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s20dan","CreatedById":1080,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T21:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrokeDiamond","CreatedById":39397,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T02:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you only wanted help with the engine problem, but there are several things wrong with the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, as for the rocket, the booster must be placed directly beneath the fuel tank. In the video, there seems to be an SAS module blocking the fuel. Place the SAS above the tank and it should work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, ships need only one SAS module in order to use autopilot. Using multiple SASs has no effect. And why not use the Advanced SASs? They can use RCS thrusters and work slightly better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thirdly, try using struts to connect your rockets together. Otherwise, they wobble around and cause your ship to fly off target, and waste fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"olex","CreatedById":32731,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T03:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;1 year old thread, problem long solved.
