I was wondering if an engine could be built that does both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to boot, what if instead of wasting thermal transfer potential (by bringing cryogenic hydrogen up to burnable temperatures using the jet nozzle as a heater (as in the SSME)) you could use it to generate your rocket fuel in-flight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may be hard to follow, since I am not a rocket scientist, or a teacher, but here goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/suOhiWg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022suOhiWg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn your ship you have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - one large tank of liquid hydrogen. (boiling point 33K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - two empty tanks, one for liquid air, and one for liquid nitrogen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - a mostly standard turbojet engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch, your turbojet is sucking in air as it\u0027s oxidizer, and burning it with hydrogen to produce thrust. But on it\u0027s way to the engines, it passes through two heat exchange coils. The second coil wraps around the air intake, or air compressor, and it\u0027s cryogenic temperatures cool atmospheric air below it\u0027s boiling point (78K). Some gas air is fed to the engine, and some liquid air (blue) is bled off and stored in the previously empty tank. Since nitrogen (the main constituent of air) boils at a lower temperature than oxygen (90k), the liquified air will bleed off nitrogen gas resulting in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - a slush of oxygen rich liquid and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - a stream of gas nitrogen (green)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gas nitrogen (green) is passed through the FIRST coil of LH2, liquifying it. The liquid is then moved to a storage tank where it can later be used as RCS. Any excess can be vented to atmosphere or used as direct thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the air becomes too rarified for the air breathing engine, the valve to the combustion chamber closes, and the oxygen rich liquid is introduced, along with the remainder of the LH2 and used as a rocket to continue it\u0027s ascent into space and avoid a violent vehicle-ground interface event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefits of this are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - lighter takeoff weight, oxidizer and RCS are gathered mid-flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - only one engine to handle both jet and rocket configurations, further reducing weight and complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - fully utilizing heat exchange potential from liquid hydrogen fuel transitioning to a higher temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only question is, how much of this is achievable using sound science, and how much of it is only attainable through some sort of black magic/witchcraft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T13:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that you now have to accelerate all that air to the velocity of your craft, so even if you can make it work, I\u0027m not sure the savings in not having to haul the oxidiser all the way from the launch pad will outweigh the extra drag and the weight of the extra equipment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESABRE is probably as far as its worthwhile to go in terms of air-breathing rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T20:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022andrewas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022andrewas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is that you now have to accelerate all that air to the velocity of your craft, so even if you can make it work, I\u0027m not sure the savings in not having to haul the oxidiser all the way from the launch pad will outweigh the extra drag and the weight of the extra equipment. \u003Cp\u003ESABRE is probably as far as its worthwhile to go in terms of air-breathing rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESABRE use more hydrogen cooling the intake air than it burn in the rocket engine, this is burned in an extra ramjet engine mostly to do some good with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to cool and store more air you will need to use more hydrogen, second you have to scale up the condenser and other parts for this so its probably not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T22:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei dont really see any point to storing the liquified air on-board. in air breathing mode a sabre engine has a really good isp, so its no problem just carrying the required o2 during the atmospheric stage of the flight. so its better just to direct feed that air into the combustion chamber and do away with all the tankage, plumbing, pumps, etc for handling the liquid air, let alone the extra coolant (lh2) needed for the whole process. the sabre way seems to be more straightforward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T01:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Agent86\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Agent86\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I was thinking ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou pretty much came up with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOTOL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHOTOL\u003C/a\u003E.
