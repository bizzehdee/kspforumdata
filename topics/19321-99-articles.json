Unfortunately I have narrowed down another problem I am having to FAR. With a simple rocket using small parts I am getting huge fps drops. With Vsync on and FAR uninstalled I get 60 frames on the launchpad. When i add FAR with the same vehicle on the launchpad my fps drops to 22, and remains low over the course of the launch until I get to orbit. Strangely enough after I decouple the radial SRBs(RT-10s) and they are far enough away my fps jumps up to 30-40s. By the time I reach orbit my frames are back up to around 60. I only have a few other mods including KJR and when I remove those mods the problem remains the same, I believe the issue is related somehow to FAR. Again thanks for this awesome mod! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I just realized you updated again to 12.2.
