In other words, the tank that has the most steps between it and the engine will drain first. A step could be an ordinary node connection between two tanks, or it could be a hose. It\u0027s also helpful to count the first step as the join between the engine and the first tank. If two tanks are an equal number of steps away, they\u0027ll drain at the same rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelating to the diagram, we\u0027ll ignore the blue arrows for now, so assume the yellow arrows are hoses. The top right box on the pink stack is 8 steps from the engine - the furthest. Once it drains, the one below it drains - 7 steps. Next the one below that, 6 steps, and now the pink stack is empty. Next, both ends of the green row drain into the middle, because they\u0027re both 5 steps from the tank. Once they\u0027re empty, the middle tank is 4 steps, BUT so is the blue tank at the top, so they drain together. Then both the blue and green sections are empty, so next the red stack drains from top to bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the blue arrows as hoses, the bottom tank of the pink would drain first (7 steps), then the one above it would drain at the same time as the left-most of the green row (6 steps) the top pink and middle green (5 steps), then right hand green (4 steps) then the red stack again from top to bottom, leaving the blue tank full (because it\u0027s not connected).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that\u0027s helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T19:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Furthest tank\u0022 is not a good way to put it.
