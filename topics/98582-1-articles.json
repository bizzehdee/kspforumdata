But note that there are eight aerospikes in there too, not too awesome in the TWR department, but their isp at sea level is second to none. That, and keep TWR at about 1.4, and you should be set to get the same payload fraction. Though considering that aerospikes have that low TWR, you might even improve on it using two of the big NASA clusters: decent sea level isp, and awesome TWR (I think I have too many aerospikes for too little high-TWR-with-almost-the-same-isp A.K.A. NASA cluster, and I shut the spikes too early instead of exploiting their higher isp as much as I can, but you know, the coolness factor also influences builds). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the middle I would put something with very high isp, like spikes or a Poodle, but I wouldn\u0027t go for the NERVAs. They may have awesome isp, but their thrust is tiny, and their weight is more than considerable (you lug 10mT on nuclear rockets to orbit to get 240kN out of them for five minutes...). You just don\u0027t use them for long enough to justify their low TWR during a climb to orbit. If you are going further than there, sure, very efficient (but then you only need the one), but the climb to orbit is ideally sized for chemical engines. You have it easier to add more fuel too! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and before I go...
