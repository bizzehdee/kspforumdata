I launched the plane directly from the runway as soon as I started the game. After flying over to the island runway (and landing almost successfully), I reverted to launch. I realized I didn\u0027t want to launch again, so I reverted to the SPH. I saw my plane for a second in the SPH, and then the game immediately crashed. That\u0027s about it.\n\nI don\u0027t have any mods at this time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T22:00:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zy-fi**"}]}
