There are also some that maybe I should use but am not because I haven\u0027t found them or feel it could take away from the game play - this is for fun after all.

Some aspects may be concurrent, but in text form that is difficult to show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**The life-support feature will not be enabled simply because I see no reason to worry about running out of power if I don\u0027t check in on a station during another longer-duration flight every few hours - a general annoyance when warping through time. Sure, satellites and stations are designed to have an extra power supply, but it isn\u0027t meant to be an extreme excess. Perhaps extreme excess generation capability, but not extreme excess storage. I will be checking to make sure, however, that there are more than enough other supplies on the missions when the Kerbals are sent out into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside: Personally, I have a multitude of ideas on how to make this game more educational and realistic (in the science sense). However, I lack the coding experience needed to implement them. I don\u0027t anticipate most of them actually being that difficult to do. If anyone reads this and is interested, I\u0027m more than willing to share. I\u0027ve been playing this game for a long while now and really believe it has a lot of potential for science education - not just orbits and physics, but most of science given that the right additions are made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeroz","CreatedById":80383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T19:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers at the Kerbal Science Foundation debated with their managerial overlords about the program and its direction for weeks. Insisting that it made the most sense to run before walking, it was decided that a glider of unknown design would be mounted to two drop towers, pointed in generally the desired travel direction, and let loose to theoretically make its way from altitude to the runway safely.
