It made me think a cool mechanic in KSP2 might be placing these like you do the wind or geothermal generators we\u0027ve seen, except this part would act like a radiator during the day and a generator at night. Visually it would just look like a well head on the surface with a pump, compressor, exchangers and generator attached and maybe the hint of buried supply lines heading back to base. We don\u0027t know exactly how complex KSP2\u0027s thermal control systems will be, if day/night solar gain or habitation heating will be a factor, but if we\u0027re primarily worried about heat dissipation from resource and energy production and crew cabin heating is abstracted as cabin electrical draw then simplifying recovery by assuming a thermoelectric generator attached to the heat pump at the bore hole head seems appropriate. I would think it would cost more in terms of raw materials to produce than a battery and have less output, but of course its doing double duty as a radiator and the energy its producing is basically free. They would also be a nice offset for bases run primarily on solar panels because they\u0027re producing energy at all the times your panels aren\u0027t.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts pretty simple technology.
