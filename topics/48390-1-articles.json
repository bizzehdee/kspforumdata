I\u0027ve been paying close attention to the version numbers used by Squad\u0027s media team. Hopefully this will help us determine what is happening. (I\u0027d rather squad actually speak to us directly but this is what we have to work with). When we see the release numbers on vids stabilize, or begin to mirror x-numbers from past releases, then bugs are few and far between and the version is almost ready for release. Jumps in version numbers points to ongoing bugsquashing. These are the versions I have found.
