So I have ~600 MB left over. ![7EbGiUO.png](http://i.imgur.com/7EbGiUO.png)\n\n- Place the Mk1 Lander Can (other parts probably work too). \n\n- Offset the can high up so its near the top of the VAB\n\n- Note that Alt select on the Lander Can doesn\u0027t work (I think that\u0027s normal...)\n\n- Place a Structural Fuselage on the bottom (Alt-no-side-attachment-placement sometimes \n\nhelps here)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![81CXpul.png](http://i.imgur.com/81CXpul.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n- Alt select that Structural Fuselage as though you were going to duplicate it\n\n- Enjoy the The Spinning Beach Ball of Death^TM^.
