Is there a mod that reduces explosions? For example on re-entry/exceeding heat tolerance have parts such as solar panels simply disintegrate rather than a violent explosion we have now? Having things go boom is fun for the first while but there\u0027s a certain beauty to have a large obsolete satellite re-enter and simply melt away....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemitis","CreatedById":28751,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-28T23:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a few mods that you might be interested in.
