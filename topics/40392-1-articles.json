My name\u0027s Dave, I\u0027m a college student studying Computer Science, and Kerbal Space Program is part of my free time. I started playing just about a year ago back during version 15 when Minmus was a big deal, and, like everyone else who tries this game, fell in love with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I know my way around KSP nowadays, as I\u0027ve built space stations and a munbase, and I\u0027ve landed and returned manned expeditions from Duna, Dres, Moho (Thanks to an Eve gravity assist), and a few others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m always glad to answer questions and give tips to anyone who asks, and I\u0027ll be sure to ask questions where I have them! For my first question: Any neat places in the forum you think I should check out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a lively sense of humor and I love to speak publicly. I\u0027ve thought of taking that and turning it into a KSP-themed Youtube channel. Any suggestions and advice are welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDave\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T03:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome to the forums!
