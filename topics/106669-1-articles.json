Go into sandbox, limit yourself to the tech tree parts you\u0027re at (using the category part selection \u0026gt; tech tier), and just fiddle around with some different craft designs until you get the hang of the new aero. TBH it really isn\u0027t hard, you just need to get the hang of it first. I found the transition easy myself, for the pure fact that I used to use FAR on my base install... and *cough* never did gravity turns in stock anyway *cough* \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve changed my strategy to the following...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo nothing but get all the local science data that can be had with the Flea engine and take the most direct route through the tech tree to get the \u0022Aviation\u0022 category parts - this has wheels and wings!

This will then gently accelerate and you can steer easily and govern the speed by using the brakes. There is enough go juice to visit the astronaut complex, the R\u0026amp;D centre, the tracking station and the VAB in one trip.
