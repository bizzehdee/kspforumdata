Looking at an image of an R7, that seems to be the case already, but what I\u0027m saying in particular is that whatever stage you mount your fins on, DO NOT DROP THAT STAGE until you\u0027re well above 50 km altitude.\u00A0Anything lower and the rocket will flip from the air resistance. The longer that stage stays on during ascent, the better, vacuum Isp be damned.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse gimbal engines, not non-gimbal ones. A reaction wheel is NOT strong enough to counteract flipping. Once you reach around 55-60 km, even a single Terrier has enough gimbal to keep you from flipping by brute-force overpowering the aero forces on the KV pod, even if you don\u0027t have a reaction wheel (though not having a reaction wheel means you won\u0027t have roll control).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHigh \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E is your enemy.\u00A0 Lock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde once you begin the gravity turn and use time-to-apoapse to control your trajectory (ie. throttle up to push it further away to make your trajectory steeper, throttle down to let the AP closer to flatten out your trajectory), not steering at crazy angles.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep the rocket short and squat.
