Personally, I would prefer a dedicated program that I can deploy on a spare computer, vm or even a cloud service, similar to how games like minecraft or arma handle dedicated servers, alongside a simpler system like portal 2 or left for dead where servers are p2p and are only up as long as the host is playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-13T03:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody knows until they release more information about multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-13T07:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere will probably be a way to host continious servers.\u00A0 tho i would probably avoid these servers myself atleast in the begining and i feel like people would rush the game and spoil all the other systems and planets that i would like to discover myself\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
