I\u0027ve had several quite spectacular aircraft takeoff failures that from what I can tell are a result of the wheels starting to splay away from eachother at speed, though I suspect this may be a side effect of the extensive clipping of the parts into the wings, even after I\u0027ve tweaked their alignment. As an additional issue, aircraft built with them seem exceptionally reluctant to fly, almost as if the parts are barely generating any lift, even on very small simple aircraft.\u003Cp\u003EI even had a go at replicating the spaceplane Scott Manley put together on one of his recent videos, since it represents \u0027known working tech\u0027, so to speak. Granted, he is using a couple of mods I\u0027m not (Most notably FAR), but I would have expected the craft to fly better without it? Still no good. The parts as mentioned earlier didn\u0027t mount anywhere near as cleanly as they seemed to for Scott, it suffered several disastrous failures on take-off run, and when into the air barely wanted to climb at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got any ideas on what I\u0027m doing wrong here, or if there\u0027s something else I need to check with the install?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther mods I\u0027m using;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDMagic Orbital Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKommit Nucleonics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtractor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estrut the landing legs to the main body of your craft. if you don\u0027t do this you\u0027ll crash. check out the stock B9 crafts like the heinlin (i think that\u0027s what it\u0027s called) you\u0027ll see that there are struts almost everywhere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry for double posting\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"snafuu","CreatedById":100976,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T22:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wobbling you\u0027re experiencing isn\u0027t normal (at least not before 0.23) and can be fixed by editing the parts files for the landing gears.
