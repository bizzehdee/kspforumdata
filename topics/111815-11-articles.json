I\u0027m currently working on a new sub module to CivPop which will add Civilian Specialties (a.k.a. Jobs ) to your civilians. \n\n**What id like, from anyone who uses the mod, is some jobs that you would like to see, or feel that fit. Any suggestions welcome.** \n\nWhat I have so far:\n\n**Job bonuses:**\n\n- Farmer - .5% bonus increase in food growth\n- Doctor - .5% bonus to kerbal health (if a feature like this is added to USI or TAC) else increases reproduction rate\n- Professor - bonus to producing of education (in university)\n- Recruiter - Lowers cost of recruiting Kerbonauts.\n- Manager/Landlord - slightly increases Civi Rent (or for sandbox, increase population limit)\n\nI have it coded right now, so each building will be limited to the number of specialists you can hold (i.e. you will have (x) number of slots for farmers per farm/hydrosphere, etc. \n\nCurrently the setup is plan so that you can obtain Specialists in 2 ways. First you can train them via the university, time and resource consuming. Or second, you can recruit them via the UI (not implemented till 1.1) this will be quick, but costs a decent amount of funds.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T05:25:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 05:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Profit-","CreatedById":144948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T04:14:42Z","Content":"Broker - With a civilian dock in Kerbal SOI allows you to purchase O2/Water/Substrate, every one extra hired gives a small discount after the first to a floor price. \n\nManager - Slightly increases credits from \u0022rent\u0022\n\nGather/Recycler/Scrapper - Brings in a small stream of a selected resource gathered from junk in space and small comets and the like.

Good Call. (for science / Sandbox games i can have this job increase civilian population limit or something like that)\n\nTrader/Gatherer would require some extra code built in to allow for resources to come in. Which would also only be useful in Career mode(the purchasing part, as funds dont exist in science /sandbox) . Not sure on something like that. Ill noodle it over. \n\nIn regards to rent scaling based on SOI, thats something that is definitely on the way. Should be in by the next patch actually (as its a seperate module from this specialization system) It will most likely be based on distance from Kerbin (not on actual SOI) otherwise it will run into issues supporting planet packs. \n\n I just have to work the exact numbers so that its fair and not too overpowered. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T08:02:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Profit-","CreatedById":144948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T06:41:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I like the Manager, which ill most definitely include!

Put another way, do you want farmers and agricultural engineers to be necessary for self-sufficiency and one of the only specialties to produce more than they consume?\n\nSome examples of what I mean:\n\nIf you want them to be necessary, I would make some careers into a tree of specialization. A farmer/botanist is able to produce more food than other civilians while in the farms. After a while he has gained enough hands-on experience and can specialize. let\u0027s say there are two jobs that he can do: Either he can focus on sanitation engineering (mulch/waste) or he can focus on the food chain engineering (food/supplies), giving a larger bonus to one or the other at the cost of specializing in one. So if you had two farmer that could specialize, instead of giving a small bonus to both, one farmer could specialize in a field giving a 10% increase in food growth while the other specializes in a field giving a 10% reduction in waste production for a cumulative bonus higher than if neither had specialized.\n\nThen on the other side of the production chain, a recruiter could start off managing Kerbals for a small deduction of recruitment cost. After a while, he can go into being a manager and retain the bonus of recruiter increase the amount of civilians that can be kept on the station (e.g. that broom closet would make a great 1-bedroom studio with the right attitude...that wall can be moved a few feet back to meet code). Or he could go into advertisement and increase the rate civilians come to your stations. But the larger responsibility comes at a cost: He\u0027s taken up binge eating and consumes about 1.25x what a base civilian does (requiring more ag).\n\nJust some thoughts. It really depends what your vision is and how much you want to implement."}]}
