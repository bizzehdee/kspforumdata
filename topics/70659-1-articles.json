Contracts and reputation comes first, then later part costs and money will get involved. All with the baseline progression of the tech tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts themselves will probably be the way to expand a players income, science AND feed reputation(or eat). I personally don\u0027t see how the Dev\u0027s can structure the career game without a \u0022quest\u0022 system like contracts. Otherwise reputation can\u0027t be gauged and there would be no way to gain money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Contracts are implimented the mission builder format can be expanded at any time. They probably wont be giving you big missions such as build a station with these pre build modules, rather a realistic contract could be test this part in this situation for this long. These sort of missions, that are extremely flexible, are more in tune with KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next update will bring contracts and reputation. But the economics will still be missing, and the contract system will still probably need fine tuning. So i wouldn\u0027t be surprised if things get a little changed around before all 3 main Career systems are added (tech, rep, money)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
