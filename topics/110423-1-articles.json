(SSTO)","CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:21:17Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:21:17Z","Content":"![sL8j4K2.png](http://i.imgur.com/sL8j4K2.png)\n\n**N**RAM Griffon Prototype 3\n\nNRAM, Inc. is proud to present its latest aerospace product: the Griffon transatmospheric cargo plane. While many cargo spaceplanes will require multiple launches to put all the necessary infrastructural components of a larger project into orbit, the Griffon can handle most such transports in one launch. Capable of a maximum payload of 72.4t (equivalent to two full orange fuel tanks) to an 85x85 LKO, it is best suited to missions where something big and bulky must be assembled in orbit, in one launch. The currently marketed version is the latest prototype (the P3), which will be enhanced in future versions.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nThis craft will require substantial computing power.\n\nParts: 327\n\nUnloaded mass: 334.9t\n\nMaximally loaded mass: 407.3t\n\nMaximum cargo weight: 72.4t\n\nCrew: 2\n\nPassengers: 8\n\nHeight: 11.3m\n\nWingspan: 19.3m\n\nLength: 29.0m\n\nPowerplant(s): 16x OS-E F1 Taurus Engine(s) (2x Turbojets, 1x R.A.P.I.E.R per engine)\n\nMaximum SL Speed: 950 m/s (breakup at 1000 m/s)\n\nMaximum Speed: LKO capable\n\nOPERATIONAL GUIDE\n\nAs long as the Griffon is properly loaded with fuel and cargo, it is a very stable and gentle aircraft, which even under significant asymmetrical engine flame-outs will stay on its rails and deliver a pleasant flying experience. It is therefore possible to push the airframe to its limits under certain conditions, especially when handling the maximum cargo weight.\n\n**Commands**\n\n1. Toggle Taurus Engine R.A.P.I.E.R mode\n\n2. Close air intakes\n\n3. Toggle cargo bay doors\n\n4. Deploy drogue chute\n\n5. Cut drogue chute\n\n**Takeoff**\n\nThe Griffon is stable on the runway and will not deviate, but do attempt rotation after accelerating beyond 100 m/s. Immediately pitch up to \u002B20 degrees and, especially when flying with the maximum cargo load, allow the aircraft to automatically adjust this angle as it ascends and gains speed.\n\n**Ascent**\n\nDo not interfere with the natural pitch up tendency of the aircraft. It will stay within reasonable bounds from 20 degrees. Switch the R.A.P.I.E.R mode to closed cycle after achieving a velocity between 1000-1100 m/s, there may be some flame-outs before this but the aircraft should be able to keep accelerating and hold its course regardless. It is advisable to have considerable piloting skills for flying the maximum cargo load, but anything lighter should be relatively easy to bring into orbit.\n\n**Preparation for reentry**\n\nMake sure to refuel at to a level of at least 1/4-1/3 before attempting reentry. Remember that this must be the fuel remaining after the reentry burn. Distribute this fuel into the forward tanks. Use airbrakes to slow down in the upper atmosphere, but do not stall.\n\n**Landing**\n\nLand as gently as possible. Approach from a distance at 200 m/s. Slow down to 140 m/s before final approach. Land carefully and at as low a descent rate as possible with between 100-120 m/s of speed. Land early on the runway and apply brakes throughout. Deploy the drogue chute for extra deceleration.\n\nLINK\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230783-nram-griffon-p3-stock-ssto](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230783-nram-griffon-p3-stock-ssto)\n\nALBUM\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027m sure there is a more efficient way of getting it into orbit - but when I develop the spaceplanes I usually do so much testing that I want the ascent to be very rapid ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) I\u0027m the trial and error type of guy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T23:07:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"}]}
