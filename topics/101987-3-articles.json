Did Gemini crews go crazy ? Do submarine crew go crazy? Truck drivers? Cubicle workers? Miners? Flight attendants?\n\u003E Nothing to do with space sickness. The size of the ISS is driven by the mission equipment that needs to be on board.\n\u003E \n\u003E There are detrimental effects to large volumes. See Skylab. One of the lessons was that astronauts routinely go stuck in the middle of the volume with nothing to grab on to. ISS modules are designed so that astronauts are always in arm\u0027s reach of a wall or a handle of some sort.\n\u003E \n\u003E Likewise, inflatable modules will never be used as large open spaces. They need outfitting with walls and floors\n\nSo u take it you would like to sit down for 14 days in a cramped chair? That\u0027s what Gemini 7 did.\n\nCrazy was an exaggeration, submarine crews spend months at a time in cramped spaces, but the subs today are still bigger than the ones in the past. Truck drivers can see the world around them, and cubicle workers are used to spending hours at a time in a box. If I were to work in one, I would walk around the building. Miners also come back to the surface, working in pretty large caverns. Flight attendants can walk around the whole aircraft, and they\u0027re usually very big.\n\nSource? It has triple Mir\u0027s volume. And Mir did pretty good.\n\nNo, that\u0027s detrimental effects to large spaces. Mir and the ISS have large volumes, too. You would have that problem in a lot of places. But you could give the astronauts an extendable device to grab onto something. \n\nYou our could put those walls and floors in the module\u0027s core. Then the first crew could climb about the module and deploy everything.\n\nA lot of stuff on most space stations need to be deployed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry to go off on a tangent here. But nuclear thermal rockets only hit high ISP values because their exhaust gasses are so light. It is true that you get roughly 1k ISP when you use liquid hydrogen, but this comes at a price. Reaction mass like Liquid hydrogen and ammonia are so ridiculously low density that you need very large tanks to get good dV. Very large tanks means a lot of added structural mass and insulation mass. This means that the increase in dV from switching to nuclear thermal is much less than you\u0027d expect. ISP goes up, but mass fraction goes down.\n\u003E Try it out in KSP for yourself. If you install the Realfuels mod you\u0027ll notice that the NERVA is not nearly as OP as it is in stock. It is only better in some limited situations, and then only marginally.\n\nThis is off topic...\n\nI take it you don\u0027t of any of the tricks of the trade, then? Balloon tanks? Or maybe the fact that in space you need much less structural mass? The gain is there."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T18:12:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E submarine crews spend months at a time in cramped spaces, but the subs today are still bigger than the ones in the past.
