Or at least it was the last time I used it. It actually crashed a plane once being stupid, and I haven\u0027t used it ever since (the ILS guidance sure, the autoland no). It doesn\u0027t control the throttle, so you\u0027re left doing that yourself while it steers the plane. One time, I botched the throttle control (it\u0027s harder when you\u0027re not also steering), the plane bounced back up into the air and...mechjeb turned it completely around backwards to point back at the initial touchdown point. I hastily shut off the autoland and tried to put it down backwards myself. It ended up slightly misaligned, and shortly after it was no longer a plane but a bunch of pieces tumbling down the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the haters, last I heard there\u0027s a way to go into the settings file and entirely disable certain features and/or modules, or something.
