I like that. It means you need more infrastructure to make a base off world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support has supplies, electricity and habitability. The supplies is basically a simple version of what TAC offers and is simple\u00A0to produce. Electricity is basically the same as TAC. But habitability is something TAC does not have, and I think it\u0027s very cool. I like the idea of needing to give kerbals a living space. Although I would like it more if it were possible to have indefinite off-world time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible to combine the Habitability of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS with Tac LS?

You should be able to turn off the Supplies bit and leave on the hab bit. Alternatively you can try Snacks! (but turn on Stress! and turn off the actual Snacks portion) or visit Kerbal Health and ask about how much of it you can disable (this one is, in a loose sense, a Kerbalism Lite. It\u0027s -only- a hab mod and works with all LS mods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-19T20:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also try Kerbal Health, which does many of the same things and adds things like radiation and training (all configurable).
