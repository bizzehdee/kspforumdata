Some people may stay with rep hidden, but I think most people will give up. I suppose that I could stop maintaining it, but I don\u0027t think that makes sense.\n\nI joined it for fun. Of course I\u0027ll go back to normal, but \u0022today is not that day.\u0022\n\nFor anti-rep judgement! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:36:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If hiding rep didn\u0027t take you off the rep list it wouldn\u0027t be a problem. But it does. and then confusion.\n\nWell... your rep is still your rep, right? The only possible confusion I can think of is in knowing where one \u0027ranks\u0027 relative to others in the Forum. I\u0027ll be the first to admit that this is something I\u0027ve paid attention to. When my comic started taking off and I began accumulating a lot of rep, I would check to see if I had broken the top 100, or moved up a page in the rep-ordered user list, etc. Now that some of the really great and well-known members like RIC and Regex have taken themselves out of the running, I no longer know where I stand--and for me, that\u0027s been better! \n\nGetting rep motivates me; when I post a page and that little tab lights up with a bunch of notifications, it tells me my work made people happy. When a page doesn\u0027t get repped, I know I need to work a little harder. And as I climbed the ranks I would look at the list and say \u0022wow, I have more rep than [really great guy who I respect a lot]! I must be doing something right!\u0022 BUT--that way, for me, lies madness. I realized I was going the wrong way when I saw something cool another user had done, and just for a second hesitated clicking the star because it meant it would put that user further above me. Just for a second, mind you--but I did not at all like the way that attitude looked on me.\n\nSo, by messing up the reputation rank order, WBG has helped get me out of the mode of caring about OTHER people\u0027s rep, and back to just having fun in the game, sharing that fun on the Forum, and hopefully making other people\u0027s KSP experience more enjoyable."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T20:51:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m part of this group as well!\n\nWelcome!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAgreed.
