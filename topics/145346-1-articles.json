They\u0027ve built a hydrolox thruster for microsatellites - main propulsion for large cubesats, or attitude thrusters for slightly larger craft. However, it doesn\u0027t carry cryogenic liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. No, it carries plain old de-ionized water. And it will use electricity from the satellite\u0027s solar panels to electrolyse that water, creating oxygen and hydrogen which is then injected into the combustion chamber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main idea behind it is that small satellites that ride as secondary payloads often struggle to find rideshares if they carry propulsion, because those propulsion systems and the fuel they contain pose risks to the primary payload (or to other secondaries). These risks need to be insured, which costs insurance money, and mitigated, which costs development money. But a spacecraft carrying water needs neither of those two, because the propellant is \u0022non-toxic, non-explosive, and unpressurized\u0022. It\u0027s also dirt cheap, and (in a future scenario) can be easily replenished by ISRU in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo much for the theory, but in practice?

Hydrolox has the potential for the best specific impulse by a wide margin among the chemical propellants typically used today, and removing the need to carry the low density, hard cryogenic LH2/LO2 bipropellant instantly removes its biggest drawback. But how much extra dry mass and volume does the electrolysis equipment require? How much effort does it take to consistently draw the right amount of liquid from an unpressurized tank in zero gravity? How much electrolysis power can a cubesat\u0027s solar arrays provide - will that be enough gas to build sufficient combustion chamber pressure and temperature to actually get the nice, high Isp? Or is the system ultimately no better than a common hydrazine thruster, and its only advantage is the propellant safety? And what about comparing other options for solar electric supported propulsion, such as electrothermal rockets (resistojets)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-04T08:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2016 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T09:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume the H2 and O2 is stored pressurized under the pretty low pressure created by the electrolyse and then burned in pulses.

Even for the tiniest of units, the power output is simply not enough. True electric plasma rockets need a huge amount of power, and you cannot really downsize them as well as chemical units. Too little power throughput and voltage simply results in the Isp crumbling to dust.

Even good resistojet working fluids have Isp\u0027s in the 500s-600s range, so if you\u0027re using a bad fluid and need to compete with hydrolox combustion around maybe 400s, it may not work out so well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-04T11:19:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2016 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T15:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022De-ionized water\u0022. \u00A0How much anti-freeze do you think it needs mixed in? \u00A0I\u0027d expect all kinds of issues in full sunlight as well as night. \u00A0Or do they just let it start to freeze and time the burns well after \u0022dawn\u0022 (and assume the thing can handle any boiling it might have)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard that PVC ablation is a cheap way to make an ion engine, but never found out how cheap. \u00A0I\u0027d still prefer something like a boring old hybrid rocket, and note that the Isp shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue assuming the weight of the water isn\u0027t a large portion of the satellite (i.e. not going to the Moon of something). \u00A0Note that while the hybrid rocket needs to be ignited, so does our hydrolox engine as well. \u00A0I\u0027d just assume that microsat builders aren\u0027t at all interested in dealing with hypergolics nor the paperwork, permissions, and procedures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T16:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPVC ablation... that reminds me... \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E, using a resistojet doesn\u0027t even restrict us to water.
