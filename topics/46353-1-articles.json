First get some robotic rovers on the ground to get some better reading of the ice at the lunar poles and look for a good landing site to build a base (these can be done using weedy rockets like Delta, no need to spend a SLS). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen if it looks like that ice is worth studying and there\u0027s a suitable landing site spend two SLS to put together the FLO in orbit, then send it to land on the moon at one of the poles near were we expect ice to be. Then send another SLS with an EDS to land something like the Apollo LM Truck:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ninfinger.org/models/apollo_vault/LM%20Variations/lm%20truck2%2001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lm%20truck2%2001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith more supplies and a large rover down near the FLO. Then finally one more SLS with EDS to carry an Orion and Altair to send four people down to the FLO to conduct in-situ resource utilization experiments over a period of 45 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.nss.org/settlement/moon/images/flo_hab1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022flo_hab1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen from this point onwards the FLO will be nearly continuously inhabited by rotations of additional crew sent by SLS launches, with alternating cargo launches in between. This gives a total of six 4 man crew rotation for a total of 1080 man days. The ISRU experiments may well be satisfactorily completed without needing that many man days, in which case the left over SLS would be used to deliver future permanent propellant producing base components / Skylab style station / Asteroid capture mission depending on how many SLS are left and if any more are forthcoming given the success of FLO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"czokletmuss","CreatedById":28063,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T05:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, firstly I would read this article about costs of the SLS/MPCV: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2330/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.thespacereview.com/article/2330/1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd than I would assemble all the NASA employees together with the Senators and proceed to do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/oEjVpgLkeFg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/oEjVpgLkeFg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut seriously, I would probably try to use its heavy-lifting capacity to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) built ISS-2/Freedom Station (ISS replacement)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) build infrastructure on Moon to try nuclear powered ISRU from the poles (water -\u0026gt; LOX and hydrogen, water to drink, oxygen to breath)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) maybe send more probes to icy moons of Jupiter and to Titan but for this you don\u0027t really need SLS, so...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T05:34:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 05:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by czokletmuss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T05:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr bust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T09:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the SLS is built, NASA will simply not have any money left to develop any payloads.
