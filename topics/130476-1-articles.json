I can launch pretty much any size ship (within reason) without issue. After a few minutes of playing, however, I notice the game starting to slow down. Within 5-10 minutes, the slowdown is significant even with just a lone capsule on the pad. Looking straight up into the sky seems to alleviate this somewhat at this point. Unfortunately, the performance loss doesn\u0027t stop there, and within 15 minutes the game is running at 1/10th speed or worse, and looking into the sky doesn\u0027t help. The complexity of the ship doesn\u0027t seem to make a difference. The same thing happens whether my ship has 2 parts or 2000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect it has to do with rendering terrain, because the slowdown is most noticeable when any part of the planet is in view.
