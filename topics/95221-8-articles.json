I ended up having to turn off flares for a bit. It worked great at first, but as I zoomed in more the flares kept turning on and would turn off if I unzoomed a bit. Is there any sort of range limitation I do play with a increase system size 7x SMA? Another thing was the flare was stuck on in the telescope and I had to enable then disable again for it to finally disappear. Then the whole planet, Jool, disappeared. Not sure what caused that and I didn\u0027t even get it to go back during that test. Will play around some more and hopefully get some decisive info.
