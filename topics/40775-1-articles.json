Burn towards prograde to raise the orbit, burn in the other direction to lower the orbit. The problem I\u0027m having is that I can\u0027t seem to affect the orbit the way I intend to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I finish the first stage launch of my rocket, and it\u0027s on course for a apoapsis of ~78km, with a periapsis somewhere in the planet\u0027s crust. So I drop the stage, warm up the next stage engine and use the RCS thrusters to swing the nose around to face prograde according to the happy fun ball. I then patiently wait until I reach apoapsis at ~78km and fire up the engine. As I expected, the periapsis comes flying out of the planet, I keep the nose pointed prograde and throttled back, when the periapsis got to ~78km, I shut off the engines, and relaxed. Stable orbit achieved.... or so I thought. I now notice that my apoapsis is about 300km out now. Obviously I\u0027m doing something wrong here, I tried using maneuver nodes as a guideline for the next attempt, and the target indicator pulled my below the horizon, which led to violently deorbiting my ship while I remained blissfully unaware in map view, watching the the periapsis do it\u0027s thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, where do I start?

In the real world (and the Kerboverse) this is impossible because you\u0027re only at apoapsis for a millisecond. So what do you do? Burn BEFORE apoapsis! Not much before, but somewhat. The best you can usually do is to divide your burn time in half and start burning when you\u0027re that far from apoapsis. So if your burn will take 30 seconds, start 15 before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027ll do a good job, but it still won\u0027t be perfect. For long burns, you may have to burn a bit to push your apoapsis forward, then cut the engines, wait until you\u0027re near again, and burn again. This way you only push it out a couple dozen (or hundred, who\u0027s counting) meters. The trick here is to stay in front of your apoapsis.

Your orbital speed should be over 1500 m/s when you get to your apoapsis. The recommended gravity turn is: straight up to 5-10 km, then start slowly nudging over towards the East (90 degrees), try to drop the nose 5 degrees for every 1000-2000 meters of altitude. You should finish your gravity turn (nose pointed at the horizon) before your apoapsis reaches 80 km. Of course, don\u0027t do too aggressive of a gravity turn or you will spend too much time in the thick atmosphere fighting drag.

Drag the progade burn thingy out until you start to see the apo/periapsis markers on the forecast orbit rotate -- that means the planned orbit is getting close to circular. The closer you placed the node to the apoapsis marker, the faster the apo/peri markers will swing around and the closer to circular the resulting orbit will be.

The calculated burn time does assume you\u0027ll run at full throttle, but you don\u0027t have to do that 100% of the time -- it\u0027s easier to get the delta-v right if you tail off gently and carefully, and if you did 95% of the burn at full throttle then being a few seconds late with the last 5% won\u0027t throw things off by much.

Because your trajectory is very sub-orbital, Apoapsis is way behind you by the time your burn is completed. See that moment moment right around 4:15, where both Pe and Ap are coming up, the music has stopped, and Ap is actually moving the other direction.

Whoops, but I was able to pretty easily circularize it, settled with a 292km Pe and a 294km Ap, so I\u0027ll take it. I also targeted by deorbit burn with a maneuver node and brought the capsule down sort of near KSC. Unfortunately, KSP crashed just as I was on final descent, so I didn\u0027t get to see how close I got. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore practice ahead!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T21:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if you\u0027ve seen this one, but it helped me a lot to start getting into orbit consistently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgPr4q5tj-Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T21:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022photogineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022photogineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks everyone, I\u0027m doing much better now. I managed to do a not terrible gravity turn and put myself in to a not super suborbital 300km Ap shot at the end of the first stage burn.
