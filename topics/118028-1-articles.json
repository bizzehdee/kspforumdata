They\u0027ve funded many of my missions, and made me a lot of extra $$$. And I\u0027ve been putting space stations in orbit around everything: Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus, Duna and Ike, and next will be Eve and Gilly, all with tourists in mind. And my newest station that I\u0027ve been building the last couple days is totally geared for tourists.\n\n![qtf1Wk9.png](http://i.imgur.com/qtf1Wk9.png)\n\nThis station, named Terrapin Station, has 8 hitchhiker pods in an octagon star around the core. The reason I did it this way is not just to hold a lot of tourists, but also to separate everyone with different destinations. For example: tourists going to the Mun in one pod, Duna and Ike in another, those returning from Minmus in a third, etc... Having 4 or 5 big tourist contracts going at once is a riot, but can also get really complicated, and I\u0027m hoping this will help me keep everyone sorted out.\n\nI\u0027m really hoping the developers expand and add more tourist contracts... stuff like maybe \u0022Send a 14 day vacation on an existing space station\u0022...."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T15:37:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Retro-solar orbit...

It\u0027s hard to use a gravity slingshot to get yourself retrograde because the planets themselves are not going retrograde.\n\nBasically you want to get yourself into a very highly elliptical orbit, then burn retrograde at the apoapsis. It will save you a lot of dV if you make your plane change out beyond Jool as opposed to making it near Kerbin, but of course it costs you dV and time to get into that highly elliptical orbit in the first place."},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T17:09:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s better than the one I got today.
