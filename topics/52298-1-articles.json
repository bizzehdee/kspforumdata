I have a manned lander which will make several trips to the surface, landing in different biomes. In some biomes I just need the gravity and surface EVA data, in others I need the full set of sensors, so I have a couple different sci modules so the lander just takes the sensors it needs for each biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also not transmitting in this mission so the modules will be brought back up and redocked with the orbital craft and then a fresh module will be taken down to the next biome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one of the simple modules has caused me serious frustration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/rSNrMQK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rSNrMQKh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rSNrMQKh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis little guy, which I was calling a \u0022science disk\u0022, is very flawed. I thought it would be neat to have these little disks, with different sensors (this is just a purely gravity one) and depending on what you needed to do you\u0027d pick up the required one before descending. However these little blighters have been seriously annoying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have larger modules that have the materials and goo containers and those worked perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the configuration of this small module causes a bug in the docking ports. I could pick one up and use it, but when bringing it back it just simply refused to redock to the orbital craft. I wasted several hours trying to figure out what was wrong and eventually I found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/1158\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis bug report\u003C/a\u003E, so I checked my Pfile and lo; one of the ports did indeed have the wrong state. So I changed the state and reloaded and it docked. I thought it was just a 1 off glitch and carried on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it happened again and again (with all the small modules with the above design), and on the 2nd (3rd, 4th, 5th, arrrgh) time changing the state in the Pfile didn\u0027t solve it. If I perfectly lined up to dock and then undocked the module from the lander and let it float on towards the orbital craft it would dock when it arrived. I thought I\u0027d found a work around, but infact that just created other problems because the port still had not been set to the right state and in some cases it was actually just being held in place by the other ports magnetism, the port that should have docked was not actually doing anything. If that happened and I did a reload or approached the orbital craft the module would just float off and neither port would then respond so I couldn\u0027t recover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes I couldn\u0027t do that because it wouldn\u0027t undock from the lander, the connected port would \u0022undock\u0022 but then it would instantly be attracted to the lander again because the other ports magnetism engaged and just held it there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander on its own didn\u0027t have any problems docking to anything else, I could dock directly to the orbital craft or pick up the other larger modules, but with that small module this bug was almost guaranteed to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had anything like this happen before, even with some really odd designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there where several things going wrong, and all because the two ports on the module are so close together, only separated by a small battery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) they interfered with each other resulting in their states not getting reset correctly when one was undocked.

As soon as the dropship docked, all control went out the airlock, and it just kind of hung there frozen until I switched to the Spaceport and back. After that, I got the whole shebang docked to the transport, but the whole assembly started bucking to and fro wildly. Switch to Spaceport and back, and all is calm once more, but from there I ran headlong into that dock state bug for the first time. I was really confused about why the dropship wouldn\u0027t undock at all, until I found a detailed post describing the situation. I got pretty confused trying to identify exactly what had happened from that post, so I tried dropping out of the game and re-loading. That ended up fixing the issue that one time, but from there it was really obvious those Jr clamps are pretty crap. They shuffle and pull away far too easily, or just bug out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat same dropship design has performed many successful drops of a larger rover using Quantum Struts, so I\u0027m relatively certain the bugs I encountered are related to that one stupid port, which I\u0027ve never used until I tried to deploy such a tiny rover in that way. The main differences with this rover are that it uses the RollKage mod for the cabin, on the top of which sits that little Jr clamp, and has a regular docking clamp on a decoupler on the bottom. The \u0022Kurb Burner\u0022 does include a probe core for automated movement, so there shouldn\u0027t be a problem with detection as debris (it shows as a probe when cut loose from its launcher or the dropship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll know more about potential causes tomorrow evening, after I\u0027ve re-tooled and re-launched the entire fleet.

The one attempt I was able to make on that docking so far was done while the struts were accidentally left active on the rover before the connection. It may come down to just making sure I have them switched off before completing the rendezvous. I can semi-confirm this is likely the problem with the locking problem, as Venture\u0027s vehicle bay is strewn with those quantum struts, and they cause no issues during launch or flight, especially since even when the bay doors are open, those struts are still attached to the open doors. I just have to make sure I shut them down before docking or launching the dropship, or things get... weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the port bug, there is something to consider regarding the ports involved. Jr and Sr are both relative newcomers to the collection (compared to the standard port), are they not? Is there something about their models that causes some kind of limit violation within the game\u0027s engine, resulting in the screwy state corruption in the persistence file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the shielded docking port? Anybody run into this bug using that one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing their .cfg files, there really isn\u0027t any difference where the involved modules are concerned, and the rest are just simple placement and tolerance specs. Nothing really stands out that could point to a potential cause there. It has to be something related to their interaction with other parts. I\u0027m betting the initial call-out regarding back to back ports is a major player in this case, but then, that means there\u0027s ALSO something else at play here, given the issues I experienced with my particular setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, with what we\u0027ve seen collectively so far, it looks like the standard port seems to be exempt from this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to the new attempt tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T05:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the issues are wiped out on my side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover was given a regular docking port to replace the Jr one, and the quantum struts were removed from it altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelivery and retrieval was uneventful, with the dropship maintaining complete control authority after locking down on the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStowing the rover to the main ship similarly went without a hitch, with the dropship de-coupling easily and without bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, everything looks good.
