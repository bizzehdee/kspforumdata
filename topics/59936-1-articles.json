He\u0027s the main reason I have Half Life 2, Call of Duty 1, Republic Commandos, Age of Empires 2, and many more. The funny thing is I discovered most of the games on my own years later, as I never knew the titles of the games when I first saw them. It\u0027s like a really drawn out scavenger hunt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I still haven\u0027t found a star wars game that I really took an interest in, and I\u0027m now resorting to forums. Here\u0027s the main details I remember:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u0027s an FPS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You use blasters, vehicles, and a light saber\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There\u0027s an AT-ST in a desert/canyon mission, so most likely post-movie era\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. During a cutscene, the player walks into a bar and starts to talk to the bartender, who throws a glass he was washing offscreen, then shouts, \u0022Jesse!\u0022 I remember that specifically because it was really funny for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you get the light saber, it\u0027s on an elevated (possibly octagonal) platform, where walls lower over it when you get too close. You have to get it by getting a running start and jumping onto the platform, outrunning the walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. I\u0027d say the graphics were HL2-quality, and my brother plays everything on max settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I think the last boss was with a \u0022dinosaur-looking\u0022 sith (that\u0027s how I described him back then, anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Pretty sure there was multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve scoured Steam, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s on there. Any help is greatly appreciated.
