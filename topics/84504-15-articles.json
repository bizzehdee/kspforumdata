It will be the last use of non-metric units because it will be the hardest to change without mishap. Like what happened in World War 2 in the Pacific theatre when the United States Navy used nautical miles and the United States Army Air Force used statute miles. And U.S.A.A.F. aircraft were sent on a mission given data in nautical miles and compared that to their aircraft loaded radius of action in statute miles and thought it would work and it didn\u0027t and air crews died. Which lead to all air forces and then civilian pilots standardizing on nautical miles. Altitude in feet got included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll operating systems now can run in 64-bit mode. But a lot of the software is still 32-bit. Which is why all 64-bit operating systems have robust ways of running 32-bit code. I\u0027m typing this post into the latest Firefox. Firefox on Windows is still 32-bit code, even though the OS is 64-bit, because that\u0027s the compiled versions supplied by Mozilla. Under Linux, Firefox can be 64-bit. And then I have other hoops to jump through because other stuff that runs in the browser is still 32-bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy OS right now is Windows 8.1 64-bit. But I run the KSP 32-bit executable because under Windows Unity 64-bit and KSP 64-bit are full of bugs. Game-breaking bugs. Squad called Windows KSP 64-bit experimental and says it got worse in KSP 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because you\u0027ve run Windows KSP 64-bit without issue for a while doesn\u0027t change that. And doesn\u0027t change the fact that you will likely hit one of those bugs. And you add in the number of players who play any mod and they will have issues with KSP 64-bit. Which they demand the mod writer fix. Even though it\u0027s impossible. Because they don\u0027t know and don\u0027t care to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thus a lot of mod writers are sick of this crap and now have their mods refuse to run under Windows KSP 64-bit.

I got some message like \u0027too many trajectories\u0027 or something like that. KSP normally runs at a sharp 60 fps all the time, so for one mod to be able to bring it to a crawl is just something I\u0027m not going to bother with right now. I wish I had better information for you, but the message it gave isn\u0027t in the log and if I\u0027m correct, after I exited and re-entered the flight scene it has just simply disabled itself anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t know for sure but that might mean the simulation runs despite having \u0027display trajectories\u0027 unchecked, since that didn\u0027t alleviate the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-20T20:49:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2014 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Youen","CreatedById":116909,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T23:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis message is normal, it just means that since the atmospheric trajectory is too long (very shallow), the prediction stops in mid-air to avoid simulating forever. The lag you are experiencing would more probably be caused by a bug, because if KSP runs smooth without the mod, it should still run well with, even for the maximum trajectory length. Nothing relevant in output_log.txt ? Most times such a bug happens, the lag is actually caused by exceptions logged every frame, so the corresponding part of the log is easy to spot by scrolling (lot of identical errors in a row). Don\u0027t know if it\u0027s what\u0027s happening to you, though. I assume you\u0027ve tested with the latest version ? (0.4.1) And what version of KSP ?

I did notice in the log it had a long list of entries around that time, but they came to an end so it\u0027s hard to say if it happened alongside the reentry or before. The only way I can think of to test it would be to send a Kerbal without any badges up and see if it happens again. The flight plan was very basic: take off, orbit, de-orbit.
