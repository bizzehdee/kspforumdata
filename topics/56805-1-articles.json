Think of Kerbin being at the bottom of a big hole and the Mun being at the bottom of a smaller one. Maybe that\u0027s why they call them gravity wells? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to increase the difference in delta vee, when you take off you\u0027re losing delta vee to air drag. But coming back air drag is your friend. It helps you shed velocity which saves you fuel you\u0027d otherwise have to burn since you can aerobrake to slow down. The same may or may not be true for trips to the various planets depending on whether they are higher or lower than Kerbin in Kerbol\u0027s gravity well. First time you go to the Mun have double the delta vee you calculate that you need for a one way trip and you\u0027ll get back with fuel to spare. After that you\u0027ll know about how much to cut back for the next trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
