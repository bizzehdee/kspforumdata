Makes sense to have a good model for buoyancy, thermal, and atmo (alongside working, bug-free, physics in general) before you make beautiful planets and parts. Why go exploring if the experience would be a giant, ill-working, let down. Dev\u0027s can take all the time they need to get out a good product IMO, everything will come in due time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T17:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure all I say has been mentioned before, but as I see it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Aerobraking at Jool and Eve has theoretically been fixed (though since introduced to the Tylo Slingshot, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be doing a Jool aerobrake any time soon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-New engine (one quarter of a Mammoth with awesome gimbal and placement properties)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Many small overall UI changes, like the camera double-click mouselook (which also handily disables the Green Mouseover Glow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Things now float in water\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Parachutes turn red when going too fast, and can be un-deployed if accidentally staged\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Radiators now work, in theory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Hollow structural fuselages!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, 1.1 will bring the promised probe changes, which will be a game-changer for interplanetary missions with its antenna requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, a few more LF\u002BO rocket engines would be appreciated for variety - at least, a mid-level size-1 engine between the LV-T30 and the 909, like a size-1 skipper.

Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say you first get a contract to do temperature scans of the Mun at 3g-7608z. When you execute that contract successfully, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll sometimes, not always be told that you noted sme kind of an anomaly at a specific surface location. This will automatically trigger a surface exploration contract at that location that requires you to do some rover exploration to scout the area. When you successfully complete that, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll identify the one exact spot where the anomaly lies. That in turn will trigger a surface sampling (or better yet ore drilling) contract that will ultimately unearth *something*. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSomething\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 could be some sort of unobtainium ore that perhaps lets you create an income stream or unlock some specific advanced technology. Alternately, it could be some kind of alien artifact that does the same thing, or that leads you to explore in a different location. Heck, it could even be some kind of humorous easter egg, like the Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Big Boy statue with Dr. Evil in it! OK, that would be too cheap, but you get the idea! Having *some* kind of reward that goes beyond just the rep, science, and cash would make grinding through all that stuff immensely more fun IMO.
