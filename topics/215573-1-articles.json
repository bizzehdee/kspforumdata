For me the most crucial thing is that I cant change the camera span from middle mouse button to another button. It is a preference thing, but I only use the middle mouse for scrolling, I don\u0027t like using it for clicking, because of life span reasons. So for me in games the first thing is to change whatever is on the middle mouse button to the side buttons on the mouse or usually LeftAlt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if anybody has any other thing related to this topic feel free to comment and I hope this will reach the development team someday and gets added to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
