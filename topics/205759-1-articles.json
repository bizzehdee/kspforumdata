Now it is \u0022inside\u0022 the fuel tank, and its tail section sticks out. I can not select it with the mouse in order to turn it over and put it right. The problem is that I tried to put another docking port side by side upside down, and it also does not select, in order to put it \u0022right\u0022 side up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow can this problem be solved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022upside-down-ports.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002279.53\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 width=\u0022723\u0022 src=\u0022https://baik.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/upside-down-ports.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-26T21:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry moving the camera to be inside the fuel tank so you can see the head of the docking port, and then grab it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrAlexTg","CreatedById":217651,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-26T21:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is a brilliant proposal.
