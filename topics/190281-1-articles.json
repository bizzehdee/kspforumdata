A typical ascent profile is to climb to 20km (depending on engine and plane design), level off to a very slow climb, accelerate to 1300m/s, then nose up to 20 degrees. Higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is easier to get to orbit; find a climb angle at takeoff that lets you continually accelerate yet avoid catastrophic overheating, and then you can just keep going without temporarily leveling off at 20km you can just keep climbing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-10T19:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat engine do you use?
