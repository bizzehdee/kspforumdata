One of my favourite mods, though I currently use a modified version of it. Alas, the only \u0027official\u0027 link I\u0027ve got for these engines is dead, but I do have them myself. I haven\u0027t seen any activity from the guy who was supposed to be maintaining the mod for quite a while, so... [**here you go**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/031s2vlu275z4cq/Leucome.zip?dl=0). Updated to 1.0 for you (hopefully) ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI should be alright sharing it, according to the readme file included, as I\u0027m not claiming it\u0027s mine. That said, I think I\u0027ll send a PM to the guy who\u0027s supposed to be looking after the mod to see if he replies. If not, I might see about undertaking maintenance on this mod myself, maybe even expanding it a bit to include my modifications... hmm..."},{"CreatedByName":"sploooshman","CreatedById":106583,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T14:16:05Z","Content":"oh you absolute legend , last time i looked a long time ago i found the dead page of the guy that made it , so thanks , they go great with the PMI fuel gen and large solar sails , for cheating my way around RSS , however im sure one day we will discover a way to generate efficient fuel while on the go in space so im just a little ahead of our time ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nthank so much"}]}
