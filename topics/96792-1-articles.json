I find it very useful for attaching air intakes that point directly at the air flow while the wings have 5 degrees angle of attack. I have also used it to angle cockpits down for IVA flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fifteen degree angled tank: The brother of the 5 deg tank this tanks top is angled at 15 degrees. useable for attaching shuttle engines or what ever you like really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oxidizer tank: A simple tank in the same size as the FL-T100 Fuel Tank but containing just 100 Oxidizer.

It has eight times the area of a mk2 ram intake but balances this with being much larger and having 40 times the mass. That\u0027s right 40 times the mass, which is a lot to lug around space but is not to problematic for SSTO\u0027s and adds drag as well (with 0.90\u0027s bad Aero dynamic system).
