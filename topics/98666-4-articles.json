Modelling is outside my skillset, so we\u0027d either need a volunteer for that, or use the regular potatoroid. Big is easy to do. Interesting orbit (high inclination, highly elliptical, far orbit) are all easy. If we tie it to a very specific timeframe in game-time, we can do something like putting it on a near miss of Jool, and the player is required to bring it to Kerbin (where the only feasible delta-v option is to use a Jool gravity assist).
