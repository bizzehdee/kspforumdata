KSP doesn\u0027t deal with single parts with extremely large masses very well, a lot of the settings in their cfg behave as if they\u0027re relative or on curves where you wouldn\u0027t expect them to, and a lot of important things about their behaviors are not controlled by settings. For instance, the wobble of a joint is defined by the relative mass of the two connected parts, so your 1.5Kt tank will be Extremely wobbly because nothing can compare to it\u0027s absurd mass and will thus have weak joints. This is why the radial attachment points all weigh so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"james4832","CreatedById":74556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T05:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould I make a request?
