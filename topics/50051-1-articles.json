We were driving to the KSC, which was east from us. There were only 70 Kilometers left. We were expected to be there before sunrise so we could quickly start out mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly a tire blew. The car stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What the...those are reinforced ones!\u0022, screamed Olsen angrily. He took out his tools and started replacing the tire. I and the others stayed in the car.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly we heard a loud scream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe looked outside, and we only saw Olsen being pulled into the forest until he vanished in the trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBjornsen, our sergeant, pulled out his machine pistol and exited the car.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see it! I see it!\u0022.

The last thing i remember was how it jumped into our car.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen i woke up in the Hospital. They said they had to search for our car with a helicopter and the confidency of the Mission could only be kept by lying to the local population. Bjornsen, Olsen and Haraldsen (The third of my colleagues) were never seen again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Annoyingorbits","CreatedById":35445,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T15:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks nice, Scandinavian names for the colleagues, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
