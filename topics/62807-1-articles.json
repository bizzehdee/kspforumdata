The view would pan around the rocket on each launch to capture sky, horizon and ground. It would be a feature in the options menu, as well as a skippable part of the first run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can then be used to tune a warning in the VAB/SPH when the part count starts getting a bit silly for the current system. A popup would explain that you\u0027re asking for X frames per second, but the current build will run at approximately Y frames per second. At current physics delta, this will result in the game running at zero point something times normal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the first popup, this can be represented somewhere unobtrusive as a value that decreases further below 1 and towards 0 for every further part added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
