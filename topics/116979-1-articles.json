Be aware that this will be visible, the UI will flicker off and then on during the screenshot.\n- The screenshots are saved as PNG files. PNG files can be big, so you can also specify that the PNG files be converted to JPG files, and optionally delete the PNG file after conversion\n- Can detect an imminent crash or landing, and switch to a faster rate of screensho\n- Can now take 2 screenshots, one with AND one without the UI\n\nCredit must go to [magico13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/75272-magico13) for his Sensible Screenshots mod, which provided the code for the following filename functionality.\n\n**Please note that this mod does NOT rename manual screenshots.**\n\nThe filename is fully configurable, by using variables in the file name.\n\n**The following are the \u0022variables\u0022 available in file names**\n\n- [date] = Parsed DateString\n- [uT] = Current in-game time in seconds\n- [save] = Name of current save game\n- [vessel] = Active Vessel name\n- [body] = Current primary celestial body name\n- [situation] = Active Vessel situation (PRELAUNCH, FLYING, ORBITING, etc.)\n- [biome] = Current Active Vessel biome\n- [year] = Current in-game year (as seen in top left during flight (1, 2, etc.))\n- [day] = Current in-game day (similar to year)\n- [hour] = in-game hour\n- [min] = in-game minute\n- [sec] = in-game seconds\n- [evt] = event flag\n\nThe hour, min and sec variables have a leading zero added if \u003C10\n\n**Event Flag**\n\n1. If a screenshot by time interval: time\n2. If by scene change: scene\n3. If by special event: event\n\n**Example**\n\nAn example (ridiculous) possible filename is: AS\\_[date][save][vessel][body][biome]\\_[situation]\\_Y[year]\\_D[day]\\_H[hour]\\_M[min]\\_S[sec]\\_UT[uT]\n\nwhich could turn out to be: AS\\_2015-04-30-22-22\\_KSPv1.0.0\\_SaveGameTest\\_Kerbal#X\\_Kerbin\\_Shores\\_PRELAUNCH\\_Y1\\_D10\\_H5\\_M7\\_S36\\_UT212856.png\n\nThe code for the JPG conversion and the custom filenames was taken from the Sensible Screenshot mod, written by magico13\n\nWhile this can take screenshots as fast as one per second, I wouldn\u0027t recommend taking anything faster than 1/every 5 seconds or so, just to avoid any performance problems, especially when there is a lot of physics going on.\n\n**Special Events**\n\nThe following are the special events which the mod can sense:\n\nCrash\n\nSpashdown\n\nCrew Killed\n\nCrwe on eva\n\nFlag Planting\n\nLaunch\n\nPart couple\n\nPart die (explode)\n\nJoint breaking\n\nundocking\n\nactivating stage\n\nstage seperation\n\nchanging vessel\n\nmaking orbit\n\nescaping orbit\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E changed\n\n**Automated Saves**\n\nThe mod will now do automatic saves at specified intervals. it will only keep a specified number of save files.\n\nAutomatic saves is turned on by hitting **Ctrl-F5**\n\n**Usage**\n\nAssuming you are using the default of F6 for the screenshots, the icon in the toolbar will be one of the following. The icons for the regular toolbar and the Blizzy toolbar are the same except for size:\n\n| 1 | All White | ![AS.png](http://spacetux.net/images/AS.png) | Nothing is activated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | Reversed |  | Configuration window is active |\n| 3 | Green camera | ![AS-snapshot.png](http://spacetux.net/images/AS-snapshot.png) | Automated screenshots are active |\n| 4 | Green disk | ![AS-autosave.png](http://spacetux.net/images/AS-autosave.png) | Automated saves are active |\n|  | Green camera and disk | ![AS-snap-save.png](http://spacetux.net/images/AS-snap-save.png) | Both automated screenshots and automated saves are active |\n\n**Configuration**\n\nNew Feature added (not in screen below yet): Supersize Screenshots\n\n**Important note regarding the Supersize option:**\n\nThe values range from 0-4. 0 is the default, 1 is the same as 0.\n\nNote that a value of 4 can take up to a second to do the screenshot. This option is extremely processor intensive, only use it if you need it for cinematics.\n\nSet this to the factor which you want your screen resolution to be multiplied by. For example, if your game resolution is 1280x720, setting the number here to 2 would give you screenshots of size 2560x1440.\n\nSee the image below for the configuration screen. Explanations of the fields are below the image:\n\n![ASS.png](http://spacetux.net/images/ASS.png)\n\n| Screenshot interval in seconds | Time between each screenshot. You can go down to 1/10 of a second |\n| --- | --- |\n| Convert to JPG | Screenshots are saved as PNG files, which are large. This will convert the saved file to a JPG file, which is a lot smaller |\n| Keep original PNG | If checked, will keep the original PNG file after conversion |\n| Screenshot path | Path to save screenshots. Defaults to standard screenshot folder |\n| Filename format | The filename is completely configurable. See the section on the filename variables for complete information |\n| JPEG Quality | Quality of the converted JPG. Default is 75, I suggest you leave it there. Lower numbers means a smaller file, but also a loss of quality |\n| Screenshot after scene change | If you want an additional screenshot after each scene change, enable this |\n| Screenshot after special event | KSP has special events (ie: crash, crew killed, etc). See the section on special events for more details |\n| Use Blizzy Toolbar if available | If the Blizzy toolbar is installed, use it. |\n| Activation Keycode | What key will activate the screenshots |\n| No GUI on Screenshot | Disable the GUI (ie: F2) before taking the screenshot |\n| GUI on screenshot | Take the screenshot with the GUI on. Both this and the previous can be done, which would result in 2 screenshots |\n|  |  |\n| Take pre-crash snapshots | Take extra snapshots if a crash is imminent |\n| Seconds until impact | Start taking snapshots this many seconds before impact |\n| Altitude limit | Must be below this altitude for pre-crash screenshots to be taken. |\n| Minimum vertical speed | If speed is below this, it isn\u0027t a crash |\n| Screenshot interval (pre-crash) | Interval between screenshots for the pre-crash settings. You can go down to 1/10 of a second |\n|  |  |\n| Minutes between saves | Save the game once this many minutes |\n| Save file format | Name of the save file, uses same rules as the snapshot files |\n| Max save files | Keep this many save files and no more, deletes any extra (only of the ones that were saved using this mod |\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-30T22:27:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2018 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**\n  \nNew release"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T14:48:59Z","Content":"very interesting, not just for the screenshots but the event triggers.
