But, as they started delving more into 1.02, one-by-one they all lost interest, fed up with the bugs (my spaceplanes just hit the KSC in orbit and gone kaboom!), dodgy physics (how can one strut produce more drag than 4 wings?!?!!) and the stupid part balancing issues (frying nukes, anyone?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ve stopped playing, too, waiting (probably in vain) for 1.03 to fix the issues and make KSP worth playing again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, I think Squad has lost the plot: judging by some of the half-baked decisions they\u0027ve made over the last year, they can\u0027t even manage the development of the PC version properly, so how the hell are they going to manage the PS4 port as well, especially as Flying Tiger are just a bunch of pound-shop developers, by the looks of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, as the game is built around mods, Squad can\u0027t fall back on them, in the ported,version, to plug over the gaps in KSPs functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, mods aside, I can\u0027t think of a game LESS suited to a games console because of its sheer complexity; (this situation reminds me of what happened to IL2 when it got ported: the ported-version became a dumbed-down, thumb-aching borefest, while the PC version became so buggy, it got blasted by the reviewers, failed to sell, and the franchise died in the process). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is going on with this decision? Is this a joke? Are Squad so arrogant to think the existing player-base doesn\u0027t matter anymore? I\u0027ve always felt these guy\u0027s were making it up as they went along and now it looks to me like, Squad are either in-over-their-heads and trying to sell-off the game before its development stalls completely through poor project-management - or their plan, all along, was to not to finish the game, but to bash-it-out and make a quick buck by selling the project off, half-done to one of the big-boyz to finish (or ruin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately for them, it\u0027s taken the FOUR YEARS to get it to that state and I don\u0027t see Squad making a bundle anytime soon: it\u0027ll cost them a-plenty to get \u0022Flying-Tiger\u0022 to come up with something workable for the PS4 (which is a bit of a flop anyway) and even longer before all that investment turns into profit, so all this stuff about money being ploughed back into better development is wishful thinking, in my view.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T14:03:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed some language filter skirting.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Interplanet Janet","CreatedById":146268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only own the last-gen consoles (PS3 and Xbox 360, and an unused Wii).
