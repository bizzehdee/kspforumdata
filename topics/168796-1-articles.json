Riding the gigantic Saturn V booster into orbit and beyond, they circled the Moon,\u00A0becoming\u00A0the first human beings ever to see their homeworld rising over a new horizon.\u00A0For the flight controllers at Mission Control this, more than any of the other \u003Cem\u003EApollo\u003C/em\u003E flights was a voyage for the ages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was the height of the Space Race with the Soviet Union.\u00A0The stakes were high. The risks were even higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Apollo command and service module (CSM) had only flown a single crewed flight. With no lunar module to provide an emergency lifeboat, it and it alone would be responsible for getting the crew into lunar orbit - and bringing them home again. The Saturn V had only flown two uncrewed test flights, one of them plagued by pogo problems. The computer software responsible for the whole complex mission around two celestial bodies had only just been finished in time for the December launch date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Apollo Program has been a huge influence and source of inspiration for my KSP writing. Even so, I didn\u0027t start out expecting\u00A0my description of the first kerballed flight to the M\u00FCn to have quite so many parallels with the real thing, from the uncertain global situation in the background to the missing lander (albeit for budgetary rather than technical reasons). But since they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E there, I consider this to be\u00A0my own, very small, tribute to \u003Cem\u003EApollo 8\u003C/em\u003E and everyone who made it happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please be advised - there is a Santa Claus.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 1 - World on the Edge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell now - there\u2019s something you don\u2019t see too often.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDondrin stepped out from under the sheltered portico that guarded the entrance to the Capital building. \u003Cem\u003ENorthern Wakiran ceremonial garb I would say, and very traditional it looks too\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0He inspected the ornate fur collar more closely. \u003Cem\u003EPoor fellow must be melting under all that.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, Ambassador.

For the benefit of all news outlets,\u201D he added sardonically. He strode towards the reception desk and, after a brief exchange with the receptionist, marched out of the lobby with Dondrin following at a discreet distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as he\u2019d assured himself that the aloof ambassador was indeed heading for the Council chamber, Dondrin took off for the press gallery at a run. He burst through the door and threw himself into a chair as the Chamber doors thudded shut below. Chief Ambassador Burvis waited at the podium, the remaining Pillars sitting silently around the Council table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMisters President, mesdames President, honoured chief Ambassadors.

One or two of them exchanged brief looks. Up in the press gallery, Dondrin leaned forward intently.

I\u2019ll ring Ademone now. If Rockomax are still in, we call a general meeting first thing tomorrow morning. Anybody that wants to go back to their Groves, or bail out for any other reason, goes with our sincere thanks and best wishes. If enough of the team are left - we launch. Too bad we never got to build the lander but If this ends up being our final flight, then lets give them all a glimpse of what should have been.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2 - Go at Thirty-Six\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from the last minute furore, thought Wernher, the launch preparations had been surprisingly similar to those for \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E. The lines of Kerbin Interplanetary Society members outside the warehouse to see them off; the ride to the Space Centre in Ornie\u2019s truck; climbing onto the back of the truck out of sight of the crowds; waving to those same crowds as they drove past the stands and out to the launch pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd here I am again, standing on the gantry outside a three kerbal capsule, waiting for Bob to give the word.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared down over the gantry rail at\u003Cem\u003E Pioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s gleaming white flanks resplendent, as usual, with sponsor\u2019s logos. From this height, only the chunky blue R and stylised silver engine nozzle of Rockomax\u2019s new logo were visible, proudly emblazoned on each lateral booster. The remaining letters and the tail end of their \u201CThink Better - Think Bigger!\u201D slogan were hidden by perspective and distance. Far below that the engines waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the distance, the Space Centre buildings stood silhouetted against the cloudless morning sky. Sunlight twinkled off the corrugated steel cladding of the Vehicle Assembly Building, squat and blocky at the end of the newly laid strip of asphalt linking it to the launch pad. The pad itself was deathly silent. By now, most of the engineers were safely ensconced within the launch bunker, and even the flocks of birds that usually made the gantries their home were nowhere to be seen, or heard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI wonder if they know something I don\u2019t.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ring of work boots on steel brought him back to the present, as Bob climbed out of the hatch and joined him by the rail. The rest of the pad team stood back at a respectful distance. For a moment the two friends gazed across the deserted launch site.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob cleared his throat, \u201CWernher?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gestured at the nose cone far beneath them. \u201CThree T20s,\u00A0Bob. The breakthrough that launched Jeb into orbit and we\u2019ll be discarding them less than three minutes into the flight.\u201D The chief engineer stared down at the distant launch pad. \u201CA single T30 is powerful enough to lift the entire Moho stack\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob nodded patiently. \u201CAnd Pioneer needs three of them just to get off the ground. I know, Wernher, I know.\u201D He grinned at a sudden memory, \u201CI\u2019d rather be sitting on top of three T30s than one LV-15 and a pile of Trashcans though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher snorted. \u201CIndeed.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CDear Kerm - what were we \u003Cem\u003Ethinking\u003C/em\u003E? Putting you, Bill, and Jeb inside that contraption.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob squeezed his shoulder. \u201COr you, Lucan and Gene, for that matter.\u201D He tapped his headset. \u201CJim and Sherf are all set. Time to go join them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reply, Wernher handed his spacesuit helmet to Bob and strode over to the open hatch. Gripping the hand rails tightly, he swung himself down into the capsule, manoeuvring his bulky spacesuit through the narrow gap. Sherfel grinned at him through her transparent helmet. James turned his head, nodded briefly, then turned his attention back to the instrument panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as he\u2019d settled into his acceleration couch, Bob climbed into the capsule after him. Wernher watched him work, shifting from side to side in his seat to let him reach all the assorted ports, plugs and sockets of the life-support and communication systems. He grunted as the engineer tightened his couch harness, checking that the straps were all lying flat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSatisfied, Bob lifted Wernher\u2019s helmet into place, and locked it in place against the neck ring of his suit. He rapped on the transparent bubble for luck, flashed a grin at his friend, and plugged his headset into the auxiliary comms port on the side of capsule instrument panel. \u201CYou\u2019re looking good, folks. Wave at the M\u00FCn for me, and we\u2019ll see you all back here next week.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll write you a postcard,\u201D said Sherfel cheerfully, \u201CCan\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll get to you before we get home though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob laughed. \u201CSending it \u003Cem\u003EPioneer \u003C/em\u003Eclass will be fine,\u201D he said, \u201CI\u2019m closing the hatch now. Good luck.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch swung shut and locked with a clunk. Wernher switched his headset on and surveyed the the profusion of switches, buttons, dials and other readouts laid out in front of him. He stretched his legs out, nodding in satisfaction as his boots hit the capsule bulkhead. \u003Cem\u003EGood legroom. Compared to Kerbal 2 at any rate.\u003C/em\u003E A sudden draft from the capsule fans riffled the pages of his checklist as the environmental systems kicked in, purging the cabin atmosphere and replacing it with a flight ready, oxygen-nitrogen mix.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe clicked his microphone on. \u201CFlight, Pioneer.

Wernher saw James\u2019 lips moving behind his bubble helmet as he paged through his checklist. The main air to ground loop cut in with a burst of static. \u00A0\u201CAdvisory panels one through three are good, Flight. Standing by for pre-staging and abort-to-orbit checks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Pioneer,\u201D Geneney replied. \u201CWernher, please go to Loop Three, and confirm engine telemetry status.

The capsule was quiet, his acceleration couch had moulded itself comfortably around his suit, and the droning fans of the environmental system were almost soporific.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shook his head sharply, hoping that Sherfel and James hadn\u2019t seen him. \u003Cem\u003EI\u2019m sure Jeb would be highly amused if I fell asleep atop of a fully fuelled M\u00FCn rocket, but I doubt that my two colleagues here would be too impressed.

Ready for external power off.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fans stuttered, the capsule lighting flickering briefly before settling down again. Wernher scanned his system readouts - beside him, James and Sherfel checked their own sections of the control panel. All three kerbonauts reported a successful test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe see it too, Pioneer. Reconnecting external power. Guidance is ready for the SME gimbal test.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher flipped a pair of switches, disconnecting the reentry batteries from the capsule power systems, turned to the Service Module Engine panel and threw another set of switches.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGimbal motors drawing power.

He carefully tested their range of movement, watching his nav-ball tilt and roll in response. After each deflection, he waited whilst \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s onboard computer attempted to re-centre the gimbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYaw gimbal tracking confirmed\u2026 pitch tracking is good\u2026 roll tracking confirmed.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Pioneer,\u201D said Geneney. \u201COK guys, break until KDS confirmation from Foxham.

Around him, fidgeting flight controllers flicked through logbooks and swung back and forth on their chairs, sneaking surreptitious glances at his console. The open communication loop to \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E filled the room with a faint hiss of static, the crew as quiet as their controllers. Above their heads, the countdown clock was poised at T minus thirty minutes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA controller coughed. Geneney paged his headset from one loop to the next, eventually settling on the public link from the KBS commentary box. Leland was busy running through the countdown, explaining the current hold to the crowds in the stands and, Geneney noted, describing the Rockomax payload as a \u2018docking target.\u2019 \u003Cem\u003EWe did a good job keeping this flight quiet but Leland is pretty sharp.

Inside the capsule, Wernher lay flat on his back, swaddled in a discordant, shrieking cocoon of sound. His head sank back into his acceleration couch, eyes still level with the control panel, which was reassuringly free of warning lights, despite the shaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENow\u003C/em\u003E this \u003Cem\u003Eis what I call a rocket ship!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove his head something began to rattle. The broad grin on his face slipped a notch and he reflexively searched the capsule for loose equipment. Then the engine noise abruptly shifted pitch, James\u0027s unperturbed voice clear in his ears.\u00A0\u0022Flight, Pioneer.

Guidance is green, pitch and roll is Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe couch frame creaked under the strain. Wernher\u00A0grunted at the growing weight on his chest, squinting at the blurred displays on the vibrating instrument panel. The flight clock clicked past the two minute mark, and he slowly lifted one arm, fighting to hold it steady against the g-forces, finger aimed at the LB-JETT button.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Decouplers A through C armed.

Three lights blinked out in front of him, a curiously muffled bang marking the departure of the lateral boosters. Relieved, Wernher let his arm drop back onto his couch. The vibrations shaking the capsule smoothed out, became a deep seated roar rather than the bone jarring discord of launch. A distant part of his mind noticed that the mysterious rattling hadn\u0027t returned, and was glad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe velocity and altitude displays on the instrument panel raced upwards. Wernher felt his weight shift, harness straps pulling on his shoulders as \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0gradually heeled over along its pre-programmed flight path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thirty-six kilometres.

It rocked slightly as it reached the top of its thirty-five kilometre high arc and started the long descent. Wernher listened to the gradually increasing thrumming noise from outside the capsule as it dropped back into thicker air.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot today we don\u2019t!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher snapped out of his reverie, thankful that neither the rest of the crew, nor Mission Control chose to comment on his outburst.

Raw, unfiltered sunlight washed through the capsule side window and over the legs of his spacesuit. The view through the smaller rendezvous window above his head was a uniform inky black, and for a moment he wished he was in James\u0027s seat and able to snatch a glimpse of Kerbin outside. Experimentally, he lifted an arm and grinned in delight as it hung effortlessly in front of him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good burn, Pioneer.

Shorter bursts of flame tipped it back over, pointing its nose along its direction of flight and aiming it squarely at a shining point of light in the distance.

The thrusters flickered again, edging the capsule into position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer, Flight.

Sherfel stared straight ahead through the rendezvous windows. James glanced back at him and nodded fractionally. For a moment, there was silence, each kerbonaut all too aware of what that silence meant.

One by one, each of them raised a thumb. He braced himself, made a note on Geneney\u0027s flight log, and clicked his microphone on.\u00A0\u0022OK, Pioneer, I\u0027ve got a roomful of kerbals here telling me you\u0027re looking good.\u0022 Jeb paused, shifting into Geneney\u0027s formal flight director\u2019s tones. \u00A0\u0022Pioneer 1, you are Go for TMI.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer copies, Go for TMI.

Over at the commander\u0027s station, James\u0027s face remained carefully impassive, but even in zero-gravity, the set of his shoulders told their own story. The drop in tension over the air to ground loop was palpable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s about what we\u0027re seeing too, Pioneer.\u0022 Geneney paused, and Wernher heard a mutter of background conversation. \u0022OK, team, the bad news is that CapSys isn\u0027t too happy about that leaked coolant.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And the good news, Flight?\u0022 said James quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that the Systems team have just dropped the answer off at my console. It\u0027s a bit\u2026 homely, but it should do the job. Wernher, I want you to head down into the lower bay and retrieve that roll of sealant tape. Jim, Sherf, we\u0027re going to need the covers from your checklists and a couple of empty ration packs - the cleaner the better.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On it, Flight.\u0022 Wernher eased himself over the edge of his couch and swung himself gingerly into the space under the crew seating. Small and cramped back on Kerbin, the lower equipment bay felt much roomier in free-fall. Wernher squeezed past the sanitation facility and twisted round to face the tool storage bin. Contents may have shifted in transit. Carefully, he slid it open, retrieved a roll of silvery tape, and just as carefully, slid it closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got the tape, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. Pass it up to Sherf. CapSys is coming on loop to take her and Jim through the next part. In the meantime, I want you to unscrew the main hose from the sanitation bowl. Sherf - please confirm waste valves A and B are closed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher heard shuffling overhead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Closed, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sanitation facility was designed to be repairable in flight. Wernher braced himself awkwardly against the bulkhead and fumbled with the first of two large butterfly nuts securing the outflow hose to the bowl. Above his head he could hear ripping noises and the squeaky rasp of sealant tape peeling off its roll. Grunting with effort, he leaned on the nut as best he could, and felt it shift slightly in his hands.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMust remember...to tell the capsule team... to grease these things before flight.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuttering under his breath, Wernher managed to loosen the first nut. The second one was more tractable. He spun it free, carefully leaving it on its bolt and easing the two halves of the locking clamp apart. Holding his breath he tugged the outflow hose off its mount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hose is free, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good work.

James glanced over at them, nodded, and took hold of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yaw then roll, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s affirmative, Jim. Yaw, negative-y translation pulse, roll, plus-z translation pulse.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames worked the controls. Wernher felt Pioneer 1 shift around him, nudged by the fleeting bursts of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CManoeuvre completed, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher was already unbuckling his harness. \u201CAccess panel one, Flight?\u201D he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAccess panel one,\u201D said Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher twisted four restraining latches out of the way, and lifted a square metal panel from its frame in the bulkhead. Working slowly in the confined space, he slipped the panel between the panel and the sanitation bowl, and peered inside the maintenance compartment. \u00A0Shimmering, oily globs of coolant quivered near the bulkhead, but as far as he could see, there weren\u2019t any other spills trapped in the maze of plumbing and wiring looms. The globs quivered, rainbows of refracted light scurrying over their translucent surfaces. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe ullage manoeuvre worked, Flight,\u201D he called. \u201CUnstowing suction nozzle.\u201D He retrieved the hose and poked it cautiously towards the floating coolant. \u201CReady.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel flipped a switch. \u201CWaste valve A open,\u201D she reported.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher reached around the edge of the bulkhead, fingers probing for the waste disposal controls. The button slid into its housing with a firm clunk, followed by a whirr of fans starting up. The quivering mass of liquid trembled, stretched and ruptured into a shower of smaller globules which shot towards the makeshift suction nozzle. Most of them slipped neatly inside, others splashed off the surface, fracturing into yet smaller droplets. Wernher chased them down, gently squeezing the cardboard cone to keep it open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last rainbow droplet disappeared up the hose. Wernher waited for thirty seconds before switching off the fans. Instantly, Sherfel toggled both switches on her console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWaste valve A closed.

Good work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the couches, Wernher was busy replacing the access panel and reconnecting the suction hose.

Jim, pull your head out of that checklist for a moment and look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames looked up irritably. Then he caught a glimpse of blue out of the corner of his eye, and snapped his head round reflexively. His frown softened. \u00A0\u201CDoesn\u2019t look like much from out here, does it?\u201D he said wonderingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLonely, and terribly, terribly fragile,\u201D agreed Sherfel.

The landscape was brutally sharp, with no atmosphere to wear down the mountains, blunt the crater rims, or shroud them both behind a blurred veil of gases.\u00A0Suddenly, a glimmer of azure light broke the unrelenting grey horizon. A small blue-green marble climbed into the sky, a radiant jewel hanging in the infinite midnight.

Noses twitched around the room, as he carried it over to the flight director\u2019s console and set it down within easy reach.

Looking back on their journey, Wernher would remember their one meal break as \u2018the most surreal picnic of his life\u2019, bobbing against the capsule window, ration pack in one hand, staring out at the Munar surface. James would talk about the relief of completing every orbit with a systems check from Mission Control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel\u2019s lasting memory was of the far side. On one side of the M\u00FCn, three kerbals in their own tiny world. On the other, and hundreds of thousands of kilometres away, everything and everyone else that she\u2019d ever known.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all of them spoke of the engine. As Wernher would put it many years later. \u201CNone of us ever mentioned it on the flight. Me least of all - I mean, I designed the thing, and helped to build it. What could I say after that? Besides, there wasn\u2019t any point - if it fired, it fired. If it didn\u2019t, we had our backup options, and if they failed too, then that was it. I don\u2019t think that stopped us\u003Cem\u003E thinking\u003C/em\u003E about it though, and I know I was always pretty relieved to get a good telemetry check from Gene on each orbit. I guess I don\u2019t need to say that I was even more relieved when we didn\u2019t need the backup options on orbit six\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 6 - Launch Vehicle 1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames squeezed the last of the creva stew out of his ration pack and chewed it thoughtfully. He glanced at the comms panel, checking that the air to ground loop with Mission Control was switched off, then turned to face his crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWernher,\u201D he said at last. \u201CNow that we\u2019ve finally got some downtime, perhaps you could answer a question for me?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked at him quizzically. \u201CI can try,\u201D he replied. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTMI,\u201D said James slowly, \u201CI saw your face when Jeb came on-loop \u2014 it looked like you were expecting it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shrugged. \u201CI wasn\u2019t told either,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut Jeb\u2019s been working towards this flight since he was a student at the Institute. If he wasn\u2019t up here himself, not a single kerbal in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E would have begrudged him the flight director\u2019s seat, Gene least of all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel blinked. \u201CHow old is Jeb?\u201D she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe was nearly nine years out of the Institute when we launched Kerbal 1,\u201D Wernher said quietly, \u201Cand that wasn\u2019t yesterday.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first time that Wernher could remember, James looked genuinely impressed. \u201CThat\u2019s a long time,\u201D he said softly. \u201CAnd when his dream flight came up, he still didn\u2019t pull the boss slot.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Wernher. \u201CWe would have given it to him, but Jeb\u2019s always been scrupulous about fair crew selection. You wouldn\u2019t have guessed it from my tutorial group, but he\u2019s grown up to be one fine leader. I doubt anybody else could have kept us going long enough to see Kerbal 1 fly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou were Jeb\u2019s tutor?\u201D exclaimed Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. \u201CAnd supervisor for his final year project.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel caught the shift in his voice. \u201CSounds like there\u2019s a story there,\u201D she said, checking the flight clock. \u201CAnd we\u2019ve got a couple of hours before the next systems check. I could use something to pass the time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe canteen doors swung shut. Wernher looked curiously at Jeb Kerman, sitting alone at a nearby table, prodding an unappetising mush of tubers, beans and greens around his plate. He walked over and sat down by the younger kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMind if I join you, Jeb?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb laughed hollowly, \u201CSure. There might even be some stew left if you\u2019re unlucky.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u2019s face fell as he took in the empty canteen. \u201COh well, \u201C he said, \u201CLooks like sandwiches again. Anyhow \u2013 what\u2019s up, Jeb? Not like you to be sitting here on your own.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked moodily at his tutor. \u201CFinal year project.\u201D he said briefly, \u201CStill can\u2019t think of anything to do.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought you were helping Bill with his stability augmentation system?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, I thought about that,\u201D said Jeb, \u201Cbut I want to build something, Wernher. Not a mockup for a wind tunnel, not a chunk of circuitry to plug into a test sim \u2013 I want to take something outside and see it fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhh,\u201D said Wernher carefully, \u201CI think I see the problem.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pushed his plate away. \u201CYeah. I don\u2019t think a hobby shop plane is really going to cut it.\u201D What about you Wernher? How are the jet intakes working?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher glanced around. \u201CVariable geometry pre-cooling intakes,\u201D he said absently, \u201CTheory looks sound, if I can build a light enough heat exchanger.\u201D He looked at Jeb. \u201CI\u2019ve been working on a side project though\u2026\u201D He got to his feet. \u00A0\u201CC\u2019mon. I think you need to see this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two kerbals crossed the main quadrangle of the Kerbin Aeronautical Research Institute and headed for the large blocky building of the Jet Propulsion Department. As they walked, Jeb tried to keep up with Wernher\u2019s muttered monologue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo anyway, I figured that if you can\u2019t get enough air through the intake at that altitude, then why not store it onboard. Or if not air, then something that would do the same job. Then I realised that you could power the whole aircraft like that \u2013 and with a much simpler engine. Just a pair of turbopumps, a combustion chamber and a nozzle really, although getting the details right was tricky. I thought about solids for a bit but they\u2019re not very controllable.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb choked. \u201CYou seriously thought about propelling an aircraft with fireworks?\u201D he spluttered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked around frantically. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EShhhhh\u003C/em\u003E,\u201D he whispered, \u201CYes, fireworks basically, but a bit more refined.\u201D He pulled a key out of his pocket and unlocked a side door to the JPD. They hurried down the corridor to Wernher\u2019s workshop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s all this whispering and secrecy for?\u201D asked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gave him a sidelong look. \u201CWell partly it\u2019s because I\u2019m not really ready to show this to anyone yet,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut also, I\u2019ve ummm borrowed one or two things from the lab to build the D1.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CD1?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDemo 1\u201D said Wernher, stuffing equipment into two large bags. Jeb spotted a pair of gas cylinders and what looked like a tripod stand. \u201CNot a very original name I admit, but nice and anonymous. OK, that\u2019s everything \u2013 let\u2019s go!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb wiped the sweat from his forehead. The Institute buildings were safely out of sight, hidden by the hillside and a small copse of trees. The ground underfoot was hard packed and rocky and Wernher was having trouble setting up his tripod.\u00A0\u201COoof, OK that\u2019s far enough. Test rig next.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked at the spindly contraption. \u201CHold on.\u201D he said slowly. \u201CIsn\u2019t that\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBorrowed!\u201D said Wernher, \u201Cand I haven\u2019t done anything to it. Well, nothing that I can\u2019t undo anyway. Right \u2013 propellant tanks next.\u201D He hung the gas cylinders on the makeshift test stand. Jeb raised his eyebrows as he recognised the name of a well known brand of camping gas stencilled on the side of one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStove gas?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, yes, stove gas and nitrous oxide. OK, propellant lines are secure, just need to plug in the control box\u2026\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb eyed the finished article skeptically. The D1 seemed to consist of an oddly shaped nozzle attached to a metal ball which was studded with bits and pieces of equipment. Two thin hoses connected the ball to the gas cylinders, and the whole unlikely contrivance hung from the tripod on a rather expensive set of strain gauges. Cables trailed from various points into the control box in Wernher\u2019s hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you sure about this, Wernher?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPerfectly sure. Here we go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth kerbals retreated to a discreet distance. Jeb glanced around for the nearest rock to hide behind as Wernher started mumbling to himself. \u00A0\u201CValves open\u2026.gas generator on\u2026\u201D\u00A0A small flame appeared at the tip of a tube.\u00A0\u201CPumps spinning up\u2026 and ignition!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb heard a sharp metallic clicking from the depths of Wernher\u2019s contraption, jumping backwards as a gust of flame shot out of the nozzle with a whump of exploding gas. With a steadily building roar, the gust quickly focused into a bright blue flame. He laughed.\u00A0\u201CIt even sounds like a camping stove, Wernher.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u2019s only response was to point at the strain gauge readout. Jeb leaned forward. \u201CHey\u2026 not bad.\u201D Then a thought struck him. \u201CYou designed this for high altitude flight right? How high is high exactly?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shrugged. \u201CWhatever you like, provided there\u2019s still enough air for the wings.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about a vacuum?\u201D Jeb raised his hand. \u201CYeah, yeah, can\u2019t fly in a vacuum I know \u2013 but the engine should still work right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGet the nozzle right and it would probably work \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E in a vacuum,\u201D said Wernher slowly. \u201Cbut why a\u2026 oh you can\u2019t be serious, Jeb?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201COh yes I can, Wernher. I think we need to give your camping stove a new name and I\u2019m thinking that LV-1 has a nice ring to it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLV-1?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLaunch Vehicle One, Wernher. Launch. Vehicle. One!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher unclipped his water bottle and took a long drink. \u201CAnd that\u2019s how it all started,\u201D he said. \u201CBy the time Jeb finished his final year project, he\u2019d already founded the Kerbin Interplanetary Society and started work on a new LV-2 engine. He even put together a relatively conservative research proposal - complete with a raft of anticipated benefits for other Institute research programs - for a sounding rocket based on it. Unfortunately, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E also had a tendency to be\u2026 vocal about critics of our spaceflight ambitions, which the Institute rather took exception to. Eventually of course, we were kicked out for wasting Institute time and resources on \u201Covergrown toys and ridiculous flights of fancy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut you kept going?\u201D said Sherfel quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe did,\u201D said Wernher. \u201CWe pooled all our money to start up the junkyard business, partly to fund our experiments, and partly to get hold of some parts and raw materials.\u201D He grinned. \u201CGeneney had the bright idea of bidding on the Institute\u2019s recycling contract. I\u2019m sure at least one of the senior professors was highly amused to see us reduced to hauling Institute scrap, but most of our best early stock - including our first pressure suits - was basically recovered from Institute dumpsters.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames shook his head. \u201CAnd you managed to build a crewed sub-orbital spacecraft out of it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt took a lot longer than we expected,\u201D said Wernher ruefully. \u201CNot surprising really, given what we had to work with. But we made it. Kerbal 1 was a success, Bill had the presence of mind to take his camera, and the rest you know about.\u201D He rolled his shoulders. \u201CAnyway, enough storytelling - we should probably check in with Mission Control.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re flying straight through the window, Pioneer. Good luck.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Flight. Hope the service module is flying through a different one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s confirmed, Pioneer. No need to check your mirrors.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E sped towards Kerbin. Shorn of the Kerbin departure stage which had launched it towards the M\u00FCn and the service module which had launched it home, kerbalkind\u2019s first ever M\u00FCn ship was reduced to its barest essence - a small conical capsule and its three crew. Inside, Wernher stared back at the thin sliver of M\u00FCn still visible through the rendezvous window, the steadily increasing glow from Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere making it harder and harder to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOdd colour though, I expected it to be bluer somehow.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel\u2019s urgent voice broke into his thoughts. \u201CJim - we\u2019re getting plasma!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlready?\u201D James looked up from his instruments. \u201CKerm! Hang on to your seats - this could get rough!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe glow intensified. A faint, high pitched scream at the edge of hearing scraped across Wernher\u2019s nerves. \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E plunged onwards, carving a luminous tunnel through the first wispy traces of Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule creaked and rattled, the contents of various storage lockers shifting under the building g-forces. Outside, the glowing plasma started to take on a yellowy orange tint. Wernher grunted at the unaccustomed pressure pressing him into his couch. \u003Cem\u003EOof - only point two gee. Remember the centrifuge, Wernher - remember the centrifuge!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter nearly a week in serene silence, the roar of capsule slamming into atmosphere was painfully loud. Wernher narrowed his eyes and focused on his breathing, shock-heated air casting a ruddy orange glare over the capsule interior. The capsule itself twisted and turned in a precise, computer controlled ballet, lifting slightly to ease the forces crushing the kerbonauts into their couches, then dipping back into the rapidly thickening air. Flames shot past the window, riven with incandescent flakes and chunks of burning heat shield. James glanced at them uneasily, cold sweat pooling under his arms. The capsule shook, blurring his view of the instrument panel, and the angry hiss of static filled his ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reentry fires began to recede, fading to a dull orange, shot through with occasional bursts of flame. Wernher watched the altimeter unwinding at tremendous speed as \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E plummeted through the sky. The static in his ears began to fade, replaced by James\u2019s voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Pioneer 1. Come in, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Pioneer 1. Come in, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u2019s headphones crackled, broken snatches of words chasing their way through the static, accompanied by what sounded like distant cheering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Pioneer 1. Come in, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 1, Flight! We\u2019re reading you loud and we\u2019re reading you clear!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe read you too, Flight. Standing by for drogues.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a loud crack, the altimeter slowed its frantic spinning, the capsule twisting slowly from side to side. Then a heavy thump signalled the release of the main chutes. Pioneer 1 jerked and swayed, slowing to a graceful descent as the parachutes unfurled.

The wonderful thing about playing KSP though is that I could read the flight journal and actually have this mental picture of what was going on and what all the various burns were doing. Likewise there\u0027s a bit of the next chapter where I used KSP as a research\u00A0tool - the procedure described was (fortunately) never carried out during Apollo,\u00A0although it was planned for and I found a reference to those plans. However, I obviously didn\u0027t have a detailed primary reference to refer to,\u00A0so II cobbled together a quick spacecraft in KSP, sent it out to the Mun and spent some time playing with maneuver nodes till I had an idea of what burns would be needed and how they would affect the spacecraft attitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole \u0022Pioneer 1, your trajectory and guidance are Go\u0022 line is lifted wholesale from the \u003Cem\u003EApollo 8\u003C/em\u003E flight journal and\u00A0it\u0027s still one of my favourite lines.
