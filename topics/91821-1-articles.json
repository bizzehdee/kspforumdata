I was pretty damn sure it was staying perfectly vertical, so I had no idea why this was happening. You can see this pretty easily if you build a small, very stable rocket and throttle the engine just enough to float a few meters in the air for a few seconds. If you touch back down gently, you\u0027ll be slightly off the center of the launchpad. I realized this direction is always West, and I think I know why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin\u0027s atmosphere applies drag to spaceships, slowing down their speed. Vertically this works fine, but I think what happens horizontally is that as the planet spins to the East, the atmosphere stays still on top of it. When your ship lifts off the ground, it had rotational momentum equal to Kerbin\u0027s and is \u0022thrown\u0022 to the East along with the planet. But since the atmosphere is not turning, drag tries to \u0022slow you down\u0022 relative to the atmosphere, and you drift slightly West compared to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality I\u0027m pretty sure this doesn\u0027t happen, but I could be wrong. Kerbin is much smaller than Earth, and spins much faster, so it just might be more noticeable. But I think that the atmosphere turns with the Earth, so if you jump up in the air, it doesn\u0027t pull you back to the West since you\u0027re not moving horizontally relative to the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis effect is much more noticeable when you just launch a rocket into space directly up. You\u0027ll notice that you get a parabolic flight path even though you went straight up, since again the atmosphere is dragging you horizontally. This might be slightly more realistic since I think higher up the atmosphere doesn\u0027t spin as fast as the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be wrong about all this though, if anyone knows more physics than I do please share. If I am right though I think they should fix this, at least for the case where you\u0027re only a few meters off the ground, since it\u0027s also pretty annoying that craft hovering off the ground will drift horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T16:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe planet is turning under you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T16:41:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe planet is turning under you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I think you both have this wrong. Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is turning at the same speed as Kerbin\u0027s surface, so it\u0027s drag is 0 at (and near 0 close to) the surface and wouldn\u0027t pull you west. Consequently, the planet wouldn\u0027t turn under you, as you\u0027d also be moving at very nearly the same speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis effect is to do with the direction of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry leaving a plane at the end of the runway with the brakes off, and you\u0027ll notice it starts to roll towards the other end (note this is the opposite direction to what you described - we\u0027ll come to that). Why is it doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is, gravity is pulling the plane forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost people think of gravity as linear (straight down), but really it\u0027s spherical - gravity always pulls to the middle of the sphere. On a big enough sphere, like Earth, it\u0027s easy to think of the surface being flat and gravity being perpendicular to/through it, but on Kerbin, a much smaller sphere, weird things become more noticeable - partly cos the effect of things like friction are much smaller relative to the force and direction of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsequently, on a surface that is perfectly flat, like the KSC, gravity will attract a free-rolling object towards the part of the surface that is closest to where it\u0027s force is perpendicular - the part of the flat surface that is closest to the centre of Kerbin. In other words, from the perspective of the force of gravity, the whole KSC is bowl-shaped and curves to a point near the middle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why would gravity pull a rocket from the launchpad west, but a plane on the runway east? Because this \u0027low point\u0027 is somewhere between the two. If you look at the KSC from overhead, you find that the middle of KSC does in fact lie between those two points - exactly as you would expect it to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, why would KSC be perfectly flat when the surface of Kerbin isn\u0027t? Basically, because KSC is a 3d model made in a modelling program that works with perfectly flat surfaces, that\u0027s just been stuck to the side of a far, far bigger model that much more nearly approximates a real sphere. Also, Kerbin\u0027s gravity is actually a separate mathematically functional sphere from Kerbin\u0027s surface, which will be even closer to a real sphere than the surface (as is the case with Earth\u0027s gravitational field).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what\u0027s the story with the rocket? Well, turns out your rocket isn\u0027t quite pointing perfectly straight up on the launchpad, because the launchpad doesn\u0027t point perfectly straight up. So, if u keep your inclination exactly what it was when you launched, you\u0027re just holding yourself at a tiny fraction of an angle off vertical. Consequently, \u0027down\u0027 is actually slightly \u0027west\u0027 of where you think it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T16:54:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T16:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that effect exists as well The_Rocketeer, though that pulls you East down to the center of the runway, the effect seen by sonaxaton moves the craft \u003Cem\u003EWest\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T16:46:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceJuice","CreatedById":129597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T16:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhats the \u0022delta phisics time on\u0022 and what computer are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T16:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah that effect exists as well The_Rocketeer, though that pulls you East down to the center of the runway, the effect seen by sonaxaton moves the craft \u003Cem\u003EWest\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep.
