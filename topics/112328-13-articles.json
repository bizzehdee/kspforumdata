Have you had any luck removing mods?\n\u003E \n\nYes, I am absolutely certain of this.  The TAC Monitoring window acted according to how it should, as shown in those pictures you showed.\n\nI have been trying numerous combinations of mods as you are asking me to, and this is what led to my previous post.  After much experimentation I ultimately got around to uninstalling DOE and Cryo Engines, and it worked that one time.  Then I try having only one installed, to narrow it down to either, that is to say a DOE-only removal, and then a CryoEngine-only removal, and we\u0027re back to not working in both instances.  And then, I try the configuration that worked that one time again, and this second time around, it doesnt work anymore.\n\nIf TAC wasnt removing kerbals from the roster, wouldn\u0027t food/water/oxygen be consumed while frozen?  The problem is that the food/water stays at the same value as it is at time of freezing, but the moment they are thawed out, those two resources get used up, to make up for the lost time.  This does not occur with oxygen, it is preserved as it should be.\n\nHeres a series of screenshots demonstrating both of these things.  The missing context menu options can also be seen.\n\n![QuZwNDI.png](http://i.imgur.com/QuZwNDI.png)\n\n![8w2drVr.png](http://i.imgur.com/8w2drVr.png)\n\n![qhlnETH.png](http://i.imgur.com/qhlnETH.png)\n\n![ciCL84D.png](http://i.imgur.com/ciCL84D.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T10:10:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by IonMage**\n  \nAdded pictures"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T10:54:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, IonMage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I am absolutely certain of this.

This does not occur with oxygen, it is preserved as it should be.\n\u003E \n\nYes I understood what you are describing to me. but a few things don\u0027t make sense...  \n\n1) In your log that you posted there are no log messages removing the frozen kerbals from TAC\u0027s roster, so I cannot explain this at all. I can explain how they disappear from the TAC window, this is because they aren\u0027t actually in the vessel, DeepFreeze removes them. But TAC remembers them in it\u0027s internal roster. So when they re-appear in the vessel again it calculates all the consumed resources and deducts them from the vessel.  \n\nMy fix code changes TAC to detect when a kerbal is frozen and removes them from the TAC roster. When they are thawed again it re-adds them as they appear back in the vessel but it has no record of them. So then it does not back-calculate resources. But this is NOT happening in your install or we would see the log message \u0022Deleting Frozen crew member: xxxxx xxxxx\u0022  \n\n2) I believe the non-consumption of oxygen is a known issue with TAC that I have read about before, so I don\u0027t think it is related at all. (could be wrong, but I do recall reading something about this before, just can\u0027t find it now).  \n\n3) There is no obvious log messages indicating any error as to why the context menu is missing as well. Although, there are a lot of other errors in your log.   \n\n4) The removal of two mods, then it works, then adding them back one at a time and removing them again, and it still doesn\u0027t work. That is an inconsistency that to me means there is something else causing havoc in your install.  \n\n5) If this was a bug in DeepFreeze and/or my TAC fix then others would have the same issue, and I would be able to easily reproduce the problem (which no matter how hard I try I cannot).\n\nI would recommend a clean install of KSP and install DeepFreeze and TAC and their dependencies (no other mods) and see if it works. If it does, that would indicate it\u0027s another mod causing the issue. Which one, that\u0027s a process of elimination.   \n\nAs I cannot reproduce this issue and unless others come forward with the same issue I have to conclude this is not a DeepFreeze / TAC issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T10:56:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 10:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"IonMage","CreatedById":2132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T11:58:03Z","Content":"Alright, thanks anyways for spending time on this.
