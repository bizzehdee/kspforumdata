I\u0027ve been playing for 15 days now between other things in life, and I have to say KSP is awesome! What a great community. The reddit guys are fun to chat with too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most difficult thing I\u0027ve done so far is send Jeb to Duna and back safely. I even got it in the first try, which is more than I can say about his first mission to Mun. I actually had to send a rescue mission to go get him after practicing a few more times with Bill or Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as mods go, I tried FAR and I\u0027m sold. The difference is 100% better as far as aerodynamics goes. I also use Procedural Fairings and Engineering Redux. Once you know how to do dV calculations the first time, you\u0027re golden. I\u0027m a firm believer in learning how to do it once and then scripting a program to help you out from there on. That\u0027s we I do it in real life. I\u0027m not going to use Mechjeb however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture for fun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NeZSrCl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NeZSrCl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a probe to burn into Eve for science in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T18:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Basketcase. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Welcome to the forum, and congrats on your Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T19:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your playing KSP it can\u0027t hurt to be an aircraft engineer.

I\u0027m an AMT by trade, so I\u0027m sure you and I can agree that there are tons of things to love about this game, and a few aerodynamic/flight characteristics that are just a little frustrating. :-P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, welcome aboard and enjoy your time here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ryan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T01:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!
