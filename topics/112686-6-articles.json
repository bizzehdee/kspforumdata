(this is what infernal robotics does, so I\u0027ve read). Also, this would affect every scene where parts are loaded. So, we\u0027re talking about a very advanced plugin. It would be different if we weren\u0027t affecting every other part in the stack. It would be best if squad were to complete ModuleJointMotor because this would be akin to writing the wheel module from scratch. It would affect to many other parts. To put it plainly this would be like creating an entirely separate mod.
