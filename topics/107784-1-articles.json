Once you get used to it you will find yourself cruising back and forth to Duna without really thinking about it. \n\nYour life will be a lot easier if before you send your manned mission you land a rover and then drive to a nice flat spot and use the rover as a landing target. Duna has a lot of hills and you can lose a perfectly good mission to a slope. \n\nAlso think about sending a backup unmanned ship into Duna orbit first, something with lots of fuel that can bring your kerbals back if your manned mission runs out of fuel. \n\nRight now for my first 1.02 Duna mission I am building an automated fuel depot on Ike in preparation and then going to send a self fueling DAV (duna ascent vehicle) to my landing site so even if my manned lander breaks the kerbals will have a way home.\n\nRemember, going to another planet isn\u0027t any harder than going to the Mun, you just need more fuel, and take the time to set up your Duna orbit several months before you get there when its cheap and you can fine tune it with RCS. If you just drop into its sphere of influence without looking you can use up all your fuel just trying to get into a decent orbit.\n\nIt took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out that my focusing the view on your destination planet you could do this."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:11:30Z","Content":"Awesome, good idea with the rover, but I\u0027m a whiner about sending kerbals anywhere without knowing what I\u0027m doing, even though I\u0027m playing Sandbox with reverting saves and quickloading XD\n\nWhat\u0027s the best way to get my periapsis down for aerobraking and where should my Periapsis be for a balance between aerobraking and reentering?

The biggest tip is to be patient setting up your maneuver node. You may have to play around with it for a while, and the adjustments can be very sensitive. Use the mouse wheel slowly while mousing over the direction to make fine adjustments.\n\nSet up a maneuver node using the delta-v required in the transfer planner, and you can slide it around Kerbin\u0027s orbit to get the ejection angle just right. (It should be exactly along the dashed purple future orbit line for your craft.)\n\nOnce that\u0027s done, focus on Duna in map mode and turn the camera so you can see the maneuver node in the background. You can now look at the Duna orbit trajectory closely and fine tune it with the maneuver node.\n\nBe prepared to make one or more small adjustment burns. As long as you get a good encounter, you can usually wait until you enter Duna\u0027s SOI before you set up a maneuver node to fine tune your periapsis.\n\nGood luck and happy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:21:32Z","Content":"Ok, I\u0027m getting towards Duna, but I need to figure out how low to set my Pe without burning up.

You will have to play around. I would shoot for 30 KM for my first test. \n\nAnd don\u0027t forget to reduce your parachute pressure to the minimum. On Duna depending on your altitude you can crash into the ground before your parachute even opens. For this reason low altitude landing sites are usually easier. \n\nAnd get 1.02 before you get too far, it has several aspects that are radically different (and improved) from 1.00."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:26:24Z","Content":"Lesson learned, 23km Pe didn\u0027t do crap.

Like I said, I haven\u0027t been there since .90\n\nWish I could go to Duna for the first time again. It was pretty exciting.

No way I could get a big enough ship into orbit so I built and refueled one with SIX docking missions, but I was able to send a science lab and two landers with that mission and return samples from both Duna and Ike.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T01:32:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aerindel**"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:30:44Z","Content":"Aaand, 10km is too low.

At the end I figured out that I could go to ike too for some science. The mission was a success and it ended by deorbiting probe to duna to gather some science from low altitudes before it crashed and for that I had to use big transmitter to be able in time to transfer all data back. I suggest that you send a probe that would look as close as possible to the manned Lander that you would send later one.
