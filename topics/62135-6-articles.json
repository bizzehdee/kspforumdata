Because it has been touted as being MJ compatible as a release goal until now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it burned too much fuel in the atmosphere, there\u0027s a variety of settings that can cause that. (Mine certainly is not doing so.) MJ misbehavior can be as much if not more due to poor understanding of the settings as to any error on the part of MJ itself. (MJ is not entirely the \u0027easy button\u0027 it\u0027s often believed to be, but also a tool that you have to learn how to use.) If you need help in working out how MJ works (as you said it\u0027s your first experience with it), I can help or you can ask in the MJ thread for testers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s still pitch excursions when flying manually w/ SAS enabled, just not as bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sage Sagan","CreatedById":102159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T00:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tada\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tada\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAm I the first one with this idea or anyone else wants 3D printed model of this cute little orbiter?
