I know you say you have no control but you should have enough that early for a slight turn of say 3-5 degrees. I have launched similar rockets, without clipping the motors, with no control surfaces, no gimballed engine and only SAS for guidance. Really need to watch your speed, try turning early but not too much, then just let it go and handle itself until it clears the lower atmosphere. Took me rather a few tries to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat payload looks like there are 4 winglets on it clipped in, i think they create some drag and drag on the top isn\u0027t too good to have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022micr0wave\u0022 data-cite=\u0022micr0wave\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat payload looks like there are 4 winglets on it clipped in, i think they create some drag and drag on the top isn\u0027t too good to have.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is almost certainly the first problem. Those fins create not only drag, but destabilizing lift forces. You need to either put them in a fairing or add fins to the bottom of the rocket. I would recommend at least as many fins on bottom as you have on top, and probably a few extra to be safe. Since you are using fins, you can also turn on the CoM and CoL indicators to help you out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems the winglet \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E the problem, thank you!
