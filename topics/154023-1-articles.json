However, one of those things I need to transfer is the entire Steam folder found in the user folder containing downloads, desktop, videos, documents, etc. Keep in mind that my KSP is modded with Kopericus and KittopiaTech. What I plan to do is cut and paste the whole Steam folder with everything inside it onto my 8-gig flash drive, then get all the data off the FD onto my new computer. Just a few questions - Is this even POSSIBLE? Also, would it screw up my saves or mods, and would I have to re-connect to my Steam account?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T06:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam itself probably wouldn\u0027t cope well with being copied from system to system.
