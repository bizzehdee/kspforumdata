Duna and Eve both have low-gravity moons that I can harvest for refuelling, but the amount of fuel I would get for ore in a lander means it could be easier to land the whole thing than carry ore up to the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy problem is, how to get a ship that size that can control decent-ascent vertically?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, my (untested) idea is to put the engines on a rotor and work it like a Harrier Jump Jet. I just don\u0027t know if I can still run them if they rotate. Do I need a fuel line somehow?

Ike is one of the smaller moons and while it has more gravity than Gilly, it\u2019s still not much. Put some landing legs on the back of your mothership, surrounding the engines but positioned so they deploy further and you don\u2019t bonk the engines on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, use some small vernier thrusters (e.g. Twitch) for the last stretch of landing if you want to do a belly landing design, the high gimbal will help to control a large vessel and you can tuck the mining gubbins inside a cargo bay. Upward-facing probe core recommended to make landings easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-20T09:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224134938\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653013940\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200752\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stephensmat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, stephensmat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just don\u0027t know if I can still run them if they rotate.
