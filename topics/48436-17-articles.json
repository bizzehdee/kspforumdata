A 3-4 ton tank part using Fuel and Ox can be cut to .9 tons with LH2 and LOX. Which means that to equal the weight of the old configuration, you need 4 times the tanks.

It lightens the load on the launch stage, but allows for greater ISP at your orbit eject stage giving you greater range, assuming you\u0027re going to use it early before the long term boil-off can take its toll. Essentially, use it as a mid stage for starting long missions, or the late stage for short missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T00:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELH2/LOX is very good for getting the most dV out of the mass of your upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that you\u0027re launching two versions of a two-stage rocket, one with RP-1/LOX fueling both stages, the other with a LH2/LOX upper stage. Assuming both upper stages are the same percentage fuel by mass, here\u0027s how things compare for the upper stage, depending on the engine you use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERP-1/LOX Isp: 320s - 380s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2/LOX Isp: 410s - 470s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ranges are based on whether you use a vacuum-optimized or a atm-optimized engine. For the atm-optimized engines, you gain 28% more dV by using LH2/LOX; for vacuum-optimized, you gain 23% more dV. If for some reason you need to use an atm-optimized LH2/LOX engine for your upper stage, but you can use a vacuum-optimized RP-1/LOX engine due to TWR requirements, you still gain 7.8% more dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative to increasing dV is that you can reduce the mass of the upper stage while maintaining the same dV. That might allow you to use a smaller, more efficient lower stage engine, boosting the dV of that stage. Or you could get rid of SRBs that you needed to get it going. Or you can split the difference and launch a slightly larger payload to orbit, taking advantage of the slightly lower mass of the upper stage to pile more on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using FAR there\u0027s the added benefit that LH2/LOX is less dense than most of the payloads you\u0027d be sending up, while RP-1/LOX is denser, which means that RP-1/LOX rockets will be less stable than LH2/LOX rockets. Ultimately, LH2/LOX is unwieldy, but it allows you to do more with less, which is quite dramatic when you consider that mass increases exponentially with increasing dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
