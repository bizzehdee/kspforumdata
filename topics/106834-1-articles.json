The last unstable orbit is at 3/2, the effective potential of a schwarzschild black hole has a cubic term which causes a large decrease in the potential as the black hole is approached. Going past this potential barrier it is not possible to continue to orbit, or escape without applying a force as the energy barrier to escape is larger than the energy of the particle after crossing the potential barrier.\n\nLook up the effective potential for a schwarzschild black hole and it is very easy to understand why that is not possible.
