Ever since, my primary goal while playing KSP has been to develop fully re-useable interplanetary ships to which various payloads can be docked for transportation. It\u0027s been a huge project because each time I have to design the ship in the VAB, break it down into components small enough to be launched, assemble them in orbit, and only then can I try to fly the thing to another planet to see if it works. Most of the time it doesn\u0027t, and I have to start over all the way from the beginning. However, after 6 months, I am closing in on my goal of having a fleet of designs that can access all the worlds in the game, and then come home to be refueled and sent out again. Here, for anyone who might be interested, is a brief history of my project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first ship was a test and proof of concept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TAyr90P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TAyr90P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cringe looking back on it. It had WAY too many parts because I threw in everything I thought a ship might need, and the proportion of fuel to payload was laughably small. It flew a successful test mission to deliver some probes to Minmus and back, and was then retired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second design actually reached Duna while carrying a considerable payload, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6risX6F.png\u0022 alt=\u00226risX6F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut didn\u0027t have anywhere near enough fuel for a return trip. Besides, it also had too many non-essential parts, and swayed around like it was dancing the hula when under thrust. The crew had to be rescued by a later mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third ship delivered a cargo to Eve, and was my first ship to return to Kerbin (from another planet) after performing its mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SaOPzck.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SaOPzck.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the flight revealed numerous flaws in the design, so I relucantly scapped the ship despite its successful first trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy fourth ship delivered 8 probes and a lander to the Jool system, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0zyDren.png\u0022 alt=\u00220zyDren.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut once more didn\u0027t have enough fuel for a return. That crew is currently awaiting rescue on Bop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, success! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sUtb3xD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sUtb3xD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy fifth ship made it to Duna and back, then Eve, then Dres, and then Duna twice more, and is still in use. It is my first truly successful, entirely re-useable interplanetary ship. I plan to build more of them, in improved versions, for use at those three worlds. However, it does not have the range to reach farther planets, so I continued with my project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy sixth design was especially frustrating. After spending many hours making the thing in the VAB and assembling it in orbit, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CJWrUfc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CJWrUfc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe workaround I thought had found to have more than one secure docking link to the same parts didn\u0027t work, and the fuel tanks flopped around and couldn\u0027t get fuel to the engines anyway. That one was a total write-off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy seventh design actually made it to Vall and back while delivering cargo, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D3WB7xv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D3WB7xv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut I was disappointed to learn, it was too big for the job. It came back with excess fuel, meaning it could be smaller and still make the trip to the Jool system. But the real problem was, the part count just about put my PC into a coma, and flying it to Vall was a terrible chore because the lag was so bad that the game was running at 1/4th real time. Sadly, even though this ship worked in the sense that it performed the mission, I had to retire the design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, I\u0027m pleased to be able to report that my 8th ship \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kIhtZMV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kIhtZMV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehas delivered cargo to Tylo and returned, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ttJLcBn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ttJLcBn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand Eeloo and back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8mBhpAH.png\u0022 alt=\u00228mBhpAH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Okay, that last one was actually my 9th ship after my 8th ship suffered a mishap.

Which was really dumb, because I forgot that you should always launch the most awkward ship segment first and then dock the easier-to-fly segments to it while it sits still. So when I launched the replacement engine segment, it had teething problems because this is still a new design I\u0027m perfecting, it flipped around wildly, and by the time I got it flying straight again and went to map view, I found it was on a 45 degree inclined orbit. In short, I realized it would be easier to build a whole new ship starting with the improved engine section than to try to rendezvous and dock a new engine section to the existing ship. So much for making the 8th ship better. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAre there any .craft download links? \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EI do plan to share the designs eventually, but I don\u0027t like to post anything until I\u0027m sure it will be smooth for other players to use, and right now I\u0027m just trying to get the things to work, and not even trying to make them easy to fly. The bridge section of that last ship, for example, is a real kludge. It takes off on Mainsails to get its bulk off the ground, but they waste a lot of fuel so on the way up I pump the fuel into the ship segment itself and ejected the big engines, then it flies most of the way to the other parts of the ship for assembly, then it ejects the engine on the rear to free up the docking ring and flies backward to the dock with a tiny engine just temporarily stuck on the nose. The really successful ship that\u0027s made several trips, the fifth one, also needs to be reworked to use the new, big docking rings, which will reduce its part count significantly. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve aerobraked wherever I can, at Eve, Duna, and Kerbin, and Jool\u0027s atmosphere was a big help in reaching Vall and Tylo.

That\u0027s really all a large interplanetary ship needs anyway. The sheer mass of the thing helps it resist rotations, engine gimballing holds it on course during acceleration, and there are no forces to induce rotations while you\u0027re in free fall. In fact, I leave SAS mode off at all times to avoid shivering, and only turn it on to hold attitude during burns. The position of the ASAS part within the ship doesn\u0027t matter, so I put it as far as I can toward the front of the ship so that less force is put upon it during accelerations, because they can be kind of fragile.
