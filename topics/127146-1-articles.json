It\u0027s always the exhaust, it gets clogged up with dust and detritus and then I have to open the sucker up, unscrew the metal top on the fan, and clean off the fan blades and the heat pipe radiator.

Before the right side cut out completely (dropped from 6 feet onto hard floor), I was keeping the right speaker of my headphones going by bending the wire to where it would sound and I superglued it to the side. But I hope you took a wire brush and/or sandpaper to your copper plates. And for goodness sakes, next time you do this don\u0027t use a little pair of wire cutters to cut your copper, Go down to your local hardware store, get a nice pair of channel lock dikes and a bottle of 3 in 1 oil. Use the dikes to cut your copper and keep all the metal surfaces oiled (you might as well stay stupid if you oil the rubber grips). Don\u0027t be stupid and try to cut bolts or heavy wire with it, if you take care of a pair of channellock dikes (or any channelock tool really) you\u0027ll give them to your grandkids. You could use cooking oil but I like the 3 in 1. Cooking oil\u0027s too heavy for my taste, I don\u0027t feel confident that the oil\u0027s everywhere in the cracks where I can\u0027t slather the oil on with my fingers. Whatever you do, make sure the oil\u0027s light, don\u0027t use motor oil or any slow moving oil. If you don\u0027t keep it oiled, it\u0027ll rust and your tool will be close to junk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T23:27:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T01:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe laptop is back together and operating.\u00A0 After 20 minutes of idle the heatsink fan RPM did not increase.\u00A0 I loaded up and played a video and after 1/2 hour the fan RPM increased slightly.\u00A0 The video is 1 1/2 hours and at the end of it the fan RPM has increased slightly.\u00A0 The temperature around the heatsink is 31 degrees Celsius in a room temperature of 26 degrees Celsius.\u00A0 The fan RPM has never peaked.\u00A0 Now I will let it cool and then recycle.\u00A0 Then it might be go time for a more intense burn and load up KSP and craft some insane part count vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@Flymetothemun The initial cutting I used pipe cutter and then yellow handle aviation snips and for the 0.60 mm and 0.25 mm I used heavy scissors.\u00A0 The red electrical snips I used to tap into the heatsink fan and powered it with a five volt USB charger.\u00A0 I wanted to run tests on the heat pipes to ensure they did not go sour and were able to draw the heat.\u00A0 I used my fingers and after running the fan I could feel them cooling.\u00A0 Also used a heat gun and increased the temperature of the copper pad to 80 degrees Celsius and measured how quickly the temperature dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of sanding did cross my mind but the hammered copper was remarkably smooth.\u00A0 There is copper foil available for multi layer PCB fabrication and is available in a variety of thickness and I might order some.\u00A0 The copper foil compared to the PCTI pad does have the advantage that it would not dry up and much better thermal conductivity.\u00A0 The only disadvantage is now it is susceptible to impacts.\u00A0 The PCTI pads would offer some cushioning if the laptop is dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also am slightly worried about the different thermal co-efficient of expansion.\u00A0 The copper was fabricated thinner than what was measured to allow for expansion.\u00A0 When the thermals are maxed the expansion rates for the CPU wafers and copper are different and might fracture the wafers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomorrow I will play some KSP using the laptop and will post the results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI butchered the keyboard ribbon connector pressure retainer and will need to order another unless someone can suggest a fix.\u00A0 I use a USB keyboard anyhow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zm5S91V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zm5S91V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-07T04:18:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2015 04:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T05:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222311495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127146\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449453396\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112247\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MoeslyArmlis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, MoeslyArmlis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nkeyboard ribbon connector pressure retainer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost folks would likely jump to tell you \u0027superglue / crazyglue\u0027, but it tends not to work well with those plastics.

handle aviation snips and for the 0.60 mm and 0.25 mm I used heavy scissors.\u00A0 The red electrical snips I used to tap into the heatsink fan and powered it with a five volt USB charger.\u00A0 I wanted to run tests on the heat pipes to ensure they did not go sour and were able to draw the heat.\u00A0 I used my fingers and after running the fan I could feel them cooling.\u00A0 Also used a heat gun and increased the temperature of the copper pad to 80 degrees Celsius and measured how quickly the temperature dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of sanding did cross my mind but the hammered copper was remarkably smooth.\u00A0 There is copper foil available for multi layer PCB fabrication and is available in a variety of thickness and I might order some.\u00A0 The copper foil compared to the PCTI pad does have the advantage that it would not dry up and much better thermal conductivity.\u00A0 The only disadvantage is now it is susceptible to impacts.\u00A0 The PCTI pads would offer some cushioning if the laptop is dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also am slightly worried about the different thermal co-efficient of expansion.\u00A0 The copper was fabricated thinner than what was measured to allow for expansion.\u00A0 When the thermals are maxed the expansion rates for the CPU wafers and copper are different and might fracture the wafers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomorrow I will play some KSP using the laptop and will post the
