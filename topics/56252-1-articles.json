But you will need to fine-tune it. try making a chamber big enough to house the satellite, with about 20 or so landing legs on the front to open and close it and keep the satellite steady once you have it. You may also need vectoring engines and reaction wheels for the deorbit burn in case the satellite is A symmetrical. There are other methods that you can use, but they may be slightly harder.
