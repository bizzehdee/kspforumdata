Nothing loads, and that\u0027s all that happens. On a side note, when I go to the pause menu I can\u0027t press revert flight either, just like any ship you fly that has been reloaded, where \u0022revert flight\u0022 is not an option. So basically, I can\u0027t play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when I go on steam and delete local content then re-install the game, KSP still doesn\u0027t work, probably due to the fact that steam does not actually delete the game, it just makes it unplayable, so when you re-install it everything is still saved as before, including mods. The problem there is that I also don\u0027t even have mods installed, however I used to have a small number of basic mods installed, such as chatterer and trajectories mod, but even after un-installing those, the game was still broken. I think I remember having this issue before and I solved it, but the exact same issue is recurring and I am at a complete loss as to why this is happening and how I can fix it. Can somebody fill me in here and/or have a solution to this unidentified issue? I appreciate any feedback!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T22:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re going to need to see your log files.
