If Squad wants to add core features to a released product then they must force themselves to iron out the balance prior to release. Stock KSP already saddles users with too many balance decisions (science/heating/rewardsx3). The result is, more often than not, an unbalanced mess. One should not have to grind through career mode a half-dozen times before finding all the sweet spots. That job belongs to the developers. The game needs to be fun out of the box, all the way to the endgame content.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is exactly why I in general oppose all attempts to add \u0022realism\u0022 features to the stock game. Keep the stock game like it was pre-1.x and focus on fixing its innumerable bugs, glitches, imbalances, lack of coherence, and such. Leave realism features to the modders, who do a better job with them because they don\u0027t have to pull their punches and can get focused feedback directly from users. Most realism mods have been in development for years already so are much more mature than anything Squad whips up in a couple of months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, 1.0 made both reentry heating and \u0022realistic\u0022 aerodynamics stock. Yet DRE and FAR are still on the market and scads of people use them. Why? Because they do a better job than the stock systems. IOW, the people who whined the loudest about making these features stock don\u0027t even use the stock system but are still using the same mods as before, and the people who didn\u0027t want these features in stock got stuck with half-baked, bug-ridden systems anyway. And these bugs affect even those who use the mods. So nobody is happy with the result, meaning making these features stock was counterproductive to Squad because it irritated the entire customer base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027d like to see things optional.

People throw around \u0022tedious\u0022 as if realism would require every single man-minute of work be modeled. In fact, we need only concern ourselves with what KSP bothers to model at all, and within that, what fidelity is possible. To the extent there is any correlation at all, I\u0027d not be surprised if more realism within what stock KSP does would be easier, not harder. At 1:1 scale (set kerbin to some reasonable size for a small, earth like planet). All the parts are scaled in lockstep, so similar looking craft behave the same. The atmosphere would scale less, since stock is too deep anyway. Distances are a non-issue because of time warp, the only change is launch/reentry given limited time warp under acceleration. Docking is easier in many ways since you\u0027ll have more daylight if you plan properly. \u003Cp\u003EPlanets could have some bigger, some the current size to make various difficulties. Minmus stays small, the Mun gets scaled up to the point that 1-stage vs 2-stage landers both have rationales. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d argue that most of the difficulty in stock KSP is added in after the fact because of the tiny scale used, yet trying to make it \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E realistic.

I do think that many of the problems come from the fact that the rockets have to be nerfed (mainly by making them small and way too heavy) in order to make staging even the least bit necessary, plus re-entry heating has to be artificially induced because re-entry is happening at 1/4 of the real speeds. Those both lead to problems for the whole rest of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think that ship has long sailed.

My biggest beef with RT is it\u0027s built on premises that are so unlike the real world. Only one ground station and doing everything by satellites, really? Sputnik was launched and tracked just fine around the world and it certainly didn\u0027t have a huge comsat network to support it! And the ground station having far inferior performance than the portable dishes, seriously? Remote Tech has been designed to force the player into a certain approach, it\u0027s not about \u0022realism\u0022 in the slightest, and that certain approach of setting up a Kerbin comsat network just becomes gruntwork after a few saves. I feel, then, that Squad\u0027s system should be built on \u003Cstrong\u003Esound premises\u003C/strong\u003E. That includes the assumed presence of a Deep Space Network meaning connections only need to be to \u0022anywhere on Kerbin\u0022 (or set multiple specific ground stations if you really want), and the ground-based antennae being the best performing. Relay satellites will still be useful to connect to the far side of other planets and moons, or to boost the signal of a craft with a weak antenna. It\u0027s also good to avoid encouraging \u0022grunt work\u0022 and to give the player multiple viable options, we have enough gruntwork in early career/science mode as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second problem with Remote Tech is the flight computer is sorely lacking. No editing an action already set, no RCS translation, no obvious indication you have additional delay enabled, I could go on. Now I\u0027m unsure whether signal delay should be added in stock because it really makes probes in KSP an entirely new game, it turns it from being about flying to being about computer programming, and I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the direction KSP should take. But if Squad do feel that\u0027s worth adding, I would want to see \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E better probe programming tools than what RT offers. And using a more normal syntax than the weird thing kOS has too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the ideas. As for the implementation, well that\u0027s where I\u0027m sceptical. Squad have a poor recent record of implementing their new ideas. The aerodynamics does seem basically bug-free but it received two game balance patches after 1.0 that messed with people\u0027s designs. The heating on the other hand is riddled with serious bugs. So even though it\u0027s a different programmer (Roverdude) working on the antenna stuff I\u0027m not confident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I\u0027ll be more positive and suggest something I think would be really nice: Realistic(ish) calculation of communication ranges instead of hard-coded figures. Give each antenna a transmit power and a gain, assume sensible values for bandwidth and noise floor, and it\u0027s fairly easy to calculate data rate over the link. Then impose a minimum data rate for various tasks. This would add complexity but I think make for some nice aspects. For example a Mun lander with a low-gain antenna might be able to communicate back to the big dishes on Kerbin because those dishes have lots of power and gain, but not be able to communicate with a closer satellite with another low-gain antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbow-Dashie","CreatedById":76160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T14:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this idea, and can\u0027t wait to see it in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, with the new aero model, and now this...

Not a perfect simulation, but a rather good one that teaches something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace teaches us that time matters, and that simultaneity is a complex problem. More realistic communications would be nice indeed.

I\u0027ve tried Remote Tech somewhat briefly and rather disliked it. So I feel Squad and Roverdude\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eideas\u003C/em\u003E are pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I dislike Remote Tech relates to what I would like to see and not see in stock. My biggest beef with RT is it\u0027s built on premises that are so unlike the real world. Only one ground station and doing everything by satellites, really? Sputnik was launched and tracked just fine around the world and it certainly didn\u0027t have a huge comsat network to support it! And the ground station having far inferior performance than the portable dishes, seriously? Remote Tech has been designed to force the player into a certain approach, it\u0027s not about \u0022realism\u0022 in the slightest, and that certain approach of setting up a Kerbin comsat network just becomes gruntwork after a few saves. I feel, then, that Squad\u0027s system should be built on \u003Cstrong\u003Esound premises\u003C/strong\u003E. That includes the assumed presence of a Deep Space Network meaning connections only need to be to \u0022anywhere on Kerbin\u0022 (or set multiple specific ground stations if you really want), and the ground-based antennae being the best performing. Relay satellites will still be useful to connect to the far side of other planets and moons, or to boost the signal of a craft with a weak antenna. It\u0027s also good to avoid encouraging \u0022grunt work\u0022 and to give the player multiple viable options, we have enough gruntwork in early career/science mode as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, stock will assume a planet wide DSN with an expanding range based on your Tracking Center upgrade level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second problem with Remote Tech is the flight computer is sorely lacking. No editing an action already set, no RCS translation, no obvious indication you have additional delay enabled, I could go on. Now I\u0027m unsure whether signal delay should be added in stock because it really makes probes in KSP an entirely new game, it turns it from being about flying to being about computer programming, and I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the direction KSP should take. But if Squad do feel that\u0027s worth adding, I would want to see \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E better probe programming tools than what RT offers.

That being said, we\u0027re exploring some interesting options from a gameplay standpoint that put you (roughly) in the same place, but will not require a flight computer UI (the latter being a massive can of worms). I expect signal delay and flight computers will remain a mod thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the ideas. As for the implementation, well that\u0027s where I\u0027m sceptical. Squad have a poor recent record of implementing their new ideas. The aerodynamics does seem basically bug-free but it received two game balance patches after 1.0 that messed with people\u0027s designs. The heating on the other hand is riddled with serious bugs. So even though it\u0027s a different programmer (Roverdude) working on the antenna stuff I\u0027m not confident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I did do resources and that turned out reasonably well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Also I\u0027d say this system is significantly simpler than something as far reaching and complex as thermal and aero.

Give each antenna a transmit power and a gain, assume sensible values for bandwidth and noise floor, and it\u0027s fairly easy to calculate data rate over the link. Then impose a minimum data rate for various tasks. This would add complexity but I think make for some nice aspects. For example a Mun lander with a low-gain antenna might be able to communicate back to the big dishes on Kerbin because those dishes have lots of power and gain, but not be able to communicate with a closer satellite with another low-gain antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume what you\u0027re covering there is something more akin to the additive range feature in the existing antenna mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T15:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds pretty good, but I\u0027m not that much into launching probes for making interplanetary communication networks.
