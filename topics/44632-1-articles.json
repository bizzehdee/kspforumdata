For an unstable rocket like that, it is best to forget everything the forums have taught us in pitching over early to improve efficiency; take it veeerrrrryyyyy slowly. I don\u0027t even begin to turn until after 15 km, and often still lose control. I find that placing RCS thrusters on the topmost section of your rocket is useful as it gives you that extra little bit of control needed to prevent the rocket from flipping upside-down. Placing larger-than-normal control surfaces on the bottom of the rocket is handy as well. Lastly, (I don\u0027t know how well this would apply to you) making a two-stage lifter will help greatly in launching, as a small second stage with a high-gimbal engine is a massive blessing when in the 20-30 km range. Above 35 km, the air becomes thinner and it is the capsule torque and engine gimbal that matter more for control.
