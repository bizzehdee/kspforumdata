A tip for ya, (regarding the first photo) if you want the transition between the capsule docking port to the LES to be a little smoother, you can ditch the decoupler.\n\nYou can set the ABORT action group (for example) to simultaneously \u0022Activate Engine\u0022 on the LES and \u0022Decouple\u0022 on the Rockomax decoupler that mates the capsule to the service module. This will activate the LES correctly in an ABORT situation. Then set another action group to \u0022Activate Engine\u0022 on the LES and \u0022Decouple\u0022 on the docking port to jettison the LES if not needed after making orbit. Lastly, you can use the offset tool to drag the LES base down slightly to cover the docking port ring, until the base is flush with the base of the docking port. The LES still jettisons with no problem, causing no damage to the docking port.\n\nIn this photo you can see the LES base just about to cover the yellow/black stripes of the docking port, but not quite. (The protrusion is a Mk16-XL parachute)\n\n![LES%20Mounting_zpsws5nzu3c.jpg](http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q737/raptor_9000/Placeholder%20Photos/LES%20Mounting_zpsws5nzu3c.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T17:09:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor9**"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:38:16Z","Content":"I just went for simplicity on the LES, it\u0027s just a habit I\u0027ve retained from back when there were no LES systems and you had to build them yourself\n\nThanks though"}]}
