{"TopicId":113694,"ForumId":34,"TopicTitle":"[KSP 1.11.1][2021/03/01] Ventral Drill for Stock ISRU","CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:56:55Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:56:55Z","Content":"I think the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E system is missing a critical part: The ventral (in-line) drill. This simple mod fixes that. It adds a ventral drill that in all other ways (Tech tree node, mass, usefulness) is the same as the stock radial drills.\n\n![Ventral_Drill_for_Stock_ISRU-1583308400.](https://spacedock.info/content/HMV_4317/Ventral_Drill_for_Stock_ISRU/Ventral_Drill_for_Stock_ISRU-1583308400.6996522.jpg)\n\n**Jeb Tested. Bill Approved!**\n\n**I did not make the model.** That credit goes to Nertea. It\u0027s the same model as the ventral drill from [Karbonite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401-), with a new name and stats so it can work on stock ore without having to install Karbonite. You should be able to install this along with Karbonite but there is no reason to.\n\n**I did not create the stats**. All I did was copy the stats from the stock radial drills (for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff) and the Karbonite drill (so it mounted and functioned correctly).\n\nSo in short, this is not my work. This is a simple retooling of two things to make a new thing.\n\n**DOWNLOAD**\n\n[Spacedock](https://spacedock.info/mod/1328)\n\n**DEPENDENCIES**\n\n[ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-M). You probably have it already. **NOTE: ModuleManager is a new dependency as of 1.9.1**\n\n**INSTALL**\n\nThe Zip file has a folder in it named VentralDrill, just put that folder into your GameData folder.\n\nIf you need to, also install [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-M) as per their instructions.\n\nYou should, on the next start of KSP, see a Ventral Drill in the same tech tree node as the stock radial drill and/or in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ready to use.\n\nIt should work in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E as well.
