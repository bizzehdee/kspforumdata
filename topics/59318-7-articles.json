They all worked perfectly) and how it is relatively safe, we don\u0027t absolutely need it, if at all. All of those nuclear materials could be used to build NERVAs, which would have an infinitely easier time being internationally approved for exemption from the International Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, since they prove to have much lower potential risk (a Nuclear reactor launched to space sounds and is potentially less risky then propelling a storehouse of nuclear weapons to space by blowing up nuclear weapons underneath it). Also, NERVAs would integrate much more easily into existing hardware and infrastructure. While both propulsion systems have similar problems (release of nuclear materials into the environment), the NERVA would have a much smaller impact if it where to fail (beat up nuke reactor on the seabed vs a stack of several hundred to several thousand nuclear bombs going off all at once).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T16:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt actually woudl be hilarious if north korea, not giving **** about nuclear testing ban started developing oron drive and become major space power \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell someone shoudl make sf book or comic about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T18:05:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECheap access to space is never going to happen in the next 20 or 30 years anyway.

You wont change me of that opinion. Ok detonating millions kilotons in weapons tests without any attempt to evaluate its impact or reduce it was bad, and would hate to go back to the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s were you could detonate 60 megaton monsters at will.
