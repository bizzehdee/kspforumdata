Gamma rods are metallic and have properties on par with steel including it\u0027s melting point with one very important exception.... they can totally absorb gamma radiation without heating or compressing... at least up to a point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamma rods can absorb a maximum of gamma radiation that equals their mass... if it\u0027s mass was converted TOTALLY into energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to pump more gamma rays into it from that point would result in an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of the rod... as it releases ALL of it\u0027s stored gamma ray energy at once with a boom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPropellant: Any that will readily absorb gamma rays as heat so it can be used for propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamma rod usage: Gamma rays can be induced to shoot out either end preferred as a graser (gamma laser beam). This is how gamma rays are extracted from the rod that stores them. It does not take much energy to extract gamma lasers from the rod... anymore than it does turn the spigot on jug laden with water for it to pour out. Unlike normal lasers gamma rods produce zero waste heat on itself compared to how much they put out. A user literally extracts the gamma energy level they type in based on however much energy is stored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would have the choice of extracting all the gamma ray energy from a rod in one mighty zap, or gradually over a constant use or gradually in pulses or a mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHazards: Since other than their special gamma absorption and graser use gamma rods have the properties of steel... they can melt just like steel. If a gamma rod is melted while possessing stored gamma rays it will explode... even if only partially melted. Releasing all it\u0027s stored gamma rays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Would this scifi tech be energetic enough to pull off heavy scifi SSTOs via thermal rocketry (100 ton at least)? I think so... since rods can hold their mass in gamma rays or less. So all you need is enough gamma rod mass with enough absorbed gamma and you are good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What propellant is best for absorbing gamma radiation for thermal rocketry?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. What is the optimal way of of getting the graser into the reaction chamber to mix with propellant?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. QUESTION EDITED OUT as I just realized the rod can be can induced to produce a gamma ray beam without a lens. It does not need a lens... especially since at higher power levels the laser would destroy it anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy conclusions: With enough engines (a lot) I reckon one could \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with it.
