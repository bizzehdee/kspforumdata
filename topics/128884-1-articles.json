Ive read the step by step mining guide, and searched the internet to find out how they work, I can get the Convert O Trons to convert ore into\u00A0LF/Ox,\u00A0but I cant get either ISRU Refineries to work. Here is a picture of my setup \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/meMf8Hy.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/meMf8Hy.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy goal is to extract water and turn it into lq hydrogen, so I have a ISRU Refinery with an empty fuel tank attached, a reactor with thermoelectric generators,\u00A0and lots of battery power. When I left click and hit extract water button it says, Status; Offline, Water Extraction; active, and 00-40 MW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the MW the problem? if so how do I produce MW? I thought having a reactor with generators made mw. I have Interstellar, KAS, and Machjeb mods installed. Any help would be very appreciated, thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T16:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re not running stock.\u00A0 What mod is that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps you could ask your question in the forum thread for whatever mod you\u0027re running?\u00A0 (Your modded ISRU doesn\u0027t look anything like stock; not only does the stock ISRU work with different resources, but it also doesn\u0027t have a \u0022Status: Offline\u0022 or any \u0022MW\u0022 line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions that are specific to a particular mod are usually best asked in the thread for the mod.\u00A0 That\u0027s not to say that mod-related threads are completely out-of-bounds in this forum, but at the very least it would be a good idea to make it clear in the thread title that it\u0027s a mod issue (i.e. \u0022Can\u0027t make ISRU work in \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-30T16:06:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T16:23:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like KSPI to me, but I haven\u0027t used it since ~0.25.
