I remember upgrading from XP to 7, and from Windows Vista to 7, and both times my games started right up. Some of the oldest ones required compatability mode to be checked in the properties window, but that was for like 2D games, so I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027d have to do that for KSP.\n\nIt may take awhile for graphics drivers to be as good as they are on windows 7 though. I know it usually takes them a couple revisions to get it right."},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T06:17:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m running it just fine on Windows 10 build 10130."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T07:13:09Z","Content":"It should work just fine, Windows 10 is essentially Windows 8 with a better GUI."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T11:34:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It should work just fine, Windows 10 is essentially Windows 8 with a better GUI.\n\nNo more so than Windows 8 was Windows 7 with a (different) GUI. Actually, probably less, now that MS has actually updated the internal numbering system again and \u0022Windows 10\u0022 is looking like it will actually be version 10.0 (Vista was 6.0, 7 was 6.1, 8 was 6.2, 8.1 was 6.3 and earlier versions of 10 reported 6.4).\n\nIn fact, that change of major version number from 5 to 6 in the XP-\u003EVista jump was one of the prime reasons for that OSs compatability issues - a very large number of apps out there just freaked out when they saw a version number that *wasn\u0027t* 5. We might be in for a similar round of issues with Win10 now that it\u0027s happening again. Doubtless there are plenty of developers out there who haven\u0027t learned.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m running it just fine on Windows 10 build 10130.\n\nWhat\u0027s that report as internally? I think 9xxx builds were still showing as 6.4 in system properties. If that version\u0027s showing 10.0 and running KSP fine, I\u0027d be confident in saying \u0022I\u0027ll be fine\u0022. I\u0027d be pretty confident of that *anyway,* but that\u0027d make me more so ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:51:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It should work just fine, Windows 10 is essentially Windows 8 with a better GUI.\n\nWindows 10 is Vista with a worse GUI\n\n/keeping 7\n\nedit: ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T01:58:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s that report as internally?
