I remember upgrading from XP to 7, and from Windows Vista to 7, and both times my games started right up. Some of the oldest ones required compatability mode to be checked in the properties window, but that was for like 2D games, so I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027d have to do that for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may take awhile for graphics drivers to be as good as they are on windows 7 though.

Actually, probably less, now that MS has actually updated the internal numbering system again and \u0022Windows 10\u0022 is looking like it will actually be version 10.0 (Vista was 6.0, 7 was 6.1, 8 was 6.2, 8.1 was 6.3 and earlier versions of 10 reported 6.4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, that change of major version number from 5 to 6 in the XP-\u0026gt;Vista jump was one of the prime reasons for that OSs compatability issues - a very large number of apps out there just freaked out when they saw a version number that \u003Cem\u003Ewasn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E 5. We might be in for a similar round of issues with Win10 now that it\u0027s happening again.
