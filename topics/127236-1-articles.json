I started with a capture around Tylo, then with the help of both Jool and Laythe, I will arrive back at Tylo again, nice and slow\u00A0at apoapsis, which is where I wanted to start anyway, for around 115 dv. Not too bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aerobreaking thing at 8000 ms is ridiculous. It is in no way feasible unless everything is well behind a heat shield and also inside a cargo bay, which pretty much rules out any large craft with multiple components. Even then, you would gain nothing because even fully shielded, you can\u0027t survive an atmosphere thick enough to slow you down.

Is that broken, or realistic in some way? Shouldn\u0027t the change in velocity be directly related to the increase in temperature? It is friction after all that slows you down at the same time it generates heat. Do we have a math guy around here to figure this out for us?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: For example, while I was at about 193km altitude on Jool, my whole craft was glowing bright red, and my apoapsis didn\u0027t change at all.

Friction creates heat, but also there is heat transfer between the gas and the surface of the craft. Once that craft gets hotter than the air, it should be losing some heat too as new cold air is coming in contact with the ship. Perhaps this factor is missing from the calculations. So a high velocity, low drag situation wouldn\u0027t just add heat as it currently does, but would be counter acted somewhat by the cooling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut reentry heat has nothing to do with friction.

The question is not how cold the surrounding air is, but what actually happens at the surface of your craft. The air 1m away from your craft might be like minus 150\u00B0C, but your craft squeezes the air in front of it so much that when the air molecules finally hit the surface of your craft, they are compressed so insanely high that the whole front (!) is covered in hot ionized gas. No cooling at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a significant heat decay when the air flows around your craft and it\u0027s pressure drops instantly, creating a zone where excess heat may or may not be taken away. However, since the pressure of the \u0022rear end\u0022 gas is so low again, it hasn\u0027t any significance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fly sitting on an iron girder makes it bend.

There\u0027s almost nothing for your craft to compress against. In any case, as your craft presses against the gas, the gas is also pressing against the craft. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This model seems to defy the conservation of energy. Setting up a high\u00A0orbit around Jool with a periapsis of 190k would give you a massive\u00A0source of power that would last millions of years. 2000k of heat can be useful if you\u0027re prepared to harness it!\u00A0It sure seems wrong though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
