The funny thing is that they didn\u0027t even get close to the Mun, and my overly ambitious group of three Kerbals (Captained by Mitmal) was stuck in an interplanetary escape orbit, with no fuel, no RCS, no batteries, and no power. I almost terminated the mission, but then decided to just let it roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 1 Kerbin year and many successful Mun missions later, the space program was doing much better, and finally decided to rescue poor Mitmal and his crew.

Maybe I could have waited a few years for things to align again, but instead I decided to try to gravity boost off of Eve. Realized too late that I didn\u0027t have enough fuel for THAT, but was already headed toward Eve. I adjusted to an aerobraking altitude of 72km, and made 3 aerobraking passes to get into a stable orbit at 1,000km x 120km. The \u0022rescue\u0022 was a partial success - I had brought Mitmal and crew out of their tumbling coffin of death, and into a functioning spaceship. It only had 900 d/v, not enough to get home, but still enough to move around a bit. It also has power, some extra crew space, solar panels, and a proper docking system. So still stranded, but like, less stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I built the second recovery ship - an unmanned recovery tug, powered by two nuclear engines, and with 9000 d/v available from LKO. It even has fore and aft docking clamps, docking assist lights, spare monopropellant to refill the payload vessel, and cool spiderweb struts. Finally got it into orbit, and got it into Eve orbit. Burned way more d/v than I had expected in order to plane match, but finally made connection to the original rescue ship, docked it, and started hauling home. After a few 20 min burns I was back in a Kerbin transfer orbit. Directed into a 42km aerobraking orbit, and made 4 aerobraking passes to slow the ship down. Disconnected, leaving the tug in orbit for later (with 800 d/v to spare), and dropped in for smooth landing next to KSC.
