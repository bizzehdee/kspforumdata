Mass\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust united scale needed. Idea to keep real density (then the scale is 3.9^3=60) is not so good. Because 60 ton scale seems relatively normal only for the largest launch vehicles, but the payload capacity to LEO even of the heaviest rockets ever built has never exceeded 150 tons. And for the orbital crafts 5 or 10 ton scale could be the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Thrust\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should keep the original TWR, because there is the same g value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Burn time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket designed to deliver its payload to low orbit shouldn\\\u0027t fly out of the star system. Needs some calibration, but could be around 3.5 times. So the fuel capacity and consumption should be scaled according to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapacity/fuel mass ratio should be different for each fuel type (based on ISP), consumption then scaled according the engine\\\u0027s parameters. What numbers can you propose? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5.
