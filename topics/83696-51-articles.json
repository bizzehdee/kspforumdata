I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s representative of other people\u0027s though. I\u0027ve experienced the crash multiple times due to the reflective parts and I\u0027ve never had a vessel corrupted. I just quit the game and commented out the part giving me heartburn. From the forums, I know other people had a similar experience. While shaw works on a fix for TR, the current solution is to rename the TR reflection patch like you did or comment out the problematic parts in the TR MM patch. In my experience those were the gigantor solar panels and the MK1-2 pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not sure how deleting all your vessels is a solution. Why bother keeping the save if all your vessels in flight are removed? Why not start over fresh? Now if you are talking about your crafts, you can just delete them from the ships folder in the save. But, I think it is unlikely that the TR patch corrupted any crafts in your ships folder because neither TR nor KSP work that way. If you are having problems with crafts you probably deleted parts that were in those crafts. That\u0027s a no go and will always cause problems if you try and load a craft that is missing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"troyfawkes","CreatedById":109437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T02:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tarheel1999\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tarheel1999\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, I\u0027m not sure how deleting all your vessels is a solution.
