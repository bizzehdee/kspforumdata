It is meant to be used to dock with the Orion space station. After some failures, the Griffin left the launchpad. It\u0027s crew was Jeb, Bill, and Deswig (I think). They got into an orbit similar to the Orion\u0027s, but weren\u0027t close enough to them. After many maneuvers, it turned out the Griffin wouldn\u0027t be able to dock without risky fuel use. They were de-orbited, and returned safely to Kerbin. Now, some pictures of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img703/3553/screenshot55h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot55h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5893/screenshot65x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot65x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/769/screenshot67p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot67p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
