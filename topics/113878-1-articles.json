View full album](//imgur.com/a/5myev)\n\nI am attempting to use the unmanned ship as a powered fuel tank meaning as both ships engines fire the manned ship expends no fuel but it is not working like this. It is similar to asparagus staging but instead of this the manned ship separates with almost no fuel left. Can anyone help me get the fuel lines to work properly?\n\nDownload link for the craft: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k03x5pntmnv5p0b/Shuttle%20II%203_4.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k03x5pntmnv5p0b/Shuttle%20II%203_4.craft?dl=0)\n\nThanks for the help"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:06:01Z","Content":"Hi, there was an issue in the fuel lines.

There is a thread from Kasuha in the tutorials section explaining them in great detail, it goes over several pages and a good 20 posts just for the basics.\n\nBut what I think that bites you: much like a router, the game counts how many \u0022hops\u0022 there are between a fuel source and the engine. Everytime you go through a fuel line is a hop; every time you go from one tank to the next is a hop. The most distant tanks are emptied first.\n\nFrom the look of it, many of the tanks on your main vessel are as far or further away from the engine as the some of the detachable tanks. \u0022Far away\u0022 in terms of how many connections there are, not in meters. Therefore the engine will start tapping the main tanks before the detachable ones are fully drained."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:34:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But what I think that bites you: much like a router, the game counts how many \u0022hops\u0022 there are between a fuel source and the engine.

Fuel lines are scanned first when looking for fuel sources and if the fuel lines provide fuel then the other connection methods are not followed.\n\nLike you said, it\u0027s complicated... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:38:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi, there was an issue in the fuel lines.

If you have a closer look that fuel line goes into the \u0022Twitch\u0022 and not to the bottom Oscar-b, that\u0027s why the tank is drained. You will need to move that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T20:56:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:51:34Z","Content":"Thanks for all of the help but unfortunately when I tried to alter that fuel line I just made things worse.
