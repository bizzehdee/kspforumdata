Only issue is then its actually a little bit too stable, meaning it has some issues burning off speed during reentry, but it is able to pull it off eventually if I pull up for the entirety of reentry; only downside to that is pinpointing KSC is a bit harder. Today I\u0026#39;m experimenting to see if air brakes at the very tail of the craft right next to the Tail Fin might help with this a bit, I\u0026#39;m hoping that their additional pull upwards in tandem with their straight speed bleed will be enough for the job.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T18:09:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KarateF22\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
