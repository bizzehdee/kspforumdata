I\u0027ll try to explain from memory what I did. It helps to have two windows in blender, one in 3d view, and the other in node editor view. In the 3d view, switch to texture or matieral view mode (Alt-Z will do fine). Right click on the flag until it is selected. Click on the material tab on the right, if there is a button that says \u0022use nodes\u0022 click that, though I think it\u0027s already using nodes. If there are already three nodes there you will just need to click on the file folder button, and change the image that is listed to the one you want for your flag. I just navigated to my Gamedata folder where I have my flag saved. Then your flag should render not as a pink rectangle but as the flag you chose. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s a bad angle, and smaller render, but you can see I have my flags on this one.\n\n![munbase1.png](http://bowencustomcreations.com/kspPics/munbase1.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T15:14:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:30:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I saw this plane in Starwhip\u0027s thread [**here**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111633-Starwhip-s-Renderfarm-Taking-Requests%21) .
