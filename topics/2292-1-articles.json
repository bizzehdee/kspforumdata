In other words, we need turbofan engines with high bypass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the most economic wing for this is one with high aspect ratio, which produces high lift/drag ratio. Either swept or straight wing can work; Airliners use swept wings due to their operations near transsonic speeds (Mach 0.8-0.9); U-2 used long straight wing because it was designed to fly high at slower speed to improve photoreconnaissance quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first aircraft to fly around the world without re-fuelling or landing was the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutan_Voyager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERutan Model 76 Voyager\u003C/a\u003E which was superficially not similar at all to U-2 but it does share significant design principles - most important being high-performance, high aspect ratio wing.

As the plane accelerated, the tips of the wings, which were heavily loaded with fuel, were damaged as they scraped against the runway (the pilot wanted to gain enough speed that the inner wings would lift the plane, not the fragile outer wings - in 67 test flights, the plane had never been loaded to capacity before), ultimately causing pieces (winglets) to break off at both ends. The aircraft accelerated very slowly and needed approximately 14,200 feet (2.7 mi)(4.3 km) of the runway to gain enough speed to lift from the ground, the wings arching up dramatically just before take-off. During the flight, the two pilots had to deal with extremely cramped quarters. To reduce stress, the two had originally intended to fly the plane in three-hour shifts, but flight handling characteristics prevented routine changeovers and they became very fatigued.\u003Cp\u003EThe plane also continuously reminded the pilots of its pitch instability and fragility. They had to maneuver around bad weather numerous times, most perilously around the 600-mile-wide (1,000 km) Typhoon Marge. Libya denied access to the country\u0027s airspace, forcing precious fuel to be used. As they neared California to land, a fuel pump failed and had to be replaced with its twin pumping fuel from the other side of the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other aircraft that has flown around the world is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Atlantic_GlobalFlyer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGlobal Flyer\u003C/a\u003E, also designed by Burt Rutan, and flown by the late Steve Fossett.
