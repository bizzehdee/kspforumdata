They are explained in KSPedia. They are unusual features on the surfaces of all the CBs. Crystals, trees, special craters, mineral veins, etc. You need to drive up really close to one of these things and then activate the scanning arm. It counts as a new kind of science\u00A0experiment. They are intended to be used with rovers. It\u0027s highly unlikely that you could park a simple lander close enough to a ROC to get a reading from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-05T02:20:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2019 02:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-05T02:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to be nearby one of the new objects on the surface.\u00A0 The Mun is now covered with rocks and little craters.\u00A0 You need to get close to one of those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Not my pic)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022N13R3LM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.78\u0022 height=\u0022571\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/N13R3LM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-07T17:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few considerations using scanning arms:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-They tend to fail a lot. On activation it will often say that colided with something and the process stops. After a lot of trial and error the best solution I came with is to attach the arm to an hydraulic expanding cylinder to separate the scanner from the rest of the vessel (or rover, most likely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-They are fragile.
