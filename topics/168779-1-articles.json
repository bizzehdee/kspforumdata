From the data I can find, the Falcon 9 second stage should have an initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of close to 1.0, which should be plenty to circularize on any reasonable ascent trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn more general terms: there are several possibilities. First, the Falcon 9 in particular uses a fairly steep ascent, something that should give the second stage plenty of time to circularize while \u0022borrowing\u0022 upwards momentum from the first stage; it should also be well out of the thick atmosphere, meaning minimal drag losses and effectively vacuum engine performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be the case; you\u0027re staging into the second stage at a much lower altitude than what the real Falcon 9 does.
