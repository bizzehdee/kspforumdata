That means that flying higher will generally produce less thrust. You can go faster to counteract that but you will eventually run out of air to shove through your engine. What you are actually banking on is the loss in drag resulting from lower airpressure. Unfortunately the same thing that decreases drag decreases engine thrust.\n\nthe normal jet engine is rated neither for high speeds or altitudes. On the other hand the ram air intake is rated for VERY high speeds. The result is that you are losing thrust from an inefficient inlet, and then you are losing more thrust from the wrong engine. Not all engines are made equal. Engines are optimized for a specific altitude and speed regime. deviating from that decreases performance. Your engine is good for mach 1.2 @ 6-8km IF it has adequate airflow. You have half the inlets and they are the wrong type. try 2 of the simple circular intakes instead and you should go much faster."},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:09:28Z","Content":"Well before 1.0.2, my simple little guy here could hit 350-ish, and break 500-550 if I dropped from high altitude.\n\n![O5GtbGq.png](http://i.imgur.com/O5GtbGq.png)\n\nNow it\u0027s basically trapped at 300 no matter what I do.\n\nAnd no, there is NO issue with the single air scoop whatsoever.

I like the new update simply because I can now design a plane or SSTO and understand how it will behave a slow and fast speeds and when it will likely have control issues. Since the release of 1.0 I am finding it more intuitive for me because it follows more realistic rules but I am also finding it more restrictive when it comes to asthetics. I have one plane I would really like to move the wings back on a little, just so it would look better to me. I probally can with some tweaking of the fuel in the tanks but decided to put plane/SSTO designs on hold until I am sure Squad will make no adjustments to the aero model. \n\nAs for your design options to be honest I have not seen much variation simply because this is not a game focusing on fantasy based designs. If everything you design can work it takes away one of the challenges of the game. If I can get a jet engine to put me on a suborbital trajectory you took away a lot of the challenge, if they model the aero to be more forgiving and allow designs like that x-wing to work you take away the challenge simply because it would allow everything to fly. \n\nI think you can adjust most of what you are complaining about by hitting f-12 and adjusting some sliders, I am sure I saw a slider to adjust drag and some other things not sure if it all adjusted something with the aero or not."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:32:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E if they model the aero to be more forgiving and allow designs like that x-wing to work you take away the challenge simply because it would allow everything to fly.\n\nWell, that\u0027s the thing.

Your idea of more intuitive craft design and my want for less wing unfriendlyness are not incompatible. In fact, if you want to build a large wing for a large spaceplane right now, the system is *very* unintuitive - somehow, building a large wing (out of smaller parts) results in unexpected and massive drag."},{"CreatedByName":"EnDSchultz","CreatedById":12337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:06:10Z","Content":"I suppose I\u0027m just bad with this.
