That means that flying higher will generally produce less thrust. You can go faster to counteract that but you will eventually run out of air to shove through your engine. What you are actually banking on is the loss in drag resulting from lower airpressure. Unfortunately the same thing that decreases drag decreases engine thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe normal jet engine is rated neither for high speeds or altitudes. On the other hand the ram air intake is rated for VERY high speeds. The result is that you are losing thrust from an inefficient inlet, and then you are losing more thrust from the wrong engine. Not all engines are made equal. Engines are optimized for a specific altitude and speed regime. deviating from that decreases performance. Your engine is good for mach 1.2 @ 6-8km IF it has adequate airflow. You have half the inlets and they are the wrong type. try 2 of the simple circular intakes instead and you should go much faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell before 1.0.2, my simple little guy here could hit 350-ish, and break 500-550 if I dropped from high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O5GtbGq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022O5GtbGq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s basically trapped at 300 no matter what I do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, there is NO issue with the single air scoop whatsoever.
