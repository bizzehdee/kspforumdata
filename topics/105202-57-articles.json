You need at least 5 in there to begin with so that your other Kerbals don\u0027t suffer from loneliness.  Adding a couple more for a rounded team of research personnel and construction/maintenance/hydroponics shouldn\u0027t be that painful..  Unless the idea is to make more disconnected bases which have smaller crew counts each to begin with I guess?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve explained this a few times already.  You do not have enough space for those Kerbals... not enough living space, and likely not enough workspace.  your loneliness penalty is nothing compared to the penalty of making them hot bunk.  Add more habs.  Has zero to do with disconnected bases and everything to do with making sure people have enough breathing room.  Side note - those habs and their space are based on data on minimum living space for prisoners (scaled to Kerbal size).  People need a surprising amount of space.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Fraz86 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Roverdude, I briefly experimented with 0.3.4 this morning and got some bizarre results with the HabMultiplier. I used a simple ModuleManager patch to give the Cupola a HabMultiplier of 2 for testing purposes. Subsequently, in the VAB, a lone Cupola with one Kerbal gave a habitation rating of 2y410d (1260d). I can\u0027t figure out how it arrived at 1260d from a total crew capacity of 1 and a HabMultiplier of 2, but that can\u0027t possibly be correct.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ll take a peek\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, apocriva said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It looks like I have a vessel which is being tracked in the Life Support Monitor, but no longer exists.

The single hab module is only enough space for 2 Kerbals. The solution would be to remove some kerbals or add more hab modules.\n\u003E \n\nBingo.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, lodestar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m having a hard time understanding how the Life Support/Recycler mechanics works. I have a base with 1x Pioneer, 1x Kerbitat, 1x Aeroponics, 4x MK-V Agro, 2x MK-V Hab, and at the moment only 2 kerbals. With everything turned off, they consume 32.4/day. If I start the Pioneer Life Support, it drops to 8.1/day, 75% as expected, but there\u0027s no cumulative effect. Even if I start Life Support in all modules, it stays on 8.1/day. What am I missing?\n\u003E \n\nRight, as noted, there is a cap.  Plus side is those do help out as your crew gets larger (beyond the capacity of the pioneer module)."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T01:58:17Z","Content":"Just curious, now that I am finally playing with the new updates, how does habitation work with inflatables?  I haven\u0027t quite been able to make heads or tails of it.\n\nFor example if I have a karibou rover with an inflatable emergency hab, inflating the Hab will increase my Kerbal\u0027s habitation timer.  But obviously I would want to deflate it in order to move.  Does the act of deflating etc incur any penalty?  Or say when deflated I would be beyond the normal habitation timer so deflating it temporarily would put the timer negative would I have immediate unhappy kerbals?
