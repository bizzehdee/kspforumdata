It\u0027s a higher energy orbit. But we can put things there that we\u0027re not comfortable with having in LEO. Like an asteroid, for example. Not to mention that it puts you on the fast-track to the Interplanetary Transport Network. Coming back from Mars, it would be far easier to brake into a highly elliptical orbit that then takes you to the gateway station than to brake into LEO, or, rather, we don\u0027t need as thick of an aero-shield. It also lets us do the trips in hops. For example, the delta-V to get to L-2, from LEO, is pretty big.

It\u0027s a tiny habitat with a service module. Possibly eventually an airlock. Besides, if you want to refuel we\u0027re taking fuel from Earth. If you want to build a fuel depot you want to store it were you\u0027ll use it, and we\u0027re going to use it in LEO.. not lunar orbit. Why haul fuel all the way out there?

It does nothing good to us, and the only thing we can do is exercise our muscles and try to block as much radiation as possible. We don\u0027t need a hundred years of research to figure that out, and robotic probes can easily measure any environmental data we need to build a craft to survive that environment. At that point you just need to build the craft and test it.. not build an entire facility to test various components of your craft for a decade. That\u0027s like building an aircraft carrier to test the flightworthiness of a jet built for the marines.

Efficiency is not their goal, safety and doing more space stuff is. The gateway would be a small time away from LEO, but after the magnetosphere, which is the most likely source of random problems they\u0027re going to run into.

Wouldn\u0027t it be better to send a transfer vehicle up to LEO (with an orion capsule, or take on up with crew as a second launch). It could spend awhile on a shakedown cruise in LEO with Earth mere minutes away if something goes wrong.
