Huh...\n\nWell, I was also looking at it for efficiency. One part instead of three, less dead weight (though you could argue a few hundred kilos isn\u0027t much compared to the rest of a craft that would be mounting multiple MK2-profile engines), length, fuel balancing (I have this very odd, bad habit of not liking it when I send anything up with less than the max fuel it can hold...), and I\u0027m pretty sure you could make something far nicer looking than a hacked-together job from existing parts.\n\nOh, BTW, the Mk2 shroud solar panels seem to be a bit quirky:\n\nThe animation is a bit off on retraction if it needs to rotate to line up. The folding animation can easily finish before the rotation alignment is done, so it just suddenly snaps into retracted state when it\u0027s folded all the way done. Not sure if you could do anything able it. It\u0027s just a quibble from me. I do wish there was more clearance so I could place them in the fuselage close to the wings.\n\nThe model itself has an inconsistency: One door is higher than the other when closed. Again, small thing. I only noticed because I was zoomed way in using the offset tool on something. As I was moving the camera around to get different views of the work I was doing, I clipped though the panel and noticed the asymmetry."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T22:41:56Z","Content":"The solar panel is one of the things that was/is getting reworked for the next update.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-17T22:48:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2016 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**"},{"CreatedByName":"Furious1964","CreatedById":113005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T17:18:08Z","Content":"For some strange reason, Module Manager would hang when trying to load the M2X Generator CP.
