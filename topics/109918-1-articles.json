I tried to use forcedirectx and my RAM usage was about 3.2 gigs; can anybody tell me if this is a real flag or not? I googled it but found nothing\n\n2) When exactly does the 32bit game crash? Is it when 3.9gigs of memory are used, 3.7gigs, 3.5gigs? Is it random?\n\n3) I used the aggressive version of \u0027Texture pack compressor\u0027 and saw almost no savings in memory. Is that normal at all? I installed it with CKAN, and the process seemed like it went through, with the initial long loading screen and everything, yet I observed almost no memory savings.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any info, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T06:50:26Z","Content":"it\u0027s -force-d3d11 if you want to use directx 11 that\u0027s why you didn\u0027t see any change there.\n\n32 bit crashes at about 3.4 GB. Really though at the menu you should be under 2.0 GB otherwise you\u0027re probably going to have a bad time. Game should be hovering around 2.4-2.8 GB during play, if it starts there and climbs out of that zone you\u0027re probably going to crash. Check your log for null reference errors.\n\nATM might be having some issues, you\u0027re better off making sure that all your textures that can be dds are. Also make sure if you\u0027re using texture replacer you\u0027re on the very newest version. EVE 7.4 may or may not be working right as well. Try removing that and see what happens. I had a lot of EVE related nullreference errors, removing it as much as it hurt to do so fixed my memory climbing problem.\n\nFinally, if you\u0027re really fighting for memory space you should try using textures at 1/2 in the options menu. Pretty much did what ATM did... kinda... not really. Not sure how big of an effect that has as the dds files should be loaded to our video cards not physical memory. In my experience though, this version seems to run about the same as .90 with dds textures and DDSLoader as far as memory use is concerned (other than the memory leaks that were plugged)."},{"CreatedByName":"Fraggle","CreatedById":143115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T07:03:18Z","Content":"use \u0022-force -d3d11\u0022 to Force it into DX11 (with the right drivers and shaders you can get way better visuals than DX9)\n\nLook up the KSP x64 Unity 4 hack to make the Unity 4 engine run in x64 mode and expand your available memory beyond the 4 Gig limit.\n\n\u0022warning\u0022 some Mods may not work with the x64 mode.\n\nSo far Iv found one.. the Achievement mod."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:46:21Z","Content":"Thanks for the help guys ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:54:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E use \u0022-force -d3d11\u0022 to Force it into DX11 (with the right drivers and shaders you can get way better visuals than DX9)\n\u003E Look up the KSP x64 Unity 4 hack to make the Unity 4 engine run in x64 mode and expand your available memory beyond the 4 Gig limit.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022warning\u0022 some Mods may not work with the x64 mode.\n\u003E \n\u003E So far Iv found one.. the Achievement mod.\n\nHow does forcing dx11 improve the game visuals?"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:02:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How does forcing dx11 improve the game visuals?\n\nI do not know, to be perfectly honest.
