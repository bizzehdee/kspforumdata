The contract system answers a problem with story campaigns: once they are over, that\u0027s it. Scripting limits some of the replay value. The contracts don\u0027t say too much about how you should do a particular thing, and are therefore pretty open ended. KSP as it is now, is more a series of puzzles and challenges; the player decides when they are done, not a scripted story campaign.
