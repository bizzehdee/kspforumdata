It roughly looks like all of the joints between pieces fail and everything but the probe body becomes debris.\n\nThis is repeatable after quickloads. However, exiting from the game and reloading from the quicksave usually works. This only happens during time warp. Interestingly, physical time acceleration works just fine.\n\nThe refuelling probe in question has a claw attached to it. Other vehicles which have undergone this dismantling have recently been touched by the claw. I am uncertain if this is related, though I\u0027ve seen other threads mentioning this.\n\nI\u0027m running KSP 1.0.2 unmodded on Linux x86\\_64\n\nIs this a known issue? Has anybody else seen this?\n\nIf not, I\u0027ll put together a full bug report including all of the requested information next time it occurs for me."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:12:52Z","Content":"Can you post the save please GarrettKajmowicz?"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrettKajmowicz","CreatedById":100570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T02:58:05Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a link to the quicksave. Some times the craft would fall apart during time acceleration. Sometimes not.
