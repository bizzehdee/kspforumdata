It roughly looks like all of the joints between pieces fail and everything but the probe body becomes debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is repeatable after quickloads. However, exiting from the game and reloading from the quicksave usually works. This only happens during time warp. Interestingly, physical time acceleration works just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe refuelling probe in question has a claw attached to it. Other vehicles which have undergone this dismantling have recently been touched by the claw.
