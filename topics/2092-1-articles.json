Idea is to make a bigger tank, but that will correspond to 3 regular tanks. Basically, I have make it 3x heavier, 3x more fuel and so on. I will make one 2x size, 4x size and 5x size. I wan\u0027t them to act same as equal number of regular tanks, so maybe in that way I will be able to remove some lag (less objects to deal with) when you build big ship, and still maintain same performance as regular parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have couple problems...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst one\u003C/strong\u003E is drag parameters... I can\u0027t set them to correct value to make my big tank (as 3 regular) to act in same way as 3 regular.

I can\u0027t set then in right values to make my tank act same as 3 regular. With bigger values (as are current) thruster with my tanks speeds up at start, and then starts to lag behind... With lower values and same values as regular tank, it lags at start, and then it speeds up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know how those parameters act when couple same parts are stack up? Does engine calculates less drag for lower parts, or they produce all same drag? If is first case (less for lower parts) then drag of my tank should not be 3x bigger, but less then that, but I can\u0027t figure out what value to put.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have attached my full config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ESOLVED THIS TWO (tnx to Andras and Capt\u0027n Skunky); I have used underscore in part name \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESecond problem,\u003C/strong\u003E is fact that this tank of mine doesn\u0027t load; if I build ship with it, save it and then load it again, my tank is replaced with regular tank (image in attachment). I have change name of my tank, make separate folder, named file with 3D model differently, but it still loads default tank.

I just unstickied that post. Forgot to do that when the problem was solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour second problem is likely due to using a number as the last character in the name. Instead of \u0027fuelTank_3\u0027 try \u0027fuelTank_three\u0027. The game appends an instance number to the end of each part as it\u0027s added to the craft and it might be thinking that 3 on the end is the instance number.
