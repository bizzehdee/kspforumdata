It would be treated as a vehicle with an arbitrarily large inertia (and is thus immovable) that contains an infinite supply of liquid fuel, oxidiser, RCS fuel, electricity and xenon. A vehicle could drive up to this structure and connect with its docking port to resupply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of this structure is to make not just space planes but refuelling trucks reusable. Since the current method of refuelling requires spawning new refuelling trucks (which causes problems when you already have a plane on the runway), this would allow a more convenient and more immersive method, by using a tanker truck to shuttle fuel to the spaceplane from the fuel depot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-27T11:25:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2014 11:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Grumman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T11:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a plane on runway, you can spawn some fuel tanks on launchpad.
