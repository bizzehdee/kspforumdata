You\u0027ll want 1049-1115 kN of thrust in the core and 603-640 kN of thrust on the boosters (assuming six boosters). An engine cluster consisting of a central LV-T45 and four outboard LV-T30s will suffice for the core, while an LV-T45 and two LV-T30s each will suffice for the booster segments. A single orange tank per stack will do the trick (by which I mean a total aggregate delta-V of 4,972.415 m/s with a TWR no lower than 1.39 at any time). Try this setup; if it doesn\u0027t work, you\u0027re not setting up your asparagus correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, 44.55 tonnes is within the tolerance of what can be launched single-stage (though just barely). You\u0027ll need to turn on clipping, you\u0027ll need nine stacks with three orange tanks and an X200-8, each with a Mainsail on the bottom. And struts of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for your ion glider, getting it to go interplanetary is like getting anything else to go interplanetary; once it\u0027s in space it\u0027s payload just like anything else. You attach it to a transfer stage (just a big gas can and some nukes) and off you go.

You\u0027ll want 1049-1115 kN of thrust in the core and 603-640 kN of thrust on the boosters (assuming six boosters). An engine cluster consisting of a central LV-T45 and four outboard LV-T30s will suffice for the core, while an LV-T45 and two LV-T30s each will suffice for the booster segments.
