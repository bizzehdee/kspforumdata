As a result, I pulled off a Mun landing without stranding the crew and blowing up several rockets trying to get a rescue boat out there with my second launch in the file! Bouyed by this success, I set out to conduct a Minmus landing, and this time I thought to take pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xqGVMM4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xqGVMM4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Pioneer 3, made with nearly all stock parts except for the Perfectron separators -which turned out to be a bit of a letdown, I\u0027m sad to say- the Quad-coupler that I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E is from KSPX and MechJeb.

Jeb didn\u0027t appear to notice, and Pioneer 3 made it through the gravity turn without difficulty in spite of the only steerage power coming from the capsule\u0027s onboard gyros.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HhLxhTm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HhLxhTm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage away, RCS thrusters engaged.
