Swapping between craft with brackets jumps the camera to the default focus on that craft, losing all the work getting the camera angle just right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003EQoL Feature request:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAllow each craft to retain the last set camera view until the player presses the Home key while in control of that craft. Switching between near by craft with brackets should set the camera to the saved view for said craft. Home key should not affect other craft but only the controlled craft. These camera saves should persist with the game save, allowing restoring from a quick save to keep them set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-06T11:59:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2024 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 6\u0022\u003EJanuary 6\u003C/time\u003E by jclovis3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
