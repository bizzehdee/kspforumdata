I had a little X-37. After seeing Majorjim\u0027s X-37 (which, by the way, is awesome, but a bit part heavy), I decided to fix mine up, and release it. Orbiter is only 89 parts, with launcher, about 180. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: Tested on stock aero, not FAR. Re-attachable cargo bay inspired by Majorjim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: X-37 comes with half empty fuel tank. Works with a full tank too. Launcher has severely drained fuel tanks, this is by design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RmJk1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Separate, use Centaur second stage to circularize. It is capable of getting into a 150 x 150 km orbit, but is probably capable of more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

If you overshoot KSC, roll over, and pitch down so the belly is still the part mainly exposed to the flames. Press 1 to make it eaiser for your nose to go up. Re-enter at about 30 degrees off prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Land\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.
