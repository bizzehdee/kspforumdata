If you do one mission to, let\u0027s say, duna, wich takes around a year.

One workaround is to take two copies of each experiment one to store the command pod, and the other to store in the MPL. Since the MPL has such small data storage, it\u0027s likely to tie up those experiments for a VERY long while. If you have two copies, you can take one home while you\u0027re waiting the years it takes for your local lab to process the other copy."},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:30:27Z","Content":"I agree.

I ended up having data: 1500/500 without any error to stop that and predicted conversion rate was at 1. something with two scientist mentioned in my post above. Unfortunately my happiness of that high conversion rate when I pressed the button start research. The data went to 500/500 and I have no idea where are other 500.
