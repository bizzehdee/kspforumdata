EC stopped being consumed, but that may have been because of timewarp. (although, this was after the timer was \u0022in the red\u0022, so it may be that having no Supplies to consume means *nothing* is consumed. idk.) and the ship that she came from continued to loose supplies (at least in the LS menu; i didn\u0027t check the craft), not sure what thats about. i will continue testing new ways to kill my poor kerbonauts...\n\nEDIT2: derp, just noticed this was updated a week ago with eva-killing abilities. are there consequences for being a tourist on eva? are certain actions disallowed (uks-maintenance, gathering science)?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-08T22:38:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2016 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CaribouGone**"},{"CreatedByName":"CorBlimey","CreatedById":134058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T21:03:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 07/01/2016 at 2:27 PM, goldenpsp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My only concern is having mechanics that require me to manually move kerbals around within a craft (or base etc).

But any life support mod that requires periodic focussing on the craft is a no-no.

A Mark 1 pod is only good for 20 Kerbal days (as a point of reference, Gemini 7 was in orbit for nearly 14 days and was some seriously cramped quarters).  So having more space - either in the form of less crew than crew capacity, or in purpose-built hab modules - can extend this.  Furthermore, some modules serve as \u0027extenders\u0027, making other hab modules more effective (the MKS Kerbitat is an example of this).\n\nWe also track a few things - how long you\u0027ve been in your current vessel, when you were last on Kerbin, and the most comfortable hab you\u0027ve been in.  We then compare two things - have you been in your current vessel for too long (i.e. have exceeded it\u0027s hab value compared to your time in vessel), and have you been away from Kerbin too long (by looking at your Kerbin time and your best historic hab time).  This lets us do scenarios like having crew in a nice multi-year base still have issues if they go gallivanting off in a rover for too long (and justifies the Karibou\u0027s emergency shelters).  It also lets you set up nice R\u0026R stations that you can rotate larger crews through to bump up the time before they get homesick.  At the same time, it prevents players from \u0027resetting the clock\u0027 by just hopping in and out of a base.\n\nLastly, and more critically, is the idea that all of this stuff wears out.  A rigid shell will last longer than a flimsy temporary structure.  Rips and tears happen, and equipment wears out.  So over time, even though a base might be rated for several years, if you keep pushing new crew into it over decades, it\u0027s effectiveness is going to degrade over time.  Fortunately, there will be mechanics for using MaterialKits to \u0027patch up\u0027 your old bases and extend their life.  From a gameplay standpoint, this lets the player get away with lighter inflatables for temporary bases, while having the option of investing in heavier components and infrastructure for more permanent installations (which goes hand in hand with how MKS has always worked).\n\nAs always, feel free to post questions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nP.S. - Not sure if the big recycler changes will make it in since those require more parts to be built and modeled - we\u0027ll see ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T02:37:58Z","Content":"It all sounds interesting.

I would not want to have to add tons of parts to the rocket just to deal with happiness issues.\n\nFor example I wouldn\u0027t necessarily want to have to build an entire interplanetary OKS station just to keep the kerbals happy enough to make it to eeloo.

Or would it in theory be possible to construct a base, or generation ship that would keep a Kerbal happy indefinitely?  Just trying to get a rough idea of target size to max length of stay -- for example if one had one each of all the OKS modules, with sufficient Supplies and Material Kits -- would a team of 5 kerbals be happy for 4 years, 1 year, or ??"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T06:39:07Z","Content":"So, hypothetically speaking, what if you throw full USI catalog and the EPLP binaries into the equation, and I\u0027ve built a fully sustained base on Lathe, crewed with Kerbals complete with with the minimum needed to generate the manufacture the rest of the base in-situ, so the base is completely self sustaining.\n\nWould it really make sense to force the players to return those kerbals back to Kerbin at some point in the future?\n\nWouldn\u0027t it make more sense to have something deep in the tech tree that allows the kerbals to stay afield indefinitely?\n\nIf I have a goal of completely colonizing the entire Kerbol station (as long as THAT would take), the habitation mechanic seems like something that\u0027s going to force a ton of necessary crew rotations in that scenario, as I would expect some way to reverse the ill effects of being afield once I\u0027m far enough down the tech tree."}]}
