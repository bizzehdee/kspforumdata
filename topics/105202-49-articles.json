I have to get all of my other mods in sync first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start, the out of the box settings are not going to have the hab-effects enabled, though using MKS-Lite or UKS will turn these on, since this is one of those features that\u0027s really meant to add to the immersion for those mods (but at the same time, I recognize that many folks use USI-LS without MKS an don\u0027t want to kill their Kerbals off).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe configs will be sorted in such a way that they pick the most pessimistic values (that way I can have a gentle default USI-LS config, but crank things up with MKS-Lite and UKS without depending on the player to change settings one way or the other).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few new concepts to work through, so I figured I\u0027d cover those now then we can go from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first is the idea of a hab module\u0027s usable time - this just represents how long a Kerbal will tolerate being cooped up in it. \u00A0A Mark 1 pod is only good for 20 Kerbal days (as a point of reference, Gemini 7 was in orbit for nearly\u00A014 days and was some seriously cramped quarters). \u00A0So having more space - either in the form of less crew than crew capacity, or in purpose-built hab modules - can extend this. \u00A0Furthermore, some modules serve as \u0027extenders\u0027, making other hab modules more effective (the MKS Kerbitat is an example of this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also track a few things - how long you\u0027ve been in your current vessel, when you were last on Kerbin, and the most comfortable hab you\u0027ve been in. \u00A0We then compare two things - have you been in your current vessel for too long (i.e. have exceeded it\u0027s hab value compared to your time in vessel), and have you been away from Kerbin too long (by looking at your Kerbin time and your best historic hab time). \u00A0This lets us do scenarios like having crew in a nice multi-year base still have issues if they go gallivanting off in a rover for too long (and justifies the Karibou\u0027s emergency shelters). \u00A0It also lets you set up nice R\u0026amp;R stations that you can rotate larger crews through to bump up the time before they get homesick. \u00A0At the same time, it prevents players from \u0027resetting the clock\u0027 by just hopping in and out of a base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, and more critically, is the idea that all of this stuff wears out. \u00A0A rigid shell will last longer than a flimsy temporary structure. \u00A0Rips and tears happen, and equipment wears out. \u00A0So over time, even though a base might be rated for several years, if you keep pushing new crew into it over decades, it\u0027s effectiveness is going to degrade over time. \u00A0Fortunately, there will be mechanics for using MaterialKits to \u0027patch up\u0027 your old bases and extend their life. \u00A0From a gameplay standpoint, this lets the player get away with lighter inflatables for temporary bases, while having the option of investing in heavier components and infrastructure for more permanent installations (which goes hand in hand with how MKS has always worked).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, feel free to post questions \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. -
