I have zero experience in ksp mod development but recently I talked to the DR developer to fix an issue with KIS - they were conflicting a few days ago. Its fixed now though. But.. It seemed that DR somehow failed to properly finish executing some OnUpdate() method - it threw a NRE exception or something, I can\u0027t really tell. My understanding is that some mods subscribe to the lets say internal message queue or an event so OnUpdate or any other similar callback that they implement will be called. I guess KSP chains it - like when you have a bunch of listeners and just iterate over them and call their respective callbacks (like OnUpdate()). The question is: isn\u0027t it wrapped in the try-catch block? One mod throws the exception and other subscribers\u0027 callbacks will never get called. I may be completely wrong about the internal subscriber/callback mechanism though. Thanks in advance. xD\n\u003E \n\nEvery such problem is unique. Sometimes try/catch helps, sometimes not. In general case if you code calls some other code then you expect something to happen after the call, or some vital data returned. If that call failed then what? Either the state is now wrong or the required data is not returned. Best thing you can do is crash nicely with helpful logs but it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll be able to continue working. There are just a few cases when ignoring exceptions makes sense.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 46 minutes ago, AdmiralTigerclaw said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027ve got going on, and I\u0027m 20 hours awake at this point.
