FE is great for seeing everything a mod adds but if I want to get rid of a certain mod (say b9 because it adds so many parts I don\u0027t usually use) it can\u0027t do it in a quick \u0026amp; easy manner.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mean \u0022show me all parts but NOT B9\u0022? Yea, I guess FE doesn\u0027t do that. At first I was thinking you were saying you wanted to see only B9, which FE can do. I\u0027ve been using FE for a few days now (and even created a custom filter or two) and so far I am still not sure I miss SPO. I think I need to get more of my mods installed in the latest version, and then decide. If I have 12 mods with parts, maybe I\u0027ll feel differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
