I\u0027m doing contracts involving eva reports and surface samples. I wanted to move my spaceplane while one of my kerbals were outside, but I couldn\u0027t switch back to my plane! So\u00A0I took my pilot into EVA to see if that would fit it. I then put my scientist in his pod and attempted to switch to the pilot (who has been clinging on to the plane) and couldn\u0027t switch focus to her! I\u0027m getting really frustrated because the day before, I did exactly what I\u0027m trying to do right now. I\u0027ve looked on the other forums, but none go over xbox, so there might be a different control that I\u0027m not aware of\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-03T00:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2017 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by BroItsHumpDay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIncorrect description, changed words to the correct situation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKorbinjer","CreatedById":172204,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-03T15:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching between craft/kerbals can be done withe the bracketing keys : [ and ] on the\u003Cem\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomputer KSP.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand after doing a little bit of research, i don\u0027t know of any way to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry messing with the button inputs in settings,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe there is, just no button for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope my suggestions help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-TheKorbinger\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-03T15:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2017 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by TheKorbinger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scottadges","CreatedById":174580,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T08:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having the exact question/issue but in a more general sense.
