There is also a general stiffening of the structure, though I think I may need to add a few more struts to take the load from the \u0027chutes opening for a landing on Kerbin. This does have the RCS capacity to act as a tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TWR is crazy-high for Mun or Minmus. If you didn\u0027t expect a Kerbin landing, you could could cut back on the radial motors. You could also reduce the nass of RCS fuel, and maybe use a stock capsule with a docking port on the nose. It would help to use lighter landing legs. The main reason for the extended radius is to make it less sensitive to the ground slope at landing. This is certainly not the most efficient option, but it looks good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use fairings it would look very ungainly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
