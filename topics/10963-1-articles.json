It is the fifth version of a line of experimental craft. It carries enough fuel to get into and out of orbit. It looks unstable, but even without the SAS it still flies decently straight. You see, it starts off with 3 solid-fuel engines in sync with 3 large normal rockets and 3 pointy jet rockets. The pointy rockets run out of fuel first, then the solid rockets. The large rockets have enough fuel to get you almost out of the atmosphere. The small rockets finishes that (NOTE: When the small rocket is activated, you lose speed fast, don\\\u0027t worry, its just the transition from 3 rockets to 1. The next 3 rockets get you into/out of orbit. Then, you use the parachute and landing gear to touch down.\n\nHere are the screenshots. NOTE: The reason the altitude is so low is because I cut the fuel and prematurely ended each stage: I didnt have the patience to do an orbit and stuff.\n\nThis is the link to the album with ALL of the screenshots: [http://imgur.com/a/Pvmzw](http://imgur.com/a/Pvmzw)\n\nI\\\u0027ll embed a few here:\n\n![bO0q7h.png](http://i.imgur.com/bO0q7h.png)\n\n![8wwegh.png](http://i.imgur.com/8wwegh.png)\n\n![rL5D7h.png](http://i.imgur.com/rL5D7h.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Anonymous_Jr","CreatedById":6514,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T23:40:57Z","Content":"May we have some screenies?
