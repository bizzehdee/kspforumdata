This was a similar ship to the first, but where the top was a Mk3-profile rover with four RoveMax model XL3\u0027s sticking out. I figured this would be a more challenging case for the fairings, because (a) the fairings would be larger, and therefore heavier, and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E I\u0027d be shoving a huge cross-section through the atmosphere. It turned out to be not quite a fair test because in the no-fairing condition, at high speed the drag was unbalanced and I started to drift off the vertical and had to rotate the craft around to wrestle it back upright. That said, the ship with fairings made it above 70km, and without fairings it only made it to 12. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ynm86\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
