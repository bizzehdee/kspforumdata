Must experiment...\n\nAnd preliminary results are \\*very\\* positive. I tested two conditions. The first was a cylindrical craft with a section that was not very aerodynamic, but still within the cylinder of the top section. The fairing was not that much wider than the ship itself. In this case, the ship went to 120km without fairings, and 190km with. \n\nThe second condition was one I expected the fairings to have a harder time with. This was a similar ship to the first, but where the top was a Mk3-profile rover with four RoveMax model XL3\u0027s sticking out. I figured this would be a more challenging case for the fairings, because (a) the fairings would be larger, and therefore heavier, and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) I\u0027d be shoving a huge cross-section through the atmosphere. It turned out to be not quite a fair test because in the no-fairing condition, at high speed the drag was unbalanced and I started to drift off the vertical and had to rotate the craft around to wrestle it back upright. That said, the ship with fairings made it above 70km, and without fairings it only made it to 12. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027m not sure when since 1.0 this got introduced, but originally the mass of the fairings was all in the fairing base. That meant that shedding the fairings would not lighten your ship. Now, however, when you jettison the fairings, you lose something like 90% of their mass.\n\nBravo, Squad, for fixing these problems with fairings. I\u0027ve still got Procedural Fairings, though, because interstage."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:54:08Z","Content":"You have interstage fairings, just attach the node to the bottom of the other side."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:04:51Z","Content":"Nice.
