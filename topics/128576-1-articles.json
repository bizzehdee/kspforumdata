I participated in that challenge and loved every minute. I failed however. Today on the eve of Christmas 2015 I reawaken this challenge! The rules are simple, perform a mission or part of a mission every day for 365 days in a row. A part of a mission for the purposes of this challenge is defined as one of the following\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch a craft from the surface of a celestial body to orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDeorbit and land on a celestial body.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerform a transfer burn to a different planet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerform a capture burn around a planet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerform a complete transfer from one celestial body to another in the same system (ie. Eve to Gilly, Ike to Duna, M\u00FCn to Minmus.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerform a significant mission critical activity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last two are additions I have made to the original challenge and are there to expand the number of valid missions. The first was added because the difference between going to the M\u00FCn and going to Duna is only ~500dV and missions to Minmus are missions too! The last one is a catch all and is there to cover the weird things that don\u0027t fall under one of the other defined mission parts, such as EVA construction with KIS/KAS or configuring a massive station for, and then performing a transfer to, a radically different orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods are allowed and encouraged as, from my experience, it might prove difficult to come up with enough unique missions with just stock content. Feel free to take on the challenge with a stock install if you want but it\u0027s not required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this challenge is more about personal satisfaction than competition there is no ranking system, completion is the only goal. That said I will try and keep a list in the OP of the active participants. My attempt will be recorded on my YouTube channel and I encourage participants to keep a public record also, whether it is with YouTube videos or a blog or even a tread on the KSP Fanworks subforum. I will begin my run on January 1st 2016. Now Kerbalnauts, state your intent and be counted as a participant to take on this epic challenge!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EParticipants\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFoxxonius Augustus\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalCorgi","CreatedById":155954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T14:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027m doing a freeplay of KSP right now, and I plan to launch a lot of stuff, so sign me up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
