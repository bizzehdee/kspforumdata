I don\u0027t want to kill my save and start over as I have so much going. Will .235 break my save?

Personaly I had almost no issues with my 23 save after I updated the main ones and tweeked a few things. I\u0027d suggest go to the threads of the mods you use and check for updates or browse the last few days of posts to see if that mod blew up and if theres a fix. Once you update all the broke ones and confirm the others are not broke have at it. I would recomend coppying the save file first though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T02:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust deorbit everything and watch it burn.
