No maneuver nodes to guide you either. So, I spent time training for it until I got it right. The key to doing it the old fashioned way without any maneuver nodes was to adjust your orbit either shrink it to speed up or expand it to slow down. Use Time Warp until you get close enough where you can adjust to make an interception. However, chance of error was still high as you could overshoot either way. Great learning experience that has paid off though. When 0.18 finally did come out, targetting has made it easier to rendezvous as you couldn\u0027t target before that nor use maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of my learning wall, I have yet to successfully bring back any craft from another planet outside of Kerbin (mainly because I have been busy and also I need to learn how to do it without screwing up).
