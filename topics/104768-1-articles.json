KSP has a learning *wall*, as many have stated. Meaning the learning curve is so steep it seems like a wall rather than a curve.\n\nThis thread is to discuss exactly what was so hard for you to learn just starting out, or what mainly was your \u0022learning wall.\u0022 What was the first thing that frustrated you? Or the first thing you needed lots of help to accomplish? \n\nI\u0027ll start us off. My learning wall was maneuver nodes. I was first taught to eyeball everything, eyeball getting into orbit, eyeball mun transfers, eyeball trajectories to the mun, and eyeballing landing.

No maneuver nodes to guide you either. So, I spent time training for it until I got it right. The key to doing it the old fashioned way without any maneuver nodes was to adjust your orbit either shrink it to speed up or expand it to slow down. Use Time Warp until you get close enough where you can adjust to make an interception. However, chance of error was still high as you could overshoot either way. Great learning experience that has paid off though. When 0.18 finally did come out, targetting has made it easier to rendezvous as you couldn\u0027t target before that nor use maneuver nodes.\n\nIn terms of my learning wall, I have yet to successfully bring back any craft from another planet outside of Kerbin (mainly because I have been busy and also I need to learn how to do it without screwing up). Docking was a piece of a cake, even though there are cases it can be hard to dock unmanned objects that have no probe core whatsoever. Even harder is to dock without any RCS, but worth the challenge. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:01:42Z","Content":"I view the learning wall as you said; a more difficult learning curve, but I would not associate all things in KSP like that; some things are more difficult to learn, but they are still definitely learnable, while others are not as difficult as one may think."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:05:53Z","Content":"Rendezvous and docking are the only two things that really frustrated me.
