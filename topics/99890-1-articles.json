Like most spaceplane amateurs, I was very frustrated when I first decided to try to unravel the mysteries of that particular side of KSP, and it wasn\u0027t until I first got a hold of DocMoriarty\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Space Plane Construction and Operation\u003C/a\u003E Guide and the guidleines it contained that I started making spaceplanes that would fly reliably every time. A few things have changes from 0.24.2 when the last version of the guide was released, but the general principles are the same now as they were then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn idea I\u0027ve had for a while now is to use a spaceplane to launch a Munar capsule to orbit, and then to use that same plane to haul the capsule back down to KSC. I\u0027ve tried this a couple of times but there were a few addtional spaceplane \u0022rules\u0022 and tools I needed (RCS Build Aid, Intake Build aid and the ability to use radial symmetry in the SPH) before I got a design that finally did the job. So, this past weekend I put together this monstrosity, the \u003Cstrong\u003EVampire Bat 7\u003C/strong\u003E, a DocMoriarty-style transporter spaceplane hauling a Geschosskopf Science Bomb Munar lander. This weekend I conducted a successful mission - Mun and back, all parts recovered, 500 science gathered...total mission cost was just \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,500 - the cost of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/F6K86\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

So what\u0027s your challenge?\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we hit KSP v1.0, the souposphere stock aerodynamic model - in which this craft is obviously designed to fly - is going to go away, to be replaced with an aerodynamic model more akin to NEAR or FAR. When that occurs, designs like this one \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E become more problematic (if not impossible) to fly due to the changes in drag. So, my challenge to you is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBuild a plane that will haul the same capsule design to and from orbit, using either the NEAR or FAR aerodynamic model\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2azcoptxrhnoht/Sci%20Lander.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGrab the Capsule Here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the requirement of using NEAR or FAR (your choice), the following rules apply:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You are not allowed to modify the design of the capsule in any way, shape or form. The capsule is too wide to fit inside a Mk3 Cargo Bay; that\u0027s part of the challenge. It weighs over eighteen tonnes fully fueled and can fly from LKO to the Mun, land, take off again and return to LKO. It has been balanced so that its center of mass won\u0027t shift as it burns fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No vertical launches - the capsule must be brought up to orbit and brought back down via a transport craft that\u0027s readily identifiable as a plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No breakage - the number of parts you have at the start of the mission must equal the number of parts you recover from the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The usual crap - no hyperediting, gravity hacking or other cheatsy nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo enter, you\u0027ll need to submit the following set of screenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your craft in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) A screenshot that indicates the number of parts the craft has prior to launch (this can be combined with the first shot if you\u0027ve got a mod that shows that information, such as KER).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Your craft in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The capsule on the Mun. I\u0027ll give extra consideration to those who take a screenie with a Kerbal/flag in the shot or using the sci bomb (by which I mean I\u0027ll use that stuff to break ties).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Your craft safely back on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) A shot of your craft\u0027s recovery with the price of parts recovered visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with your screenshots, you must also indicate which mods you use - NEAR or FAR, stock parts versus parts mods such as B9 and Firespitter, etc. Categories for entries will be based on specific mod combinations as they come in. Scoring for the challenge will be based solely on mission cost, i.e. your score will be the total overall cost of the craft minus the cost recovered from the craft, which makes the first and last screenshots absolutely crucial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck to all entrants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If you want to fly the Bat yourself, here are the necessary files):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfe9rvgs8tstakn/Vampire%20Bat%207.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVampire Bat Craft File\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jqwzockdcjsmk55/AADVXMFGHVlgRgTkrzC1jJMAa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELarge Gear Bay Folder\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You\u0027ll need the Large Gear Bay part to fly the Bat; just drop the contents of the Dropbox folder above in a local folder titled \u0022LargeGearBay\u0022 inside your KSP\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Gamedata\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Squad\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Parts\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Wheels directory.
