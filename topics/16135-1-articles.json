I think KSP is set a long time after that, and the inhabitants have turned green because they can only eat grass. the kerbals renamed the planet kerbin and have only just realised that they had been tricked into going to their planet, and are building a space program to get their revenge. and you know how in the book Arthur finds the face of the guy who helped make the fjords carved into the ice? maybe they are the monoliths.

My first computer (HAHAHA) was a Commodore 64 and I was a HUGE fan of Infocom\u0027s text adventure games. I was 7 years old when The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy was released by Infocom in 1984. I played it thoroughly and beat it many times with my best friend and it wasn\u0027t until 1995 when I came across a copy of the Original Hitchhiker Radio Scripts that I had any idea it had been a radio show. I enjoyed reading the scripts so much that I even bought the black leatherbound \u0027The Ultimate Hitchhikers Guide.\u0027 Just an amazingly great piece of sci-fi comedy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T03:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe babel fish dispenser is still one of my favorite puzzles in all of interactive fiction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfocom games rocked.

They had one of the best anti-piracy schemes ever: those silly things in the box that not only helped provide key hints here and there, but were such fun (and eventually, collectible) that you happily paid for the boxed game even if your best friend was already willing to loan you his copy. Still got my Joo Janta Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroPelican","CreatedById":28509,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T08:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou should re-read it, seriously, it\u0027s that good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s quite clear that the planet the Golgafrincham\u0027s \u0022B\u0022 Ark crashed onto was prehistoric earth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it is pre-historic earth, and have read it several times.
