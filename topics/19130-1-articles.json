Does it, by any chance, appear that the large decoupler is failing and the rocket engine is pushing straight up through the rest of the parts? There is a small, albeit catastrophically dangerous, bug within the large stack decoupler. If you look at the stats on the large decoupler you will notice it has a 10x increase in mass and no increase in strength over the stock 1 meter decoupler. This causes them to fail when under increased G forces. I recommend modifying the part.cfg file and increasing the strength.
