Look into a mod called Procedural Fairings. They are far easier to use and far more forgiving. Also, try adjusting mechjebs ascent profile. The default one is a bit ugly. Lastly, while that tank/engine combo is good for a booster stage, its not suited as a primary lifter. The other suggestions are good too.
