Example time. Say you have 4 solid boosters and 3 liquid engines, the 4 solid boosters are connecting to radial couplers. Taking off i have all on the first section of modules. When the solid fuel runs out i want to disconnect the solid fuel boosters whilst leaving everything else in place. Is this already possible or will it be implemented in the future? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you can manually release certain modules by right clicking but this is timey and gives the ship a very unstable few minutes whilst trying to get them all off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T23:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can already shed your boosters while leaving the LFEs running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate your rocket with LFTs and and LFE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next stage have your decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next stage (at the bottom) put your boosters and drag just the LFE from the above stage into the boosters stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch, the boosters and the LFE will fire up.
