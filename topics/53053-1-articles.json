The station modules are attached to the rest of the station via the regular clamp-o-trons. The robotic arm has a clamp-o-tron jr. on it, and so does the station module, so that it can be grabbed and moved around. However, when I get close to it, it only magnetizes, but doesn\u0027t connect. I tried undocking the regular clamp-o-trons, and that worked, but the regular clamp-o-trons immediately tried to dock again, and caused the ship to spin out of control and break apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T03:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can.
