And with 60 kN of thrust like it\u0027s in the game, we basically have to spam NERVAs all over the ship to go places, unless it\u0027s a small ship like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g7Zyegol.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022g7Zyegol.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I suggest to either make the current NERVA heavier and more powerful, or add one more NTR which is bigger.

Once their TWR was lowered by increasing their mass and lowering their thrust. The \u0027worst\u0027 was that they started to consume only LF, making NERVA-powered rockets carry more than half-empty fuel tanks (but also making them realistic). Instead of lowering their thrust, I think something should be done like removing gimbal, power generation, and limiting its usage. For example, you can run them for \u0026lt;balanced value here\u0026gt; minutes only, before their reactor core is depleted.
