However, this time I present to you the AeroSpace SM-SSTO Space Plane in which can orbit kerbin at approximately 500000 meters and quite possibly the capability to get to the Mun (I dont know that so all you Delta V fans out there can find that out for me** ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)**) It is highly stable and gets the job done. Science is already onboard for all you career fans too.**  **The craft can be found here:** [https://www.dropbox.com/s/foy4z9wl07clcad/AeroSpace%20SM-SSTO.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/foy4z9wl07clcad/AeroSpace%20SM-SSTO.craft?dl=0)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ODHlaDY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ODHlaDY.jpg)![QbYiiRS.png](http://i.imgur.com/QbYiiRS.png)![I8M76Mu.png](http://i.imgur.com/I8M76Mu.png)![vtFzbwt.png](http://i.imgur.com/vtFzbwt.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T10:03:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghostbuzzer7**\n  \nAction Groups"}]}
