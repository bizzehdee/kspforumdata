I got contract to go on Minmus and scan the Olivine formation with the small scanning arm. No problems, I build rover and man it with two kerbals and send it to mission. After few minutes of roving around I find the Olivine formation and scan it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow while I was scanning it I notice in the science window\u00A0a\u00A0message written in orange letters saying that I should come later again with better instrumentation to recover more science as small scanning arm gives you only 33% of total science. Before I left the place I left there a flag, the rover and surface mystery goo observation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I unlocked medium scanning arm I send a mission to Minmus and land a lander next to old rover and previously found Olivine formation.
