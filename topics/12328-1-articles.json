It\\\u0027s actually got 6 degrees of motion to it, so in theory, it could even take care of everything by itself (short of throttle). The latest driver version is able to report as a joystick to Windows, so you can map the axes in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIDK what your budget for the project is tho, the cheapest SpaceNavigator model is 99USD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the rest, a HOTAS stick like an X52 would work just fine. The X52 right hand stick has a twist grip, so it\\\u0027s got the three rotational inputs you need there, and with the throttle || spacenavigator on the left hand, it should cover all bases. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor buttons and switches, the most common approach used by simpit enthusiasts is to take apart a keyboard and have each button on the panel basically closing a key circuit on the keyboard PCB. Another option, which is more involved but much more customizable, is to use an Arduino controller to read switches and buttons on its pins. Or, you could look for a keyboard emulator board, which are made especially for simpit construction. It\\\u0027s basically keyboard hardware, but instead of keys, there are open pins to attach buttons and switches to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, best of luck with this project!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
