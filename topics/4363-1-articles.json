Or they are created via cfg file? Thats very confusing to me now, and I would be very thankfull for anyone explaining this to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-07T05:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you create the collision node in Blender - thats a mesh that defines the physical \u0027boundaries\u0027 of your object in the game - its usually roughly the same shape as your model and its object must be named node_collider\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead the three sections on this page, from Node Tags and Name to Collision Mesh: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Part_Modelling_Guidelines#Nodes_and_Tag_Names\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Part_Modelling_Guidelines#Nodes_and_Tag_Names\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it says, you create the actual connection nodes are added via the config files - basically it takes the origin point of your model (typically the middle, if you kept the \u0027dot\u0027 lined up over the axis intersection in blender) and then positions them by offsetting by the values in the config. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore about that here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions:\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to remember, the Y axis is UP in KSP - its translated properly even if you model Z-up in blender, so you don\\\u0027t need to rotate usually, but you still have to think Y-up when making coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll let you soak all that in, and ask questions about it before we add any more details.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBricktop","CreatedById":11910,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-30T12:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reply, i actually managed to do it by myself, only thing that confused me was some part in the modelling wiki that said I should define nodes in blender.
