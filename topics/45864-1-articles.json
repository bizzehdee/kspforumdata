My space station has been in planning for a long time and I will soon get to building it. One of it\u0027s features will be an advanced refueling system (converting kethane into fuel and using that fuel to refuel) and for that I need a Kethane mining program. I am not an expert at this game, but I\u0027m not a noob either. So this is what I have in mind: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kethane mining vessel able to land, take off and randezvous in low Minmus orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis vessel would land on Minmus, mine Kethane to full capacity and then take off to randezvous with Kethane carrier in low orbit (it would also refuel there to be able to land again and take off later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Kethane carrier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would store all the Kethane delivered by mining vessel and then fly to the space station to transfer the fuel there, refuel and go back to Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.The station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about the station yet. I would prefer it to be in Kerbin\u0027s orbit. All the conversion will be done here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it. Please tell me what do you think about this. Would it be efficient? Is it possible to make vessel capable of constantly travelling back between Kerbin and Minmus?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T15:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by StalinislavStalinovich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eanswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tydeth","CreatedById":77572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T03:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the carrier, you will want LV-N Atomic Rocket Motors, for they are the most fuel-efficient space rockets ever. Their drawback is the low thrust that limits them to space/moon use. An alternative is Ion Engines, if you don\u0027t mind taking forever and a year to get anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not using the refinery itself to refuel ships launched from Kerbin directly, the refining station doesn\u0027t have to be in Low Kerbin Orbit, so that can help with the fuel costs of transfering the Kethane and returning to Minmus. While moving the station out on a higher km orbit can make Minmus-Refinery travels easier, it will make Kerbin-Refinery travels need a bit more fuel to reach, so there\u0027s a balancing act to consider. Of course, using the refinery to convert Kethane to fuel for transfer to a separate Low-Kerbin Orbit gas station would also require a Low Kerbin Orbit fuel depot and a tanker to make those trips. Up to you whether the refinery will be the fuel depot or will fill fuel depots via tankers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne extra step to consider, between the lander and the carrier, is a Kethane Storage Outpost over Minmus. The lander docks with it to offload the mined goods, the carrier docks and sucks all the Kethane up for a trip to the refinery, and the lander can continue to mine while the carrier is in transit. Currently, your lander would have to wait for the carrier to arrive in Minmus orbit to continue operations. This would make your mining more time-efficient, rendering fuel your only limiting factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T03:28:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tydeth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T03:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis might suit you well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/kethane_mk2_1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kethane_mk2_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s not entirely to your spec, but it does do a great job of making mining Kethane a quick and mostly painless process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/kethane_mk2_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kethane_mk2_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The miner itself is very light for what it does, and has a Kerbal Attachment System \u0022mouse\u0022 attached for Kerbal-free fuel transfer operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/kethane_mk2_3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kethane_mk2_3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The fuel tug is nice and simple, and doesn\u0027t require a lot of work to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The base of the whole lot of it is designed to be lugged up to Minmus with the miner and tug, and acts as a station with a single orange tank and CoT Sr. docking ports on either end for expansion purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T03:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESupposedly refining the kethane into fuel and then lifting them offworld is slightly more efficient than lifting crude kethane.
