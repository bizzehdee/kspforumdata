It functions perfectly in atmo but when I fire up the rocket engine (LV-T30) in space it pitches upwards almost uncontrollably. However once I deorbit and enter into atmo again the craft rolls and spins whenever I attempt to control it.

Try to include a side shot with the CoM, CoT, and CoL markers on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is probably happening when you fire the rocket is what Sirrobert said. The LV-T30 will be pretty powerful if your ship is small and will cause it to go out of control. You want the Center of Thrust (CoT) pink marker to line up with the Center of Mass (CoM) yellow marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the out of control on reentry, thr CoM is likely shifting back during flight because you burn fuel. The Center of Lift (CoL) blue marker needs to stay behind the CoM during atmospheric flight. You can test the CoM\u0027s location by right clicking on the fuel tanks while in the VAB. When you right click, there is a slider that lets you adjust the fuel load. Set up the fuel configuration to match your reentry fuel condition and make sure the CoM is in front of the CoL. (Remember to put the fuel load back when you\u0027re done.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso make sure your plane is pointed mostly at the prograde marker during reentry (or slightly nose up) and not sideways, top first, or backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T13:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/zH6wd#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/zH6wd#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T13:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EScreenshots can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/zH6wd#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/zH6wd#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re immediate issue is that your CoM (Center of Mass) is too far behind your CoL (Center of Lift) This causes instability, and even more so as you burn fuel (And your CoM shifts) A good way to fix this is to remove the canards on the front of the craft,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T13:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the landing gear causes the SPH to lie about the CoM (they are massless in flight).
