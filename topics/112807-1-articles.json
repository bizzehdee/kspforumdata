At some point I\u0027ll hear either a snapping or buckling and within 10 seconds of that, the SRB\u0027s will turn inward and the rest of the vehicle breaks up. It should be noted that this happens before SRB sep is supposed to take place so, the decouplers have not yet been deliberately fired at this point in the launch. Nothing major can be visually seen when I hear this peculiar noise, until the SRB\u0027s twist and the break up occurs. Whole thing reminds me of an NTSB investigation. Lol Although I\u0027m sure space agencies like NASA have their own accident review boards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
