I was going to edit my post tonight, to clear this mod of the problem... who knew (still quite new to the game really).  If I return the wings to 100% size, the aircraft flies normally (if not goofy as hell looking).  I went into the config files for the wings, and added scale to the model (0.5,0.5.0.5) and the wings worked with no issue, It must be the math that Tweakscale uses to get into the negitives (not sure how the code works in KSP, but some kind of \u0022If (M =\u003E 1) M = M - (M/2)\u0022 in there to prevent negative numbers.  \n\nAs for the part, had no idea of the \u0027unfunness\u0027 of legs.  I haven\u0027t dabbled in it yet, but i do 3d modeling (using 3ds max) but I\u0027m kinda stuck at the conversion from a 3ds format to the KSP 3d format conversion.  Would love to have some reference models as i do have some ideas for parts not yet in the MK2 Catalog.  I\u0027ve dabbled with code for years, and the config files are pretty straight forward, and it seems the modeling is as well (along with the texturing).  \n\nAnyway, thanks again for the advice on this error I\u0027m having, even if I blamed the wrong mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-30T13:11:38Z","Content":"Just downloaded, excited to see what it has to offer, especially the nuclear engines ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-30T18:18:54Z","Content":"[@SuicidalInsanity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143878-suicidalinsanity/) I just wanted to say THANK YOU for this mod, with your mod, I actually landed my 1st plane without the engines exploding or plane coming apart! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-31T03:11:44Z","Content":"Update 1.7.5 for KSP 1.3 is now up, grab it from [SpaceDock](https://spacedock.info/mod/473/Mk2%20Stockalike%20Expansion) or [GitHub](https://github.com/SuicidalInsanity/Mk2Expansion/releases/tag/1.7.5)  \n\nChangeLog:\n\nSpoiler\n\n-Update for KSP 1.3  \n\n-Model Rework: Mk2 Science Lab  \n\n-Model Rework: SC-TD Multipurpose Cockpit  \n\n-Model Rework: HSNC now has spatular variant  \n\n-Model Rework: Nosecap  \n\n-Model Rework: Rontgen nuclear jet  \n\n-Model Rework: Linear Aerospike  \n\n-Banshee Lift Fan SFX volume reduced  \n\n-HSNC and SSNC now use updated RSCFX  \n\n-Fixes Omni \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts clipping into surfaces  \n\n-Adds optional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch to add reactor heat/decay mechanics to Rontgen  \n\n-Removes Scramjet thrust Offset  \n\n-Added Engine Lights  \n\n-R-71 cockpit now has ASET IVA  \n\n-Tweakscale Patch has been updated courtesy of eberkain"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyKaptn","CreatedById":153990,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-31T08:28:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, SuicidalInsanity said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Update 1.7.5 for KSP 1.3 is now up\n\u003E \n\nThank you"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-31T10:55:44Z","Content":"Awesome!

With NFE, engine thrust is tied to the reactor\u0027s core heat, so the reactor has to warm up to optimum temperature before it\u0027ll produce its full thrust. I think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is also tied to core temperature as well, which would explain it sucking down fuel.  \n\n@Fr8monkey: As mentioned above, almost certainly a NFE interaction. As JadeofMaar said, NFE adds NFE reactor mechanics to the Mk2 Nuclear engines which affects how they function, however you should be able to run them without radiators as the engines feature exhaust cooling, but radiators will be needed if the reactor cores are left running when the engines aren\u0027t being used.
