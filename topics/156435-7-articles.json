I\u0027m getting 5 identical boards, just cause that\u0027s how the manufacturer does things. Total cost was only about $22, and that was with the faster shipping.

More than likely, I \u003Cem\u003Ewon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E have time tomorrow, so the board has a solid head start. Unfortunately, me incessantly working on \u003Cem\u003Eother people\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E projects has screwed me over... The board design took into consideration parts that were in stock at the time of the design. Because I have myself tied up in half a dozen projects that aren\u0027t even my own, my board revisions took some time, and getting the board ordered took some time... It\u0027s also been enough time that one of the two main power transistors is out of stock with a month\u002B lead time... I hope... I can\u0027t win...

Huh... I thought I posted about that, but i didn\u0027t see it. Anyway, I had debated for a long time if I could justify getting the LEDs... I just went ahead and got them several months ago. Anyway, the big issue with the boards, is that they don\u0027t have very much space to sit, and there are a LOT of pins I need to break out, which makes through hole mounting iffy at best.. Furthermore, orienting the board endwise, while it could work, also likely means slots in the aluminum panel, on three of 4 sides of the Navball, and I want the maximum physical support in that area, so I wanna minimize the size of any slots I cut into the surrounding aluminum. I pretty much expect to be multiplexing them, but the red and green LEDs have to be multiplexed separately. The reds are common cathode, and the greens common anode. No idea why they made the parts that way, but that\u0027s how they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Rate of Rotation Meters will consist of three bar graphs, one for each axis of rotation. Each LED module is 5mm long, and has five 0.5mm x 1.6mm LED segments. Each bar will use 10 of the green modules, and 6 of the red modules, for a total of 80 segments in an 80mm (3.15 inch) bar. If space or electrical complexity becomes an issue, i might be willing to go down to 9 or 8 of the green modules. I\u0027d rather not though. i could cut one red module of either end too, and have less red portions of the bar graph. honestly, depending on the complexity of it, I might look into a 4 layer board, if that helps route all the connections. Routing is such an issue, because of the limited space and absolute number of connections to be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like I should make a small addendum... These might look like standard DIP style chip packages, but they are very much smaller than the standard DIP package. A standard DIP has 0.1 inch spaced leads. this has 0.049 spacing, converted to the same units... as small as the part is, close enough to 0.05, or half the pin pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-22T15:01:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2021 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-06T12:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022g8QJHXM.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221184\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/g8QJHXM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETHAT\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E is a fine sight!

I think people were reluctant to buy it, due to it being international shipping, possibly. I spent $70 something in shipping costs alone... Honestly, it was \u003Cem\u003Ewell\u003C/em\u003E worth it though. I\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seen one go for as cheap in the years since I originally snagged mine. I took the gamble, mainly because it was pulled form a working simulator, simply because it was being retired... The F-4 is a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E old jet, after all! Honestly, three axis navballs are just very rare on ebay. They don\u0027t pop up very often, and if they are flight rated, they\u0027ll generally be over a grand. Mine was rated for simulator use only, so it sold for way cheaper. It\u0027s amazing how many 2 axis balls are out there. They really do clutter up the search results, and it makes finding a good 3 axis ball very tedious. 2 axis balls are less useful for space applications, where orientation can easily be situated in all three axes. The two axis units also can be misleading too... If they utilize an integrated gyroscope that is vacuum or electrically driven, then the indicator is 100% useless. If it is a remote sending unit... that is a remotely oriented gyroscope sends signals to control the two axes, then it can still potentially be used... Displaying pitch and roll is typical for commercial and small aircraft, along with having a heading indicator display yaw separately. For space applications, one could have toggles to toggle yaw and pitch, or yaw and roll on a pair of such indicators, but it\u0027s universally less intuitive for space operations than a unified three axis navball. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve been so determined to get it up and functioning!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-22T17:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... an idea...

For the longest time, mounting it, along with what sits around it had always been in flux until very recently. I\u0027m now quite sold on the current position and the current order of instruments, with the current bezel configuration including three rate of rotation meters and the velocity readout. One issue has been the fact that due to the angle of the front instrument panel, the rear of the Navball housing, and by extension, the tape meter, was likely going to stick out below the plane of the bottom panel, and require a \u0022pan\u0022 to enclose. I was fine with this fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne area of concern was what cutting slots for the rate of rotation bargraph PC boards would do to the overall strength of the Instrument panel. The Navball is the heaviest of all my individual instruments, and was designed to be supported from the front bezel. I was trying to find ways not to slot the panel surrounding where the Navball would mount, but now I think I might have an entirely different strategy for mounting. If I cut a \u0022U\u0022 shaped channel in the instrument panel plate surrounding the Navball, and bend it inward, the Navball will have a flatter facing front (which doesn\u0027t matter much as the whole ball is round), and this will leave a full gap both at the bottom \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E on either side of the Navball. If I use a pair of brackets to secure the bottom of the Navball to the front panel to preserve the gap at the bottom while reintroducing rigidity, then I\u0027ll have a gap \u003Cem\u003Eall the way around\u003C/em\u003E to support rate meters on both sides, and \u003Cem\u003Ebelow\u003C/em\u003E the Navball...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can create a bezel that has a much shallower angle, and let the bottom rate of rotation meter sit at an angle that transitions well between the horizontal control panel and the near vertical instrument panel. It buys me vertical room, which makes mounting the velocity readout \u00A0easier. It also allows a much more shallow mounting angle, and could help reduce the depth of the pan required to close off the hardware on the bottom panel. Reworking the tape meter only involves re-drilling 6 holes, where the belt frame mounts to the main housing of the tape feed assembly. Those holes simply determine the angle the two assemblies sit against one another, at the point where they both attach together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully you can imagine it... No time to do a sketch up of it. At the moment, I have circuit boards to solder for work again (Thank goodness)!

As for the motor, rather than order a replacement from China, which will take forever, I\u0027ll just disassemble the gearbox from the motor, and as long as no teeth are broken, I should be able to replace the motor from one of the other ratio gearmotors I ordered (remember that I ordered the wrong ratio motor, initially, so I have a spare motor).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if it is likely recoverable, it still sucks.

Rather than take it apart to extend the legs, like I should have, I just took two different chairs, cobbled them together, and made a really low chair. It worked, for nearly 10 years... Thing is, the workbench was \u003Cem\u003Estill way too low\u003C/em\u003E. I\u0027ve always had issues with my back sitting at this thing. It was only 25 inches (63.5 cm) off the floor...\u00A0 The reason that this workbench was originally built to be so low, is It was originally used with a \u0022proto-gamerchair\u0022 that I made in the late 1990s. Back when I was in college, I ended up scrapping a car, and saved the passenger seat out of it, and made a rather comfy computer chair from it. Had it for years, and I built my computer desk around that chair. I later also built this workbench around the same chair. After a decade or so, I removed the old seat, which had then worn out pretty badly, and replaced it with a newer car seat. When I moved to the apartment a decade ago, my computer desk and workbench were no longer adjacent in the same room... I could no longer just roll the chair between the two, and this required me to set up a different seating arrangement...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was not ideal...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis year, I scrapped that car seat, and replaced the aging cushion of the replacement chair for the workbench. I\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Estill \u003C/em\u003Enot resolved the seating situation for my computer desk... Not that it exactly \u003Cem\u003Ematters\u003C/em\u003E right now, with my computer \u003Cem\u003Estill being dead\u003C/em\u003E... Thing is, I\u0027ve not gotten much of anything done at my workbench lately, and I finally realized what the issue was...\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe new cushion\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E... it was \u003Cem\u003Ejust enough\u003C/em\u003E added height, that the formerly \u003Cem\u003Eborderline\u003C/em\u003E too low workbench was now \u003Cem\u003Eharmfully \u003C/em\u003Etoo low! Every time I sat down to work, I\u0027d be just in pain even 15 minutes in. Once I realized how bad this was, I knew what needed to be done...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI jacked up my workbench, and installed leg extensions! The workbench now sits about 29 inches (73.6 cm) off the floor. It doesn\u0027t sound like much, but it really does make a huge difference! I borrowed a jack from a my father, and from a buddy of mine, and combined with my own car jack, I was able to lift the entire workbench, as it was, with all the equipment and tools left in place. I put the two smaller jacks on one side, and the larger one on the other side. With three jacks, I had three points of lift, and the workbench remained stable as could be throughout the entire process! It simply could not have gone smoother than it did, and I was\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eso dumb\u003C/em\u003E for not just doing this years ago!

Truth of the matter is, car seats \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E designed to be comfortable, even when sitting in them for long periods of time, and are made durable enough to last years. It\u0027s why I used my weird 1990s \u0022gamerchair\u0022 for so long. I\u0027m seeing a lot of comments that salvaged seats can be as little as $25-$100, and considering what commercial gamerchairs cost... and comparing the quality, this actually works well for me. I feel like if I find the right seat, I could really fine tune the overall ergonomics of this thing, and improve my comfort for long term build sessions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to my workbench, I also have a desk in my workshop. This desk has been the universal \u0022I\u0027ll deal with it later\u0022 space... And it has become terribly cluttered. Funny story... There was a box that sat on that desk since the first year I moved here... It was pushed back into the rear corner, and just sorta... took space. I finally cleared it out. Apparently it contained exactly one non local 1999-2000 phone book... That was it...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I couldn\u0027t even be mad, cause it was so absurdly silly!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U24xUeL.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/U24xUeL.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that has sat on the desk for years, pushed off to the side, was my Twentieth Anniversary Mac. It still boots up even! It\u0027s definitely in need of a recapping however, as the audio has developed a hum.\u00A0Currently, it\u0027s configured with a PowerPC G3 CPU upgrade, 128 MB RAM, and the full TV/FM tuner/capture card. These old Macs had speakers supplied by BOSE, and sounded pretty decent. I mainly used to use this for playing music. I think it\u0027d be fun restoring it... Dropping in an SSD and a network and USB card would make a world of difference. Networking can possibly be done with a USB network adapter, if I can\u0027t find the old Comm Slot II Ethernet card that this thing takes. I could also cannibalize the Comm Slot II card from another machine I have, if it comes down to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly, I am clearing off the desk because I want a large open space to actually work on large things, such as the cases for my two PC builds, vintage calculators or computers, and of course, the Kerbal Instrument panel itself. The workbench was built at a time when my primary work was making cable harnesses and soldering circuit boards. Hobby wise, I was 99% working on tiny robots and again... more circuit boards. As a result, I designed the workbench to hold electronic test equipment on a middle an upper shelf, and the main shelf has extra lighting, but also only has 7.25 inches (18.5 cm) of vertical clearance beyond the first 12 inches (30 cm) of bench depth (the bench has double that depth, but the second shelf severely limits the available vertical height beyond the first 12 inches of surface depth). This means that as I\u0027ve shifted to wanting to work on larger things, I don\u0027t actually have a good space to do so on. The side wings of the workbench are open, but they are not that large either. Clearing this desk will \u003Cem\u003Emake a world of difference\u003C/em\u003E for my ability to do large projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GIs9IyF.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GIs9IyF.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the other project occupying my time... I wanted a high resolution ultrawide monitor that I could slide and tilt and rotate to either be right in front of my face or out of the way. When I need to have schematics, diagrams, blueprints, parts lists, etc. right in my face while I work, without blocking the actual workbench below, I can slide it right in front of me. Other times, I want to be able to slide the whole thing off to the side and out of my way, for when I maybe want to have youtube videos or some kind of background content going, while I focus on my work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DohF5OZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022761\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DohF5OZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe monitor is made from a pair of iPad Retina LCD modules, and a pair of HDMI to LCD converter boards. They are mounted behind a polycarbonate panel in a simple frame made from U-channel aluminum. The total resolution is 4096x1536 (two 2048x1536 panels), and requires dual HDMI signals to drive. The tablet is my only working PC right now, and it only has one HDMI out, which is why only one side is lit at the moment.\u00A0The overall display width is about 16 inches (40.6 cm), and 6 inches (15.25 cm) tall. The bezel adds an inch to both dimensions, so the overall dimensions are\u00A017 inches (43.2 cm) wide and 7 inches (17.75 cm) tall. These dimensions are very compatible with my workbench, and permit me to see the work area without interference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did add a ventilation grill later on, because I noticed some heat being trapped by the enclosure. It wasn\u0027t extreme, but it\u0027s still good to vent it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iAlIFeK.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022741\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iAlIFeK.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI picked up a cable chain and installed a pair of long HDMI cables and a cable to carry power. I also picked up a 12v switching power supply, which will be set up on the bench to provide power to both LCD modules in the monitor, as well as LED lighting upgrades that I plan to install. The old florescent lighting causes visible banding on the rolling shutter of my phone\u0027s camera, and it makes taking pictures of my work kind of a pain. Since the LEDs will be DC, there should be no flicker and thus no more banding in photos. I haven\u0027t installed this yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rkLdX6q.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022611\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rkLdX6q.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe slide rail and the tilt/pivot were made from a closet door slide and a GoPro bicycle handlebar mount. Pretty simple, but it works!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found a local-ish supplier for Teflon washers, and used a combination of fender washers and the Teflon washers to create the slides.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe screws securing the slide rails are flush, except for the two on the end, which act as stops.

That will permit me to plug in only one power connector and have both LCD modules power up. I\u0027d also like to make an aluminum port plate to cover the bottom. I may paint the frame as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226ujRIsy.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022142.92\u0022 height=\u0022510\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6ujRIsy.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe overall construction is just layers of plastic cut out from an old Gamestop poster hanger. All the cuts were just done with an X-Acto knife and a metal ruler. I just layered the different layers together, and held it all together with screws. This part was fun to cut out. I wanted to enclose the boards and the button panels, but leave space for the ports and connections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220jjkwgF.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022136.75\u0022 height=\u0022495\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0jjkwgF.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe area with the buttons needed to be thinner, so I cut out the diffuser from an old LCD TV to close off those spaces and cover the circuit boards, while leaving the buttons accessible. I used a hole punch (the kind used to punch holes in paper) to make the button holes. Added benefit, is the LEDs on the button boards shine through the diffuser.
