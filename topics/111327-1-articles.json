A peircing call from mission control commands my attention, forcing me back into reality. One by one, I flick the red switches by the launch protocol that has been drilled in my memory, activating SAS, RCS and activating the orbital map for future reference. I report the usual \u0022Nominal\u0022 to control and they give the countdown. \u0022T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, ignition on, 4, 3, 2, 1, liftoff.\u0022 The jolt of massive boosters underneath me tugs me to the back of my seat, I grab hold of the controls and make the necessary minute changes to the navigation of the craft. I stare at the nav ball, knowing that losing track of it could mean disaster. In the corner of my eye I see my velocity climbing steadily, as well as my altitude over Kerbin. I glance at the fuel gauges for the solid boosters at first stage, see the fuel deplete, decouple, then activate the 2nd stage liquid fuel boosters. Hand still on the controls and accelerator (Though the latter was worthless for the boosters) I am told that my apoapsis will be substantial for a 100 kilometer orbit. I am then giving a node directive; accelerate 1000 m/s in T- 5 minutes. I check the controls again, making sure they are nominal, before looking out of my window to see something I thought I never would; a sunrise from space, seeing the delicate majesty and balance of the solar system. I stare there until I glance at the node counter and realize there are 30 seconds until the node arrives. I wait \u0027till 10 seconds and activate the liquid-fuel engine, feeling yet another jerk towards the back of my seat, vibrating and shaking uncontrollably. After about a minute of burn, I am told \u0022Cut acceleration, you have reached nominal velocity\u0022 by control and yank the thrust lever backward as the beads of sweat gather at my brow, trying to get the rusted stick backward. I sigh of relief when it gives in and goes back, feeling the engines deflate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Part II; Mishap \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMC chimes in and states \u0022A node has been made for t-minus 30 minutes for you to preform a Hohmann Maneuver to the moon, it will require you to gain 1400 m/s in acceleration, but we believe your 2nd stage thrusters will do.\u0022 I respond back with the usual \u0022Roger that\u0022 and turn the mighty ship with the power of monopropellant. I sit there, snooping around in the cabin containers, looking at the usual \u0022Food\u0022 and \u0022More Food\u0022 containers until I spot the \u0022Pilot Distractions\u0022 container and open it, seeing a rather remarkable assortment of cheap dollar-store items. I see a notepad and pen and grab both. I click at the pen in rhythm, wondering what I should draw. I cease the clicking and gain inspiration; I will draw the sunset of Kerbin from orbit. Curve after curve, line after line, I draw a sketch that rather does not do the majesty of space justice. But it will suffice, for now. I put the pen and paper back in the \u0022Pilot Distractions\u0022 cupboard, but hold onto my masterpiece and put it in my pocket. MC startles me by saying \u0022You are t-minus two minutes away from the node, activate thrusters A.S.A.P.\u0022 I then slowly move the accelerator forward and watch as the \u0022Pilot Distractions\u0022 cupboard flings open and spews out its contents backward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T13:49:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LavaCake\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMade a part of Part II and separated Part I and II\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
