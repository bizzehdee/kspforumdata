I am tired of updating KSP and all my mods every time there\u0027s a change from 1.0.x to 1.0.y. Alternately, I suppose I can just bite the bullet, be happy with the stable version I have now and try to ignore any new minor updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do worry about newer mods being incompatable with older versions though.

Why fix things in U4 that are to be entirely rewritten in U5? Also, this would effectively put us into beta where this game (sadly) belongs.
