I\u0027ve haven\u0027t been quite straight with you as to why though. In order to accept submissions I manually installed the 1.0.4 parts and they work fine, proof of which being the Boar. Unfortunately that means I have to manually change the version in the .craft file to 1.0.2 for KSP to allow me to load it, but it hasn\u0027t caused any problems with craft, accept yours. The craft loads without any of the BD parts or radiators (this being the normal version). I loaded the craft in 1.0.4 in order to remove the new BD part (I don\u0027t use the new update as it would render my progress on episode the worthless). This allows it to load, but as I said, it\u0027s broken. Try loading your ship in 1.0.2 after removing the new BD part, save it, and send that to me. It should hopefully fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
