So in that case most of the planets would probably be huddled up next to their star, And since the mass a brown dwarf is low the DeltaV required to get from one planet to the other would not be much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadies and gentlemen i bring you an example of mine that is still WIP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE OPLARA SYSTEM:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UtwO6kT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UtwO6kT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you guys like it, I am currently having trouble porting it to kopernicus (Mainly because 0.90 is so darn stupid that the ksc buildings glitch beyond all usable form!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E I hate how if you are unable to get the latest version the best mods will always advance farther than you and you will be left behind unable to do anything! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E ) so if anybody can help please PM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust imagine a whole star system of planet packed really close together and the DeltaV requirements to get from one to the other are tiny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut brown dwarves aren\u0027t stars.
