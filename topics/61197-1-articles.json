In fact, when I reenter atmosphere, I use to get all the fuel in the front tank, so my plane goes straightforward. But it\u0027s not happening, it wants to turn and gets stuck at a very unlikely aerodynamic way, 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA of prograde!!.

However...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your CoL might actually be in front of your CoM, even though it might look otherwise in the SPH. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Remove your landing gear and check the placement for all your fuel configs. The landing gear causes the SPH to lie about the CoM because landing gear is ignored in flight. (Unless FAR fixes this? Sorry, I don\u0027t know...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- I also say this because your chutes look pretty far forward, as if they are close to your CoM too. So if it\u0027s lying, it might be causing those problems too. Try moving your chutes back too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027ve built in very little margin on your CoM/CoL spacing, then it can still cause stability issues such as flat stalling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Try building in a little more margin and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If your CoL is low compared to your CoM, that can also cause instability even if it\u0027s behind your CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Add some dihedral, a V tail, anything like that and see if it\u0027s the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I also don\u0027t know anything about the FAR drag model, but if for some reason the nose is much draggier than the tail, it might be causing your plane to flip at high speeds. I haven\u0027t seen this problem in Stock, but the drag model is different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just watched the video again, and one more thing to think about. It looks like you have a lot of control surfaces on the back. If FAR is a good modeler of super/hypersonics, then that might also be your problem, especially if your CoM/CoL margin is small (although your SAS trim looks okay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, when you go supersonic, the Center of Lift shifts back. With such large control surfaces, you might actually be changing the location of the CoL when you try to activate at supersonic speeds. Once it goes unstable, you don\u0027t have enough control authority to get it back. You could try deactivating some of the surfaces via tweakables and see if that works.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T00:31:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1sz","CreatedById":93466,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T13:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you a lot Claw, I\u0027ll check that out moving the COM, and will post a picture of the plane soon showing COM and COL, thanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T14:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome and good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use FAR so I don\u0027t know if any of that will fix it, but hopefully it will help you stumble on the answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T15:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR: Biggest pain in the [()()()] for airplanes.

That\u0027s a big no-no in supersonics. That\u0027s why it\u0027s trying to align with the flowstream along its long axis (the wings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your brain can handle it (it\u0027s tough) google the Whitcomb Area Rule. Boiled down, it says in essence the ideal shape for a supersonic body is a long cylinder thingy with pointy ends on each side. Now, that\u0027s a model of the cross sectional area of the plane. So, to keep the cross sectional area constant across the body where the wings stick out, real world supersonic aircraft have Coke bottle shapes (the fuselage gets a smaller cross section to make up for the cross section of the wings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, go for long and skinny, not short and wide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, any excessive control inputs you make at those speeds won\u0027t help much! You don\u0027t have a lot of maneuverability in KSP until you get subsonic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: it could also be incompatibility between FAR and other mods you are using. Again, I haven\u0027t used FAR or your cockpit, so who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit again: Now that I think about it the Area Rule is about low supersonics, you are in the hypersonic range there. I never got to that point in my studies, so this is talking out of my lower extremeties, but I\u0027d agree that you may have too many control surfaces. Any small deflection is going to have big implications.
