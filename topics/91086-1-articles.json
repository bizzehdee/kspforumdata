You\u0027d be surprised how even a tiny misalignment can cause a major torque (spinning force) on your rocket. The other thing I can think of offhand is that you might\u0027ve accidentally messed up the staging order or fuel lines of the Kerbal X booster, causing asymmetric fuel drain, and thus a CoT/CoM misalignment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T20:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Haxsis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Haxsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehi guys, requesting help with my rocket, initially the game worked fine for me, now occasionally my navball seems to invert itself at times ie that orange line that points down will flip up, i have a feeling its my rocket design but i dnt know what or why and also a bigger issue, my rocket begins to spin uncontrollably wildly from about 1000 mtres after liftoff, I have no idea about this one, as am a new player to the game, i am using all stock parts no mods.. thx- Haxsis\u003Cp\u003E I HAVE SUPPLIED IMages for reference, i am using the kerbal x stock booster with a payload of my own configuration if the images dnt help\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see any images, so thats one thing..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think it maybe an issue with the load being to heavy.
