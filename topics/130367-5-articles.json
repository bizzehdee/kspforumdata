They weight about 45kg, they take up less space than a solar panel, but 1900 watts of power needs to be dissipated somewhere. You would need 636 of these per N of thrust, at a weight of 45 each adding 28600. There are thermovoltaic systems that are more efficient, but they don\u0027t last as long, you could get that down to 10000 kg per Ion N. But that orion produces 80 so thats 800,000 kg, Those 80 would produce 2000 x 636 x 80 watts of heat 101MW of heat, and thats not going to go away by passive radiation so . . . . nope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course if we are more carefree, like the Russians we can use nuclear fission. A 6kw reactor weighs 1000kg and you would need 12000kg of them for each and 80 also around a million Kg. Again more efficient than RTG but you still have a megadensity of heat to dissipate. They have a relatively high failure rate, the space watchers believe that one of them actually exploded. If you have 1000 on board you cannot risk the failure of even 1. RTG are much safer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo. . . . . . The big problem here is not the ION drives, its the energy production. Your solar panels take up about 0.7 hectacres (about an acre) for every millimeter/second of thrust, the RTGS will need more area for heat dissipation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said you have these big floppy launches laden with panels and decay-driven devices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBattery Assist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk as seen above thruster weight and surface area is not the way major problem, the thrusters could be telescoped like panels. For making a transfer, you need a pulse at AtPG of between 200 and 160 efficiently, kicking, but driving a retrospiral orbit wastes. Since near earth orbits are on the order of an hour, and you are in that ~10 to 15 % percent of the time thrusters are active and 85 to 90% of the time they recharge (50 if in low earth orbit). The other problem is that beyond 170 degrees the earth is blocking solar panels, this means more kicks with solar panels. But once a escape trajectory is achieved, power can be ramped down to energize the transfer, it can take days. So what to power productions look like with batteries. So now assuming that the density of Lithium Ion batter is 2 a liter of battery is 2kg one can achieve a nice 650Wh/L or 325 Wh/kg of battery (higher a conservative estimate), If we are using that battery .15h then they can produce 2166 kw and we only need then 32 kg of battery per N of thruster 2560kg of battery per 80N thus we are much better off stocking up on batteries than panels. This takes now our solar panel to about 0.1 hectacre per mN of thrust, but we are going to spend many orbits kicking out our space craft. So\u00A0 540 seconds at say 0.002 m/s gives us 1 m/s lol. and to break earths orbit we need to add about 7000 kicks, actuall much less because as eccentrecity grows so does time spend in the kick zone. Of Course at Mars, recharging batteries will take 3 times longer. UNfortunately if you are going to use alot of lithium Ion batteries you better have an integrated cooling system to prevent them from overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELiquid fuel Oxygen assist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can see now that adding a few dV close to earth just to get the ship away from the earths shadow is advantageous. One possibility is an ION drive LEO/HEO shuttle system, something driven by VASIMIR might pick up ships and carry them an earth radius out and then let them enjoy longer orbital periods and longer times burning, this means adding some battery weight and thruster weight. Of course VASIMR not really a prototype transport system, so for now a good kick of LfOx into say high earth orbit, then let it burn continually into escape trajectory and on to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T06:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222383804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130367\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454008453\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145373\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbonautInTraining\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, KerbonautInTraining said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHypergols are really our only option (for burns other than TMI) unless we develop long term cryo storage but them we\u0027d likely use NTR.

It makes landing possible but it undervalues the potential dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I look at ION drives as way underpotentiated, based on latest research, even what is being used is about a half as powerful and a quarter as efficient. In fact Ion drive systems are the only deep space propulsion that actually works (proven unlike the RF resonance drive) that is as underpotentiated in terms of its current use. The Nerva, for all its worth lacks testing in a repeat use scenario, its basically been tested on a single burn, not a repetitive burn scenario after the engine is idled for 2 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO lets say thrust is a tenth, and of course earth has a GM/r at minimal orbit 10 times that of kerbin, if you can break orbit in a quarter of a pass then you could break orbit in 25 passes at perigee. This lack of power has more than just inconvenience, looking at Mars entry one has to do a near perfect transfer out of earth, otherwise dV would be to high to reverse a flyby trajectory, this removes 39 day scenarios, unless alot of gas is spent on pre-SOI burning. So this basically removes ION drives from consideration from short trip scenarios, this is why I keep saying, for the technology that we currently have, a mars trip is 4 to 5 years. It gives very good reason for separating the transfer processes\u00A0 Few people, lots of supplies, a small thin craft of the design I put forward. from the landing processes/reorbit processes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may note that I went with a single person capsule and a halfweight crew supply package, it would be about the size of a cross over SUV on the inside, which means only 1 crew. The power supplies dissipate heat at the square of the radius whereas power density increases by the cube. This also has connotations, you can not scale up in 3 dimensions, a power package can get longer, not wider, which means craft take on extremely long dimensions, or excessive weight additions for radiators. So it is not smart to send crews in one big ship but many smaller ships. This can be considered an exploit, because you may note that NASA stacks the TNGs and you would have to have huge areas of TNGs running in a wide spanning lattice to power the craft without generating so much local heat as to destroy the power unit. I have a system of piping crafted now to do this, but its an exploit to launch it, because it has impractical drag, The only way to practically use TNGs is to build the lattice in space, and each unit needs to have a shield to protect the crew. Thereare are ways to do this, you can radiate the TNGs away from the capsule. If you have to bridge the TNG over several 100 meters of axial crossection, then its better to use expandable panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe undeveloped technology is to embed the TNGs into the retractable radiator, the only problem there is keeping the cool until you get into space. So the basic problem is very simple, ION is great, wheres your power supply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the basic idea of using ION power works, but my point is that its not one ship, its multiple ships to complete a mars mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot four to five years- you can use a out-of transfer window trajectory after a short thirty day Mars mission.

It\u0027s possible to do a short fifty-day mission to Mars currently- NASA makes it the baseline for a \u0022short duration\u0022 Mars Mission. Is it worth the effort of getting there in the first place? That\u0027s the real question....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n39 days is not just slightly out of the transfer window. So 40/200 is about 1/5 th. Lets see transfer from kerbin to the mun in 3 days, try to find the most efficient transfer that gets you to the Mun 3 kerbin hours compare that with the 850 dV it takes you to get in an efficient transfer. (Dont for get, to be really efficient your munar circularlization needs to be as close to periapsis as possible. Now lets make it fun, instead of using a 1g*mass thruster, lets use a 0.0001 g* mass thruster, 0.001g * mass thruster, 0.01g * mass thruster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually made a ship that did this, I cut the travel time to the mun by 80%, it used 3200 dV instead of 850, it was a tiny ship, only fuel, but in required 4 ION drives to accomplish the feat, because breaking kerbin orbit would have to be done starting way before the manuevering node. When I reached the Mun SOI, I had 16 minutes until reaching the other side and 29 minutes required to circularize, most of the fuel was actually spent slowing the craft down, it missed the periapsis circularization point by about a 2000 kilometers, required extensive negative radial burning to get a periapsis, which would not have saved any time, I would have been performing a Dawn ceres like manuever to gain orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo minimize the time to land I simply took out all the horizontal velocity and thrusted toward the Mun, the negative surface velocity at the suicide burn point to land. The total time took 2h 44min. Of the 7000U of fuel and 10500dV of fuel that I started with I had 38U and around 100 dV left at the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou guys need to sit down and actually calculate out all the dV you need to accelerate, decelerate, recircularization manuevers, etc to get to Mars. When you launch using a transfer window the planet is basically chasing the space craft, if the two planet orbits are relatively close together the craft will make a nice loop around the planet and affords a very nice window to decelerate with ION drives, if you come at the SOI at 3 or 4 times that velocity your craft is going to be heading in a strait line most of which is distal from the planets gravitational energy and therefore useless for the reverse form of the oberth effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be corrected in the game had I started decelerating short of the SOI, which I have done many time when heading to MoHo (ion drives are really good idea for inner most planets). And moho is an example where cutting corners actually can save alot of time, given that you have to power so much into the change of orbit, change of inclination, making the periapsis smaller than moho\u0027s orbit generally affords a fast intercept. But Mars is not Moho, the ion drives require alot of kW of power, the panels are not near as efficient, and Mars is far from the sun and Moho is very close to kerbol. A radical game for mars is not rational, a conservative game is however, provided the energy problem of the previous post are dealt with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222383935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130367\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454014110\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 28.1.2016 at 9:48 PM, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVASIMR has no capabilities to know right now.
