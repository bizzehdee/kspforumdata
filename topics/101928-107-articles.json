I have no words for that...\n\nThough I have (may be stupid) question. Yesterday I have tried to replace 1 docking port on my Salut station with another. Bill was on ladder of Ven Stock Revamp 1 Kerbal can (supposed to be airlock) and removed old HGR docking port - it drifted away eventually.  Then I moved my Souyz from side bit close - so Bill could grab docking port from it and attach to airlock. Grabbed ok, node attach pointer to station, everything in place, press \u0022H\u0022 - KABOOM! Docking port I was trying to attach blown away, Bill flying away rolling like Bullock in Gravity, Soyuz has its orbital module (where docking port was attached) blown away, spinning and drifting away from station, pilot (Ferlo Kerman) trying to stabilize.\n\nThe question is - are docking ports are special parts - to handle with care?"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T10:13:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, evileye.x said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The question is - are docking ports are special parts - to handle with care?\n\u003E \n\nI never had a docking port explode on its own, only when using the \u0027redock vessel\u0027 feature with \u0022Y\u0022 key, happens to me only on certain vessels.
