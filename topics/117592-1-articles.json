We also have decent estimates on co2 released from the ocean again, biological sources and volcanoes. \n\nThe oceans can absorb loads of more co2 plants also uses more then it has access to more many places. \n\nThis is pretty hard knowledge, with error margins who does not change the overall picture.\n\nThe real question is the relation between temperature and CO2 level. yes its an effect, however we also have other effects.\n\nOne weird effect on the 400.000 year graph was the stable temperature 120.000 years ago while co2 and ch4 level was falling hard. \n\nYes this can be measurement errors too but interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T16:57:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Am i missing something?\n\nNot at all. You **spotted** something.\n\nBefore I start, keep in mind that the source you provided in the original post is heavily biased, and therefore not reliable. It\u0027s a web site that\u0027s dedicated entirely to squashing global warming skepticism, and the site only appears to collect data that supports that goal. That\u0027s not how one is supposed to do science.\n\nThat said: the first problem here is that the graph showing temperature changes lagging behind CO2 changes is an approximation. We\u0027re making educated guesses at what Earth\u0027s temperatures and CO2 concentrations were in the past, via indirect methods (frequently ice cores). It\u0027s entirely possible our measurements are off.\n\nThe second problem is: people are just plain stubborn. Point out a problem with a chart, as you did in the OP, and a large number of people will refuse to listen to you, walk away in a huff, and go right on posting that chart in other threads on other web sites. Happens all the time, and not only in global warming arguments.\n\nThe third problem is much more insidious. You already snagged a piece of it when you called attention to the possibility that temperature affects CO2 levels, rather than the other way around. The argument of \u0022does CO2 affect temperature, or does temperature affect CO2?\u0022 is old hat in global warming arguments. But there are always at least **THREE** possibilities, and the third possibility has been almost entirely drowned in the vitriol people have been spewing at each other in arguments over climate science for the last forty-odd years. Here\u0027s that third possibility: **temperature and CO2 could both be caused by something else entirely.** The chart does show a correlation--but that correlation doesn\u0027t tell you what the cause is. We humans have an automatic tendency to assume it\u0027s one or the other--but what if the cause isn\u0027t on the chart?\n\nOh, and it gets better--the **fourth** possibility is that the chart is simply a flat-out lie. I\u0027ve seen more than one global warming alarmist say the following in online chat forums: \u0022so what if global warming isn\u0027t real? If people think it\u0027s real, they\u0027ll work harder to clean up the planet!\u0022 Gives a whole new meaning to the old snippet about how \u0022the truth hurts\u0022.......\n\nSo there ya have it, Arkey. Four possible explanations of what\u0027s wrong with the things. Sorry I don\u0027t have a clear and simple answer for you, but as you said in the OP, this topic is a nasty one. Gets peoples\u0027 feathers ruffled. Good fortune in your pursuit of the truth.\n\nAlrightey, folks, time for some fun!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Luckily, there are also negative feedback loops that have stopped our planet from going the way of venus\n\nI\u0027ve got a big surprise in store for you, dude. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Hang onto your potatoes!\n\nVenus isn\u0027t what you think it is. It\u0027s not a planet-size warning to Earth about what will happen if we don\u0027t all turn into Al Gores. The barbecue-grill temperatures on our sister planet are almost entirely **NOT** the result of carbon dioxide!\n\nAll forms of radiation, including heat, follow the inverse-square law: double the distance from a radiation source, and the radiation received does not get reduced to half--it gets reduced to one-fourth! Radiation received depends on exposed surface area. Hold a playing card in front of your face at varying distances, and you can see it yourself: at twice the distance, the card is half as wide and half as tall--which is one-**fourth** the surface area. Cut the distance from a radiation source in half, and you get **FOUR TIMES** as much radiation. This remains true even for radiation that goes right through you (such as gamma radiation). It may seem that your entire body is still being exposed to gamma radiation, but if you double the distance from the source, you now only have one-fourth as many gamma rays going through your body (taking that playing card and sticking pins in it would be a good analogy--at twice the distance, the card gets one-fourth as many pins).\n\nVenus is thirty percent closer to the sun than Earth is. That doesn\u0027t mean Venus gets thirty percent more heat from the Sun.....it means Venus gets twice as much. And guess what? Venus is twice as hot as Earth. The high temperatures on Venus are almost entirely the result of Venus being closer to the Sun, and its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere has very little to do with it.\n\nOh, there\u0027s more! Here\u0027s some more fun for the science wonks in here. It turns out that Venus\u0027 night side is just as hot as the day side! It\u0027s been verified via satellites landing on the planet. This is particularly impressive when you remember that a Venus day is longer than a Venus year. That\u0027s what carbon dioxide actually does.

The high temperatures on Venus are almost entirely the result of Venus being closer to the Sun, and its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere has very little to do with it.\n\nThe problem with that reasoning is that you assume that the inflow of energy is the only factor in what determines the surface temperature and it\u0027s not. The (constant) temperature is a result of an equilibrium between energy received at the surface, and energy released. When your planet \u0022loses\u0022 more energy than it receives, it cools off. When it loses less energy it heats up.\n\nDon\u0027t think the reception part is easy because it\u0027s not just thermal energy received from the sun. The inside of the planet may be hot and that might radiate (and convect) outward. A solid core might mean tectonic movement with heat resistance. And not all radiation hitting the planet is converted to heat; some of it simply bounces of (\u0022reflection\u0022) and doesn\u0027t get the chance to add heat.\n\nConversely, how much heat the planet loses is also not simple. A lot of that depends on if there\u0027s an atmosphere or not, and how good that atmosphere can retain thermal energy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s what carbon dioxide actually does. It buffers and slows temperature changes.\n\nYes... and that\u0027s exactly the problem. We\u0027re introducing more of this heat retaining gas into the atmosphere. While thermal energy IN doesn\u0027t change, we\u0027re lowering thermal energy OUT. And that... means temperature will rise."}]}
