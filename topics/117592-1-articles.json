You already snagged a piece of it when you called attention to the possibility that temperature affects CO2 levels, rather than the other way around.

But there are always at least \u003Cstrong\u003ETHREE\u003C/strong\u003E possibilities, and the third possibility has been almost entirely drowned in the vitriol people have been spewing at each other in arguments over climate science for the last forty-odd years. Here\u0027s that third possibility: \u003Cstrong\u003Etemperature and CO2 could both be caused by something else entirely.\u003C/strong\u003E The chart does show a correlation--but that correlation doesn\u0027t tell you what the cause is.

It may seem that your entire body is still being exposed to gamma radiation, but if you double the distance from the source, you now only have one-fourth as many gamma rays going through your body (taking that playing card and sticking pins in it would be a good analogy--at twice the distance, the card gets one-fourth as many pins).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is thirty percent closer to the sun than Earth is.
