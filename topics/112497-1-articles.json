Three RamJet engines on a tricoupler \u002B 6 circular air intakes as the first stage, Nuclear engine as the second stage, payload/lander as third.

The ramjet gradually increases speed; at certain point its speed starts to grow exponentially and if you stay so low it will burn you up. So, if you reach some 800m/s (point 1) start turning upwards. By the time you reach point 2 (altitude nearing 30km), your speed will reach some 1200m/s or more and you\u0027ll have quite a few overheat bars all over. That\u0027s also about when your ramjets will sputter out, and you\u0027ll need to switch to rockets (and you may dump the ramjet stage or separate the airplane). From then on, continue ascent and circularizing the orbit.

The difficulty is in getting that carrier craft into space.
