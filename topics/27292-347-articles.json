Then I usually have multiple sets of chutes as I tend to land my landers back on kerbin intact nowadays. I have one set that deploys first attached to the upper non-science section and usually set to 1k altitude deployment (current lander is X shaped with the science and command module hanging below the center of the X) then I have a double set attached to the top of the sci/command module that I activate once the lander rig set is fully deployed, the command module and other science mods also have one emergency chute each (2 on the 3 man pods) that I activate IF anything happens to the rest of the lander and/or chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave found that without a drogue chute, you have to stagger your chute deployments going into hi-grav, hi-atmos planets like EVE, otherwise you need to strut your reentry vehicle to hell and back. By staggering, I mean only open one chute at a time, wait 5-10 seconds, then open the next, once you have your speed down to around 50 it\u0027s generally safe to open the rest. Even using this method I still have suffered a 10-20% loss of landers doing a non-powered descent. And I still use parachutes on those doing a powered descent, just wait till the atmo burn is done, the power up the engines, once my speed has dropped from using the engines, then I deploy chutes, then cut the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-07T03:19:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2014 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruthgar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruthgar","CreatedById":113799,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T03:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt a few rovers that are completely separate from any type of engine system aside from RCS (useful for keeping stable when Bob suddenly sends one airborne, think he actually cleared 100 meters there on the mun) and I\u0027m glad my lander could bring two along as Bob....kinda smashed the deployable solar panels on it, and all it has left are the basic fixed panels.
