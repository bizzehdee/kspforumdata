That only resets the staging sequence for the currently loaded ship. It does not delete anything nor change any settings. Your description of the problem is incomplete. Something important is missing. From what it sounds like you must have deleted your current game.

Was running 1.2 and DID NOT want to update. Been about as far as I could get with that version. Been to Laythe but it\u0027s like a 3hr trip even using FF \u0027cause of the manual staging of the Asparagus staged Nuke engines. Have a Base \u0026amp; orbital station there. Have a station \u0026amp; 2 bases on Duna too. 2 on the Mun \u0026amp; 1 on Minmus. Could see I could never build anything big enuf to get back to orbit from Eve so I gave that up. Was going to start trying for a couple of Jool\u0027s other moons but as I said it\u0027s a Long Way \u0026amp; a Long Time to get there. Just want to fly and have some fun and not make it a Real Job trying to do anything else. Really wish I could learn to build Big stuff in Kerbin Orbit so I could launch from there and not all the way out of Kerbins gravity well but I\u0027ve yet to figure out how to do that. 1.3 looks different and I\u0027ll see what happens. If I start losing all my old ships in Re-Entry being \u0022Realistic\u0022 that I think I\u0027ll be Done with it all. I just liked it as a Game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bartman","CreatedById":100207,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-22T19:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell it looks like MechJeb is no longer working on my Old ships now so I guess I\u0027m Done with KSP, oh well, it was Fun for a few years but I guess that\u0027s it.
