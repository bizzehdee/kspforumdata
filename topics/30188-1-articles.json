While the people of Earth has reduced their carbon footprint, bring the world to the Age of Stability, on Kerbin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman, who was 50, has witnessed this problem. 20 years ago he talked of the problem of Global Warming. But that period is dominated by war, and few (if any) ever heard of Jeb talking to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis friends (correction: allies), who either heard of Jeb or witnessed Jeb lecturing, did. Bill and Bob was a long time ally of Jeb (though they have disagreements over some stuff, but that\u0027s natural), also noticed the problem. So are the few dozens who did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne day in Kurt Kerman\u0027s house, Kurt, Sidble, and Kelvis were playing video games when suddenly a hot stream of air rushed into the house.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt then broke the silence:\u0022 Guys, do you notice how hot it is than before Kerbal War II (2002~2008 A.D.)?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah,\u0022 replied Sidble, \u0022this is even hotter than before!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So I guess Jeb\u0027s right.\u0022 said Kelvis later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt and Sidble looked at Kelvis, puzzled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why are you looking at me like that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because...\u0022 said (and choked) Kurt, \u0022because... Anyway what do you mean Jeb is right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKelvis then sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kelvis?\u0022 asked Sidble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes?\u0022 replied Kelvis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean Jeb is right? What was he right about?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well...\u0022 Kelvis finally continued, \u0022this could influence you or make you laugh. Are you ready?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth Kerbal nodded in unison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright,\u0022 said Kelvis, and begin his story with eloquent words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen he was 16 (2004 A.D.), Kelvis volunteered to enter the Allied Army.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKelvis mentioned most of the not-so-interesting parts until he got to Jeb\u0027s lecture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There I was sent to Midway Island, and I was there to meet Jeb.\u0022 continued Kelvis. \u0022Jebediah Kerman is a very nice guy, and he usually entertained us by joking. But one night he didn\u0027t.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait,\u0022 asked Sidble, \u0022so is Jeb a veteran?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You can say that, kid.\u0022 replied Kelvis. \u0022That night he mentioned something so interesting, it changes my life, possibly forever.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What did they say?\u0022 the eagered Kerbals asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well,\u0022 continued Kelvis, \u0022he mentioned something like Global Warming. He talks of the factories that is polluting water and air, and other pollutions, making more people to stuggle for food and supply. He said that if pollution doesn\u0027t get reduced to a resonable amount, the world would face a great period of badness and if not treated on time, would be irreversible.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wow, interesting.\u0022 said Kurt. \u0022Continue.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s it,\u0022 sighed Kelvis, eyes blinking at the 2 Kerbals, \u0022I never got into much detail, but that sentence I\u0027ve remembered for the duration of the war and beyond.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If you want more, ask Jeb. I don\u0027t think being 50 would means that he has forgotten everything. You should-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, alright,\u0022 interjected the impatient Kurt, \u0022can we see Jeb?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh sure, he\u0027s probably in his office somewhere.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let\u0027s go then.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the three left Kurt\u0027s house, heading to Kerbal Space Center, already forgotten the ferocious heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Kerbal\u0027s office, at Kerbal Space Center, they found Jeb watching news.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sigh,\u0022 sighed Jeb, \u0022those people keep giving reports, but they keep giving false causes and that it won\u0027t affect the world. I\u0027m telling you, if no one is doing something, Kerbin is destined to lose all of her inhabitants.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why doesn\u0027t the government doing something?\u0022 asked Sidble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s the jig. The government aren\u0027t sending people to investigate. All informations came from external source, from those who knew nothing about Global Warming.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hun,\u0022 said Kurt, \u0022even at 50 you are still intelligent. By the way what do you mean Global Warming?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Global Warming is caused by something you can\u0027t see, produced by something you can see.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s the something, then?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The something is called Carbon Dioxide (CO2). It is produced by factories, burning non-renewable resources excluding natural gas, and cars that uses high-emission gasoline. Right now most of the Kerbals around the world use coal to warm up their house, work at skyscrapers and factories that emit high amount of CO2, drive cars that emits high pollution, and at lease 1 people are on each car! While we are living in solar-powered and wind-powered houses, drive cars that run on solar power and uses energy efficiently, work in a green (by environment, not color) workplace, and carpooling everyday! Can you see the difference between our carbon footprint and everyone else?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yup, and almost no one cared about it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Technically we are not alone.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who are the others?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thousands of people around us, mostly space center crew, and our friends, thought of this problem. I heard from a neighbor that he is trying to get the neighborhood to sign up a petition that would make the government to solve this problem. Democracy, guys.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So are things getting good?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not quite. The petition got to 24,376 when someone that claimed to be from the government decided to mess this campaign up. He resigned after this, of course. But the campaign seemed to be messed already: the damage is done. We now have to restart this petition.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are there other ways?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know, I guess we\u0027ll find it. But if the petition doesn\u0027t work, we gotta think about something. So no matter what, we need a backup plan. Meet me near the launch pad tomorrow at 12 P.M. Dismissed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater back at Kurt\u0027s house.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So,\u0022 said Kurt, \u0022is that about it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t think so,\u0022 said Kelvis, \u0022Jeb also mentioned that when the world\u0027s average temperature reaches 60 degrees celsius, the worst place would burn and it could spread into a conflagration, and it would be impossible to put the fire out. This, in turn, would eliminate all life forms except bacteria on Kerbin. We gotta do something!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait, do you think planting trees could help?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s one way, but it is the government that is holding things now, not us. Still, if we could solve it...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then the world would be saved! Right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No,\u0022 answered Sidble, who remained mute before, \u0022that is only a temporary solution, we need to undergo a period of which all ways of reducing CO2 to a resonable level, and the rate into a stable level, in order to eliminate all types of global warming.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So I guess this is hard, then.\u0022 replied Kurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You can say that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You heard Jeb,\u0022 said Kelvis later, \u0022meet him near the launch pad at 12.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Got it. Dismissed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt night, at Sidble\u0027s house, Sidble dreamed a world that would lead to disaster. He dreamed himself on a planet burning, and he had no places to go. When the fire have caught him, he immediately woke up. \u003Cem\u003EHoly crap,\u003C/em\u003E he thought, \u003Cem\u003Emaybe everyone should focus this even more now.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the night he felt restless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo Be Continued...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s the prologue.
