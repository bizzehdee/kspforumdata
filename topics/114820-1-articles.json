However, when you\u0027re coming in from another planet, the game doesn\u0027t slow down time warp and allows your craft to crash into Kerbin. IMO, this is a bug that needs to be fixed."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:27:33Z","Content":"How fast were you warping? The game applies a brake to warp if you\u0027re at 1000x or less, but not at 10kx and above. Although, now that passing through atmospheres can kill you, I don\u0027t recommend contacting air at more than 100x just so your ship is pointed more or less the right way to survie."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:45:37Z","Content":"Yeah you gotta slow down manually. I personally use KAC and set a periapsis alarm with a 5 minute margin. Or drop a maneuver node near the periapsis and warp to it."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T04:16:21Z","Content":"This is a known problem which, unfortunately, has not been resolved yet.
