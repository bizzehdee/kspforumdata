Still some testing to do and 1.0 to verify against, but I thought I\u0027d share some images of the changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the Resource selection window (Manifest Window) looks pretty much the same with some minor changes in details to account for multiple resources. You cannot select Crew, Science, or ElectricCharge with anything else. So these will cause the other selections to be deselected when clicked. As before, resources are a toggle, so clicking on a previously selected resource deselects it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow any other resource may be combined with another. maximum 2 resources. Since I cannot possibly know all the possible fuel / oxidizer combinations, I left it up to the user to select their choices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aolE3lm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aolE3lm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, Transfer Window: This now uses the same button toggle method as in the Manifest Window. You can select any number of parts in the source or the target. It is smart, in that if you select a part in the source, it is now greyed out in the target. (we can\u0027t move a resource from/to the same part.. heh). This will make choosing your destination parts easier I think. in the details, when multiple parts are selected, the total amount of resource for each resource will be displayed and the amount remaining in all parts selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then calculate the maximum amount of the largest capacity resource to use as a basis for display. I only show the largest resource for editing in the text box. I struggled with whether to allow editing of both, but real estate simply did not allow it, and since I calculate the ratio based on the target tanks, one number is sufficient. The resource slider will control the largest resource, and the smaller resource is calculated, based on the amount selected in the interface. If you want better control, move only one resource at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculated ratio is the total capacity of the selected parts, and the selected Resources. So, if you have a total capacity of 8000 Oxidizer, and 6000 Fuel, the ratio will be: 6000/8000, or 0.75, which is used to multiply against the larger number to arrive at the smaller number to transfer. It will be up to you to be sure your ratios are correct for your engine needs if you use non stock fuels and parts. Since you likely do this anyway for your ship design, this method should work fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W1uYmhz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W1uYmhz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMulti part, multi resource xfer in progress below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nbudphN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nbudphN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll keep you posted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T19:41:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP 1.0.0 update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip manifest version 4.1.4.4 works in KSP 1.0.0.

There is a reference ID for the vessel they once were a part of when detached and free floating. if the payload has no command/control, then it is usually identified as debris after being detached in game and until it is attached to another vessel. Question is, does it lose the id of its old parent vessel when detached, and take on the id of the new vessel?
