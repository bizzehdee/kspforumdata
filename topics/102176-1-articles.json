If password is leaked, you can still check if the person entering the password is the person with authorization for access through biometric and other means. Never depend on one layer of security if you want to be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiometrics takes a lot more effort to be faked too, especially for advanced scan like retina scan. It is not easy, even if you have all the information for the vein patterns, to replicate an eye with all the complex systems of extremely small capillaries that is in a person eye (don\u0027t believe the hollywood trick of using a contact lens, the scan doesn\u0027t work that way). Advanced system also require you to be scanned for a few seconds to detect blood flow, so that it knows if a dead body part is being used, even.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when you coupled that with a physical key card and a password, your security is pretty tight, and it would require a really determined infiltrator to get in such places. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, we are getting way off topic. The context of security being talked about here is home security. Which means less important data and information, and much, much less determined attackers. Usually your cousin/niece would just give up with another layer of security by just having to swipe your finger there along with a password, they are not going to bother faking the print, even in the unlikely case of they having the means to do so. Try an USB key too and no one will bother.
