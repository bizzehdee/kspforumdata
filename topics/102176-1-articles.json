This post is making the assertion that they shall offer \u0027*enterprise-grade security that will meet the requirements of organizations with some of the strictest requirements and regulations\u0027,* using in some cases existing hardware.

From my reading of the article, it sounded like it was going to be workable on preexisting hardware, which would mean that they would get a lot of not so high end readers.

If password is leaked, you can still check if the person entering the password is the person with authorization for access through biometric and other means. Never depend on one layer of security if you want to be safe.\n\nBiometrics takes a lot more effort to be faked too, especially for advanced scan like retina scan. It is not easy, even if you have all the information for the vein patterns, to replicate an eye with all the complex systems of extremely small capillaries that is in a person eye (don\u0027t believe the hollywood trick of using a contact lens, the scan doesn\u0027t work that way). Advanced system also require you to be scanned for a few seconds to detect blood flow, so that it knows if a dead body part is being used, even.\n\nAnd when you coupled that with a physical key card and a password, your security is pretty tight, and it would require a really determined infiltrator to get in such places. \n\nThough, we are getting way off topic. The context of security being talked about here is home security. Which means less important data and information, and much, much less determined attackers. Usually your cousin/niece would just give up with another layer of security by just having to swipe your finger there along with a password, they are not going to bother faking the print, even in the unlikely case of they having the means to do so. Try an USB key too and no one will bother.

Let say someone make an virus who grab the fingerprint signatures on a popular device like an macbook and send them to you, you can not uses another hacked phone to inject this data into the driver and send it.\n\nNow apple has a problem, if its impossible to reprogram the reader so it sends other data the authorization is broken for good, you can as you say not change fingerprints, you could change the software so the old drivers don\u0027t send valid data anymore however if someone hack it they can use all the old fingerprint data again. \n\nHowever the problem here is popular computers with popular os, windows is far more popular but also has lots of laptops with various readers.\n\nUsing it to unlock an phone or pc locally is another issue, here its no mass penetration, having your fingerprint don\u0027t help unless you go trough an complicated process, simpler to just use the hard drive or replace it with an blank."}]}
