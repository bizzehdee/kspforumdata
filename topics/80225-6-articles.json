If you recover a hangar with some \u003Cstrong\u003Estored\u003C/strong\u003E vessels (i.e. they are invisible and appear in the list in the GUI), their cost is just added to the cost of the hangar, so they themselves are not, technically speaking, recovered, just their costs. On the other hand, if some vessel is just positioned inside the hangar (e.g. you drove your rover into the inactive ground hangar and left it there) and then you recover the hangar, positioned vessel is not recovered; the hangar just disappears from beneath. Maybe the vessel that was left was not stored, just located inside the hangar?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T00:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to rerun the test to be sure, I didn\u0027t have time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hangar was still on the runway when I launched from the SPH, to be clear.

Because what you describe is what was happening before v1.1.1; I\u0027ve just checked the version of .dll from the v1.1.1.1 zip from GitHub, and it is the new version with the workaround. I will check the behavior myself on Sunday, when I return home.

I\u0027m running kspapiextensions as well as Infernal Robotics and Mulitwheels7. I haven\u0027t used module manager yet, and I am terribly clueless on how to use it in this scenario. I have unpacked the folder into my GameData folder like everything else, when I start KSP I can see it loading the files from the Hangar folder, and Module Manager comes up on my loading screen. I then continue to my sandbox mode only to not find any new parts either in SPH or VAB. Any suggestions? Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
