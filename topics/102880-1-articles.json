I went the \u0022I had a dream to walk on the Mun\u0022 route, but for some reason that didn\u0027t seem Jeb-ish. I tried extending his personality currently to back then, which seemed to turn him into an arrogant blockhead, (\u0022I started KSC to serve as my personal thing\u0022) and I didn\u0027t want that either. So I need help. What in your eyes motivated Jeb to start KSC?

Being trusted by the space program for his cooperation, Jebediah is accepted in as a recruit.

Bob had been selected to become the first Kerbal in space, but got cold feet at the very last moment. Terrified of the rocket and the general idea of going to space, he asked his friend Jeb to do it for him - which worked because all Kerbals look exactly the same.\n\nJeb agreed, adorably oblivious to the potential danger. The rocket blasted off into the sky, and no one noticed anything unusual until he had already reached orbit and happily exclaimed that he could see \u0022Bob\u0027s house\u0022 from his window. He had not received any training whatsoever and was immediately ordered to return to Kerbin with the help of a few instructions that were sent to him through the on-board fax machine.\n\nTo everyone\u0027s surprise, Jeb\u0027s capsule landed intact in the ocean outside the KSC, and he could be rescued and taken in for questioning without any trouble. However, no one ever found out what Bob had done, because all Jeb would talk about was how he wanted to do it again.\n\nSince the space program was new and they were short on qualified pilots anyway, Jeb was offered a job there on the very next day."}]}
