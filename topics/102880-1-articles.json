I went the \u0022I had a dream to walk on the Mun\u0022 route, but for some reason that didn\u0027t seem Jeb-ish. I tried extending his personality currently to back then, which seemed to turn him into an arrogant blockhead, (\u0022I started KSC to serve as my personal thing\u0022) and I didn\u0027t want that either. So I need help. What in your eyes motivated Jeb to start KSC?

The rocket blasted off into the sky, and no one noticed anything unusual until he had already reached orbit and happily exclaimed that he could see \u0022Bob\u0027s house\u0022 from his window. He had not received any training whatsoever and was immediately ordered to return to Kerbin with the help of a few instructions that were sent to him through the on-board fax machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo everyone\u0027s surprise, Jeb\u0027s capsule landed intact in the ocean outside the KSC, and he could be rescued and taken in for questioning without any trouble.
