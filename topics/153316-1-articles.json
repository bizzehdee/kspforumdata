To me, even though I grew up in the age of the prequels, I still think that the original three movies are the first. However, I still wonder what everyone else\u0027s opinion is on the order to them.

So, I come home from work one day, and I notice that my sons (who were 7 and 5 at the time) have brought a stack of Star Wars books home from the library. I immediately confiscate them. My wife thinks I\u0027m overreacting, but I\u0027m all, \u0022There might be spoilers in here!\u0022 Thankfully there weren\u0027t, but that started me thinking. Then, that Christmas, my mom treats us all to tickets to Legoland. As we\u0027re walking down the walkways in their Star Wars section, they have life-sized Lego figures of each of the characters with biographical plaques underneath each one. That go into great detail. About things like their parentage. \u0022Oh, my goodness, kids.

So I went out and bought the Star Wars Blu-Rays. And a Blu-Ray player, since I had never actually bought a Blu-Ray disc before. And we watched them, one each Saturday night, in Machete Order. It was awesome. When they saw the end of Empire, their jaws were on the floor, because they had no clue it was coming. I asked them what they thought afterwards, and they said, \u0022He\u0027s lying!\u0022 I remember thinking that. The really funny part was all that week they were pestering me to watch the next movie, they were just dying because they wanted answers. I was all, \u0022You think you\u0027re dying because you have to wait one week for answers?
