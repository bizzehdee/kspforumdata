reusable\u00A0lander instead of taking the ITS all the way from LEO to the surface of Mars, and back again, each mission. \u00A0This way the ITS won\u0027t need to carry enough fuel to both make it to Low Mars Orbit from the surface AND return to Earth in a single stage (the lander should carry crew down to the surface on each trip, and fuel back up to the ITS. \u00A0Possibly these two functions could be seperated into different specialized landers for each task to obtain greater efficiency.) \u00A0The lander or landers would transfer fuel to the ITS after each ascent, in a similar manner to the tanker refueling the ITS in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from reducing the Delta-V the ITS needs to carry and\u00A0allowing the ITS to avoid the need to carry as much heatshielding \u00A0(the presentation by Musk shows that the most difficult re-entry with the most maximum G\u0027s will actually be on Mars, not Earth) this also benefits from the fact that smaller vessels have lower ballistic coefficients due to the Square-Cube Law (so the lander should experience fewer maximum G\u0027s during Mars re-entry), and avoids the need to accelerate any empty tank-mass (originally used to hold the fuel for Mars ascent)\u00A0from Low Mars Orbit back to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) \u00A0Send the cargo seperately from the crew. \u00A0This will allow them to\u00A0to shrink the MCT and use\u00A0a smaller booster instead of a 42-engine behemoth, thus increasing their\u00A0launch-volume. \u00A0The closer you get to mass-producing your rockets and keeping your launchpads in constant use, the better your economics...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) \u00A0Send the cargo a transfer-window ahead of the crew, on a slower trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know the ITS\u00A0is already capable of a minimum of 5.4 km/s in order to finish its orbital insertion after booster separation, and most estimates put the transfer trajectory at about 6 km/s based on the 3-5 month table in Elon\u0027s presentation, plus they must have\u00A0additional Delta-V for orbital circularization after aerocapture ,and landing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the determining\u00A0factor on the size of the spacecraft fuel tanks is the Delta-V needed for Mars insertion, capture, and landing- not for initial LEO insertion... \u00A0This means that if you developed a cargo-only variant of the ITS you could increase its payload, and send it on a slower transfer (we already know the launch stage is capable of handling a heavier upper stage than the crewed ITS, since the tanker variant weighs about 25 tons more on the launchpad...) since you wouldn\u0027t need as much Delta-V for TMI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe slowest Mars transfers\u00A0possible take about 16-18 months and 3.1 km/s (minus gravity-assists from the Moon), so there\u0027s certainly room in the Delta-V budget for extra cargo, especially if you\u0027re willing to not return the cargo-only ITS to Earth for reloading until the NEXT transfer-window (transfer windows come every 26 months, \u00A0so otherwise you probably wouldn\u0027t want to take longer than about 7-8\u00A0months getting to Mars\u00A0so you\u0027d have plenty of time to unload cargo, head back to Earth a good\u00A0bit past the transfer-window, and load more cargo before the next transfer window...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor newcomers to conversation, the first 3 items of

class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(4) \u00A0Instead of designing the ITS as a Mars transit vehicle that is responsible for supporting the crew all the way to the surface of Mars (or LMO if a dedicated lander were utilized instead of the plan Musk presented), design it as an interceptor-ship to meet up with an Aldrin\u00A0Cycler Ship to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design for a good\u00A0interceptor is basically the same- a big spacecraft with a lot of Delta-V and a large crew capacity, which you can get to LEO by using it as its own upper-stage stage and refueling it in LEO before proceeding further. \u00A0 But instead of carrying lots of\u00A0living space for each crew member sufficient to last months, it should pack the crew in like sardines and only have enough life support for a few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Cycler ship swings by Earth, the interceptor ship would speed up to match velocity, and should easily be able to rendezvous within a few hours (although stretching that out to closer to 24 might reduce fuel consumption).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew would then transfer over to the Cycler Ship (which would be about the mass\u00A0of the current ITS on the launchpad, but with slightly\u00A0more of that mass dedicated to crew accommodations and life support,\u00A0since it wouldn\u0027t need a heatshield or landing equipment, and it takes about the same mass to reach a Cycler Orbit as it does to make a 3-5 month transfer to Mars. \u00A0In fact, Musk may have selected the current trajectory-time for the ITS since it is almost exactly right to turn into a Cycler Orbit with a small course-correction and make a free return to Earth as a possible emergency abort-option...) and remain on the Cycler until shortly before passing by Mars. \u00A0At this point, they would board the interceptor again, and make a course-correction to aerocapture at Mars...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn interceptor-ship version of the ITS would obviously be a lot lighter than the current ITS due to its much more draconian crew accommodations. \u00A0The extra mass freed up that the booster is capable of lifting\u00A0could be used in a variety of ways, but the most useful to me would seem to be launching with full,\u00A0somewhat\u00A0larger fuel tanks (in its current form, the ITS launches with only a partial fuel-load,\u00A0since it would be too heavy for the booster if it launched fully-fueled).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would mean the ITS would reach orbit with fuel to spare, and reduce the number of tanker launches necessary to fully refuel it for its Mars injection-\u00A0thus saving money. \u00A0I would advocate shrinking the booster and fuel tanks and sticking with the current strategy of partially-loading and completely refueling instead, but the booster ought to be kept its current size to allow for the Cycler Ship to launch atop it the same way the ITS would (as the Cycler Ship would require about the same booster nominal capacity\u00A0as the current ITS, though the redesigned ITS would have a lower dry mass...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transit-time to Mars on a Cycler Orbit is 146 days- almost *exactly* the same voyage and Delta-V as the 3-5 month journey the ITS is designed for. \u00A0In fact, when the Earth-Mars distance is such that the current ITS would make a 5-month journey, the only real difference between the current ITS trajectory and that of a Cycler Ship is that you intentionally miss Mars by a bit, so that its gravity doesn\u0027t change your orbital period too much...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, a Cycler Ship only needs to support crew for 5 months (the short leg of its orbit). \u00A0So the necessary crew accommodations\u00A0would be almost identical to the current ITS- except that not needing a heatshield or to carry any fuel aboard for a Mars capture or surface landing would give you a bit more mass to play around with for things like better radiation-shielding, a small greenhouse to reduce the demands on the life-support system and provide fresh food to improve crew morale, solar sails to reduce fuel consumption needed\u00A0for\u00A0station-keeping and small course-corrections, and even MORE crew living-space than you find in

a bit, remove the heatshield, lughten the structural reinforcement needed for re-entry and landing, and rededicate that mass to other things- but they wouldn\u0027t have to), and design another

of the 450-ton payload capacity, 100-man, 350 tons cargo\u00A0ITS he proposed, and it costs $10 million to refuel and refurbish the ITS each time it lands back on Earth, and refuel it again in LEO

9600\u00A0people and 33600 tons of cargo to Mars, vs. $1390 million for the Cycler design, which transports 9600 people and 0 tons of cargo to Mars. \u00A0That means you cut $4610 million off the cost, but lose 33600 tons of cargo capacity. \u00A0However you should be able to send cargo-only ITS\u0027s with a minimum of 450 tons of cargo each launch, and probably about 500 tons if you rely on a slower transfer-trajectory for cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, let\u0027s say you conduct a series of launches of cargo-only ITS\u0027s. \u00A0This should cost you about $750 million for each 12 launches ($640 million to build each ITS, $110 million to refuel and refurbish it each subsequent transfer-window), but place 6000 tons of cargo on the Martian surface over the 12-reuse lifetime of each ITS with a 500-ton capacity to Mars for each cargo-only mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning you need 6\u00A0of them to place 36000 tons if cargo on the surface, at an additional cost of $4500 million. \u00A0So,\u00A0you saved about $110\u00A0million (1.8%)\u00A0on the cost of your mission,\u00A0and sent 2400 (7.14% more) additional tons of cargo to the Martian surface. \u00A0These aren\u0027t exactly enormous margins vs. the plan Musk proposed, but it\u0027s a small improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does appear, however, that a Cycler ship design variant only makes sense if you strip ALL the cargo from the Interceptor and send it on slower cargo-only ITS\u0027s. \u00A0This is because the\u00A0Cycler Ship only benefits the crew\u00A0you can bring to Mars with each ITS, the cargo doesn\u0027t benefit in any way. \u00A0So, you will need to develop 3 closely-related variants of the ITS instead of one for a cost of under\u00A0$110 million.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not a lot of money to play with for extra R\u0026amp;D, and less when you consider that over 24 years (the lifetime of each ITS, and time period over which you save $110 million- at a rate of $10 million each transfer-window after the first) any money you spend up front essentially accrues capital costs of around 5% a year- meaning you only ACTUALLY have around $50 million to play around with in extra R\u0026amp;D (compare that to an estimated $10 billion R\u0026amp;D budget for the ITS), and whatever you don\u0027t spend constitutes

I like Northstar\u0027s idea of simply using abother ITS and that may be how it ends up, but I firmily believe that eventiually a dedicated ship(s) could be developed for greater capacity and safety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T01:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222781856\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475274143\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CatastrophicFailure\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou really can\u0027t say this definitively, giving that no one has yet \u003Ci\u003Etried\u003C/i\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou missed a point: the regolith is rich in perchlorate salts.
