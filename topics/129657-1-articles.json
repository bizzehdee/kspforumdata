I seem to have created ghost mountains in KSP. My ship was on route to the Mun and it was some ways above Kerbin when I saw this. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a glitch. Those are the mountains in the middle of the continent opposite the one KSC is on. The rest of Kerbin looks fine.

Some features are hard-coded in, such as the large-scale arrangements of continents and biomes, but filling in the details would consume an absurd amount of storage space. Thus, things like mountains, rocks, and trees are placed via an algorithm which generates pseudorandom numbers based on the local conditions (e.g. makes cacti in a desert or makes hills in a grassland).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBu nobody needs to see little rocks and cacti from Eeloo. Plus, the terrain generator, as far as I can tell, only bothers with one planet or moon at a time. So if you go to the Mun, Eeloo, or wherever, the terrain engine shuts off for Kerbin (or wherever you were last). In order to not look ugly, it has apparently been coded to \u0022fade out\u0022 and reduce its opacity based on altitude and gradually reveal the simplified planet sphere. Ideally this doesn\u0027t occur until you\u0027re so far away that you can\u0027t tell (because mountains would only be one pixel tall), but performance constraints meant that SQUAD had to make it fade out a lot closer. Thus if you keep a sharp eye on the horizon, you\u0027ll often see artifacts such as this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is that this is not (knock on wood) the Kraken! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Oh, who am I kidding - this is the KSP forum.
