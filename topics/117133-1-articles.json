Likely covered with soil. BIG structures. 10m? Way bigger. Sleeps 100 kerbals 2-3 to an apartment or something, where each apt is maybe 40 m^2 in KSP. That\u0027s a 10m part for every other kerbal, just for habitation ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nConcrete (lunar and martian) have both been tested using simulants (I\u0027ve worked with some of the guys doing that at Los Alamos in the past). Guys are messing with 3d printing (basically stabilizing soils with built in place retainers).\n\nThe nice thing about such structures in KSP is that they would be covered with soils, and pretty easy to model---only a few places with a view need to be modeled as IVAs (assuming you want IVAs). Another possibility would to be able to have variant KSCs, where each is unique to the others (in terms of capabilities).\n\nI imagine putting out a building/facility using a huge \u0022construction\u0022 rover part in a way similar to taking a part out of KIS. You drag it to the surface, and slide it around. Maybe it looks for \u0022flat\u0022 under the template, then turns green. You rotate it with q/e as you\u0027d expect, and maybe another key swaps between available designs (for variability in appearance). Place it like KIS/KAS with X, and it starts building.\n\n(edit) to be clear, you\u0027d first need to land XXXX tons of \u0022construction supplies\u0022 and perhaps have local ISRU in place at some level, etc, etc. to unlock this capability, and what size things you can place would depend on the available resources.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T16:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T15:37:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Really depends on your thoughts as to what colonization is.\n\u003E For example, you do have the CivPop mod which has some very large nifty ones that fit late-game stuff (and there are similar MKS ones on the books in the 5m/10m form factor).

If the KSC looked like the sort of place where kerbals lived like ants in a hive, then it might make sense. They seem to build stuff that looks rather a lot like we have on Earth, so I\u0027d expect real colonies to have to have apartments for kerbals. The greenhouses could also be parks for them to have common areas to walk around. Obviously things would always start small, then grown, but a small colony (vs a base) in my mind would be as big as KSC. \n\nA colony is people/kerbals being born, and living their entire lives there. I see anything meeting that standard as being akin to an O\u0027Neil colony (landed or not).\n\nI think it\u0027s beyond the scope of KSP 1.X, but I think it would be awesome for KSP 2.X (which I would pay for)."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T16:41:45Z","Content":"Well I meant more in the context of what mods were available, and what the OP was looking for."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T16:57:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well I meant more in the context of what mods were available, and what the OP was looking for.\n\nYeah, I was way off topic.
