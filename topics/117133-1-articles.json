Another possibility would to be able to have variant KSCs, where each is unique to the others (in terms of capabilities).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine putting out a building/facility using a huge \u0022construction\u0022 rover part in a way similar to taking a part out of KIS.

If the KSC looked like the sort of place where kerbals lived like ants in a hive, then it might make sense. They seem to build stuff that looks rather a lot like we have on Earth, so I\u0027d expect real colonies to have to have apartments for kerbals. The greenhouses could also be parks for them to have common areas to walk around. Obviously things would always start small, then grown, but a small colony (vs a base) in my mind would be as big as KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA colony is people/kerbals being born, and living their entire lives there.
