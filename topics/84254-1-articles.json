It was a few nose cones that contained fuel. It may have been a part of another mod, but was not the spherical and toroidal fuel tanks mod. The one that was the larger tank, that would go onto the Rockomax Jumbo orange tank for instance, was grey in color, with a slight dorsal ridge on the texture as well as a circle at the top, and the texture showed a few dents, scratches. the one for the smaller diameter tanks and boosters (sorry I don\u0027t know the meter standards of the different tanks off the top of my head!) was just a white hemisphere with a grey ridge at the bottom. It looked almost like one half of the Stratus-V Roundified Monopropellant tanks. I spent an hour and couldn\u0027t find it...cant for the life of me remember what the heck to even search for. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiagobs","CreatedById":76021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T07:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod, maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69539-0-23-Stockalike-parts-for-useful-esthetics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69539-0-23-Stockalike-parts-for-useful-esthetics\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vladthemad","CreatedById":100533,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T15:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES!
