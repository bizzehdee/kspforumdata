There is a mod that works, and fills the role (though with some limitations, as noted in previous posts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the features and plans, however, we all can see that Multiplayer KSP (WOOT!) is a planned feature. Now, in multiplayer, this sort of system would be much more important. Not all spacecraft belong to the player, and, as of yet, we don\u0027t know how they will interact. Regardless of how they will interact, however, if two player\u0027s spacecraft will be sharing the same area, knowing orientation, direction of travel, etc, will be vital. Imagine the rage of two players that put up multi-hundred ton payloads, only to have them collide in orbit, because they couldn\u0027t tell which direction the other player was travelling.
