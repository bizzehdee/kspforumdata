There is only a \\*tiny\\* bit of thrust vectoring in the pitch axis (about five degrees maximum) which might be pushing the craft to critical AoAs. I usually don\u0027t use thrust vectoring on a lot of my aircraft since I\u0027m not very interested in making supermanuverable planes (I like building planes like they\u0027re from the 50\u0027s to the 80\u0027s), so I might also lock the vectoring on the plane I\u0027m working on.\n\nOn the sideslip, I never use the rudder while turning unless it\u0027s some sub par \u0027light\u0027 fighters I\u0027ve made early in my save. Though after adding variable camber wings (more on that later), I did seem to notice a slideslip effect during turning where the nose yaws upwards about ~3-4 degrees. It could be different deflections on the flaps/slats, but I would need to dive into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E code and make it show current deflection on the right click menu.\n\nOn the 1.2 version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E (Not sure if you\u0027re asking me specifically), I\u0027m not using it. I bit the bullet and decided to stay with 1.1.3 instead. I know there\u0027s a pull on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E github page, but I have no idea how to get either the source or the compiled libraries.

The swept wings your design exhibits can also induce asymmetric stalls due to tip stalling.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*very interesting and useful things that you should definitely read yourself\\*\n\u003E \n\nActually, It seems like I missed a decimal point. It\u0027s actually 0.15t/m\u00B2 with a mass of ~10.51t and ~69.10m\u00B2 of reference wing area. I keep an excel file with all the masses and wing areas of all my planes and it calculates the wing loadings for me. The most lightly loaded plane I have has a wing loading of 0.12t/m\u00B2 and effortlessly turns around and shreds everything with its two 20mm guns.\n\nWing rakes, fences and vortex generators, while very good in real life, don\u0027t look like they\u0027ll work as effectively in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. I don\u0027t think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E models wind vortices yet (If an update adds that, I would kill to get it, it would literally change everything). I added both leading edge slats and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E activated flaps on the wings and made them taper off a bit more at the end. I feel like the tapering of the wings did very well to improve turn characteristics overall, but I can\u0027t solidly confirm that. Though the variable camber wing (made possible by slats/flaps) were a different story. I don\u0027t know if adding variable camber either restricted the plane from pitching up into its critical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E or increased wing lift, but it definitely did something that stopped the plane from pitching up into its doom. \n\nBesides the odd \u0027slideslip\u0027 effect I mentioned earlier, the variable camber did it. I\u0027ve tried \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E activated leading edge slats before, but I never tweaked them enough to make them really work until now. [Here\u0027s the (partially) variable camber in flight.](http://i.imgur.com/TXvPJa5.png) I also added variable camber to the wings of that 0.12t/m\u00B2 I mentioned, and it added a lot more turn stability while keeping roughly the same turn (rate?).

What is happening is the early wheels are so weak that even the lightest aircraft will cause them to build up \u0022stress\u0022 and lose lateral traction. You can turn off auto friction control and turn it all the way up to max and it will solve the problem, but if you try to steer at all you will spin out wildly. The fixed landing gear do not work at all and cannot be used. The first retractable wheel only works for very small craft. The only way I found to fix it is to either modify the wheels\u0027 files and quadruple the stress tolerances, or cheat and get the later models. Both will solve the problem.\n\nIf you are not running 1.1.3, here are some fixes that I know work from experience:\n\n1) Go into the rotate function in the editor, turn on angle snapping, and drag the rotate wheel a little bit in both planes. The gear should still face the same way, though. This forces the gear to snap exactly into alignment (you should see a little movement when you first rotate the wheel), and may solve your swerving issue.\n\n2) Attach a strut to the gear pieces from a central fuselage piece.\n\n3) make sure your gear are attached as firmly as possible, preferably to a fuselage piece. If the gear flex and change orientation even a little bit it can throw the aircraft into a spin.\n\nBeyond that, I can\u0027t help.

On each wing there are 4 pairs of split elevons - that is two elevons stacked on top of each-other. The elevons are set to \u002B/-100% yaw (-100 top/\u002B100 bottom) with full ctrl deflection and ~30% roll. I tried using a M-form for the wings but that didn\u0027t look as nice, although I did experience less roll-pitch coupling.\n\n**How do you fly it?**  \n\nCarefully. Immediately after take-off set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde and never ever turn it off. Minimum take-off speed is around 60m/s. For landing use airbrakes and reverse thrust and touch down at less than 80m/s. The plane suffers from some buffeting due to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, but you can manually counter that. It does have some inertia coupling so it\u0027s best to roll, wait, and then pitch. Other than that this is actually flyable and ~~stable~~ even at transonic speed (tested up to mach 1.05). ***No warranty!***\n\nGet it here [https://kerbalx.com/capnrotbart/V-Wing-Y5](https://kerbalx.com/capnrotbart/V-Wing-Y5)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-14T15:12:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2017 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CapnRotbart**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-14T18:42:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, Rodhern said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hello Drew Kerman.

Not sure how much that matters concerning stalls, but it does definitely matter concerning sideslip stability for swept wing aircraft ( especially forward-swept ones ).  \n\n\\* If the craft is rotating around the yaw axis the inner wing is moving through the air slower than the outer - this definitely \\*does\\* matter for stalls.  \n\n\\* If your wings are near stalling and you try and roll you will probably stall the aileron on the side you\u0027re trying to roll towards unless you\u0027ve added \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to it\u0027s deflection, which will be like putting an airbrake out on that side.  \n\n\\* I seem to remember rolling also changes effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, but not having thought about it for a year I\u0027m having problems visualising... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) inner wing will be higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E I think?  \n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E I still don\u0027t think has any spanwise flow effects, so fences \u0026 so on are only good for reducing sideslip ( as extra vertical surfaces ).\n\nSome time back - 1.0.4 days? - I built a BDA contest plane which could fly around at over 30deg \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E ( more like 35deg I think ) at 50-60m/s using the old Wheesley engine, which didn\u0027t have any gimbal at all. Just took some very careful fiddling with control surface behaviour, and a wing loading lower than most gliders I suspect... although honestly that mostly means it can outturn missiles rather than being maneuverable at low speeds.\n\nOld vid: mine was the Hummingbird, the one with elevators.

Any suggestions?\n\u003E \n\nShimmying: you could try giving your wings anhedral or dihedral, but that can sometimes get unstable at low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E at high mach numbers.\n\nYou could try moving the tail control surfaces back away from the center of mass. \n\nIncreasing the height of the vertical stabilizer might help, too, as you need larger rudder surfaces at higher speeds.\n\nAlternatively, you could double your vertical stabilizer area by having twin tails on the fuselage (a la F-15) or putting them on the wingtips.\n\nYour aircraft seems extremely heavy: you must have a crazy high wingloading. Ditch all the weight you can afford; engines, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheels, etc, and then increase the winglength. If you dump enough mass you can probably use less engines, which will reduce your mass even further, and this give a far better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, which in turn will get you out of the atmosphere faster and give you more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E with your rockets. Canards are a crutch that a stable aerodynamic design shouldn\u0027t need at low speed. Increasing your winglength will also lower the stall speed.\n\nFor good hands-off performance, you\u0027ll want the center of mass to be nearest the front, so it will fall like a lawndart.\n\nI can\u0027t say for sure any of that will help without testing it, but that\u0027s my two cents."}]}
