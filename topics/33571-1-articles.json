I\u0027m not sure what made this the ship I chose but I enjoyed making it and trying to get the indent in the middle correct without making a wobbly craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere wasn\u0027t really a solution so I wound up using quantum struts and I couldn\u0027t make the rear end rounded like the actual ship but I\u0027m very pleased with the outcome overall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease ignore the strut acne.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pRIGehy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pRIGehy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q9KD4zJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q9KD4zJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t take one with the hump in the middle clearly visible but I wound up building a bit of utility into it. The Mk2 adapter on the front end is placed backwards and has a normal docking port attached to its end. I used a KW Rocketry 2.5 to 1.5 decoupler for the engine section and attached it to that docking port before building off that. It made the struts necessary, though I think I went a little overboard, but I ended up with the cockpit section being able to decouple from the engines and either be retrieved by another ship or have another engine section mounted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T05:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething from TitanAE!

You need to let it float free of the decoupler after triggering it. For some reason, possibly the quantum struts, it didn\u0027t allow me to turn ship. It just yanked it right back until it floated free. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KAquKAc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KAquKAc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny new engine unit or other module would need a docking port because I only used a decoupler for the engine section to get that damned hump correct.
