Skylon is never going to fly in its current form. They have no money, no industrial capability, no infrastructure. Their cost estimations are bogus and they are not going to get the huge investment they need, because their economical model is unrealistic. Please read the following threads where the Skylon project is debunked, because I really shouldn\u0027t need to reiterate the same argument over and over again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72850-Skylon-may-fly-this-year-first-SSTO-spaceplane\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72850-Skylon-may-fly-this-year-first-SSTO-spaceplane\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon is not happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with Skylon out of the way, let me explain this: getting to orbit will ALWAYS be an expensive job. It takes huge amounts of energy to accelerate payload mass from 0 to 27000km/h while fighting gravity and drag. Huge amounts of energy like that will NEVER be available to the general public, because they are just too dangerous. Huge amounts of energy will ALWAYS require large organizations and infrastructure to safely produce, handle, and convert that energy into delta-v. Large infrastructures will ALWAYS require highly-qualified people to run them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is where the cost is: highly-qualified people. Hardware and propellant are commodities. When you pay $100 million for a launch, only a small part goes into paying for the propellant and the metal that makes the actual tanks, engines. You are paying for the people who build, test, integrate, fuel, transport, and operate the launcher, as well as the administrative overhead, the facilities, the catering, etc... for all those people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the industry has been working for decades to reduce the cost of getting to orbit. This has been done through competition, outsourcing, streamlined processing, automation. The current batch of Delta, Atlas, Ariane, Falcon, are all cheaper to fly than their counterparts of 30 years ago. You know about the law of diminishing returns: the first gains in efficiency are cheap, but the more you squeeze the sponge, the less you get out of it proportionally. So yeah, expendable rockets are already cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe people who work in the civilian or military aerospace industry are among the most brilliant on Earth. They are not idiots. They produce innovations and improve the technology incrementally on a daily basis. If there was some easy way to reduce costs or to get to orbit with less energy, or to drastically reduce costs by 10 or 20%, they would have figured it out by now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons, unless there is a huge breakthrough in technology, there simply isn\u0027t any way to reduce launch costs by 90% as you suggest in the foreseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the new business that can appear are unimaginable.
