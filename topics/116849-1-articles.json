I have since received patches for various improvements, and also the addition of his [Cargo Transportation Solutions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/70203-cargo-transportation-solutions-wip/\u0026page=1). I figured it was time to make a proper support thread.\n\nDownload: [Talisar Parts v1.3.0](http://taniwha.org/~bill/TalisarParts-1.3.0.zip)\n\nSource; [github](https://github.com/taniwha/TalisarParts)\n\nChanges (mostly for spherical/toroildal tanks, but more or less applies to all) from Talisar\u0027s releases:\n\nv1.3.0\n\n- Update for KSP 1.8\n\nv1.2.1 (the \u0022missed Olympic1\u0027s PR\u0022 release)\n\n- All parts have more stock-alike tolerances.\n- Fairings now use stock variants.\n- Separators can get test contracts.\n\nv1.2.0\n\n- Spanish updates (Fitiales).\n- Update to KSP 1.4: use part variants for the texture switching (no more FireSpitter dependency).\n\nv1.1.0\n\nSpoiler\n\n- All work by Olympic1 (many thanks). All I did was some housekeeping.\n- Localization (not translated yet).\n- Category filter.\n\nv1.0.2\n\nSpoiler\n\n- All work by Olympic1 (many thanks)\n- Update for KSP 1.2\n- Remove some redundant resource entries.\n- Category reorganization.\n- Crossfeed fixes.\n- Separators now decouple.\n- Docking ports dock only with each other.\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E removed from the command pod.\n- Cargo Solution updates.\n- Radial storage container updates.\n- Use stock lights, removing FireSpitter dependency.\n- Structural Truss updates.\n- Spherical / Toroidal tank updates.\n- GameData cleanup.\n\nv1.0.1:\n\nSpoiler\n\n- Correct Ore\u0027s entry and add EL\u0027s MetalOre.\n- Correct duplicate bottom nodes on the hubs.\n- Remove some redundant resource entries.\n- Tested in 1.1\n\nv1.0.0:\n\nSpoiler\n\n- Updates and cost rebalancing for KSP 1.0.\n- Part scaling fixed.\n- Node directions fixed.\n- Textures converted to dds.\n- GameData directory changed from ModsByTal to TalisarParts.\n- Improved mass ratios for spherical tanks: 17:1 vs 137:9 (15.22..)
