Ideally you should have a small stage to do the braking burn for you, basically zero out your orbital velocity cut it loose and just let the lander drop and kill vertical velocity just before landing. Lights pointing towards the Munar surface are good for judging how far you are off the surface. This approach should save the maximal amount of fuel in your lander as possible\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T03:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would use the poodle engine and the fuel tank twice (16) that size.

It only takes about 1000 delta-v to get from the Mun back to Kerbin. Adding the poodle engine actually adds too much weight, as does the larger fuel tank. For a craft of that size, the only thing you need to get back from the Mun is a single LV-909 engine. That would give the pictured craft a delta-v of around 2300-2700 , depending on how much monopropellant it is carrying. More than enough to land, and get back to orbit where it can dock with the returning craft. Just swap out that heavy big engine for the smaller more efficient one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekris28","CreatedById":57577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T18:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMine is great for landing on a bunch of places.
