This pack above all other relies most heavily on dependencies which are all going to be broken for who knows how long. I\u0027ll also need to redo ALL the engine and fuel values for everything that has them and somehow work out the fairing problem. Apparently the new fairings are not actual parts but act more like the jettison module which is nice but impossible to do with fixed-sized fairings. I have absolutely no idea how I am going to go about doing this as, as parts, my fairings are going to cause drag while not reducing the drag of the payload underneath, they are more just for show, as are all mods with fairings that exist at the moment. The new modules may work nice for procedural-type fairings but will ever work for a type like these. I may end up having to just give the rockets slightly more DV to overcome the extra drag caused by the fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically what I\u0027m saying is this pack above all other is going to be a complete nightmare to make work with the new update. I should have us probes, skylab and the salyuts updated tomorrow or tuesday though as long as firespitter doesn\u0027t break. This mod will take considerably longer as I will need to entirely redo how the rockets work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StoryMusgrave","CreatedById":131938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T11:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood point. Get it done, when you get it done.

For the fairings, now of course we have no idea how things go, but I would think that maybe something like FAR would treat things as such much better (IF it\u0027s updated), but I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t want to add something like FAR to a list of dependencies.
