Compared to fuel tanks of 16t and above, even the large panel doesn\u0027t provide much extra area, though. And anyway, radiation depends very much on temperature: in order to radiate well, a part has to be very hot. Which in this case means that the panel\u0027s parent has to be very hot -- a situation you probably want to avoid from the outset. Still, a panel or two may make the difference between a part going poof, or merely running dangerously hot. But as I said two sentences ago: if a part does not become dangerously hot, the panel will also have little to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Thermal control systems\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E (the extendable swivel type) gather heat from all over the vessel. They can easily be the hottest part on the ship and thus also radiate disproportional amounts of heat. For purposes of heat managment, it does not matter where you place them. However, they will break if they collide with other parts of your vessel, so you better make sure they have enough elbow room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, it seems as if the fixed radiators were nearly useless. However, when in atmosphere they may also help with shedding heat through convection. Think of a nosecone that gets really hot during reentry and continues to dump heat into a nearby part long after you\u0027ve been through the worst of it. Or running a nuclear engine on a spaceplane, where nearby parts could conceivably become even hotter than the surrounding atmosphere.
