Cool, I\u0027ll watch that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out it\u0027s about an accident in which a woman was skydiving, her parachute didn\u0027t open properly and she crash landed. She survived the fall, ended up in hospital, bla bla...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TV show is called Weird or what and they try to answer how she managed to survive. Turns out it\u0027s divine intervention. Sure, there\u0027s a physicist analyzing the actual footage of the accident, describing the fall and injuries and offering a reasonable explanation, yet the narrator keeps on bringing \u0022somebody up there\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is a man who died in his bed in a fire. It\u0027s a weird fire where mostly just his bed is burnt, the rest of the house is pretty much fine. There are some matches near by, he has an oxygen enrichment thing nearby (not mentioned if he was breathing from it or was it just placed there), yet here comes a guy that\u0027s been studying spontaneous human combustion (SHC) and he\u0027s certain this is textbook SHC, no doubt about it. Another guy offers an explanation on how fires work, but the SHC guy responds by saying the explanation is a fabrication and stops just short of calling him a liar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final case is a woman who allegedly is a real life incarnation of Storm from X-Men (a guy studying that sort of cases actually mentions X-Men). She claims to have an influence on pretty much anything and everything that uses electricity. She drains batteries significantly faster than usual, street lights turn off as she\u0027s walking down the street, fuses blow up, TVs break down, jukeboxes stop playing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, despite having the opportunity of being on camera, she doesn\u0027t demonstrate any of it. The X-Men guy hooks her up to an oscilloscope which shows what appears to be a 50Hz wave, obviously a proof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s wrong with you Discovery?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/rant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, specialties channels that doesn\u0027t broadcast realities show or celebrities gossip or stuff like this are in serious problems.

For a few years if you turned on History it\u0027s probably be either Modern marvels or some Hitler program. After they started showing reality-style programming it all mudslid. After it mudslid I quit TV and went to the Computer, where I could choose what I wanted to see and see it when I wanted to. I also think that it\u0027s a bit more competitive on the Internet, which means that there are far better and more niche-type programs and websites. I bet that most of the internet shows (React series, Good Mythical Morning, etc.) wouldn\u0027t have even got on the air with TV, but because of the Internet they\u0027re popular, really good, and true-to-concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the Military channel used to be good, I can remember watching old war films (Actual combat footage, not stuff like Bridge Over the River Kwai) from the \u002740\u0027s and \u002750\u0027s and programs that explained the evolution of weaponry from as far back as the connections could be made.
