They ran so many Hitler and N\\*zi programs that it garnered the name \u0022The Hitler Channel\u0022. For a few years if you turned on History it\u0027s probably be either Modern marvels or some Hitler program. After they started showing reality-style programming it all mudslid. After it mudslid I quit TV and went to the Computer, where I could choose what I wanted to see and see it when I wanted to. I also think that it\u0027s a bit more competitive on the Internet, which means that there are far better and more niche-type programs and websites. I bet that most of the internet shows (React series, Good Mythical Morning, etc.) wouldn\u0027t have even got on the air with TV, but because of the Internet they\u0027re popular, really good, and true-to-concept.\n\nAnd the Military channel used to be good, I can remember watching old war films (Actual combat footage, not stuff like Bridge Over the River Kwai) from the \u002740\u0027s and \u002750\u0027s and programs that explained the evolution of weaponry from as far back as the connections could be made.
