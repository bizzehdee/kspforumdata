Tried playing on an old-ish save (maybe 2 months old) and noticed that the MKII cockpit was acting weird; like when I tried to use one of them in the VAB it would show as being kinda blurry. So I backed up my game folder via Steam, completely deleted the entirety of the game via Steam/Steamapps as well as deleting local content for the game via Steam. I then went and reinstalled KSP via Steam and even though none of the addons are there any more, I seem to still be missing some parts which are stock in the game (such as the orange tanks, structural pylons and large docking adapters.) This is while playing in Sandbox mode and I haven\u0027t even got my backup file plugged back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESystem Spec:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD Phenom II X6 1100T running at stock 3.3 Ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.0 Gb Ram\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64-Bit Windows 7 Ultimate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning on a 2Tb WD SATA HDD with 1 TB of free space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help me!
