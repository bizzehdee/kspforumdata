Now, I could move that fuel to low kerbin orbit and launch interplanetary missions from there, but it seems like a waste to haul it so far down kerbin\u0027s gravity well just to haul it all back out again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the timing is right, minmus is a great place from which to leave the Kerbin system, seeing as it\u0027s so close to the edge of the SOI anyway. What I\u0027m not sure on is what to do when the timing is wrong-- say the window for a given transfer puts my trajectory straight through the middle of the system, and by the time minmus comes around in its orbit the window is long gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a couple solutions, but I\u0027m not using any math-- just intuition. I could see burning just outside of kerbin\u0027s SOI, with enough relative velocity to be clear of the planet before the transfer window opens. If you\u0027ve got the time, you can do this when minmus is moving in the planetary prograde or retrograde direction, and save yourself some delta-v. I could also see setting up a slightly different orbit from minmus- one that stays within kerbin\u0027s SOI but will put you on the correct side of the planet when the window arrives. Finally, I could see heading down kerbin\u0027s gravity well, then doing a burn at periapse to slingshot yourself out of the system in the direction you need. This one seems like it would be the most difficult to plan and execute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea which would be the most efficient Delta-V wise.

Thus, I\u0027ve always assumed that leaving direct from Minmus would required more delta-V than leaving from LKO, because your orbital velocity is lower out at Minmus\u0027 distance. Is this not the case?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, diving down from Minmus to a low Kerbin Pe would give you higher starting speed. However, you still have to account for the delta-V needed to get out to Minmus in the 1st place, and that makes it a wash. For example, suppose you ignore the position of Minmus and do a 2-step transfer burn starting at LKO. In the 1st step, you go into an elliptical orbit out as far as Minmus, except Minmus isn\u0027t there. Then you coast around this orbit and when you get back to Kerbin, you do step 2 of the burn, finishing it off. This will require the same amount of delta-V as doing the burn all in 1 go from LKO, because Oberth does not give you any free speed increase if you\u0027re already in a closed orbit around the body in question. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll Oberth is doing here is keeping your orbit elliptical. If you don\u0027t do step 2 of the burn, you just go back around the same elliptical orbit you established in step 1. If Oberth was actually giving you free speed, you wouldn\u0027t have to do step 2 at all. Instead, each time you passed your Pe, it would be like burning prograde there, so your Ap would get higher and higher each orbit until eventually you escaped. But this doesn\u0027t happen, as seen by the fact that comets have constant, instead of increasing, orbital periods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the only way to pick up Oberth speed from Kerbin towards your eventual escape is to already be on an escape trajectory (hyperbolic, open orbit) when you pass Kerbin. That pretty much rules out doing this from a starting point anywhere within the Kerbin system. You\u0027d have to be coming into the system from Eve or Moho, like how the Voyagers were doing at each planet they flew by.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T17:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m missing something here.....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s more that we\u0027re not measuring the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThus, I\u0027ve always assumed that leaving direct from Minmus would required more delta-V than leaving from LKO, because your orbital velocity is lower out at Minmus\u0027 distance.
