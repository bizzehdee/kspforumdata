First, It\u0027s become traditional for Nauthy to do the first module of any new project, so he should be the one to start off the base, not me. Secondly, because of floating point values, a Duna orbit at Ike\u0027s height will invariably eventually hit Ike, and considering all the time warping we\u0027ll be doing, the station should be well out of Ike\u0027s way. Also, considering Duna\u0027s gravity (We aren\u0027t in Kansas- er, Minmus anymore!), we should have the station as close to Duna as possible to save delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
