It can be given an in-game interface, and for example, be used to display biomes where the player has collected science or not with various experiments and such.\n\nI just implemented a similar system for my mod recently, and it makes a big difference to overall playability. It also helps a heck of a lot with picking landing sites, which is why I associated it to that potential hint.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T23:47:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T00:12:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about the phrase \u0022 green lighted\u0022?\n\nIt just means exaxctly that, that it was okay\u0027d.\n\nAlso, landing approximation would be more a MechJeb thing, and it already does that actually."},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T00:26:28Z","Content":"Huge expectations should probably be rained in.
