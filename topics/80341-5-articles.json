There\u0027s a relatively simple (if a bit massive) way of doing it. Basically, have the thermal protection be a big heat sink (it\u0027s metallic in nature) and run some piping which sprays water onto it and have the resulting steam vented out the back. Yeah, you\u0027d need a fair amount of water, but it\u0027s non-ablative (you only need to refill the water tanks) and the amount of water can be lowered significantly if the heat sink is good enough. An extra layer of ceramics on top of the heat sink would also help a fair bit, especially if it\u0027s super-nano-carbon-tube-stuff (great thermal insulation properties, better than the Space Shuttle tiles).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T18:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... related to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y140/kightcat/world%20ships/aircraft/my%20designs/LockheedSR-100AuroraIINRO.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis phantom\u003C/a\u003E by any chance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize and hatch makes me think of a star destroyer too...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T19:27:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T22:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow... that\u0027s an awesome space plane!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T01:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Krevsin: That doesn\u0027t really work--heavy plus SSTO is always a no (FWW there\u0027s a very good reason that Skylon does active cooling with it\u0027s LH2 and a thin skin).

Additionally, I\u0027m assuming a 40MW reactor.
