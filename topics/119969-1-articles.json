What about designing Vulcan to use 10x SRB, making some of them air-startable (like on Delta II, so that only 2 fire at any one time (3 for 1st SRB burn if there is an odd number of SRBs)? Keep the core throttled down to increase its burn time and lower TWR (assuming BE-4 is throttleable.) Later upgrades could use up to 6x Delta II Core LRBs (since the tooling already exists), and then a Vulcan Heavy configuration with even greater capability as a \u0027final evolution\u0027 (possibly with propellant cross-feed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is a distributed launch structure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m not so sure adding 2 more RL-10s and a larger upper stage would be less expensive than other upgrade options- RL-10s are expensive as .....
