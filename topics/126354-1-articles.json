Short version: Jeff Bezos (creator and CEO of Amazon.com) has started a company called Blue horizons which is aimed towards space tourism. Yesterday they launched a full-sized test vehicle, made a suborbital hop and brought the (empty) capsule as well as the rocket back down. The capsule lands on parachutes, the rocket uses powered descent (though not a suicide burn like SpaceX does).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: while there may seem to be a big similarity to SpaceX\u0026#39;s attempts at powered landing att first, the two scenario\u0026#39;s are completely different. SpaceX has to haul far larger payloads, far larger rockets, aims for orbit, can\u0026#39;t have their rockets hover because of the extremely powerful merlin engine, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, it\u0026#39;s nice to see technology evolving on multiple fronts :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T21:32:08Z","Content":"\n[video=youtube;9pillaOxGCo]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pillaOxGCo[/video]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nVideo, wow this is amazing.

The Shuttle SRB parachutes were the largest ever made and weighed nearly 5 tons with their deployment systems. Yet, the boosters still splashed down at 23 m/s (80 km/h) in the ocean and were often dented and buckled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo land on the ground, you would need much larger chutes, and to add some sort of dampening system such as airbags or Soyuz-like landing motors, which would also increase the weight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the end, it\u0026#39;s easier to just carry some more propellant for the landing and use the same propulsion system.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T10:32:02Z","Content":"\nI did not even know spaceX had a new concurrent.
