I can then tweak the CFG file to match. The goal is to reduce component count in my ships without deviating too far from the visual style and other characteristics of the stock parts. (I.e. the same ship *could* be built with stock parts and behave the same, but using one remodelled part to replace three stock ones improves the performance of the physics engine.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?
