Once you enable HTML, any number of JavaScript, XSS, PHP, and many other exploits become easily accessible. Filtering entered HTML for dangerous content is a much more taxing load on a server than simply not permitting it in the first place. By only permitting some HTML objects through the use of BBCode, it\u0027s basically a zero-load filter that prevents unsafe code being executed on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T23:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspected as much.
