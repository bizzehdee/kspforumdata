Well, whenever you want to get the save file to me is fine. You could just dump the contents in this thread, using CODE tags to keep it from getting too long if you\u0027d like. I can work with it from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to your question. What you\u0027re asking for is essentially impossible, though not because of accuracy. The two body patched-conics assumption assumes that every \u0022local\u0022 gravity field (using our Kerbin-Duna trajectory, the gravity fields of Kerbin and Duna) is infinitesimal in size. Because of this, according to the assumption, \u003Cem\u003Ethere is no orbit around Duna.\u003C/em\u003E You simply run into the point mass that is the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in practice you\u0027re right, we usually target somewhere near the planet to achieve a particular orbit. But to do that, we need the concept of bodies with finite gravity fields, which patched conics lacks. In short, KSP TOT (which is built on patched-conics) can\u0027t do what you\u0027re asking for because its underlying assumptions do not permit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two workarounds, however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) After you get into the Sun\u0027s SOI, feel free to use RCS to adjust your orbit past Duna as you see fit. The corrections will be very small, so use fine controls mode (caps lock I think). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Wait until you get into Duna\u0027s SOI, then use the Optimal Two Burn Orbit Change Tool (KSP TOT -\u0026gt; Tools menu). Grab your initial orbit from the SFS file using the feature I wrote, and then plunk in your desired orbit. KSP TOT will compute the two burns you need, as well as their locations in the orbits. Execute the plan as KSP TOT as generates it and you\u0027ll end up where you want to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1 is (marginally) cheaper but harder to execute. Option 2 is a bit more expensive but KSP TOT does the math for you. I prefer using (2) but it\u0027s up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes my explanation make sense? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks for asking great questions, let me know if I can help with anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T13:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I started a new persistence (I shan\u0027t send you my \u0027bugged\u0027 file) and started from scratch. Everything was easy to understand but I ALMOST gave up with the last bit: adjusting my departure burn \u002B/- a few seconds past peri so that you score an intercept. I didn\u0027t realise it was so sensitive and the intercept window is very narrow. I was \u002B/- 10 seconds and clicking like a mad man trying to find an intercept.

In the example above - launch was about an hour before the burn to Duna. It wasn\u0027t spelt out but this is the best way to ensure you\u0027re in the correct orbit.

When you get bored one day (joke) consider having a \u0027lite\u0027 version and an \u0027full\u0027 version - or a toggle button - that hides all but the essential information. I want to get to Duna so I really only need four things - the delta values and the time from periapses. All the rest is frightening and may actually discourage noobs.

Here\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re in an orbit, and at a fixed point in time, you are at a known location. Now, KSP TOT gives you both a location in the orbit (the \u0022Departure True Anomaly\u0022) and a time (the departure time). However, it may be that your spacecraft will not be at the departure location at the departure time. So you can\u0027t just input the departure time into a maneuver node editor, because you might go flying off into a random direction! This is also why moving the maneuver node 1133 seconds (the difference between the two times you gave) probably got you an intercept: you moved to the correct point in the orbit, which is strictly more important than nailing the exact departure time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Lone Wolfling\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Lone Wolfling\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould you add a way to import the departure / arrival body from a vessel (from sfs)?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this, do you mean setting the departure body in the application you\u0027re using to that body specified in the orbit you import from the SFS file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Lone Wolfling\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Lone Wolfling\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, a suggestion for an alternative porkchop plot mode - have the y axis be days after departure not the absolute time.
