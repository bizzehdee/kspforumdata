I\u0027m relatively familiar with stock parts and I have decided that I want to install four mods: B9 Aerospace, Skillful, Intersteller and Kethane mods. I have successfully installed the mods so that they appear in the load menu and they load for in the VAB and the hanger. However, when ever I try to launch a design, the game crashes. Any advice for me? I\u0027m right now on a steam version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T22:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActiveTextureManagement.
