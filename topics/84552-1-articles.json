And when you want the nose to go down, it should pitch like this \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AF\\ to push the tail up. Usually they do that. For some reason, if you attach it to a wing whose \u0022placement point\u0022 is in front of the center of mass, the control surface is treated as being in front of the center of mass as well, i.e. it functions like a canard should. In stock KSP, this seems to just be a visual thing that doesn\u0027t have any actual affect on \u0022aerodynamics\u0022, because my stock A-10 Warthogish plane flew perfectly, despite the odd control surface behavior. Recently, though, I\u0027ve started using NEAR, and now because of the realistic aerodynamics, these reversed control surfaces are ruining me. It basically means the lift provided by my tail is completely overridden by the incorrect lift from my main wings, when the main wings should be assisting the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T03:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a known bug.

The control surfaces are behind the CoM, and are deflecting as if they are behind the CoM, and are deflecting to push the nose of the plane up. If they deflected in the opposite direction they would hinder the pitching motion of the plane, which is what you are actually controlling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
