No point in doing awesome things if you don\u0027t look the part! Every detail has been polished, and every piece clipped with the smoothest finish, to hide all seams and struts and the like. And what kind of awesome things *can* you do with it? Well, this thing not only has a pretty face, it has *legs*. In atmosphere it is downright sporty, with low wing loading yet a high-ish TWR, while having a CoL close behind the CoM (that itself stays quite put, if anything it increases in stability as you go lighter to compensate for it) and ample control authority. Meaning it handles like a fighter, yet it will stabilize itself if you let go of the controls (if you have the time for it, of course). At high altitudes, the air routing solution will keep both engines lit as they spool down until one of them goes for good, and the nuke, while having lowish TWR, is more than enough to complete the push to orbit, and it makes the best out of the ample supply of fuel to give over 4km/s of delta-v from low orbit. With that kind of propulsion system (and I\u0027ll freely admit, *some* sorcery is involved), you can visit petty much any rock, if only to fly by it, and you can actually plant flags in a lot of places, including Laythe and Duna. Though I\u0027m doubtful about safely landing on Duna without an additional VTOL system or some chutes, there is ample delta-v and TWR to *try* (note that the RCS system is placed where the CoM is, and it hardly moves).\n\n![nCiNAGZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/nCiNAGZ.png)\n\nAnd you do all that with ample crew space, at a ridiculous cost in fuel and with minimal part count! I actually use this obscene delta-v to perform what I call \u0022rapid crew assembly\u0022 in my career save: train a lot of crews to lvl 3 really quick because I have launch windows to make and infrastructure to service. Goes like this, if you are interested: you take two standard crews (pilot, scientist, and engineer), zip off the runway, and if you burn the excess delta-v in a smart way (i.e: you do a fast-ish initial transfer to Minmus, but not too much into hyperbolic territory, and then you try to cut the travel time by flooring the pedal to the floor going outside kerbin\u0027s SOI and, especially, on the way back), have them put boots on Minmus, zip to outside kerbin\u0027s SOI, then turn around and scream back to base flying by Mun with all the m/s you can manage while timing it right so the Mun is in the right place when you cross its orbit. I\u0027ve completed such a tour of the kerbin system in about two weeks, kerbal time, which is somewhere between three and four Earth days. Minimal delta-v Minmus missions are longer than that!\n\n**IMGUR ALBUM:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Good thing it has the stock tag on it I guess ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).

For the way back, be sure to exit Laythe retrograde, so you drop back close to Jool to make the escape burn, Oberth and all that, done that way it\u0027s peanuts (and worry about rendezvousing with kerbin later, that\u0027s only amatter of figuring out an orbital period that will make you coincide when you cross its orbit).

Now that they accept .craft files as 3d models... I want... (The shipping to Australia will probably cost the soul of a young child though)\n\nSome difficulty reaching orbit? Well, let\u0027s throw in a quick stock guide: I also speed my way to 20kms and then do a speed run, then setting a climb rate of about 10m/s (keeping control of your climb rate is *the* key to flying SSTOs efficiently). Afterwards I let it increase as I build speed to about ~100m/s by the time I get to ~27kms. Then, usually, the turbojets start whining and spooling down, so I light the nuke to give an extra oomph, and start flying it like a usual rocket building time to apoapsis to around one minute, then keeping it there. The jets give out their last effort by the time you apoapsis is going over 60kms, so don\u0027t worry if they spin you a bit when they go out completely.\n\nAs to the offtopic comment... well, any guy with a 3d printer can do just what the guys at eucl3d do from a blender file, and there\u0027s already a thread about exporting those from .craft files somewhere in the forums. So you might find some friend and/or geek somewhere close to where you live that owns a 3d printer, and get a much better prize, then paint yourself.

If, on the other hand, you think about the problem a lot, you usually can find a good balance that gets the most out of every single part, often making them do double or triple duty. In general, doing more with less seems to always be better for me.\n\nRune. We clearly have two different views on the issue.

Afterwards I let it increase as I build speed to about ~100m/s by the time I get to ~27kms. Then, usually, the turbojets start whining and spooling down, so I light the nuke to give an extra oomph, and start flying it like a usual rocket building time to apoapsis to around one minute, then keeping it there.

I think where your clash with Rune is coming from is the wording. When making a complaint it is best to also have an idea on how it could be improved and mention it. Additionally, express that you understand the effort put in (just as a little extra). Also, understand that this craft may get updated but not changed (severely anyway). The comment \u0027Negative feedbacks actually improve the design, too bad you can\u0027t take it\u0027 was quite inflammatory and would be seen as offensive by many. If you do not like something on here just tell the creator HOW it can be improved and WHY and then just move along.

In this design, it is perfectly reasonable to get to 1,800m/s (surface), with the jets engines still providing thrust, and though that happens at about 32kms, by 30 you should already be well over 1,600m/s. Maybe you are giving up on them early? You can perfectly well ride the slight thrust asymmetry when the engines are starting to spool down, and that lets you keep them lit almost until you apo is outside the atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Careful, it may reach critical mass and collapse into one tiny superdense engine ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E You could teach a clipping-class on how to stack things inside other things...\n\nIt does take a long time to learn all the tricks that the UI allows. And the multitude of bugs, too! Lately, I\u0027ve been trying to spread the word on the part parenting bug... it\u0027s the one that causes more head-scratching in my opinion. Still, sadly, my time is limited, and a new job is not going to make things any easier on that front. You will have to keep on relying on asking for bits of advice! (or being subjected to them, depending on opinion ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) And, you know, I don\u0027t even clip that much, I rarely put tanks inside other tanks. Intakes and engines? well, there I do make a lot of exceptions, mainly for aesthetics (you run out of places to put intakes that look good, fast) but also in some cases for performance itself, a Turbo-RAPIER being a perfect example of both (the flames sure look pretty, but I\u0027m also taking advantage by putting their thrust vectors in line with a single attachment point). But I still usually respect the laws of physics with regards to the amount of stuff that fits in a given volume.\n\nThen again, sometimes, you have to throw the rules out of the window, just for the fun of it:\n\n![aWauQOZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/aWauQOZ.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Flies like a brick. Mind you, not many bricks can go to orbit though... And how many bricks have the potential to get to Laythe? Yep, still getting used to this kind of SSTO Rune.

A man can only take so many sub orbital hops... I know that the problem isn\u0027t the craft but me before you take offence.\n\n...mmm let\u0027s see if I can guess what is going on here. You are having some trouble with high altitude flight in the stock atmosphere? If so, that is probably because you are accustomed to fly high TWR designs, things that don\u0027t really need the wings and could go on a vertical climb without issues. Well, this is not one of those things! TWR is never over one, I think, so you need to know how to use those wings to actually do useful work. That is also the source of it\u0027s enormous delta-v, BTW, I save a lot of engine weight! But the problem comes when you get to the high atmosphere: due to it being modelled as it is (lift scales with v, not v^2 as in RL), the wings pretty much do nothing there and you can\u0027t trust them to keep you going up. And, as I said, you don\u0027t have TWR over one so you can\u0027t just point up. So how the hell can this go to orbit, then? Well, simple, but simple does not mean easy: a proper zoom climb. That means you keep momentum going up always, and as long as you can keep you time form apoapsis from going down, you can make orbit with TWR 0.8 or 0.7. Re-read what I said about the climb profile: vertical speed of ~10m/s at 25kms at ~1km/s (surface), then 50-100m/s at 25kms and over 1,500m/s (surface), then let it stick to that last heading, light the nukes and watch vertical velocity climb as kerbin\u0027s gravity starts being more and more counteracted by your \u0022centrifugal\u0022 (centripetal, actually) acceleration. Oh, and keep the turbojets lit until one of them gives out completely: I worked the intakes so after a slight imbalance, the engines will spool down on their own as the air starts to run out, and that way you can keep the nuke going full blast beside them, and you can keep accelerating quickly. That should leave you with a \u003E60kms apoapsis, \u003E1,800m/s (surface), or in other words \u003E2,00m/s (orbit), and more than a minute to raise it over 70 and circularizing on the nuke.\n\nRune. Of course, this should all change for the better with 1.0, when wings give proper lift all the way to the Karman line. I can\u0027t wait to get a plane with a TWR of 0.5 to orbit!"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:09:00Z","Content":"Found a triple stack example from last year; [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics?p=943756\u0026viewfull=1#post943756](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics?p=943756\u0026viewfull=1#post943756) ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...And, you know, I don\u0027t even clip that much, I rarely put tanks inside other tanks.
