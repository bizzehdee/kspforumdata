It started with Titanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe movie broke both cost and box office records. And this was the most interesting part of the movie at all. We all knew what was about to happen, we all knew how they were making it, most of the content was social realism (pictures of real life of the society and its different members). So you could reflect on all this, but you didn\u0027t really care. Like I was thinking: \u0022Ok, so here this is happening. And now this happens, all right.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall this was Ok movie. Actually, they did only one bad thing: the crappy annoying tune that was playing everywhere that year. But the hype around \u0022Titanic\u0022 was annoyingly too strong (I guess PR agencies did their job very well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then it happened more and more: much hype around huge budgets and CG, and actually good writers, actors and directors making mediocre but profusely promoted movies. Void plots that leave no ideas and you don\u0027t care about: Spiderman, Harry Potter, Avatar, Hobbit, the new Star Wars trilogy, Transformers, new Terminators, Maleficient, Hunger games, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now feel like I don\u0027t care about movies. Even of the most popular ones. They\u0027re just void. You watch and think: \u0022ok, so this is an epic battle, *yawn*\u0022. I tried watching new cinema around 2008-2009 several times, and the amount of crappy but hyped movies just stunned me, so I stopped going to the cinema. I give it another chance once a year, and every time come out with facepalm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is that around that time, end of 1990s cinema networks finally got global, so that they could run and leverage a movie across the whole world faster than illegal copies were spreading. So big money came in. Then they could spend a lot of money on CG, on promotion, and marketing department made sure the plot had nothing too smart, and in the end it made a good return. (Actually, look at the \u0022most expensive movies\u0022 in Wikipedia, there\u0027s a clear mark: historically most expensive movies start around 2004, but I guess if the table were bigger, it would be mostly the 1997-2004 range.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo others have similar impressions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*edit*\u003C/strong\u003ETo put it better way, it\u0027s about \u003Cstrong\u003Esympathy to the characters\u003C/strong\u003E which becomes rarity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duxwing\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Duxwing\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI infer from our many complaints of films\u0027 insufficient intellectual stimulation that we expect it from them.

Actually, recently I realised that we not necessarily expect intellectual stimulation. We at least expect having sympathy towards the character. This often times does not happen. Before you want to sympathise their dares and adventures, you need to build a bit of feeling for them, see they are worthy. The more movie makers try to impress you, the less they build character, and you end sitting through the film and just don\u0027t care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I should say, probably the intellectual bit was a cliche that I followed. Sympathy is a real rarity now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad example: Maleficient. The intro is the standard Disney opening, you don\u0027t feel this character is worthy, and right away they show THE epic battle, where you know what to expect: magic will happen (read: someone thrown by explosion or beaten against the ground). You immediately understand it will change nothing, because nothing real has even started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad example: Hunger Games. Before you understand what the hell it was, they drop you the \u0022mass protest\u0022 scene. Oh, not quite mass, but a protest in oppressed country. Again. Yawn. Stop pushing me to like them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood example: Blade Runner. You completely feel for the guy and worry about him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood example: Le Professionel. Before Beaumont starts his offence, you see how he is (mis)treated and how stoic he stayed. Then you\u0027re ready to forgive all the illogical decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood example: Interstellar. You totally feel for the guy quite soon.

I don\u0027t know how old you are, but for most people the blockbusters get less entertaining as you get older. The same old cliches, underdeveloped cookie-cutter characters, romantic subplot and utter predictability are harder to cover up with pretty special effects to a more sophisticated viewer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Selective memory. We tend to only remember the truly great and truly awful movies from the past, and only the great ones from the more distant past. We tend to forget the drivel that made up the bulk of movies in those years, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESturgeon\u0027s Law\u003C/a\u003E definitely applies.

Similarly, the only movies we remember well from the 50s are those that have stood the test of time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More pervasive marketing. New blockbusters get promoted more often and in more media than at any time in the past, this makes our awareness of them a good bit higher than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, there are still great movies being made every year, it\u0027s just that most of them aren\u0027t the heavily-marketed blockbuster eye candy films.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T02:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere are several silent movies that i have enjoyed too. you figure the movies that your great grandparents used to watch were tame puritanical pieces. but when you figure back then censorship was practically non existant, you have nudity, violence, all the things we associate with modern works. then you also have cerebral concepts. metropolis kinda toyed with marxist ideology for example. you also had birth of a nation (arguably one of the most racist movies ever made), had some pretty impressive war scenes in it (its also considered one of the first war epics). there was a 30s (not silent) picture \u0022things to come\u0022 which was a great scifi movie with far reaching ideas about the course of humanitie\u0027s future. forbidden planet in the 50s pretty much cast the mold for every space opera ever made (and even had a few cerebral elements in it). so its fun to go back and watch some old films. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40s war era propaganda films are a great watch (just be sure to watch movies from all the countries involved) and it gives you a good sense of how the events of world war 2 were perceived by the general public at the time. the 60s and 70s were great for cerebral scifi. planet of the apes, zardoz, a clockwork orange, 2001, soylent green, logans run, the boys from brazil, etc. you of course have the hippie movement, feminism, civil rights, and anti nuclear movements all happening at that time and those movies reflect the times in which they were made. so for those who care about history they are a great watch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor some more modern films, you have pretty much anything from tarantino. he has the ability to turn tried and true movie cliches into something completely different and original, do watch all of them. 90s also had movies like fight club which is one of my favorites. the best movie i think ive seen in the last couple years was probibly cloud atlas. it managed to completely slip under the radar and i wouldnt have even found it if i wasnt scanning imdb for recent scifi films i havent seen yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eobligatory note that some of the movies mentioned in this post have adult concepts and ratings, so use digression.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T04:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways has been, is now, always will be a mix to choose from; ranging from garbage (open to interpretation) to so-so to good to epic in scope (again, all open to interpretation).

Actually, recently I realised that we not necessarily expect intellectual stimulation. We at least expect having sympathy towards the character. This often times does not happen. Before you want to sympathise their dares and adventures, you need to build a bit of sympathy, see they are worthy. The more movie makers try to impress you, the less they build character, and you end sitting through the film and just don\u0027t care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I should say, probably the intellectual bit was a cliche that I followed. Sympathy is a real rarity now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad example: Maleficient. The intro is the standard Disney opening, you don\u0027t feel this character is worthy, and right away they show THE epic battle, where you know what to expect: magic will happen (read: someone thrown by explosion or beaten against the ground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad example: Hunger Games. Before you understand what the hell it was, they drop you the \u0022mass protest\u0022 scene. Oh, not quite mass, but a protest in oppressed country. Again. Yawn. Stop pushing me to like them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood example: Blade Runner. You completely feel for the guy and worry about him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood example: Le Professionel.
