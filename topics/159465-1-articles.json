I\u0027ve got the Aerodynamic point (blue ball) right down near the main engine, using four fins to stabilize. And whether I set them perfectly straight, or on a very slight angle in the hopes of spin stabilizing, my rocket will tip to the side shortly (before 700 m) after launch. I\u0027ve only got about 8k delta-v on this thing, it\u0027s nothing crazy. Using an RD-107 on the main stage. It tips, and keeps tipping, this isn\u0027t a gravity turn built into it by design, it tips until it\u0027s going back down, and it does this very quickly. I can\u0027t seem to set up a rocket without avionic control stabilizing it.

The rocket has an excess of lateral area at the back, which is good. This means that if flying sideways it will generally try to rotate its nose towards prograde.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the forward facing / leading area is a different story. The yellow circles, rings, and rectangles show approximations of the location and amounts of surface area (and thus approx drag) of areas when looking down from the top of the rocket. I didn\u0027t bother actually do a similar demonstration of areas canceling out, but it was easy to find that there was significantly more area towards the top. This means that when pointing close to\u00A0prograde, it ends up wanting to turn to the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing the effects of lateral and forward facing area balance out at some angle between 0 and 90 degrees, so without control the rocket will end up tilting over to\u00A0this angle, causing problems. If given active control surfaces, it could probably go straight though, as they would keep it from deviating enough from prograde for aerodynamic forces to cause this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T02:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPull up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI and do an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E sweep at Mach 0.5, Mach 1.0, and Mach 1.5.
