I\u0027m not sure of... so didn\u0027t want to call it out. The Cassini Hyugans(Spelling?) probe that landed on Titan. That probe was not designed to send directly back to Earth... But I believe we did pick up its signal from Earth and then waited for the relay from the Cassini orbiter. I\u0027m unsure because I know we lost half of the data from the probe... so maybe what we picked up was just a carrier signal or something and or too badly degraded to get data from.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see. The Huygens probe, part of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft/mission was a little bit of a different story. We did receive the signal, however it was fairly weak and so far as I know, was used mainly for Doppler experiments and most data came from the Cassini spacecraft. While more data was lost than should honestly have been, I don\u0027t think it was half. They lost half of all pictures and a Doppler experiment. These losses were not due to any actual signal issues, but rather the fact that the ESA forgot to write a program to turn on one of the channels leaving only one working. While the channels were mostly redundant and transmitted most of the the same information,the doppler experiment was only on the non-working signal and the 700 pictures were split between the two channels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eeke","CreatedById":98641,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T03:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello there,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been setting up Sat nets for a while, and recently I decided to venture to the mun and throw 4 sats in random orbits there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tuvq7RN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tuvq7RN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe detachable satellites have Communitron 16s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways... fast forward to the execution stage and here\u0027s what happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Achieve Munar orbit -\u0026gt; Detach satellite -\u0026gt; No connection error on detached satellite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m maybe 100m away from the parent, each child satellite has a probe core \u0026amp; fully extended Communitron 16.
