Your first option should be to move your rear landing gear closer to your CoM, Landing gear are like the pivot point of a fulcrum. The closer it is to the balance point (your CoM) the easier it is to turn your aircraft around them. That being said, you don\u0026#39;t want them too close together, or you will nose up unexpectedly on the runway and destroy your engines. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOption two is that your CoL is too far from your CoM. The CoL needs to be close to, but slightly behind the CoM, this causes your plane to be ever so slightly unstable, allowing you to perform various maneuvers. Another problem might just be a lack of pitch authority. Without a picture of your aircraft though, that last one is hard to diagnose.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T17:59:58Z","Content":"\nScreenshots would help immensely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree Junos should be plenty for small aircraft.

It\u0026#39;s not wrong, but it\u0026#39;s also not the full picture. Which means we all have a tendency to mount wings with zero Incidence. On top of that KSP defaults to wings mounted that way.

Drag from the wings will of course remain unchanged, but that is much less than drag from fuselage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn real life [U]even cambered wings are mounted with incidence[/U], for the same reason.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Wikipedia\u0027]\u0022Wings are typically mounted at a small positive angle of incidence, [U]to allow the fuselage to have a low angle with the airflow[/U] in cruising flight. Angles of incidence of about 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 are common on most general aviation designs.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence#Angle_of_incidence_of_fixed-wing_aircraft\u0022]Source[/URL][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe amount of incidence you need depends on mass and wing area. I usually go for 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 Incidence (because that\u0026#39;s easy to do in stock) and a wing area 1/8[SUP]th[/SUP] to 1/6[SUP]th[/SUP] of the mass in t. (not counting wing area from Mk2 fuselage)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis will result in the craft being able to fly completely level with the horizon at sea level (below 500 m), without losing or gaining altitude, at or just above Mach 1 (350 m/s) which minimizes drag at transonic speeds, where drag is very high and thrust is still low. This is more relevant for RAPIER powered planes that have less thrust than Whiplashes, until speed is above 400-something m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]TLDR;[/B] But it also means that if you fly level at 10 km, then the prograde marker will start to pull above the nose around Mach 3 (900 m/s), and you can start following it up, to get a good angle for the transition to ballistic flight, with very little pointing away from prograde.[/spoiler]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T23:00:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Val\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T16:38:50Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m going to have to agree with everyone else and guess that your rear gear is too far aft. The closer your gear are to the CoM, the less the aircraft\u0026#39;s own weight counters the desired rotation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou also need to make sure your pitch controls (elevators) are far enough from both your CoM and your gear to be effective - canards need to be far forward, and/or tailplanes must be far aft. As long as your gear are close to your CoM, far enough from one is far enough from the other.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, if you\u0026#39;re doing a tail-dragger, it\u0026#39;s not that important since you\u0026#39;re already rotated back, and in fact the plane may naturally rotate forward during roll-up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the typical answer is to make sure your gear are near the middle. But there are other alternatives if you\u0026#39;re constrained:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Shorten your aft gear so you\u0026#39;re already rotated when you start.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Rotate the main wing upward in your design (\u0022geometric\u0022 angle of attack). This achieves the same thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Use oversize canard elevators and brute-force the rotation. This is very dangerous.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The end of the runway is raised above the surrounding land. If you\u0026#39;re careful, you can roll off the end of the runway at speed and rotate in the air. This is pretty much what is done on aircraft carriers. The key here is to not go so fast you lose control on the runway.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, seeing pictures would help as we\u0026#39;re just guessing here. But you probably do NOT want more engine. Real aircraft get by with T/W on the order of 0.3. And since I assume you want to land and collect science, you\u0026#39;re heading for rough terrain. You want low-speed takeoffs and landings, and more engine does not help you there.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satnet","CreatedById":147366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T20:26:30Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m going to plug Keptin\u0026#39;s aircraft design thread [thread]52080[/thread] or as I like to call it \u0022how I learned to make planes that actually fly\u0022.
