So you want to test stage 1 with solids attached as well, try this: instead of stage 2 being the decoupling of the solids and stage 3 being the lighting \u0026amp; decoupling of stage 1. Instead keep everything [i.e keep the same rocket] but make stage 2 activate a single solid booster that decouples from the rest of the rocket with just another decoupler \u002B capsule \u002B parachute. This is an intended emergency extraction, except you can get out at any time of you want. So the end of each test flight is this extraction from the rocket [be things going well or not]. Importantly you would be flying a multi stage rocket with only two functional stages. Therefore if you are testing solids, the next stage is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E to decouple them, [you want to keep them attached] the very next stage is the single solid \u0026amp; capsule ejection.
