When in VAB I loaded up a commsat I was working on. When I attached a decoupler, the animation was playing, that puff of gas, over and over. I figured I can live with this but... there\u0027s always a but isn\u0027t there? The \u0027but\u0027 in this case was non-stageable parts showing up as icons (blank ones) in the staging area. Sometimes I would delete the offending parts and be left with empty staging. The probodyne core is my root part, but I have a 1 kerbal pod I use for control. I have NEVER had an issue with this being a problem (having placed at least five sats this way. \n\nThe last thing I installed were some updates to stock bug fixes mods. The rest of my mods are up to date. I did attempt to run Distant Objects, but it bugged on me so I uninstalled it.\n\nI have see a few other posts having the same issue but failing to provide the output log, or mod list. (it took me far to long to type that list... time to trim the fat...)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI found a rocket that displayed all it\u0027s parts. the decouplers were fuming as \u0027usual\u0027 and their icons were blank. I launched the rocket. Part way up something, not sure what, happened and my camera slid down a bit. I adjusted. My SRBs finally cut out, and I staged. No stage sound, the rockets just sort of \u0027came loose\u0027 and slid down the main rocket. That\u0027s when my camera totally lost control. Some have attributed this particular behavior (the camera sliding) to Hot Rockets but I\u0027ve had that installed for some time with no issues.\n\nPics off Imagur:\n\n[http://imgur.com/2NB334Y,NDyoQDB](http://imgur.com/2NB334Y,NDyoQDB)\n\n[http://imgur.com/2NB334Y,NDyoQDB#1](http://imgur.com/2NB334Y,NDyoQDB#1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T21:15:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yithpistol**\n  \nMore information"},{"CreatedByName":"yithpistol","CreatedById":61110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T02:20:10Z","Content":"I figured out the problem.
