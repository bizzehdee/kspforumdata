I think it is\u00A0C:\\Program Files\\Kerbal Space Program...,\u00A0C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Kerbal Space Program\\... or\u00A0C:\\Kerbal Space Program\\...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe easiest way to find the folder is to right click on the shortcut of the launch, and click \u0027 open file location\u0027. This will get you to the install folder.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are few .exe files, KSP.exe if I\u0027m right and KSP_64x.exe. I would recommend the 64bit one.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake a shortcut of the one you want to start, it is either the 32bit or the 64bit startup. 64bit is mostly required when you play with mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlace the shortcut somewhere you like.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRun the shortcut.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n...?...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProfit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
