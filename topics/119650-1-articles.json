I thought it was a game glitch at first but later realized that Ike was being eclipsed by Duna. It\u0027s very cool that the eclipse game mechanic works for solar panels but a visual queue of the shadow on the ground and spacecraft would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T14:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea your electric will be blocked.
