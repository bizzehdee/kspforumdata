What I noticed on the way was, unless I angled quite sharply upwards, I\\\u0027d rapidly descend. Then, obviously, I\\\u0027d ascend up until the engines no longer had the atmospheric throughput they require and dip down to where they did, then go up, fall back down, etc. This strikes me as heavily inefficient, is there a better way? Maybe a more specific pitch using Mechjeb?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nomer","CreatedById":30789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T00:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate using mechjeb :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey ruined all the skill this game had.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T00:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh. It actually depends heavily on the balance of the plane you\\\u0027ve created.

It seems to me you need more lift on your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per your question, what you are fighting mainly is drag from the atmosphere. This decreases with height, so just go as high up as you can with your engines still working.

There are a couple way to do long flights. Personally for longer flights, I use the aerospike rockets to do atmospheric hops. I glide up to ~15km with the jet engines, then activate the aerospikes for a quick burn. If you plan on returning, fit two sets of aerospikes if weight allows, I launch and ignite one aerospike to do a high atmospheric hop and jettison when I am coming in for landing. I use my second one to return. That is personal style, but the principles of it makes for nice flying. Also common is to use one aerospike for all maneuvers and glide in to conserve fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor full atmospheric flight, steep pick to a high altitude, then angle myself just a bit above horizon, eventually the plane will reach an equilibrium height and a nice max speed where you can turn down the engines if desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T06:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh you can maintain a perfectly level pitch, sure, but your TVV may not agree with it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
