Not only does the loading time inexplicably increase exponentially, especially with mods, but when it is finally finished, some part models and UI elements become corrupt even though the game itself runs fine. It may be due to tabbing out during loading or previously quitting the game by pressing alt\u002Bf4. Once this happens, the only fix seems to be to reboot the PC, restarting the game alone does not help. It has been happening a lot on 0.21 and 0.21.1, but if I recall correctly, it may have happened in 0.19 also.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T22:39:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Grizzlol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T22:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMods increase the load time, but I\u0027ve found that no matter which version I use, KSP won\u0027t load at all if you alt tab out of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce its loaded, alt tabbing isn\u0027t an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T22:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t run KSP in full screen so i don\u0027t use alt-tab to switch and I don\u0027t get the issue.
