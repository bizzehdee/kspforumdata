Carts/rovers work best when they have a bit of a wide wheel base so they don\u0027t flip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E. About half the length of the cart/rover should be it\u0027s width\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep in mind power consumption and how to recharge the batteries. i would recommend using the large radial batteries if the rover is kind of big, but you can use other kinds. Also, RTGs (those radial generators) work good for rover recharge... things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To ensure your rover/cart does not dip in the middle, secure as much of it as you can with struts. Sometimes, i stack 2 or 3 of the little truss pieces upwards from the center of it to put struts to the rover wheels. it keeps it stable, and works well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. What will the purpose of the rover be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Depending on the rover type, you will want to chose your wheels wisely. If it\u0027s detail exploration of a kinda smooth planet. use the little ones. if it\u0027s mun roving, use the medium ones. if it\u0027s roving a planet like dres where it\u0027s super hilly, use the large ones. But sometimes if the rover is large and you\u0027re mun roving. use the large wheels then. It all depends and the situation,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about all the help i can give,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePyrateCaptain","CreatedById":57208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T15:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I should have stated \u0022from scratch\u0022 I have the basic CART.DAE file, unity, blender, but the trick is I\u0027m trying to make a cart for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h349/pyratecaptmorgan/screenshot64_zpsbd22e742.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot64_zpsbd22e742.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my own personal testing sorta.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
