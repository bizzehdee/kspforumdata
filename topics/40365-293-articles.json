I had 1 design with a central 1.25 and put a pair of .625s on outrigers because I had more power than the single could use, my TWR was just bairly over 1 and I figured the 2 extras would use up the spare power in the net and boost thrust. It actualy lowered thrust as for some reason the main stack stoped drawing its full load and the MJ pannle showed I was showing lower utilization than just turning off the outrigers. Ended up junking the outrigers and replaced them with argon droptanks to get that one off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I\u0027ve never had plasmas just splutter out unless I managed to compleatly loose connection to the relay. Normaly power fluctuations do lower the thrust but dont result in a flameout shutdown. Although for a 10 ton I\u0027d say try reducing to only 2 if you can. I had a spaceplane design that was about 19 tons and it could just bairly hover at sea level on kerbin on a pair of .6\u0027s useing lithium. could hover at rather low throttle off LF or vacume on the mun. use the main drive when you need extra power and the smalls when you only need a low amount of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T17:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually i think that those generator attached to thermal receiver may end up having zero efficiency because of really low receiver temperature (lower than radiator maximum temperature), obviously producing no power at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T17:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, that\u0027s because of how KSP loads config nodes.
