But it turns out, it\u0027s significantly less expensive to just use traditional rockets until you can do a SSTO space plane which requires the Whiplash engine. I was able to achieve sub-orbital SSTO\u0027s before unlocking the Whiplash (made it a priority) but to actually get into orbit, the Whiplash is a necessity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zFePKTf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zFePKTf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nsgallup","CreatedById":136892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T11:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECouldn\u0027t you make a rocket plane SSTO?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T12:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHad to add contrast to see what you were doing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.gyazo.com/23a23dc9d01aeac236acb9f59a8a6a29.png\u0022 alt=\u002223a23dc9d01aeac236acb9f59a8a6a29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, can you take photos in light?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a friendly tip \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketology","CreatedById":152263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T17:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I have, for some reason the in game screenshot makes them really dark.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meyerweb","CreatedById":135212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T18:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is exactly what I\u2019m trying to do next, and what I can\u2019t figure out is how to mount the satellite inside the cargo bay (Mk2) in such a way that it will just drift out.

If I merged in (or even just straight loaded) the VAB craft, it had zero attachment points; I couldn\u2019t even save it as a subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, I loaded up the SSTO file and mounted a docking port inside the cargo bay. It had to be manually placed, as the docking port\u2019s attachment points didn\u2019t snap to either of the interior snap points in the cargo bay. (Unlike, say, stack separators, which were totally fine with attachment-point snapping.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I merged in the SPH version of the satellite, which snapped to the docking port just fine. Runway testing of the satellite release procedure checks out, so I\u2019m finally ready to take my own stab at this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-11T18:00:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2015 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by meyerweb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECleaned up forum migration errors (Unicode and hyperlinking were both botched\u2014sigh)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
