But now we can send and parse messages between kOS CPUs so you can work around it and actually use IR integration properly (coming in 0.19 of kOS I believe, but I may be wrong).\n\nAs for limit snapping - I\u0027ll have a look into it, although I think it has to do with 150 acceleration you have on that part. Anyway I\u0027ll look into the formula just in case it can be remedied easily."},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T13:43:24Z","Content":"Ah, clarification: I\u0027m not talking about executing IR code on a remote vessel from the CPU on the player vessel.
