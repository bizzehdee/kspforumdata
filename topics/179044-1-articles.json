For nearly every mod, you do not put the contents of the gamedata in the gamedata folder. You just copy the BDArmory folder and put it in the GameData of KSP. Otherwise, you can break mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-20T09:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223469774\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179044\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539792134\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278218\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/18/2018 at 12:02 AM, Hodo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont think BDArmory has been updated to 1.5 yet.\u00A0 You may have to wait for it to update before downloading and installing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, did you install the dependencies?
