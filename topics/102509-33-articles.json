So what happens if I do this?\n\n[![plane-small.png](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/plane-small.png)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/plane.png)\n\nThis is pertinent; this is my prototype Project Orion powered spaceplane for moving the Mk IV to other worlds. \u0022I am become death, the destroyer of runways\u0022. Fortunately, the colossal weight is arguably an error; the cargo bay and adapters that form the body of the plane are hollow, and TweakScale suggests a lower mass exponent with hollow parts (their weight doesn\u0027t grow proportional to volume).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:21:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by damerell**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chemp","CreatedById":154483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T20:25:05Z","Content":"With the new forum, I decided it might be a good moment to join.
