Ideally, everyone who participates would play GM at least once, but, since this is likely impractical, the rule will be that whoever wants to give it a try next round calls dibs (with priority going to those who have never GMed before). If you commit to being the GM, you must resolve the round within three days, or else somebody else will assume control, and, thus, you just wasted your turn. If you have the time and inclination to make an event or to set a (reasonable) challenge for the next GM and/or players at the end of the round you govern, then go for it. These new rules are all detailed with the others within the quote bracket below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Quote:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Basically, this is an RPG where you play as yourself. You can attempt to do pretty much anything- but whether you succeed or not is determined by the roll of a six-sided die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Summary of the above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you roll a:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1- Critical Failure: The opposite of what you intended occurs, usually in such a way as to screw you over. And yeah, I DO mean screw over. If you try to use your -3 to \u0022Not find 1,000,000$\u0022, then I\u0027ll likely pit you against a bag of killer coins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2- Failure: You fail to do what you were attempting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3- Marginal Success: You accomplish what you were attempting, but in a sub-optimal way. Or maybe not, depending on what the action is, and what mood I\u0027m in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4- Success: You succeed at the action. Trying to cause mass destruction will likely prompt a R2D against the target, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5- Excellent Success: You perfectly accomplish the action, and get a \u002B1 morale bonus to your next roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6- Critical Success: You complete the action and accomplish something else related to it. You also get a \u002B1 morale bonus to your next roll. Depending on the date or turn, this might be an overshoot instead, in which case I might cause it to backfire horribly due to the over-exertion of effort. You still get to keep your bonus in the end, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To put that into an example, lets pretend to build a house, and see what the roll results would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1- You attempt to build a house, but instead end up destroying all the residential buildings within a 10 block radius. You now have an an angry mob heading towards your direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2- You try and build a house but succeed in doing nothing. Dang, Minecraft makes it look so easy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3- You attempt to build a house, but you end up tearing up your neighbor\u0027s shed for materials. The house is done, and now he\u0027s thoroughly pissed, and threatening to file criminal charges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4- You build a small, yet comfortable house.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5- You build a good-sized house with the mortgage payed off. \u002B1 to next Roll for a nice pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6- You somehow built a mansion complete with a swimming pool and power generator. Sweet! (\u002B1 to next roll)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Furthermore, whenever someone attempts a hostile action against someone else, that person or object must...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Roll To Dodge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1- Critical Hit- the object is destroyed or the person dies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2- Hit- the person or object is severely damaged. If successfully attacked again before recovering, they will die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3- Light Hit- the person suffers a -1 penalty to their next roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4- Miss- nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5- Compromising Miss- the defender gets a \u002B1 to their next roll against the attacker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6- Counter- the attack fails, and the attacker must Roll To Dodge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Other rules which players should likely read\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1.) You can\u0027t attempt the same action twice in a row. (for now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2.) You can\u0027t attempt a hostile action against other players, the GM, or the topic in the first two rounds. Otherwise this thread would asplode within the first round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3.) You can\u0027t attempt an action specifically against everyone posting after you. You may attempt an action at the next person, or specific people, or everyone, but allowing people to target everyone after them encourages ninja posting. And that\u0027s no good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4.) Any action attempting to tamper with the nature of the dice automatically fails. 6-siders only, damn it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5.) Actions are resolved in the order they are posted, unless otherwise subverted by the ruling of a GM as the result of an action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E GM rules specific to this thread, as detailed above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1.) No one person may be the GM for successive rounds. Players must call dibs if they wish to assume the role of GM for the next round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1.a) With respect to rule 1, priority will be given to players who have never GMed before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2.) The GM may set a challenge for the GM and/or players of the next round to adhere to if s/he wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3.) If a round has not been resolved by the GM within three days, another player may assume the GM role for that round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll do the first round, and, just to ease us in, I won\u0027t do an event or set any challenge for the next GM, but, if it comes around to me again... Well, there are no guarantees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour setting is a quiet port town, where you have all just gotten off from the same boat in the morning time. The salty spray of the sea breeze is quite refreshing to the touch, and the sun has just lifted itself up from the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHALL WE BEGIN?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lukerules117","CreatedById":51027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T07:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow there is no people here yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI force people to play this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T12:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI roll to ignore you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T12:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour roll is a critical hit, and this whole thread is promptly ignored. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI roll and your roll is invalidated\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T19:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI roll but it lands on the wrong number \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edeath is coming to kill you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t roll because i m a rock and so i dodge like a singin\u0027 death song like this tongue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T21:25:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
