As it is, I was uncomfortable enough with the change management of ORS that I forked it and will continue in my own derivative work that I will share with the various teams that work on extensions to MKS, Karbonite, etc..

As it stands right now, I have most of that already in place other than 1.2 of KSPI. So as noted, I\u0027m going to make very sure that I do not accidentally break something just so people can enjoy these bits together. If we land there, that\u0027s fine.
