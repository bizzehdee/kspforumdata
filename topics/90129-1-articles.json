If you\u0027ve got a good heavy spaceplane that can loft a decent amount of fuel, then you\u0027d be better off simply using THAT as your fuel depot instead of a rocket-lifted station. Put a few docking ports on the plane and let smaller vessels link up with it as necessary; when it\u0027s nearly empty, return it to the surface. Or, build your plane such that it detaches a cargo of fuel tanks once it reaches orbit and returns immediately. Either way, there\u0027s just no reason to move that fuel to a station unless your planes\u0027 capacity is much smaller than that of the station (and with the way things scale in KSP, you CAN make the planes huge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all about perspective.
