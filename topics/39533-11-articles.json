Afraid they would destroy shipping between Duna and the outer planets, Admiralty dispatched the 12FF to deal with the invaders. Their ships were the newly commissioned \u003Cem\u003EDrekevak \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003EThrasher\u003C/em\u003E, both Light Fighters designed after the battle of Dres, in which Zokesian Fighters proved far inferior to other nations\u0027. Along with the pair of LFs the New Frigate \u003Cem\u003EDavid \u003C/em\u003Ewas sent to act as a mobile battery to fight off any larger ships that may be used to support the raiders. Rumors around the Admiralty that probe-Tek had come up with a new type of short range Fighter prompted the sending of the \u003Cem\u003EDavid\u003C/em\u003E as the enemy fighters relied on light weight and so neither carried the fuel nor antennae to operate at long distance. Most had a range of a few hundred kilometers, and these were millions of KM from Minmus, Probe-Tek\u0027s home moon. As well, all Ike colony commanders were alerted to the possibility of attack on their bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 12th fighter fleet steamed to Ike at 10:23 Duna time and soon detected short range band signals to and from the Ike surface which were not in the Zokesian format. They knew something was up. Then, suddenly, \u003Cem\u003EDrekevak \u003C/em\u003Epicked up a strong signal from directly below the fleet: It was Tekkan. The fighter obviously thought the Zokesian Fleet was its relay ship and attempted to communicate with it. Immediately \u003Cem\u003EDrekevak \u003C/em\u003ELaunched a Mk XXI Short Range Torpedo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 minutes later the torpedo\u0027s homing system slammed it into the target at 120 m/s. Since the firing control was relatively new for the \u003Cem\u003EDrekevak\u003C/em\u003E, it was not fine tuned for surface targets and missed the critical component of the enemy ship; the control pod/antennae. However it did do massive damage to the armor and tore off the portside engine assembly. The fighter sat helpless on the surface.
