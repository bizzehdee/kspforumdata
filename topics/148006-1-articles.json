Basically, booster, sustainer and vacuum nozzle configurations. I understand that each engine is intended for one of these three roles - I wouldn\u0027t expect the nozzle to fully change the ASL vs Vac thrust/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E relationship to the same degree as an entire engine redesign. However, options like a lower expansion nozzle for the LV-909 could change the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E statistics from 95/340 to 200/325, making it more useful as a sustainer engine but sacrificing efficiency in Vacuum. The LV-T45 currently has 270/320 - a booster configuration could change it to 285/305 for better performance on the pad. Essentially, give engines the choice of two of the three types with each having a unique balance of performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany real engines have this type of customizability, and it was common in the past when only a small number of reliable large engine designs had matured.
