I needed to build a ship with enough fuel and enough resources for a return mission. As the result, I built a simple ship in order to get there, as shown on this monitor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tYFfZ4d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tYFfZ4d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably one of the most complicated spacecraft I ever made. So many stages were required and larger rocket designs had to be used in order for this thing to successfully get to space. After a very long time warp, the spaceship got there successfully. No electricity was lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to admit, yes I am using mods. You can see the interior of the cockpit here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fGXMBem.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fGXMBem.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/729pE6A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022729pE6A.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis spacecraft is not designed to land on Laythe \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 that would be suicidal. The mission was to simply launch to Jool, grab some science with EVA reports on one of Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons and return back to Kerbin with the smaller spacecraft attached. I chose the closest moon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Laythe, as shown here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zo4fwRd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zo4fwRd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pkZpWCP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pkZpWCP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there is a problem\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can get science, but the power isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t working properly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 even with those 4 solar panels deployed, not enough electricity is being produced anymore (see bottom image). Yes, they are facing directly at the sun. In fact, it is stuck on 0.05 energy. When I time warp, it goes up to 1.90 electricity but that\u0027s about it. On the night side of the moon, the energy just drops to 0.00. In other words, I went from having 8000\u002B electricity to nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CoiY01p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CoiY01p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see on the top image, no electricity is producing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure what happened because the solar panels were just working a few minutes ago on the Kerbin system, and suddenly they have stopped producing electricity once I got to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if this is a small bug in the game due to the fact that I am using mods, or if there is something else I am not understanding here.
