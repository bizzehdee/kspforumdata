I\u0027ve tried the contracts.cfg but this doesn\u0027t seem to have what I want - I removed the \u0027TOUR\u0027 section, but the ferry tourists is still there.\n\nRejector only does what it says on the can. It cancels contracts as they come up. I don\u0027t want them to appear at all!\n\nAny clues, or help would be appreciated.\n\nPeace.\n\nEdit - [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/897/StockNoContracts](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/897/StockNoContracts)\n\nThis has what I wanted. The only issue with it is that I had to start a new career (having just started one).\n\nI think that my editing of the contract.cfg may only have worked on a new save as even with this mod existing saves still had contracts appearing.\n\nBut anyhow, issue solved! Now onto building a new space agency!\n\nPeace everyone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T04:07:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theJesuit**\n  \nSolved issue"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:05:36Z","Content":"What you\u0027re looking for IS [**Rejector**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108316-Rejector-v1-1-2).

If you remove the \u0022tour\u0022 section of contracts.cfg, they\u0027ll no longer show up. You just need to reject the ones already listed, or wait for them to expire. You can reject contracts without having to accept them first, for those that may not have known that."},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:13:17Z","Content":"I have no idea why it didnt work but even rejecting the contracts more still turn up after the removal of the tour section from the .cfg. It was most bizarre and made me wonder if the tourists were from elsewhere. I\u0027m not a huge fan of editing the stock games files quite like that and nostock solved my issue. My latest save had only just orbited so it was no great loss. \n\nThanks Malah and Targa.\n\nPeace."}]}
