I tried to edit it, but I can\u0027t seem to find the right spot to make the change. Angel, any guidance?\u003Cp\u003EI think the storage unit is great, 240 KAS units is perfect for the size, but I\u0027d really like the MCM to have a storage model, maybe 480 units since it\u0027s about 2x the size of the MSM. The inflatable warehouse parts are pretty great, and while I can use an MSM (or four), an MSM sitting on an MCM on top of an MBU, all in Storage mode and filled with stuff would be really handy and fit in well with the aesthetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027d certainly give modding this function in a shot, but I think I need to be sure how to add/adjust the KAS storage for these parts first, particularly given the puzzling lack of a Parts folder. You\u0027ve clearly done something interesting, is there a document or site I can look at to learn how this works?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for considering the mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I don\u0027t currently have documentation, but I\u0027ll add that onto the todo list. The KAS amounts for the modules were made with the thought that other stuff would be stored inside the module as well. So for instance, the Multipurpose Base Unit has 80 KAS units because it also stores life support and other resources. That said, there is a template for KAS in the templates directory, 046_KAS, that will specify how much KAS is available for a part. If you find that 046_KAS.cfg file and change the kasAmount to 686, you\u0027ll get the 240 KAS units when using the KAS storage template. I\u0027ve gone ahead and changed that value for the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to fiddle with things more in-depth, read on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E In a part\u0027s cfg file, you\u0027ll find either MKSStorageController or MKSModuleController. Both of these have a setting called capacityFactor. This factor is applied to all resources specified in a template. The MBU, for instance, has a capacityFactor of 0.35, while the upcoming Homestead module has a capacity factor of 4.5. The colony templates all use the resource values of their corresponding MKS/OKS resource amounts, so the MCM has a capacityFactor of 1.0. The storage templates are all based upon the MKS storage drum, or are based upon the storage volume of a cylinder that is 2.5m in diameter and 3.75m tall (Rockomax-32 dimensions). Based on the amount of fuel stored in the drum, the base storage templates have 3640 units of storage. FYI, it looks like Squad took the volume of the cylinder, multiplied by 1000 (to get total liters), and then divided by 5 to get the total units of the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to capacityFactor, you have baseKasAmount, which specifies the minimum amount of KAS storage a part has. So if the base KAS is 80 and the capacityFactor is 0.35, then you\u0027ll never dip below 80 KAS units in the part (there might be a bug in the current release that drops the KAS below minimum, but the upcoming release has that bug fixed).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-20T04:59:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2015 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"parrots","CreatedById":2796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T22:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Considering the mod\u0022 is putting it mildly, I love this thing, I should have said that in my previous post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you VERY much for the information, I\u0027d seen some settings that looked like what I wanted, but they weren\u0027t the right ones at all.

The new value of 686 multiplied by the capacity factor of .35 gets 240.1. Assuming an MSM with 240 KAS capacity is half the size of an MCM, the MCM with a capacityFactor of 1 would end up with 480 KAS storage. So 480 (base KAS) * .35 (MBU capacityFactor) = 168, close enough to 167 that it explains why the MBU in Storage mode had that amount of KAS storage.

That should give you the new functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The IMW now has a stack attachment node to make it easy to line up with an MBM\u0027s side nodes in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added a Fusion storage template that holds FusionPellets and Glykerol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Fuel Refinery has new converters for producing FusionPellets and Glykerol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Inflatable Orbital Workshop Addition (IOWA), an efficiency part similar to the IMEM but made for orbital stations. It has convenient attachment nodes as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can now \u0022store\u0022 the IMW, IMEM, and IOWA efficiency parts on the MBU\u0027s attachment nodes. The part will be stored at the node nearest to the kerbal on EVA (the hatch looking thingies on the side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Inflatable modules require confirmation before being deflated to avoid losing resources. Yay for less aggravation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Inflatable modules won\u0027t deflate if there are kerbals still inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The MSM and MBU may be reconfigured in the field to store different resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The MCM may be reconfigured in the field to become a different colony module after you have unlocked the Composites tech node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Made some improvements to the Module Operations Manager (MOM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Corrected description and cost for the Skydock 375.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Homestead Inflatable Multipurpose Module (IMM). Homestead is a large inflatable module that can serve as a colony module or as a large-capacity storage module. The Homestead serves as its own efficiency part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- Optional Components ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule Manager patches are provided to enable Multipurpose Colony Modules to be used with 3rd party mods.
