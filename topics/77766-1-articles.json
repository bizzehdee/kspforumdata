It seems fine until I take it out to launch, it starts shaking harder and harder until things start exploding. Putting the rocket on launch clamps helped a bit, but it only delayed the self-destructive shaking. The after mission report says that some of the X200 fuel tanks impacted one another. Is there something I\u0027m doing wrong? I\u0027ve seen people use parts clipping like this for aesthetic purposes before and they didn\u0027t seem to have this problem. I know it\u0027s kind of cheating and all that, but this won\u0027t be for any serious challenges, I just want to build a cool retro-rocket with a soviet vibe to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screengrab of it in the launchpad. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fy7GepX.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Fy7GepX.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to clip the engines into the fuel tanks somewhat, so only the very bottom of the engine bells stick out.

But I\u0027m running into another problem right away. I placed the parts with 6 times symmetry but the engines aren\u0027t using fuel in the same way. Some are feeding from the central tank, some are ignoring it and just using the fuel they have in the tanks above them. The results is that one engine will run out of fuel before the others, sending the whole thing tumbling out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/niJBxuR.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/niJBxuR.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cLS2ro1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/cLS2ro1.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to eliminate as many clipped parts as possible, and I noticed that when I removed all of the clipped parts the problem went away. In the pics the only clipped part that remains is the end-caps on the 6 outside stacks.
