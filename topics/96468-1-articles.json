Neutrons are dangerous because they do not interact via the electromagnetic force and thus and sail right through the outer atoms of your body, delivering ionizing radiation deep inside your body when they finally strike a nucleus and interact via the strong force. In contrast, alpha radiation, which is helium-4 nuclei, generally only burns your skin since alpha particles are electrically charged, and so they feel electrostatic forces from both the electron cloud and nucleus. (The wide separation between electron cloud and nucleus means that the range at which electrostatic forces are cancelled is much, MUCH larger than the range at which the strong force is cancelled- the effects of the strong force is just confined to the nucleus and a very small radius around it, while the electromagnetic force is not largely cancelled until a few atomic radii.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince a proton has twice the charge per mass as helium-4 does, I would expect protons to penetrate even less distance into solid matter than alpha particles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-12T19:28:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
