Now, the vacuum delta-V requirements of the old delta-V maps once you are in lko are still the same as before (what dV you needed to reach a low dres orbit from LKO for example, is still the same as before - as the orbital parameters of the planets are still the same.) \n\nNow, as the vacuum chemical engines are less effective, and with various previously massless parts now adding weight, you\u0027ll need a bigger chemical stage than before to have the same delta-V."},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T10:48:55Z","Content":"What SGT said, and throw in an extra 250 to be on the safe side ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
