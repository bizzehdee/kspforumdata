When I\u0027m trying to make a rover into an assembly I\u0027m out of luck. I put the command module deep inside of the rover. Such a nice one too. It has a docking port. I even put another port to it so the back of the second port would be a free attachment node. No luck because the only way I could pick up the whole thing is by my \u0022node 0.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a minimum please allow docking ports to be attachment nodes for subassemblies.

That way, when you pick up your subassembly, the attachment point will be the free node on the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
