The idea is so i can edit a cfg, load it into the game, trouble shoot, edit again, reload repeat. (booting KSP takes forever for me)\u003Cbr\u003E\nsecond question is if there\u0027s a way to test the coding of a .cfg without booting kerbal, perhaps using an external program (like unity/monodev).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have quite a few idea about part\u0027s i\u0027de liek to make, but the testing is so daunting if i have to reboot KSP every time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nfyi, i am familiar with the alt f12 debug menu\u0027s option to reload all parts, but i find it doesn\u0027t load them correctly, and it still takes forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T20:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake a second separate copy of your KSP install for testing, and delete the data from that testing install of everything you don\u0027t want to test.
