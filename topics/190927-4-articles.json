Simply up-scaling the nozzle compared to the rest of the engine apparently isn\u0027t enough to make it look powerful. Something along the lines of Rocketdyne F-1 would have been a better source of inspiration in my opinion (\u0022sadly\u0022 that is already covered by the MH expansion).\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) While faithfully recreating the aeroshell that hides/protects all the plumbing and turbo machinery may make that design more true to the original, it also makes it bland and uninteresting to look at in a game. Also to me this \u0022sleek\u0022 look again takes away from the aura of power that the old design had.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Those exhaust pipes are possibly the worst offender here. They already look a bit strange on the real Vulcain (at least after seeing the Mainsail revamp), but in their stylized KSP representation, they make the whole engine look outright goofy. \u0022But this is KSP, Kerbals are pretty much the definition of goofy!\u0022 I hear you scream. But for a \u0022Mainsail\u0022 engine, it is the wrong kind of goofy imho.
