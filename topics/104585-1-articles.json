I cannot even select them from the list. The problem started after I accidentally removed a part that I didn\u0027t want to remove and hit ctrl-z. This replaced the part on the vehicle but also left a copy of the one I had removed and placed to the side. However, the copy is not selectable and appears to have lost most of its texture. It is mostly white compared to it\u0027s duplicate part. I tried to create a new vehicle and that is when I noticed that I was unable to select ANYTHING.\n\nHelp!"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T16:17:21Z","Content":"Undo can be a bit finicky (i.e. prone to bugs). Did you try restarting KSP?\n\nIf so, we\u0027ll need your output\\_log.txt from the KSPData folder. You can post it somewhere and post the link here. That might help us figure out what is going on.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
