This isn\u0027t my first post here, I\u0027ve recently added a rambling post requesting \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25674-Camera-question\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehelp with my camera plugin\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Philipp, although I tend to go by Nistur online. I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while now. I wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m good by any stretch of the imagination, I do enjoy it though. By day I\u0027m a programmer working on predominantly iOS games, largely using Unity. To date I\u0027ve got four (relatively successful) games out with my name on them, and one out which we weren\u0027t allowed credits for, mentioning no names *cough*EA*cough*. I\u0027ve also worked on a number of other projects that haven\u0027t (yet) seen the light of day. In my free time, I used to game a lot, but now I tend to spend most of my time while at the computer coding and tinkering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s because of my love of space, tinkering, and also my inability to do much well in KSP that I\u0027ve been wanting to make some mods. I have a larger goal for the project, which is to make a giant interplanetary ship in space, but in the meantime I\u0027m building smaller components which will make life easier to achieve the goal. I will \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enot\u003C/span\u003E be making cheating parts. The first part I\u0027m making is a docking cam system to help me with (surprisingly) docking, which I\u0027m particularly terrible at, but can also be used for general awesomeness. After that I think I\u0027m going to be working on a fuel management system to help with refuelling. Maybe then some more \u0022standard\u0022 parts like engines, fuel tanks etc. One thing that I\u0027ve got planned for the (more distant) future is to be able to create a hull. This will almost definitely be via a ship mounted tool so will only be available in space. The player will aim the constructor ship and \u0022fire\u0022 four points at a target ship, after the fourth one a quad will be created between them. The functionality of this will be that it will act as structs between the four points (six in total, two horizontal, two vertical, two diagonal) and probably a collision box. This should allow the creation of more aesthetically pleasing ships, as well as more structurally sound behemoths. Overall there are a lot of things I\u0027m planning on doing which I\u0027m sure will have been done before. I would like my mod to be standalone and \u0022complete\u0022 as it were, so I don\u0027t want it to depend on someone having another mod installed to run mine. On the other hand, I definitely don\u0027t want to conflict with anyone else\u0027s work, so I will be looking for other similar work to mine, especially open source stuff so I can... be inspired by it (I will obviously credit anyone else\u0027s work) If there are mods achieving similar goals to anything I\u0027m working on, I\u0027ll also try my best to make the functionality interchangable, so the mods can be used in conjunction with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have set up a \u003Ca href=\u0022kaos-industries.blogspot.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eproject blog\u003C/a\u003E for \u0022Kaos Industries\u0022 in which I\u0027ll be providing updates in character when they occur. I will also update this thread with OOC news when I see fit. Unfortunately this probably won\u0027t be progressing particularly quickly for a number of reasons, firstly, I am currently working as a freelance programmer for a while and the majority of my energy will be sucked up by that, and secondly, there is a significant amount of artwork that needs to be produced for me to be satisfied with my mods. I currently don\u0027t have an artist available to produce these, so it will have to rely on my rather poor artistic skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a final note, all my plugin code will be released under an open source license on GitHub (probably zlib) when I\u0027m happy that there\u0027s a functioning and useful mod. If I make any 3D models, they will be under a similar license, if I manage to find a contributor, that might change depending on their wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve managed to read all of this and not got bored, you deserve a cookie.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
