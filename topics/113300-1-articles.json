I was quite pleased. Then reaction wheels got insane buffs and made RCS only truly necessary for translation. I know that it was likely a concession for the sake of gameplay (Or more likely, new players), but it just annoys me that what should be a spacecraft\u0027s primary method of both rotation and translation is now really only necessary for translation. Luckily, KSP is easily moddable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T06:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s because this game isn\u0027t a niche product that makes realism a priority.

If there was one thing everyone could agree on, aside from a few oddballs, it was that the aero implementation was literally crap. Even Harv admitted it was just a placeholder. Now it plays kind of like old FAR, which is great, just needs a few tweaks. We also got some great additions that will make RO incredible. At the end of the day, I\u0027m pretty happy with the state of the stock game because it plays like the game I expected despite the fact that realism is not a priority for KSP, and I and others have known that for many, many versions. Doesn\u0027t mean we should stop making suggestions if realism\u0027s where we want to see the game go but it also means I can be happy with a fun, interesting, and completely unrealistic mechanic and be totally unrepentant defending it.\u003Cp\u003EBesides, it\u0027s not like we\u0027re going to get a z-pinch engine or fission-fragment rocket to overheat our craft, might as well be the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T10:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that rubs me wrong with that design is that you use \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Rockomax_adapter.PNG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/0/0c/Rockomax_adapter.PNG/60px-Rockomax_adapter.PNG\u0022 alt=\u002260px-Rockomax_adapter.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Rockomax_Brand_Adapter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERockomax Brand Adapter\u003C/a\u003Es for the tank tips (which weight quite a bit and give nothing in space and only some reduction of drag in atmosphere) - instead of, say, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:C7_Brand_Adapter_-_2.5m_to_1.25m.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/e/ea/C7_Brand_Adapter_-_2.5m_to_1.25m.png/48px-C7_Brand_Adapter_-_2.5m_to_1.25m.png\u0022 alt=\u002248px-C7_Brand_Adapter_-_2.5m_to_1.25m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/C7_Brand_Adapter_-_2.5m_to_1.25m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EC7 Brand Adapter - 2.5m to 1.25m\u003C/a\u003E or its slanted version, which double as good extra fuel tanks, and are aerodynamically superior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T11:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice ship: both in looks and functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have to say that heating hasn\u0027t been a problem (except for reentry with intakes).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T13:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even add radiators now, for most designs connecting the LV-Ns to largish tanks and carefully planning how parts connect together is sufficient.
