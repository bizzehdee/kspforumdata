The only things we know about it is that it had 4 main moons, Potatus, Fonso, Daphy and Eeloo (wonder why Eeloo looks like a kerbalised Europa?), rings, and an awesome blue color. Now, why should we players have to use mods like Kerbol Plus or Outer Planets just to experience something we should have had in stock? Can\u0027t we do anything to revive the Gas Planet Two?
