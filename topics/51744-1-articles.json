Just sitting on the runway gives you a small picking, then once dunked into the ocean you can get a bunch more and after you can turn to fly west there are more points in the grass lands and more in the mountains (although landing a plane on the hills was rather problematic and I eventually setted for parachuting into them). Even without goo or materials you can get quite a few points from doing a crew report and 3 EVA reports in each location, one while standing on the ladder which counts as a different report to the one when your standing on the ground and finally a soil sample which is the most lucrative. Once you have goo and materials going back to those places is worth a few more points. Once I had a jet engine I was able to get to the desert and the north pole and that got a load more. Also its worth taking a quick swim in the lakes as that seems to count for more points although the message just says the name of the main biome your in (I\u0027m not 100% sure about this, but I thought I\u0027d got all the points from the desert but I then got some more in a lake in the desert).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has taken me much longer to rack up the points this way but that\u0027s been part of the fun.

A few more intakes on the last plane I showed and I got a wide suborbital with the Ap at 100km so I think its possible with a few more tweaks and then I\u0027ll have a shed load more points \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T10:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo fix.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T04:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice one.

Quickly he pumped what fuel he had to the front most tank and fought to get the nose down. But the obstinate plane refused and he started falling backwards out of the sky. Finally he managed to get the plane pointing directly up and used the engines to slow his fall.

It would have worked, but he didn\u0027t hit the ground quite level and two of the left engines broke off, the right side still had its three engines and despite Jeb hutting the kill switch they where still running enough to cause the now unbalanced plane to cartwheel and smash sideways into the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe thought he was a goner, but then he remembered that \u003Cem\u003EHe was Jeb \u003C/em\u003E.

But he next statement worried them. \u0022I believe this craft is capable of reaching our further moon Minmus, and I\u0027m going for it!\u0022 Without making any alterations to the craft he set off again. This time he was unable to plot a free return and had to do a burn to enter Minmus\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/A2Sw6Ws\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A2Sw6Wsh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A2Sw6Wsh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/86VKvuC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/86VKvuCh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002286VKvuCh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis cost him much more fuel and even he wondered if he\u0027d have enough to make return transfer. The craft did have 40l of RCS fuel which was originally intended for making small course corrections. If he ran out of fuel it would be just enough to correct his course back home. Thankfully he had enough fuel, but only be a small margin of a few litres. Once more he made his return and glided to safety, this time landing by a small lake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all that time cramped in a small craft, Jeb had earned a rest and took the opportunity to go swimming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Ga3h4jH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ga3h4jHl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ga3h4jHl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/f7BdU9o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f7BdU9om.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f7BdU9om.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VvZXKXV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VvZXKXVm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VvZXKXVm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/PJMbiBv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PJMbiBvl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PJMbiBvl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile paddling about he had an idea and knew how he would use the research these missions had yielded.
