Basically you\u0027re going to have to break it down into stages, something to put it right into orbit, one stage to get it to the mun (i usually discard this stage on a collision course), and I usually have my lander set up with 2 stages one for landing and taking off then the 2nd stage should return it to munar orbit/kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T16:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to dock to go to the Mun, you can actually make a more efficient craft without docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing in career mode I\u0027d suggest you research at least as far as Survivability.

One, your life will get MUCH easier once you get to the tech Fuel Systems - it lets you run fuel lines between your tanks to do Asparagus Staging (making for horizontal staging rather than vertical and much more stable, less wiggly ships, also much more efficient). Two, keep it simple. For your first trip, don\u0027t bother trying to take a Science Jr, just bring a Goo pod. In fact, if you don\u0027t have that much science, just orbit and come home, don\u0027t even try to land.
