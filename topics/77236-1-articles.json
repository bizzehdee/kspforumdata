If you have a very low TWR, 8km may not be enough to shave off your speed before landing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, if are in a low TWR craft you are safer if you fly the profile shown. My lander has a kerbin TWR of 0.3 (2 on Mun) and the only way it\u0060s really safe to land is this way. you get a LOT more control over your descent (and landing point) and it removes the urgency and precision needed compared to things closer to suicide burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T16:34:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T22:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother thing worth noting, is that if you\u0027re visiting a moon (say one of Jool\u0027s moons, for instance), and have other destinations after that (such as in the Jool-5 challenge), and your orbiter has a detachable lander, it can be far better to park the orbiter in a highly eccentric orbit. That is, a low periapsis, for a nice Oberth Effect in your capture burn, but only execute the burn long enough to make your apoapsis manageable. No need to waste fuel to completely circularize, unless you really need it for a fast rendezvous after your landing. If you don\u0027t care about the orbital period much, you can save fuel by keeping the apoapsis high.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure this is ever a good idea, and if so, it is only in really limited circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this highly eccentric rendevous (aside for the more challenging rendevous), is that you shift the dV requirements from the mothership to the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets assume your \u0022highly eccentric\u0022 orbit is going right to the edge of the SOI. In this case your lander will need enough dV to basically acheive orbit \u002B escape velocity... which laregly negates the point in doing a rendevous in the first place (if you\u0027re only doing a single destination, and its near kerbin, such as duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch an eccentric orbit means the lander needs more dV capability, which means it must be bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose if the orbiting \u0022mothership\u0022 is much more massive (suppose it has habitats, life support for very long durations, etc), then it makes sense (similar to an aldrin cycler almost). With multiple destinations in mind, the mothership will have a lot of mass for fuel, and you probably have a lander intended for multiple moons, with large excesses for some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it is almost always a good idea if you add a 2nd rendevous*:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mothership arrives in a highly eccentric orbit, and detaches a lander and a fuel depot (fuel tank\u002B docking ports). The lander engine places the fuel tank in low orbit around the moon, and then descends to the surface, then ascends, and rendevous with the fuel tank. The fuel tank then supplies enough dV to make the rendevous with the mothership that is in the highly eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo sense in carrying the fuel that you need to get that eccentricity down to the surface just to lift it up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there is also no sense in slowing all your fuel down into a circular orbit, just to accelerate it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can save a lot of mass by avoiding situations where you decelerate something, only to accelerate it again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*excluding cases where the savings are small, and the dV used to dock is likely to surpass the savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T23:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile that\u0027s true that it shifts a lot of the burden to the lander, your lander will also use less fuel since it\u0027s moving less mass.
