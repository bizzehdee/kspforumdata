Our goal is to send a home built rocket into space at the cheapest cost. Right now we are using sugar (propellant) and potassium nitrate (oxidizer) since they can easily be bought at a local store and they are CHEAP. I have 4 years in model rocketry experience and building homemade rocket motors is a new challenge for me. We are able to make an E rocket motor equivalent for only $0.90 ! Normally an E would cost around $20! We have tested many batches of fuel and found the best ratio. However our launches have been inconsistent. I was wondering if you guys had any contributing comments that would help us along our path of getting to space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is our most recent launch video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ni9TVSW6zVo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here are our motor tests with surprising results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/YSfUfIlkggM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this type of fuel has been known since the dawn of the space race, however nobody is really doing anything with it today.

The FAA will let people launch high altitude rockets with the proper form. Right now we are working well within the legal parameters for rocket motors. We are trying to send up a small camera so the cost will be low. The sugar and KNO3 fuel is less efficient than what NASA uses however it is significantly cheaper. Plus, this is just a suborbital flight so not as much delta-v is needed. As for the body, we are using standard PVC pipe now but that may change if we find a cheaper alternative that is still strong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T03:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelta V is in fact low, that is true.

My years in model rocketry has helped me reassure that this rocket would fly straight for its motor. The nonsense around the rocket neither aids or hinders(aside from drag) the rocket and is purely for cosmetics to show the \u0022aesthetic\u0022 of our low budget. I am sorry about your brother and thank you for the input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_8th_Bit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_8th_Bit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst of all, I would recommend finding a local rocketry club. They will be able to help you especially with the legal FAA stuff.\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, when designing your rockets, there is a lot of aerodynamic stuff to consider.

My college\u0027s rocketry team uses this software, and we built a rocket designed to fly to 25,000 feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, recovery is important. There are a lot of parachute options. Below is a very good paper about recovery systems for large rockets. It may be too much for where you are now but as your designs grow a lot of this information will become very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ricknewlands.webspace.virginmedia.com/downloads/technical-papers/Parachute%20recovery%20system%20design%20for%20large%20rockets.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ricknewlands.webspace.virginmedia.com/downloads/technical-papers/Parachute%20recovery%20system%20design%20for%20large%20rockets.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, \u003Cstrong\u003EPLEASE BE CAREFUL!!! \u003C/strong\u003EThese things can be very dangerous.

I was in a rocket club for 4 years and used this software a lot. I understand the safety concern and I really haven\u0027t conveyed it in my videos but I assure you I take all safety precautions. If I am going to launch rockets to higher altitudes I will need help from local communities since my old club only launched rockets to about 2000ft.

I know it\u0027s far-fetched, but I\u0027ve done plenty of simulations and have ~10yrs of experience building large-ish rockets. This plan would, as mrfox said, use a weather balloon as a first stage. Once the rocket has been lifted to altitude (100k feet-ish), it will fire two stages. The first stage will be enough to push the rocket about 60,000 feet further into the air, and the second stage will take it to space (peak altitude achieved looks to be about 325,000 feet on paper).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve had that idea before for getting an amateur rocket into space.

You don\u0027t really have to wait until after the balloon pops to fire your rocket: you can either fire the rocket through the balloon on the way up (the Army did this for some rocket tests before NASA was formed) or you can fire the rocket at an angle, so that it misses the balloon on the way up. I\u0027m doing the latter, in spite of some slight performance costs, because of worries that the rocket will be knocked off-course while passing through the balloon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for stability, the rocket will be stable if it is spinning.

If you\u0027re making and testing large motors, the government of your country will notice. If you\u0027re in America, they may view you as a terrorist. You will thus have to get the government\u0027s express consent to make rocket motors, which involves certifying the place where you make motors as a facility and paying lots of fees.

I think that it is great that more people are getting into the hobby of launching high altitude rockets. It shows that we don\u0027t need to rely on NASA and other space agencies to send all the rockets. As long as you stay within the legal parameters of model rocketry, you are allowed to make your own fuels at home. If however you start making large quantities and exceed the maximum amount of fuel a hobby rocket is allowed to have, then you will need to ask permission from the government. I like your idea of the weather balloon \u002B rocket. We had a similar idea of a fan \u002B rocket but the balloon is a lot cheaper and efficient. I\u0027m wondering how you plan on spinning the rocket after you eject it off the balloon? Sugar rockets aren\u0027t the magic you are right, but that is why we aren\u0027t called the sugar rocket space program. We are the Low Budget Space Program and aim to get to space at the lowest cost possible. Sugar rockets are a good starter for us and hope to build hybrid rockets. Those get even more dangerous but has a lot of potential. And who knows, maybe sugar rockets will stick around with us and we can use them as boosters along side our hybrid motors. They still have that tempting price tag.
