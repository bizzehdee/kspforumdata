The Kerban atmosphere will take care of your horizontal speed.

Probably a similar height too. The key thing with these is that they allow radially mounted parts to be rotated around the central body of a rocket.

It\u0027s certainly worth considering as a supplement to variable CoT and maybe a preferred solution in our real world. The most efficient source of extra mass comes in the form of fuel tanks and this is where the problem could become tricky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a static situation, one where you are not burning fuel, it\u0027s quite simple to manually balance the fuel load.

So you need to not only adjust the position of the counterweights but also come up with some plan as to which fuel tanks to empty first. If you want to enable time warp while running the engines you need to implement this counterweight\u002Bfuel balancing strategy in software which could become complicated. And for a general solution applicable to many different ship designs the complications multiply many times over (I\u0027m guessing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem may become much more simple if, as you say, the counterweights consist of fixed mass items, though don\u0027t necessarily consider Kethane tanks as fixed mass. The ship above can run the centre engine and Kethane converter at the same time, effectively running off kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
