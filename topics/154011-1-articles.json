I\u0027ve tested it with multiple vehicles and multiple arrangements, and haven\u0027t found anyone else having this problem. I also noticed the thermal system has changed since i last played, just wondering if it has something to do with the new system, or if its a known bug. I build a lot of craft with reactors and folding electric propellers, so this is kind of a game breaker for me. Anyone else having this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot to add, this problem started immediately after i updated many of the mods through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E. It was more than a dozen, and i dont know which ones, and i cant find anyway to revert through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E.
