Send up a rocket core, Attached to that core have some part with a seperatron attached to a radial decoupler. Use symmetry to duplicate the part. Make as many rings of these dibrise parts as you want on the rocket. Once in orbit kick 1 round of them off (decouplers and seperatrons fired at the same time). Give a small burn to adjust your orbit a bit and timewarp half an orbit or so and kick off another ring. Do this till your out of debris then return to space center and timewarp a few days of game time. You\u0027ll have a whole bunch of dibrise in simirandom roughly equatorial orbits. The time warping will let the debris cloud spread out and the seperatrons will make each one have a different orbit from others kicked off at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T22:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would have a lot of debris...If my debris made it to orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T23:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a lot of debris on my save, but I\u0027m not pre releasing any crafts for you to upload!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheScareCake!","CreatedById":103641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T10:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Slam_Jones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Slam_Jones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, theoretically I could upload one of mine.
