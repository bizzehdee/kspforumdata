I\u0027m planning to put a vehicle with several docking ports for crafts to dock, and a orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-esque structure surrounding a central docking port. On the side ports I plan to put docking areas for 2 SSTOs along with extra fuel tanks and power supply. I also plan to add ISRU onto the craft and one of the SSTOs will deliver ore to it. I have OPM and I\u0027m going to mess around and explore in the Sarnus system first.

Try to place thrusters so that all thrusters on the vessel line up relative to the cross-section of the vessel (difficult to explain this, and I recently uninstalled some mods, so now several of the craft that would exemplify it best cannot be loaded in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E . . . but: imagine a rocket that starts out pointy on top, spreads out to 0.625 at the beginning of the command module, then expands to 1.25, then eventually to 2.5.

ESSENTIAL: the sets of 4 MUST be lined up with respect to the two planes the four thrusters form through the center of the vessel.

Always try to have at least one set of 4 at the superior (\u0022top\u0022 prograde) end of a vessel, one set of 4 at the inferior (\u0022bottom\u0022), include more in the middles depending on mass of the vessel and space them roughly equally. So the final \u0022payload\u0022 section will have at least two sets (one \u0022top\u0022 one \u0022bottom\u0022) then the stage below it will have at least one toward its \u0022bottom,\u0022 and the next stage same, all the way to the lowest stage where I will use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E; I often do not use it until in space, but sometimes really clumsy craft need it right from the launch pad to maintain maneuverability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.
