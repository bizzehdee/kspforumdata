There\u0027ll be angry posts all around, and once the dust settles, some people will have problems with a bad download. They\u0027ll have to re-download, and they *won\u0027t* be happy.\n\u003E About five hours after release, someone will find a game-breaking bug with a certain combination of parts or maybe Career mode. Because SQUAD will be inundated with low-quality bug reports, there will be many more bugs that are found but not easy to replicate. There will be a lot of bile addressed towards SQUAD and its lack of wider testing. SQUAD will scramble to make a hotfix, eventually producing it close to a week after the update. \n\u003E \n\u003E The magic will have been lost. Opposition towards SQUAD will be at an all-time high. The Forums will be full of sometimes-heated discussions, just as a great number of new players enter and further disturb the \u0027normal balance.\u0027\n\n...I think I got it pretty *dang* spot-on.\n\nThe website/store didn\u0027t crash, for me at least, but some others couldn\u0027t get it to work.\n\nThere was a game-breaking bug with parachutes, some problems with fairings and the like, and there\u0027s probably a lot more bugs out there.\n\nSQUAD\u0027s gotten a lot of bile, much of it unfairly directed towards the QA testers.\n\nNow, many are claiming that SQUAD \u0022blew its first release\u0022 and the like. Whether or not this is true, it\u0027s inspiring loads of heated discussion. \n\nI do think that public opinion of SQUAD is a bit better than I anticipated, which is nice. But it was considerably higher before the development cycle for 1.0 really kicked into gear.\n\nI\u0027m not gloating here. If anything, I\u0027m stating that unfortunately, the KSP forums have become a less pleasant place since the update. This cycle is rather predictable, and I personally want it to stop.\n\nI know that I have previously been a part of the negativity, participating in some heated discussions (though trying to be polite) and such. I\u0027ll try not to do it in the future, difficult though it may be. I promise. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"}]}
