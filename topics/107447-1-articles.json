There\u0027ll be angry posts all around, and once the dust settles, some people will have problems with a bad download. They\u0027ll have to re-download, and they \u003Cem\u003Ewon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be happy.\u003Cp\u003EAbout five hours after release, someone will find a game-breaking bug with a certain combination of parts or maybe Career mode. Because SQUAD will be inundated with low-quality bug reports, there will be many more bugs that are found but not easy to replicate. There will be a lot of bile addressed towards SQUAD and its lack of wider testing. SQUAD will scramble to make a hotfix, eventually producing it close to a week after the update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magic will have been lost. Opposition towards SQUAD will be at an all-time high. The Forums will be full of sometimes-heated discussions, just as a great number of new players enter and further disturb the \u0027normal balance.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...I think I got it pretty \u003Cem\u003Edang\u003C/em\u003E spot-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe website/store didn\u0027t crash, for me at least, but some others couldn\u0027t get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a game-breaking bug with parachutes, some problems with fairings and the like, and there\u0027s probably a lot more bugs out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD\u0027s gotten a lot of bile, much of it unfairly directed towards the QA testers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, many are claiming that SQUAD \u0022blew its first release\u0022 and the like. Whether or not this is true, it\u0027s inspiring loads of heated discussion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think that public opinion of SQUAD is a bit better than I anticipated, which is nice. But it was considerably higher before the development cycle for 1.0 really kicked into gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not gloating here. If anything, I\u0027m stating that unfortunately, the KSP forums have become a less pleasant place since the update. This cycle is rather predictable, and I personally want it to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that I have previously been a part of the negativity, participating in some heated discussions (though trying to be polite) and such. I\u0027ll try not to do it in the future, difficult though it may be. I promise. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Upsilon\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
