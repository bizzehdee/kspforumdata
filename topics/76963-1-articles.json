There\u0027s lots of useful advice on this forum, which has helped me get over the challenges of balancing CoM/CoT etc. So I\u0027ve made various different VTOLs which can fly, and which I can steer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I really want is a craft which can hover, to lift things with a magnet or winch. Whilst I\u0027ve built ships which can do it, the problem lies with me as a pilot. I can constantly tweak the thrust to make them hover (more or less), and I can tilt them to steer. But what I really struggle with is doing both simultaneously. When I put my mind to steering, I look away from the vertical speed for a while, and it starts to rise. When I focus on the vertical speed, my steering goes awry. This is probably confounded by the fact that tilting the craft to steer it affects the degree of vertical thrust, meaning that this is the time when I should be most focused on that thrust, but instead I\u0027m busy steering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis inability to spin multiple plates might well be one of the reasons why I\u0027m not a military test pilot (there are a variety of other reasons!). But that is not about to change, so I need to find another way to do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I would really like is a mod which takes over my thrust control and tweaks it to maintain a fixed altitude, freeing me up to tilt the thing so it\u0027s moving in the direction I want it to. Does such a mod exist?

It would still need me to do 2 things at once, but it would at least mean that one of the things (steering) did not have such a large effect on the other (vertical speed). But I did have a rather heavy craft in mind, which in atmosphere might take a lot of RCS to shift.
