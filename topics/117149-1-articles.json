They only like to appear when you\u0027re relatively close to an encounter, even though they\u0027d still be useful if they said your target is a full 90 degrees out of sync by the time you reach it\u0027s orbital altitude...\n\nWould be really nice if they were *always* shown regardless of whether the game \u0027thinks\u0027 they\u0027re useful or not. I don\u0027t care if the closest approach is 10,000,000km, or right at the spot I\u0027m sat at - more information makes for better course planning."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T22:09:50Z","Content":"They always show if you\u0027re close enough to the orbital PLANE, but it really would be nice to see them even if you aren\u0027t ... it would let you do an initial burn without needing to plan the mid-course correction even before that burn."}]}
