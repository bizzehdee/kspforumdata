Quite often, at least on Kerbin and Laythe, they keep you from getting any reentry flaming at all. They\u0027d probably work even better on Eve due to the thicker air having them make more drag. So I recommend putting a ring of airbrakes radially attached around the top of the lander, points down. Open them when you do your deorbit burn and leave them open all the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this will steepen your descent so if you\u0027re trying to land on a specific spot on the ground, you\u0027ll have to change where you are relative to that when you do the deorbit burn.
