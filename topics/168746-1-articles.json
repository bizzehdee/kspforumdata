Crashing seems worse than ever. Earlier I had crashes when staging and then spontaneous explosions while staging. Too many parts. Gotta get more efficient. Gotta pop the payload before separating the boosters because somehow the boosters are jumping up and wrecking the fairing and rocket. One big problem solved was all the bizarre changes in course I was taking as the rocket accelerated. stiffening the payload by putting struts from the fairing to the boosters and the core rocket improved this situation about 95%. I think the payload was swinging from side to side and getting into a harmonic situation.

I ejected it once successfully with seperatrons but the next time I had rotated the module or something and the separatrons were pointed the wrong way. I left the doors open while in a vacuum and undocked the tank and it slid out easily on its own when I accelerated.
