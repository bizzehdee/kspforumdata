(legal restrictions on their operation) although you was far below cut off speeds and altitudes, they can be a bit variable and some cut off much much sooner. Alternatively, might have been knocked out by shock on engine cutoff/drogue deploy. It\u0027d be a good idea to test the performance of a few modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I\u0027m suprised you didn\u0027t use the IMU telemetry for tracking position instead of the GPS (or at least thats what it sounds like was being done with the voice over on the launch), which off the shelf modules tend to be unreliable in extreme conditions. If the IMU is capable of guiding the rocket, I\u0027d expect the accuracy to be sufficent to track it. (aircraft all used to be guided this way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat to see another Peter Madsen engine, I love his work. Also props to your guidance control computer designer for getting it to go in the direction it was supposed to be going! (though I\u0027d have done the tracking differently) I think you guys are gonna have to really rethink your recovery techniques though. Heat1X didn\u0027t deploy, Sapphire did not appear to deploy, and LES test didn\u0027t give enough time to see how it would have behaved (but did seem to work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink your next test needs to be a quick and dirty parachute experiment. Also consider fitting an alternate, different parachute redundancy, so they can\u0027t fail in the same method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHearing from a few more people on the youtube (probably danish speakers) It sounds like it was a telemetry error, where the altitude was slated to be increasing when the rocket was falling. A timer or static pressure sensors could be potential ways to prevent this occuring again. Hopefully a lot of lessons have been learnt aside from checking the guidance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T12:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TouhouTorpedo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Copenhagen_Suborbitals","CreatedById":62764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T15:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXkkMDKZS8o?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JelloTickles","CreatedById":70657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T16:02:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was a very nice launch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T16:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy did it leave the pad 20 seconds before the countdown ended?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T17:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWooooho!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice launch!
