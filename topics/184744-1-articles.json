The first one adds another type of action group for controls that let you bind input controls to fields - an axis group. The second adds Action Sets, which allow you to enable or disable sets of axis or action groups. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThis extends what you can do with a limited number of keys, letting you put your craft into different modes of operation. You can even override the base controls with the action set feature, further fine tuning the interface between you and your craft. We developed these extensions to give players more options to control their robotics, but it certainly will be useful for stock and modded players as well.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EFinally, we\u2019ve added EVA portraits, so that you can check data on your Kerbals even when they\u2019re out and about.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-26T07:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will be extremely useful, especially because when you have a lot of craft docked to a space station action groups tend to overlap.
