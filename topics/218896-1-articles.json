I would appreciate, if anyone can help me with this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe max usage occures specifically when I\u0027m in a mission within the atmosphere or point my view onto Kerbin while in orbit. It also occurs when zooming out in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view (where you choose to enter the buildings). However, after the first patch this also started happening even in the start menu and randomly when entering the settings menu. During the mission-related GPU usage spikes, VRAM usage only ever rises to about 7500MB. All data is gathered with MSI Afterburner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I assumed this is an issue with cloud shading or the texture shading. However, turning down those graphics settings has no effect. Even running with all graphics settings put to minimum, it occurs just as bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy hardware setup is: Ryzen 9 7900, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM. I am playing on a 240Hz QHD display. I wonder, if this is a problem created by the game alltogether. However, I am able to run other titles (among them Cyberpunk 2077) with no issues and almost the max amount of FPS with no such GPU usage or heat up whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any tipps or hints or possible solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-19T17:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA GPU that isn\u0027t running at 100% isn\u0027t being effectively used, so there is really no problem with it running at 100% except if you are exceeding the refresh rate of your monitor, in which case those are just wasted frames (except in some very specific edge cases that aren\u0027t relevant here so I won\u0027t discuss them) and you are just wasting electricity and creating unnecessary heat. In those cases just limit the frame rate either in game or via the video card control panel to your monitors refresh rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever if you are hitting your temperature limit then that is a separate problem you have to fix. The vast majority of the time this can be solved by opening up your computer, removing the video card, and then removing any large debris on the video card fan following by blowing it out with compressed air to get out all the dust and other debris still in there. Keep in mind when using compressed air that you let the nozzle blow into the air for awhile\u00A0 to remove any potential water moisture that is still in the lines so that it doesn\u0027t blow onto your card.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your video card is really dirty, you should blow out the entire computer case as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen working with any computer components make sure you work with them in an environment that isn\u0027t prone to static electricity.\u00A0 I usually just make sure I am not wearing any clothes that are prone to static, don\u0027t work on or around carpet, and regularly touch the metal case of the power supply in the computer to ground myself in case I am building up any potential charge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that fixes it, great. If not, make sure the fan on the GPU is actually working. If it isn\u0027t then it need to get replaced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the fun is running, then you may need to adjust your fan curves using a tool like MSI Afterburner so that the fan spins faster at higher temperatures to keep the temp down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-19T17:27:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2023 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 19\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by MechBFP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-22T10:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s ksp2 for you, the game is awfully optimized so it will not use your system\u0027s resources properly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kaseijinsan","CreatedById":201184,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-30T20:22:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, my main issue is not hitting almost 100% GPU usage. I\u0027m also not overly concerned with the temps. The system is less than five months old and I clean it weekly, so there is not much dust or dirt on the GPU fans yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue I\u0027m having is that GPU usage rises and leads to drops in FPS without any apparent reason. What different calculations does it need to do when I focus on Kerbin versus when I point my view into space? I can literally control my GPU\u0027s fan speed via camera angle or when I choose to enter the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd why do I have this issue only in this game while being able to play Cyberpunk 2077 with RT enabled and on ultra settings and no framerate issues whatsoever. If not for these vastly different performance results, I would have assumed it\u0027s some system settings configured the wrong way. But it isn\u0027t. Is this game really optimized so poorly as of yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
