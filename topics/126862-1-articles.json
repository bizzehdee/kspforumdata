The higher you go, a gradient of blue is gradually introduced that tints things increasingly towards the horizon. This simulates the effect of atmosphere. It\u0027s a simple effect that adds greatly to the visual beauty of the planet - my question is, why do you have to go so high to see it? It should be very apparent when at low altitude because of the viewing angles at that height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way of editing when that blue gradient gets introduced?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T00:08:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00191-16112015-multiplanet-support/\u0022\u003EScatterer\u003C/a\u003E?
