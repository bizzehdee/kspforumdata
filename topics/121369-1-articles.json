Grab the kickback and slide it up/down the core a bit - if that\u0027s the problem, you will see the kickback shift away from the core when it\u0027s properly on the decoupler. I\u0027ve seen this with hammers, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is easier to see with 3x or more symmetry, as you can more easily see the boosters bounce away from the core when properly on the decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have the booster actually attached to the decoupler, grab the decoupler (with attached SRB) and place/set symmetry as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T20:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027ve held your mouse below the actual attachement area and attached the booster to the tank instead.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think so in this case, you can see clear space between the booster and the core stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is more to do with Kickbacks having a collider that doesn\u0027t match well with the visual mesh.
