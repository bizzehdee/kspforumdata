I have encountered a problem where the camera is stuck at a weird angle, the camera is positioned to the side of the VAB looking somewhat past it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFurthermore, loading an old save that used to be working results in the same thing upon loading up any save.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRestarting KSP doesn\u0026#39;t help. I can load to a quicksave that is focused on a vessel, but I am unable to control the vessel or switch to map mode, and all that works is going back to the Space Center. However once the space center context loads, the camera is stuck at the side of the VAB, and only the escape key works, or the button at the lower right that lets you save/load/exit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Piper","CreatedById":110485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T02:53:28Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;ve been having the same issue for quite some time now. I don\u0026#39;t know what is causing it, but I do have a workaround. I keep an extra save in my save folder simply called \u0022new start.ksp\u0022 which is simply new game save. I load that from in-game, then go quite to the main menu, re-load, and you\u0026#39;ll find the camera glitch fixed. Then I simply load my last quicksave and my old one is back. If it was a while since your last quicksave, or you aren\u0026#39;t sure when you last save, copy your persistent.ksp file and make that your new quicksave BEFORE you load any new game files.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EditorRUS","CreatedById":153621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T03:07:33Z","Content":"\nPerhaps you mean something like that:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/YJz6qq8.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf so, then it\u0026#39;s not caused by mods (doesn\u0026#39;t seem so at least).
