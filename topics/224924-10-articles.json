Since ShadowZone\u0027s video has come out, various people have come forward on places like the mod Discord to say that some Squad employees were actually in contact with the KSP2 developers in 2018, even being in meetings with Nate Simpson. 2. We also know from their earliest dev blog videos that they had outside consultants such as \u0027Dr. Joel Green\u0027 acting as talking heads to give them scientific credibility. Therefore the idea that there was a complete veil of corporate secrecy doesn\u0027t ring quite true. If they were able to reach out to astrophysicists for advice, why not reach out to the ex-Squad developers of the original game?\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. It\u0027s possible Nate just didn\u0027t want anyone with prior history of the KSP world getting in the way of \u0027his vision\u0027 and clouding his authority. He clearly wanted to be in control of developing the sequel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe still don\u0027t know where the quote \u0022this stays away from Scott\u0022 comes from. It likely comes from some leaked internal message, ShadowZone is not revealing from where in order to protect his source. 4. But would a higher up Take Two executive even know who Scott Manley was? It\u0027s more likely this was someone directly involved with developing the game. Obviously it\u0027s conjecture, but it would be in Nate Simpson\u0027s interest not to have outside experts giving advice that would contradict his own vision of what KSP2 was going to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. This was likely the higher ups at Uber, not T2. It seems they took this decision in order to have any chance of making the mandated 2020 release date.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. But even if he didn\u0027t make that call, Nate was still misleading us for a long while stating the game framework was rebuilt from the ground up, something many of us were skeptical about after seeing so many technical flaws from the first game appear in KSP2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Ultimately, it was Nate who put himself front and center as the \u0027face\u0027 of Kerbal Space Program. If the sequel had been a roaring success, Nate would have been quick to lap up the praise and accolades. Instead the game failed, and therefore Nate needs to take much of the blame as a result. 8. The fact that he\u0027s stayed radio silent since then is unfortunately likely a testament to his true character.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still haven\u0027t mastered the art of quote splitting on this forum\u0027s software, so I\u0027ll just insert numbers for each point.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.
