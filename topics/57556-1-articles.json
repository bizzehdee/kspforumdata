I love building spaceplanes so I took my latest SSTO plane out, took off the rocket engines and put on rapiers to see how it would fare. I got barreling down the runway, lifted off, set my attitude to 45 degrees, hit T, let go of the up arrow and... wtf... the SAS indicator turns into a couple of arrows and my attitude drifts down to my prograde marker. Uhm.. What\u0027s going on? Who broke SAS and what do I have to do to get it to keep my attitude stable?
