The objective of the simulator is to provide precision re-entry maneuvers, a replacement to the now defunct parachute calculator and perhaps a visual aerobraking simulator. I was wondering if there was any community interest in this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, was wondering what tools are currently available that I could improve?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpleivan","CreatedById":120081,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T06:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI for one would like to see a parachute calculator, as the web based I used died some time ago.
