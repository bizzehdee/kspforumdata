This causes funding to bounce around a lot. Upgrading buildings is difficult because the tech tree takes cash. However it also brings in a windfall of cash now and again. Also the occasional financial crisis. Although not an ideal solution it gives a different SETI based playing experience that is worth trying. Certainly more better than stock progression.
