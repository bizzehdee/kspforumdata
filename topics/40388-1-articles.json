Realistic comms towers just aren\u0027t that exciting. One thing you could do is clip wing parts together to make a giant dish (hope you don\u0027t have Ferram, drag coefficient of over 9000! XD). Another option is a tower of girders (2 or 3 of em) and add a bunch of communitrons to the top.

They\u0027re so ominous yet powerful looking, though I know they\u0027re out-of-date and probably obselete/inactive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think they\u0027re also line-of-sight only, meaning that if you were to stand in front of one of the radomes, you would be able to see (if you had good eyes, or a telescope) the radome on the other end. Every time I see one, I get these weird chills running down my spine. Like it\u0027s an old piece of history, still standing.. It\u0027s eerie, yet beautiful, since these are pretty rare to see as opposed to your standard circular radome towers and cell towers... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you\u0027re going for looks, personally, those are my favorites, even if they\u0027re not exactly realistic for space use. They\u0027d probably be great for surface, though... Still, there\u0027s some pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T03:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre modded parts okay? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E I ask because I don\u0027t like the communitron\u0027s appearance, so I use the industrial-looking radio equipment parts from AIES Aerospace.
