It\u0027s fine as is but if you moved the cockpit forward and placed a docking port in the middle (facing up), you could attach the rover to a skycrane. A fairly simple one could lower it to the Mun, and if you assigned the docking port to an action group, you could detach the rover when hovering close to the ground without losing control of the crane. That makes delivery easier and possibly saves you the crane for future use. And it\u0027s pretty cool too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the main ascent i\u0027d build the rover\u002Bcrane, flip it upside down, add a decoupler or docking port to detach the crane once you orbit the Mun, and the main rocket would be beneath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Docking port, ASAS, OCTO2 probecore, battery ring, RCS fual tank, and some solar panels. The fuel and engines fit below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Two big orange tanks, one medium with a Mainsail beneath. Strut up the connections between tanks to add strength. Add RCS thrusters to the rocket or you wont be able to turn it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 6-way symmetry enabled for 6 radial decouplers, then attach to each the same tanks and engine as the main rocket. Strut up the tanks or else they fall apart, and also add conections between the rockets because radial decouplers are not very strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Take any pair of oposite rad. decouplers and put them together in one stage. Place a fuel line between the bottom tank and it\u0027s neighbour tank. Do this on both sides. Then find the decouplers for this pair of rockets and put them together in one stage, set above the previous pair. Again connect the bottom tank to it\u0027s neighbour with a fuel line. Place the remaining pair of decouplers in a stage, again set to stage after the previous pair and connect the bottom tanks to the main rocket bottom tank this time. This will ensure that fuel allways flows to your main rocket, and the outer rockets run out of fuel in pairs. You can drop empty rocket pairs by staging the decouplers. Depending on payload, you should be circularising your orbit shortly after dropping the last pair and can complete the rest of your trip on the main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once the whole thing is built you should stabilise the skycrane\u002Brover by adding plenty of struts. They will be gone as you drop tanks, and also once you decouple the main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget a probe core for your skycrane, and give it some batteries or solar panels. Skycranes also benefit from having lights pointing downwards for night landings. Balance is crucial, you want the docking port/decoupler to be on the CoM of both vehicles, otherwise you will lose stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my first succesfull rover delivery. It\u0027s not the best by a parsec or two, but it did the job. I crashed the rover within two minutes though... sadly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/5xdzbeh75/screenshot64.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot64.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/jrtcmkgg9/screenshot78.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot78.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is a later, more refined variant of rover\u002Bskycrane.
