Solar wind also has a small but cumulative effect. And at least in the case of Mars, the density of the planet varies so much that gravity is actually a little stronger at some points in an orbit, so spacecraft there must continually adjust their trajectories to maintain a steady orbit. I imagine tidal effects also come into play.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-07T18:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understood from the article that they intentionally crashed Lunar Orbiter 1 into the dark side of the Moon because it was low on fuel and to free up radio bandwidth for the Lunar Orbiter 2 probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Moon also causes orbital perturbations because its gravitational field is not uniform.
