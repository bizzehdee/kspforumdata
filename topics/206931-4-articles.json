Heck, even most veteran aren\u0027t always trying. A 90% recovery at 10 or so kilometers away is pretty damn good enough that most players would only try to land closer it they find pleasure in the challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d expect the average player would be very satisfied with a good enough result, especially for a mission that is subsequently repeated for free in the background. And in the remote possibility recovery scaling on proximity from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in KSP1 career mode was news to you, I strongly advise you against changing your play-style for a handful funds you did not notice until then and which the game in normal difficulty gives you in near infinite abundance already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for offering help in case I did not know about the current recovery system in KSP 1. I was aware of it and wanted to suggest something different. So, on the topic of player psychology, I always err on the side of loss aversion. Personally in career mode I land my craft anywhere on Kerbin no matter how expensive they were because I only really care about precision in colonies. Additionally, as you said, in career mode there are virtually unlimited resources, even without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, that you can use to keep playing. However, I\u2019m KSP 2 especially with repeated missions this will change. If you fly a route transporting 1000 units of metal to a colony but land imprecisely, only recovering 500 units of metal, that is 500 units lost every single time the mission runs. Over many supply routes, this compounds and you could run into a situation where you end up stagnating or even losing material. So, unlike current career mode, the landing penalties in KSP 2 create a long term negative impact that is very difficult to remove. I\u2019m not advocating for full recovery anywhere, I\u2019m one of the people looking to incentivize precise landing. I just think there needs to be an easy way to mitigate losses without having to re-run dozens of missions.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224094888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221645481148\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP wouldn\u0027t really be KSP with an autopilot - the motto as I remember it is build, fly, explore.

I mean I have all those mods loaded and I\u0027ve landed on the Mun approximately a million times. I can pretty reliably land within 20m of where I intend to. In the universe of KSP players I\u0027ve practiced this more than a person really should. Yet I still find accurate Mun landings pretty difficult and a little stressful every time, and in atmo I honestly don\u0027t bother trying to land very precisely anymore. I get within 50km, pop some chutes, and use the engines to get down to a couple of m/s wherever I happen to be. I definitely agree though that seeing trajectory both in map mode and in flight are absolutely critical. I started a new install recently and Better Burn Time broke and just not having burn and impact time right next to the nav ball proved surprisingly difficult, so thats probably critical too. All that said I think it\u0027s okay to admit that the amount of time it takes to learn this skill for some players might just not be worth it, and if these kinds of things don\u0027t unlock until mid-game is there really any harm? Players who don\u0027t want them could just chose not to unlock them at all and have more science or whatever available for things they do care about, and players who want the convenience will already have learned to land manually basically where they need to, this would just allow them to get much more accurate with less fuss.

There is a major difference there, comparable to having a delta-v display (assistance) versus removing fuel depletion (removing gameplay). They both fix the problem of having no fuel in the middle of a mission and make the game more accessible for those people who draw the line at building capable craft, but one of them preserves the gameplay and still gives people who are more comfortable with the game opportunity to engage with that gameplay with less annoyance.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s the general policy I think the devs should take, to assist players with every aspect of gameplay while not removing them entirely.

Instead of having a \u201Cmanage resources\u201D button, have recommended actions be highlighted so players can enter a colony and quickly manage their resources without having to do math and balance numbers. As you said, everyone\u2019s line in the sand is different. Mine is constantly accelerating craft, but I don\u2019t think they should program interstellar space differently, I think they should have a secondary way to display trajectories that assumes you are constantly accelerating.

A stock variant of Kerbal Engineer I think would make a good solution for helping with situational awareness, and of course task saturation can already be overcome with slow motion so that the player has more time to absorb the events happening. So why, after I consider two solutions to two problems, do you just go for such a cookie cutter reply as \u0027throw in an autopilot\u0027?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(just a reminder that Scott Manley also had depth perception problems in KSP but didn\u0027t shy away from narrowing his booster landing skills)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224095700\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221645622538\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/23/2022 at 8:22 AM, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think they should have a secondary way to display trajectories that assumes you are constantly accelerating\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfirmed.

So why must the line be drawn at booster landings? Because one person can\u0027t do it? Well I\u0027ve got news, there have also been people who could never dock or even land on the Mun. So why don\u0027t we argue that an autopilot should play the game for us? Because flying is the core aspect of this game, being in control of a rocket you have got to get back safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe skill curve of KSP 2 is going to be an extension of the skill curve of KSP 1.
