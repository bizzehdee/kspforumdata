It\u0027s early in my new career game, and I have the HG-5 antenna that says it can be used for short range relays. So I set up a satellite in polar orbit around Kerbin and another in polar orbit around Mun, but when ever I send a ship out to Mun, it doesn\u0027t seem to use the relay even though the signal strength to Kerbin is weak, and the satellites have a direct line of sight to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure I understand how this is supposed to work.

Mun to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is 9.4Mm minimum, so that particular relay connection will never work. But there is some confusing logic as to when a direct connection is preferred over a single hop. It sounds like a single hop in your case should always give a much better signal -- but AFAIK, a hopped connection loses Remote Piloting capability -- so a direct connection is better, except for science transmissions. So it gets confusing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T15:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so when they say short range, they mean less than the Mun lol. The very closest body to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you are using relay antennas, you can\u0027t do remote piloting? It\u0027s only for data transmission? That\u0027s kindof a bummer. Does that mean you can\u0027t do remote piloting unless you have a direct connection to Kerbin? That would seem to largely defeat the purpose of building a communication network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The wiki says the the HG-5 has a 500Mm range with a level 2 tracking station. Also, the sats themselves have a 100 percent signal strength with Kerbin. When I have other craft around Mun, I have a low signal strength. I don\u0027t actually have antennas on those other manned craft however, maybe that\u0027s why they don\u0027t relay.
