be.\u00A0 The biggest problem is that early on in a career, you need all the funds you can get for building upgrades and just being able to fly your next mission, so you probably won\u0027t have a lot lying around to make bulk purchases for any future missions.\u00A0 And later on in the career, you have so much cash, you don\u0027t know what to do with it anyway, so there\u0027s no real benefit to saving a little extra with bulk purchases then either.\u00A0 There will probably only be a narrow window at best where you do have just enough extra to make it possible but still need to save up for some big future mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, it would be a good option to have in a mod, especially if it\u0027s used in combination with other mods that alter career mode to

an \u0022inventory\u0022 rather than just buy them when needed when launching a ship) just doesn\u0027t seem like it really adds a lot to gameplay, in exchange for the overhead of adding another layer
