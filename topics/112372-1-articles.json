I need to get down there with a guy, then go put 2 satellites in orbit around Ike, and do 6 temperature scans and one gravity scan contracts... Everything\u0027s in place, I\u0027ll do this and then that and then... Feel like a boss.\n\nWell, the day comes and I leave Kerbin... Only to arrive at Duna SOI and discover my separator won\u0027t separate. It just stays there attached to my engine...\n\nAlso, staging the separator for some reason activates my fairings, TWO STAGES ABOVE. I need the fairings to protect stuff when aerobraking... Dunno why, I moved the fairings to stage 0 and somehow the space bar finds a way to magically get to activate the fairings but nothing else in the middle. Sorcery I tell you!\n\nI finally get the separator to work after many reloads and retries (with right mouse menu of course, not space bar).\n\nOnce in Duna atmosphere, I\u0027m aerobraking like a champ thanks to Kobymaru\u0027s Trajectories mod... only to discover that my vessel wants to go retrograde, exposing the engine instead of the bullet like tip made by the fairings... It tumbles out of control but fortunately Duna\u0027s atmosphere is not that thick and the engine and pretty much anything survives.\n\nGet to the Ap and drop the lander, rise my Pe above atmosphere so it will stay in orbit and go land with the lander.\n\nWait, who\u0027s piloting the freaking thing? Jeb! Noooooo! Again... Rosco my man, I thought you would have learned by now... Jeb can\u0027t repack parachutes, I need them to land on Kerbin... Well, I\u0027ll have to leave the capsule in LKO and send an engineer to repack them before landing. Again.\n\nLanding goes well, I underestimated the amount of chutes I needed, but the engine made up for it. Even the Kraken inducing bays work and all! Also, amaizingly Jeb hitting the landing legs seems to be enough to tip the lander... Watch out there my fried. You hit F5, right?\n\nOk, I\u0027ll leave Jeb for now and will go deploy some satellites!\n\nI get to Ike only to discover that my two satellites are NOT connected with separators... I just forgot about them when I imported them as sub assemblies and mounted them directly with their engines. I can\u0027t deploy them, I\u0027m screwed.\n\nFine! Go \\* yourself! I\u0027ll just go back to Duna orbit and take off with Jeb, rendezvous and go back to Kerbin. Lost a couple 100k here but what you\u0027re gonna do.\n\nStage the freaking satellite assembly altogether and let\u0027s go. No no, wait, wait... No... I forgot to add a probe core to the rest of the ship! Now my return stage has become an orange high tech asteroid.\n\nDaaaarrrrnnnnnn... Well, good thing I have like a gazillion backups so I\u0027ll just revert to a time before I have even put the ship in Kerbin orbit and I\u0027ll start over. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nBTW, this is what I love about KSP, if I managed to do everything I did wrog, right, I\u0027d have felt like the king of space and everything in it...

(\u0022Oh damn, not enough chutes... okay, I\u0027ll use my engines.

Even in real life they have a Kraken!\n\nYeah, it really is amazing just how many things can go wrong, both in KSP and in real life. (The engineer\u0027s report they added to the VAB/SPH is a nice 1.0 touch. I hate it when I launch and then later realize I forgot to put RCS thrusters on the damn thing.)\n\nSome of my personal favorite (yes, really sad, but they\u0027re so insane you just have to laugh while you\u0027re crying) examples of real-life space program screwups, in no particular order:\n\n- When the Hubble telescope main mirror was carefully engineered to nanometer precision in an astounding feat of engineering persistence and ingenuity... and they only discovered after launch that they\u0027d accidentally used the wrong equation for the shape and it was off by something like a millimeter.\n\n- Failure of the Genesis spacecraft, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_%28spacecraft%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_%28spacecraft%29). Brilliant successful mission, everything went off great, then when it was landing on Earth, the explosive bolts to release the parachute never fired, and it slammed into the ground and the precious sample container broke open. The reason turned out to be that an acceleration sensor was installed upside-down. Simple guy-with-a-screwdriver problem.\n\n- Failure of Mars Climate Orbiter, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter). Two different organizations needed to talk to each other to specify the size of a course correction burn. One assumed metric units, the other didn\u0027t. Oops.\n\n- A failed test on the space shuttle in 1985, [http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/20/us/laser-test-fails-to-strike-mirror-in-space-shuttle.html](http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/20/us/laser-test-fails-to-strike-mirror-in-space-shuttle.html). Shuttle computers supposed to automatically orient the shuttle by pointing it at the correct location on the surface of the earth, but somebody mixed up \u0022feet\u0022 with \u0022nautical miles\u0022 for altitude. Result: the spacecraft spins around and points at the sky instead of the ground.\n\n...And the thing is, none of the people involved in all of these problems were idiots. It\u0027s just that spacecraft are such insanely complicated things, that have to do such amazingly difficult tasks to such ridiculously tight precision, that it\u0027s a true testament to human persistence, ingenuity, and sheer bloody-mindedness that any of the damn things work at all. I think KSP does a pretty good job walking that line-- making it hard enough to give you a taste of \u0022oh, there\u0027s a lot of stuff that you have to get right\u0022 to get a feel for why space travel is hard, without making it so hard that you just weep in frustration.\n\nMost of the time. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd I bet there\u0027s a lot of guys at JPL and NASA that really wish they had an F5 button..."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:39:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t.

Testing doesn\u0027t have to be so extensive as \u0022simulated launch before the real thing\u0022.

Landing went well, I did the science and started the ascent to meet with the interplanetary stage in orbit. But as it turned out I did some calculation wrong and I was lacking about 500m/s of delta v to catch up with the ship. At that point I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land back so went it ran out I quickly went EVA, grabbed all the experiments with me and started to use my own jetpack. Then there was a very intense journey to the ship with lots of going back and forth between the main view and the map view and I barely made it with literally 0.05 fuel left out of 5 I had.\n\nAnd then I realized that I can either go home right now or wait another 1.5 years. The problem was that I didn\u0027t have enough delta v for the first option, so I had to use the jetpack again. And I\u0027ve decided to go for it, just for the fun of it. Kerbal way, right? So now I have a kerbal doing an interplanetary flight in a spacesuit with about 0.10 fuel left and I will have to slow him down about 3km/s to get him into orbit. I\u0027ve managed to reduce that number a little by using moon gravity assist.\n\nSo now I\u0027m working on a ship that will orbit Kerbin somewhere around Minmus and have about 7km/s to catch up with the kerbal, let him in and then slow down.
