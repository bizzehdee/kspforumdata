The reason why I had to return is that for some reason, one career mission requirement was to conduct scientific analysis of space around Gilly. And now I\u0027m in Eve orbit, about to transfer to Gilly, but realized I didn\u0027t bring along ANY science instrument, not even a Gray Goo! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E So now, my question is, can Jeb do a quick EVA and still get the required scientific analysis, and for career system to detect THAT as \u0022collection of data from space around Gilly\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-29T19:03:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2014 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strainborm","CreatedById":116277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T17:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrew reports, EVA reports and surface samples all count as scientific data.
