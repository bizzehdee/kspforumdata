As for some claiming that probes serve no function is basing it on how they play the game, and there is more than one way to play the game. You can make probes useful without modes by setting certain rules for yourself; cannot land on a body before you send a probe there, make the probe only able to send certain amount science back and the rest you have to collect the rest. I am not taking anything away from using mods to make it harder, however for those that are against modding this would be a viable option for a more challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T10:43:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Liowen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T12:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would actually love to see programmable flight computers (also enhancing existing staging stack and action groups into one system) so you could design executable commands run by ships, probes and rovers (this could also made signal delay an feasible idea).
