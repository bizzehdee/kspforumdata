I myself like flying my helicopters more, but if you have no flight experience they can be overwhelming. I\u0027d suggest you start with a small foam plane of the 3 channel variety so you don\u0027t have to worry about aileron control. This will allow you to get used to the orientation of flying away from you and flying towards you without flipping over and crashing constantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoheli","CreatedById":47640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T18:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there, I have flown R/C planes for many years!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend something with 4 channels, not 3 channels for a starter. Why? Because it\u0027s simply annoying to have to learn to add the 4th channel to your controls when you\u0027ve gotten used to 3 channels. And a 4 channel transmitter is useable for more since it has more channels it can control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, the channels you have are 1: Throttle, 2: Pitch, 3: Yaw, and 4: Roll. Roll is NOT included in a 3-channel aircraft (altough it can of course roll slowly due to the forces of the rudder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I started out with a Multiplex Minimag, a styrofoam plane that can be repaired with cyanoacrylate (instant glue/super glue/whichever you prefer) no matter the damages to the aircraft, except for a change of propeller. It is not exceptionally fast, but can perform many maneuvers - and upgrade the engine to something a bit more powerful than the standard one and you\u0027ve got yourself a very fun plane to fly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.bungymania.com/minimag/images/minimag125c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022minimag125c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have that much room for flying, then I would instead recommend a helicopter. I myself went for the E-Sky Lama v4, and I can not recommend that helicopter. It is not much fun since it is really made for kids and not for somebody with a genuine interest in flight. It does look neat with a home made Kamov shell, though! Mine was unfortunately lost when I let my nephew fly it, though x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead I would recommend something like the Walkera Dragonfly 4. It is a simple helicopter that should be easy to start up on, but it does not have changing pitch of the blades (known as collective pitch), instead it is controlled by simply throttling. Spare parts are really cheap too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.rc-airplane-world.com/image-files/dragonfly-4-out-the-box.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dragonfly-4-out-the-box.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso get a training landing gear if you\u0027re buying the helicopter.
