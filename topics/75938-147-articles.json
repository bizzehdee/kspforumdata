Also looking into adding some action groups that set ride height to some specific presets such as 0, 50, or 100. On the drawing board are functions that assist in smoothing the transition between ride height levels for the repulsors so that, for example, you set your ride height to 0 when you\u0027re currently at 100, it will slowly descend to 0 instead of just dropping the craft into the dirt.

KSP is somehow freaking out between starting the scene and moving your focus and/or craft to the correct launch position/vector. Reminds me of back when I was playing Morrowind and installing random mods all the time. There was a spot in the outside world that was considered the \u0022center\u0022 of the massive collection of cells that made up the game world. If a mod tried to teleport you to a position in the world that the scripting system could not get a reasonable return from the locational awareness engine, then it would spit you out in that \u0022center\u0022 spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that KSP goes through several passes before it lets you see anything in the flight scene (abstractly in order: instantiate assets, get universal body params, initiate on-rails physics, set positions of said bodies (crafts \u0026amp; planets included), apply velocity vectors, apply lighting params, retrieve new ship params (parts, persistent params, launch vector and coords, etc), create said ship, attach camera center to said ship, sync vessel with assigned launch vectors for the assigned object (the static object that corresponds with the launch position/vector requested), activate local camera, call event that says \u0022we\u0027re about ready to start\u0022, initialize physics/IU/control schemes and key assignments ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, we all know what the rest feels like. If KSP runs out of juice (memory) during one of these operations, it may throw an exception and, if the operation is not flagged as a critical one, it may simply move on to the next operation that does not rely on the class that was running the previous operation. Instead of reaching your final launch position with everything active and working as well as your awesome (or pathetic) building skills allow, you end up in the middle of nowhere, with non-functioning UI and key assignments, and incomplete physics initialization. Game then starts trying to process new information from the flight scene that is not initialized (correctly, anyway) and wracks up a bunch of errors that it cannot express because it\u0027s out of juice and ... the picture is much like if you were to take an Egg in a sealed jar and increase the pressure inside said jar until a complete implosion occurs. Then burnt the remains... twice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
