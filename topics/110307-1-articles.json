After 3 weeks of struggling with the unmodded game, everything suddenly seemed to flow like honey yesterday. It was wonderful! In one explosive day of can_do_no_wrong, all of the following suddenly happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I got something from tier 6 unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I got scientist Bob to circle Kerbin (solo).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I not only landed on the Mun, but also made it home safely (talk about a science windfall, wow!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I designed and built a tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I got a tanker (with a full 1400 units of fuel, etc.) into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I rescued a Kerbal from orbit. (never docked with anything outside of the tutorial before)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I completed four contracts in one flight, where all 4 contracts required being in space. And then (same flight) I docked with my tanker and gave its second empty tank my spare fuel. (never did a fuel transfer before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat a breakthrough day!
