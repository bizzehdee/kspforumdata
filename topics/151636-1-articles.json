I have launched huge contraptions in 1.1.2 before, and they did load slower than the smaller ones. However, since I play 1.2.1, the loading time has gone up to 2-4\u00A0minutes before I see my ship on the launchpad, whereas in 1.1.2 it was certainly less than 30 seconds.\u00A0It is really significantly longer than in 1.1.2, to the point that I now grab my phone to read the news while the launchpad is loading.\u00A0Does anyone know what causes it, and is there a fix?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue, if it is an issue, occurs with the stock game. (I generally play with only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, but I just tested it without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and the issue remains). I play 1.2.1.1604 (LinuxPlayer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the ships that I built in 1.2.1 are incompatible with 1.2, so I cannot use that older version to test whether it has anything to do with the ship specifically. But the slower loading time\u00A0happens with multiple versions of the same ship, which each have hundreds of part different. I do know that I launched a 997 part ship in 1.1.2, which was fine and loaded reasonably fast, so my computer can handle the load. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if completely related, but I get the feeling that the other screens, including the main menu, also load slower than in the past.
