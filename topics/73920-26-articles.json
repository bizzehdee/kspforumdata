I just use them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, so KERT doesn\u0027t seem to be the problem at all - I can have DangIt! and KERT both installed without MC2 and it works just fine, and I can have DangIt! and MC2 installed, and remove KERT, and... well, neither work. It seems that the problem is that with just DangIt!, an EVA suit can hold 15 spares. MC2, on the other hand, overwrites that and makes it so that an EVA suit can only hold 1 spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem that I run into after that is that 1 spare isn\u0027t really 1 spare. I used KERT to pull the 1.0 SpareParts out, and it still doesn\u0027t work. Getting back into the pod shows that I was carrying 0.999999977648258 units of SpareParts, not 1, thanks to the buggy nature of floating point arithmetic. So, when I\u0027m clicking \u0027Take Spares\u0027, there\u0027s not actually room for 1 unit of SpareParts (We\u0027re short by 0.000000022351742 units), so the retrieval fails. Even after using KERT to transfer in the SpareParts, I can\u0027t perform the repair (because again, we\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E short of 1 unit of SpareParts). This isn\u0027t a problem when the EVA suit can hold 15.0 units, because if it comes to 14.999... or 15.0000...1 or something, it\u0027s more than the required 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo! That said, I haven\u0027t figured out a bandaid solution, even, because I can\u0027t figure out where MC2 is defining how much SpareParts an EVA can hold (though there\u0027s a file that looks like it, it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything), but I am very much certain that\u0027s the issue that\u0027s happening here.

Or, at least, it\u0027s not making the situation with MC2 any better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway! So, I pulled down the source for DangIt! to fiddle with, and set it to reset the EVA\u0027s max amount to the value DangIt! sets if something else set it to lower, and, after realizing I don\u0027t know C# and wrestling with it for a while, got that to function, giving the EVA suit 15.0 capacity again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking spares still didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut KERT did, sort of.
