The idea was then to launch the test flight from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I soon learned that physics doesn\u0027t work like that. Put as simply as possible, by increasing the mass by 1.7 times I also increased inertia by the same factor IIRC. This would not simulate Eve ascent properly, as the \u0027Eve Simulation Parts\u0027 would have greater mass than the actual rocket (and thus a much lower delta-v budget). Increasing drag by a factor of 5 was also fruitless, as Eve\u0027s atmosphere is larger than Kerbin\u0027s anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo unfortunately I can\u0027t give you the answer you\u0027re after, but I can add something that \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t \u003C/em\u003Ework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: As others say, HyperEdit is probably the easiest way for you to do this.
