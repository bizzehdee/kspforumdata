Hopefully someone here can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand, we have used the proportion of lead/uranium in meteors to determine the solar system formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago. However, the uranium we are measuring was formed in a supernova explosion. Are we therefore not measuring the age of the solar system but instead measuring how long ago the supernova explosion that created the materials the solar system is made from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems there would be a gap in time between the creation of the uranium and the coalescence of our solar system. Is this time gap accounted for and if so, how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T18:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen rocks form, the chemical and physical processes result in elements separating.

So the Lead you find in that zircon crystal later came from Uranium decaying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T19:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did read where the clocks get reset during rock formation, and thought this was the reason we were using meteors to find the date.

But the small sizes of the asteroids mean that they cooled off soon after formation and ceased being geologically active...so when they get bashed apart and the pieces fall on Earth as meteorites, we have rocks that are much more likely to come from a time close to the formation of the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t the only method we use to determine the age of the solar system. We can also use helioseismology data to tell from the interior structure of the Sun how much of its hydrogen it has turned into helium in its core, and that also gives use an age of around 4.5 billion years (but it\u0027s not as precise as radiometric dating).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T06:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought we already found some cluster in Virgo that we are going away from directly... ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding OP\u0027s question: you don\u0027t need to worry about which SN created us.
