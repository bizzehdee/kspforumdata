I have been trying to fulfil\u00A0a simple docking contract in carrier mode and despite several hours of butting ports together have yet to get it done. I have tried both stock and mod ships using the jr port. The one thing I noticed after a while was the ports would actually merge into each other . The graphics would show something like what would happen if the one port was not there. Ie the collision didnt seem to occur until the base mount area of the port. At this point I am considering trying to mod one of the pilots to have sufficient skill to allow auto docking using mech jeb just to rule out if this is me or the program. Previous version I could manually dock after a few bashes but nothing \u00A0was this bad even when I first started ksp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSliding point of view\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis just occurred last night and I have noticed that it behaves one way in orbit and another during landing and i aircraft flight. During orbit it tends to occur while costing up to the circ\u00A0burn point. The \u00A0\u00A0pov at first seems to jitter then the pov shifts. The pov focus is no longer centered on the vehicle but 1 to 2 vehicle lengths behind. I also noticed that after this occurred that any change in orientation of the vehicle used that focus point as well not part of the vehicle. So if I change from pro to retrograde the vehicle does this large loop instead of just spinning around a point on the vehicle body. I also had this happen on reentry and it occurr\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ned about 8500 meters and just when the drouge chutes changed to safe to deploy. The vehicle would slide off a few lengths and stabilize but as soon as the chutes were deployed the distance would increase to what appeared to be about 1000 meters. Upon spash down the pov would be well under water or below ground level. I built a 4 engined transport to try out the medium gear and while I could smack that onto the ground with out it breaking if I went offshore to about where the bottom \u00A0first drops the aircraft would have to pov shift very far behind. Unzoomed it was just a dot while at max zoom and actually pointing where it was you could just make out the basic design features.I at first thought this was speed or altitude related like the reentry but it seemed more like it was triggered by that change in depth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was running with almost every mod of interest just to see if this made any difference in stability but its actually be very solid and stable compared to earlier versions.
