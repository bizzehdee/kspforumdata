A natural result of this is a lot of Kerbals sacrificing themselves for science. Therefore, I\u0027ve decided to lighten [the rules i play by](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112982-Self-imposed-rules-to-play-by?highlight=self-imposed) for \u0022simulation mode\u0022 where i can test landers and whatnot to their destruction under situations I\u0027ve had probes test before me. (Basically, simulating a known environment)\n\nSimply put: Say, i want to test a craft, what\u0027s the simplest way of moving my ship to a specific location/orbit? For example, if my I want to run \u0022simulations\u0022 on my Eve lander, what would the steps be to move it into reentering orbit of Eve quickly?\n\nPreferences:\n\nNo reloading required\n\nDebug-console/cheats are acceptable\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T13:32:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T12:24:01Z","Content":"WEll, you could use a mod like [Kerbal Construction Time](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-0-90-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-1-2-%2812-27-14%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly) which gives youthe ability to do exactly what you want, just disable everything else (Or leave it enabled, it\u0027s actually quite fun, and it gives you science for building vessels)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T12:30:37Z","Content":"To move your ship into an Eve reentry state, just quicksave on the launchpad, find your quicksave.sfs, and change the orbital parameters to to put you in an Eve reentry trajectory."},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T12:37:06Z","Content":"a mod called hyperedit"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T12:37:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To move your ship into an Eve reentry state, just quicksave on the launchpad, find your quicksave.sfs, and change the orbital parameters to to put you in an Eve reentry trajectory.\n\nI\u0027d prefer not to do this, as my quicksaves are huge because of the enormous amount crafts, debris, and kerbals around the system.
