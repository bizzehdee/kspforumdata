I\u0027ve only tested on Kerbin.\n\nAlso I\u0027ve had a go at deploying a number of times under \u0022risky\u0022 . . . chutes destroyed every single time. Is \u0022risky\u0022 in fact any different from \u0022unsafe\u0022? If not why does it even exist?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T18:46:10Z","Content":"It\u0027s dependent on atmospheric density as well as velocity. 250m/s at sea level is fine, up higher faster is OK, and on Duna very fast indeed is ok.\n\nRisky will sometimes work, especially higher up in the atmosphere and/or with drogues."},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T13:34:25Z","Content":"Today my chutes were destroyed while deploying them at 260 m/s at about 10k height.\n\nAm I sure to survive if I open them at 250 m/s or less with this height or even lower?\n\nIt\u0027s pretty bad if I can no longer be sure if they will survive or not.\n\nIs there some rule or formula to calculate or estimate this during re-entry?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:34:18Z","Content":"There\u0027s an indicator of \u0022safe to open\u0022 which changes to \u0022safe\u0022 at 250.
