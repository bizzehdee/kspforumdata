As far as I recall, I did not change any auto struct settings for those unrelated to the MEM. I also ensure the top port and the terrier (the top and bottom attackment nodes of MEM) are autostrut to heavy,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould someone please give me pointer as to why the CSM seems to flop through the top shroud?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Okay, guess it\u0027s MEM itself -- something that cause it flopping around, but it was fine before I put the BG robotics for the rover deployment....\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT2: yes, temporary\u00A0stop gap solution is to use interstag node for the shrouds and put a TS-decoupler. However, in the earlier version I can do it without such contraption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-02T21:06:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2019 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
