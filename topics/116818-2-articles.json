So yes just switch through your vessels quick and everything should update correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will look into FPS drops right away, Is the drop occurring with the Station Keeping tab or the Decay Estimates tab or both? It may be something updating 60 times a second compared to the planned once per second causing the problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scroll bar issues is caused by a fixed value in the code rather than a variable value, sadly I havent had much luck getting the Variable container to work but I will look into it tonight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : 22:19 GMT \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay I have narrowed down the problem of FPS to be present only in the Station Keeping tab - Working on it now \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have googled the Scroll bar issue and I am working on a solution now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : 22:54 GMT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight so I have been trying to fix both issues, however in doing so this seems to have surfaced more problems than solutions with the Station Keeping function breaking down entirely for some reason...

If I still cannot find the issue I will temporarily remove the Station Keeping tab. The scroll bar fix still doesnt work; this is a result of how UnityGUI\u0027s are used, although a variable for the scroll position is made it is automatically reset to its default position upon each frame refresh, however C\u002B\u002B does not acknowledge Var\u0027s outside of a Void function.

However I have discovered a new more worrying issue with the Station Keeping, here is how the system works for background vessels: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The total volume of RCS resource is reconciled every time the vessel is switched to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This information gets stored in the VesselData.cfg \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This data is decreased as it is drained. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Upon depeletion this value in the config gets set to 0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This causes the craft to stop station keeping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This \u0027Resource Debt\u0027 is payed off as soon as the vessel is switched to removing the required resource or setting the vessels resource count to 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the issue is in the total volume of RCS count and how KSP\u0027s resource system manages flow modes, a long time ago RCS used to be set to a flow mode of ALL_VESSEL which means that resources can pass freely throughout every part without special routing criteria, however now (I believe) this has been set to STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW which removes resources from each stage as active rather than from every stage, this causes chaos when Decouplers are involved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E By luck I discovered this when trying to find the FPS drop issue by using a big multi probe of decouplers, probe cores, RCS tanks and RTGs to quickly put more vessels into orbit, as soon as the vessel is launched to the launch pad, fuel in the tanks connected to decouplers is not considered as a connected resource to the root part, as such the total amount as calculated by my station keeping code does not sum to the full amount, thus the resources are removed as my code believes there is a resource debt...
