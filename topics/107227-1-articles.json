I persevered with what I felt initially to be a losing battle and now I think that the technological curve is finally leveling out and delivering HUGE science rewards. My first simple lander to the Mun and back (recovering as much science as possible) yielded more than 450 science from a single landing site!\n\nWith these points I was able to buy the procedural fairings part. This is revolutionary! With a fairing it is hugely easier to get into orbit.

However, I managed to get Jeb stranded on the Mun. Badly. He\u0027s nowhere near the equator... I tried to fly him closer with the remaining fuel in the ship, but couldn\u0027t slow down in time so he had to bail out. I flew the rest of the distance with his EVA pack, but now I\u0027ve got a stranded Jeb at the bottom of a giant pit with no EVA fuel.\n\nHe\u0027s screwed.

Once I got a few orbits in, got the science to research landing parts, and landed, the science points started pouring in. I did forget to put parachutes on the first lander, but that only led to a fun rescue mission where I sent up an unmanned capsule with a probe core to rendezvous with the lander and transfer the science - and Val of course!\n\nThe tech tree could probably use some tuning, but the game is more fun now that it\u0027s ever been!"}]}
