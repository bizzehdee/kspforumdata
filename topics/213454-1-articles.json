Because After thousands of hours from KSP1 to train my brain this never occurred to me... I\u0027ve literally been making one craft one workspace saves for the entire couple dozen hours I\u0027ve played KSP2 so far... Between the potato smear thumbnails, the autosave mechanism I\u0027ve not worked out, the complete lack of any indication which \u0022workspace\u0022 I was using... I had no idea it actually worked this way... I genuinely assumed \u0022workspace\u0022 was just a weird name for \u0022save file name\u0022 and got to business saving everything in separate files to not lose any of my precious horribly buggy ships.\u00A0This isn\u0027t sarcasm I\u0027m just surprised to find out this is what\u0027s going on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...

This is a game I\u0027ve never \u0022exited\u0022 its always crashed and I decided to not open it again for a while... I currently have no faith in the save/load not screwing up my stuff yet, so I think it will be a while before I consider having more than one thing per workspace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-28T07:26:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2023 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by TechDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatwaffe","CreatedById":226950,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T08:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that the concept is not finished yet.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI like the Idea of that Workspaces, they make totaly sence when you go for bigger projects.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut t it would be great that you can save your vessels well sorted too.
