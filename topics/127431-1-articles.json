\u00A0These dilemmas are made up to sell magazines. \u00A0Any self driving car controller uses machine vision to look for a clear path. \u00A0It\u0027s a probabilistic thing - no algorithm exists that absolutely guarantees the path is clear, but there are \u0022good enough\u0022 solutions. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the path is completely\u00A0blocked, the car tries to find the course of action that will minimize damage, but this is only using the car\u0027s relative crude sensors and limited ability to tell what is in front of it. \u00A0Realistic ones won\u0027t be able to tell the difference between a yellow\u00A0cargo truck and a school bus, just that there is a large vehicle shaped obstruction in front. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, the movement planner is just going to apply the brakes to maximum and aim for the least blocked path. \u00A0If a school bus and a bread truck are blocking the road, and a crash is inevitable, and there are no other alternatives\u00A0and the school bus is 5 feet back from the bread truck, the automated car is going to aim for the school bus because it calculates the energy at collision will be lower since the car will have had 5 more feet to brake. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome automated vehicle teams are working on extremely fancy software solutions that will allow the car to truly consider every option, including drifting and forms of controlled skids in order to evade obstructions. \u00A0So under some circumstances, you might come around a corner on an icy road and your car goes into a controlled drift around the curve. \u00A0But it\u0027s not going to be the perfect decision every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese ethical dilemmas are bunk because the car won\u0027t know what the alternatives are. \u00A0Engineers who build these things are far more concerned with getting the machine vision that finds obstructions to be \u0027dead on\u0027 so the car doesn\u0027t crash into things it can\u0027t detect, and getting the software to be reliable so it doesn\u0027t have a software crash during driving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for ethics : \u0022find the least dangerous route (to the car), from the alternatives in the vehicles path\u0022 is pretty good. \u00A0Over a long term, if every car is out to protect it\u0027s own occupants from the energy of collisions, this also protects people outside the car from those collisions. \u00A0Even if there are edge cases where the car chooses to crash into a school bus or truck full of explosives because it\u0027s the lowest energy alternative, and lots of people are killed during the edge cases, it\u0027s still going to reduce the overall death rate over human drivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime

bottomless pockets who also will purchase additional insurance coverage. \u00A0The individual programmers won\u0027t face individual responsibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0When automated cars crash and cause accidents, the whole matter will get dragged into court. \u00A0On the bright side, automated cars should have amazingly clear event records that include high resolution video taken from multiple angles, a detailed software log of every decision made by the car and the key variables used to make that decision, and so forth. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means in cases where the car\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewasn\u0027t\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eat fault it should be possible to show this in court.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem these liability issues create is the courts don\u0027t really have any absolute limits on damages and the lawyer fees are very expensive. \u00A0A jury could award the plaintiffs a hundred million dollars for a single crash. \u00A0And unlike GM cars, it will be obvious when the automated car killed someone. \u00A0(while GM, since it doesn\u0027t keep detailed event records and the car doesn\u0027t drive itself, can hide behind doubt - \u0022did that faulty ignition switch \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E guarantee a death?\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this reason I don\u0027t know if automated cars will ever really take off. \u00A0How will the manufacturers stay in business if they say, kill 10 people (even if they statistically save 1000 lives), and get slammed with a billion dollar lawsuit each death? \u00A0The courts cost an immense bribe to even show up for a case (lawyer fees) and the car manufacturers won\u0027t get any credit for the 1000 lives they saved if they are facing a case for killing 1 person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fix for this is the same thing they do for vaccines. \u00A0If you are injured by a vaccine, a board reviews your case and pays a fixed compensation. \u00A0No point in lawyers - the government has denied you the right to sue. \u00A0The reason to do this is that if automated cars really save 100 lives in vehicle crashes for every person they kill, it\u0027s beneficial to society if we have them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027ll take years for such liability exemptions to ever be formed into law, if ever - it

Stationary possibly kills people in your car, AND you run over the wheelchair anyway. Ramming the chair gets you the heck out of the way of the truck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was referring to the OP, but in the situation you describe I still doubt there\u0027d be any consideration of passengers lives involved. The car would determine if IT could stop before hitting the obstacle in front of it and nothing more, the vehicle approaching from behind is not something it can control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe programming is never going to recognize that person in a wheelchair as a \u003Cem\u003Eperson\u003C/em\u003E in a wheelchair, it\u0027s just a thing in the way, and it doesn\u0027t recognize itself as carrying \u003Cem\u003Epeople. \u003C/em\u003EWhen it does reach that point, we\u0027ve probably got to check and make sure we don\u0027t have new overlords.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-10T19:53:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2015 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
