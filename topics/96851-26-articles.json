There are no visor reflections in IVA. The \u0022reflections\u0022 you see are baked into KSPRC visor texture and they \u0022vary\u0022 a little because of different internal illumination between command pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Real reflections don\u0027t work in the main menu, because visor reflection and shader replacement are managed via part module on Kerbal EVAs. However, part modules are disabled during the main menu.

Otherwise we\u0027d have stock reflective windows. Take the old mod \u0022KerbPaint\u0022 which, before we even had alternative asset loader capabilities (which lead to the DDS loader mod), used texture masks (which were not actually loaded into the game) to define the color replacement regions. I believe it also used custom shaders to accomplish all this. If something similar could be developed to work with the reflection part of TR it would allow much more freedom of texture modification without the need for nearly-completely transparent regions of the texture in the areas where you don\u0027t want it to reflect. Either way, this line of thought isn\u0027t even a \u0022request\u0022 at this point. Just something to look into when you\u0027re up to it. If texture-mask usage could be done before, surely it can be done again. Otherwise, we\u0027ll never be able to have freely-retextured parts \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E reflections.\u003Cp\u003EAnother way of going might be if we could simply invert the behavior of the \u0022reflection plugin\u0022 part of TR in that instead of non reflecting in the transparent areas of the texture, it would treat the transparent areas \u003Cem\u003Eas\u003C/em\u003E the reflective areas. Granted, you\u0027d have to cross some wires somewhere between the texture load and the reflection rendering, and current mod authors would have to invert all their alpha levels to match it, but it would sure do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know much about all this though, just thinking out loud, so to speak.

Also it looked like maybe the colors weren\u0027t matching up like they should. I put Bill, Bob and Jeb in a capsule and they came out in 2 red collars and 1 yellow in EVA. I\u0027ll check it out again tomorrow when I have more time...but so far, I absolutely dig the idea of telling which class they are just by the color!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to replicate. I\u0027ve been trying different solutions (arm bands, jacket tops, full recolours), it\u0027s hard to make the suits different but still visible in the IVA window without completely recolouring the suits. Wish I could give them baseball caps or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
