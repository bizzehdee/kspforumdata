I\u0027ve actually been inspired by RougeMason\u0027s writing to perhaps start my own series. Hopefully I\u0027ll be able to get something going, and with some luck have something as good as his work ( if you haven\u0027t already read his series, which I highly recommend reading, the link to his collection is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35023-The-Mason-Codex\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35023-The-Mason-Codex\u003C/a\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for someone who could help me out with making a company logo. I have zero drawing skills so I am unable to come up with something good. My \u0022company\u0022 is Precursor Space Industries, and what I had envisioned was a drawing of a sunrise in LKO with a spaceship(could be anything from a shuttle to an orbiter) in front of Kerbin. Kind of like viewing a sunrise from aways outside your ship. Also in the upper righthand corner would be the Mun, and below the ship would be Precursor Space Industries. The default styling of the KSP company logos would work, or whatever someone came up with, as I have no way to make anything better than what the person made. I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask for this, and would be happy to post a thread in the correct location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, as I know from my experience on other forums I tend to ignore the \u0022Introduction\u0022 threads.
