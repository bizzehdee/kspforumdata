Not sure exactly why it would hang there, though... do you have any virtual network adapters installed? (e.g., Hamachi, or possibly other VPN services). If you do, try disabling their adapters in Control Panel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T19:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a network connection, but it does not have internet, this results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither fully disconnect the device/unload the internet software/etc, or establish a working internet and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr.. just run directly from ksp.exe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a he11 of a pain if your last action in launcher was to tweak graphics, and now it won\u0027t load direct and also won\u0027t load launcher to revert settings with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
