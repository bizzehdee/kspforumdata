Tried it on an 6000 m/s escape trajectory and no matter how flat your trajectory is, the second you enter the atmosphere at around 35 km, you brake down to about 1800 m/s. Hard. From there on it is just plummeting down to the surface, unless you apply some thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Girlinhat","CreatedById":4163,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T14:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use the atmosphere to slow yourself, then your lowest point in orbit will skim the atmosphere, and thus slow you down with every orbital pass.
