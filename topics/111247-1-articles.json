They define the orientation of the node: 0,1,0 is up, 0,-1,0 is down, 1,0,0 is right, etc. Unless you turn on \u0027non-strict node checks\u0027 in debug-\u003Echeats, you can only attach parts using orientations that would work, to prevent clipping."},{"CreatedByName":"Niles_Ferrier","CreatedById":140928,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:15:27Z","Content":"Thanks! But by definition, I have a model that the 0,1,0 matches the part to be attached, but it still wont, Have i missed something? or does the part have to Match as in DOWN goes to up?"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:01:38Z","Content":"node\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1, 0.0, 1\n\nnode\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, -0.25, 0.0, 0.0, -1, 0.0, 1\n\nThe 1 and -1 are important.
