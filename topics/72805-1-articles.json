Time to get this right. I\u0027ve searched the forum and YouTube videos; no joy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I launch and hit my apoapsis, I cannot achieve periapsis without significantly increasing apoapsis. Prior to apoapsis, I ensure the rocket is tangential to the surface curve (navbal is half brown (right side), half blue (left side). Just before apoapsis, I kick on the engines to full burn. Everything goes well, the periapsis increases (from negative) with minimal disturbance to apoapsis. Immediately after the periapsis goes positive, suddenly the apoapsis skyrockets into a very elliptical orbit. During the burn, I ensure the rocket is constantly tangential to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWTF am I doing wrong? For learning purposes, I\u0027ve used MechJeb to see how it accomplishes this task without increasing periapsis in hopes of discovering the secret.
