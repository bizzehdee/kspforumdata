In my naivety, I guess I figured it would just be something like \u0022change it so you get all possible science from transmitting,\u0022 which is usually less than the full 100% from recovery, so I made the assumption that would make it so that it gives you all the science a transmit can give you from a single transmit.  Which means that you would then need to adjust all stock science transmit values from their various 30-100% so that they all are 50% instead.  Which may well be more than mere config edits (although, if its just in a different config could it be doable with just the caveat that it won\u0027t effect non-vanilla science parts?). \n\nBut yeah, this is just me acknowledging assumptions and making some new ones in hopes that there is a simple way to achieve the basic effect."},{"CreatedByName":"A Soviet Tank","CreatedById":177853,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T14:05:01Z","Content":"Why have I not found this sooner!?
