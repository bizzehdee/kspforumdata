There\u0027s even a tutorial on it on the KSP wiki - [Tutorial: Apollo 11](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Apollo_11).\n\nThe only thing I would want to add to that would be fairings around the LEM(MEM?) during launch. That can be done today with mods like Procedural Fairings, and probably with the stock fairings in the next release."},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T15:20:28Z","Content":"This has already been confirmed to be added in one of the devnotes (or was it a squadcast?).
