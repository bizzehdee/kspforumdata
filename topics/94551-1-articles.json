The above plot contains all the information a player needs when designing craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, increasing TWR increases efficiency while increasing TVR decreases efficiency. Increasing TWR increases efficiency by allowing the craft to aim more horizontal, thereby, using more of its fuel to accelerate into orbit instead of fighting gravity. Increasing TVR decreases efficiency since, for a given DVR, less fuel is burned. This, in turn, results in a more constant TWR during the flight, and therefore, a longer flight as well as a steeper angle above vertical, causing more fuel to be wasted fighting gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, for low TVR, lower TWR are needed for a given efficiency; similarly, for a higher TVR, a higher TWR is needed to obtain the same efficiency. This is the direct result of the trends described above, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eis the most important result of the simulation\u003C/strong\u003E: thus, for two crafts with the same ISP engine, the craft on Minmus will require a higher TWR for the same efficiency as a craft on Mun, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, this model should be easy to test. Since efficiency is not a function of DVR (i.e. size or scale), two craft with the same TWR can be compared on the same planet with different ISP engines or on different planets with the same engine, and the craft with the larger ISP engine or equivalently on the planet with a smaller orbital velocity should have reduced efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in case you dont believe that efficiency is independent of DVR for all TWR and TVR: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4nr9GlL.gif\u0022 alt=\u00224nr9GlL.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcel Versions of the Simulator: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/sddikc3qzv37zyx/Horizontal%20Orbital%20Insertion%20Simulator%20v1.0.xlsx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVersion 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9o3vqf9hlzyzpmf/Horizontal%20Orbital%20Insertion%20Simulator%20v2.0.xlsx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVersion 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/737gcgkaqobuv7i/Horizontal%20Orbital%20Insertion%20Simulator%20v3.0%20with%20Macros.xlsm?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVersion 3 with Macros\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-29T22:42:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2014 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T05:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh, did you not \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103890-Non-Dimensional-Model-for-Optimal-Horizontal-Launch-Efficiency\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealready post this\u003C/a\u003E in what is really the more appropriate forum?

I agree, they will need less mass of fuel-- that is what increasing ISP does. However, knowing this, players are likely to decrease the mass of their fuel accordingly (!) such that they will have the same total deltaV, not realizing that they need more deltaV to get into orbit due to reduced efficiency (assuming they also adjusted their engines to maintain the same TWR)....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot starting TWR. Final TWR. A craft with total mass of 3 tons, a dry mass of 1 ton, and a starting TWR of 2, will have a final TWR of 6 just as its fuel runs out - since its mass decreases threefold. Let\u0027s say .2 tons of that is tankage, .8 tons is the engine. The engine thus has a theoretical maximum TWR of 7.5, in an ideal craft without tankage. An LV-N, however, has high I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, but awful TWR - around 3.5, IIRC. Whatever the starting TWR and FMR, it can never go beyond that 3.5 TWR because that\u0027s how much the engines themselves weigh, even disregarding tankage.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is true but not relevant at all.
