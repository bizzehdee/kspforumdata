I have noticed that nuclear engines \u0022ISP\u0022 isnt working. They are not most effective engines.\n\n\u0022kerbal engineer redux\u0022 mod showed me, that nuclear engines give way less delta-v than LV-909. I though this is mod error, so i tested it...\n\nI flew 2 similar space ships into orbit (140 km around kerbin) [ Mk1 comand pod \u002B FL-T200 Fuel Tank \u002B Engine ] with another rocket. Saved game (F5), then flew \u0022prograde\u0022 with rocket from same point of space, same speed. (I quickloaded before i flew another one).\n\nAnd results are :\n\nStarting speed (orbit) : 2182 m/s\n\nFinal speed with LV-909 - 3927 m/s\n\nFinal speed with Nuclear - 2911 m/s\n\nThis means that LV-909 is way better that nuclear. Is it just for me, or this is global bug? I though nuclear must be most efficient engines... with 800 ISP... and its not... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:02:49Z","Content":"That is as intended. Nuclear engines won\u0027t outperform the LV909 until you are using much more propellant than a single small tank.\n\nReview the rocket equation:\n\ndV = Isp \\* G\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E \\* ln(WetMass/DryMass)\n\nFor the rocket described, the additional dry mass of the heavier LV-N outweighs its higher Isp. Try it with a much larger tank and you will see the efficiency benefit of the higher Isp.\n\nOh, and welcome to the forums!"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:05:24Z","Content":"Also since 1.0 nuclear engines no longer use LF\u002BO but only liquid fuel; then the oxidizer in your tank is just dead weight."},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:16:00Z","Content":"Fuel fraction is a factor in Delta-V.

Their low thrust, high weight and insane efficiency makes them prominent interplanetary long range engines. You need to put them on larger tanks, though, and shouldn\u0027t go for a thrust to weight ratio higher than 0.5 (usually 0.3 is a good starting point).\n\nI recommend using the kerbal engineer mod, it will show you delta-v and T/W ratio during construction and flight, aside from adding some nice optional hud elements.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-23-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-23-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-3)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T18:39:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bzz","CreatedById":142563,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:09:59Z","Content":"Thaks for answering! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I tested by adding more \u0022dead mass\u0022 without fuel and... looks like Nuclear engine becomes better than LV-909 only at about 0.03 TWR...\n\nThats not good enougt!

The 909 is only better with little fuel tanks, it results in lighter ships, since the LVN is 9 times as heavy. Take a 18 ton tank and then compare both engines performance.\n\nNever go for fuel tanks lighter than the engines they are attached too, that will always result it terrible efficiency.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T18:44:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bzz","CreatedById":142563,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:48:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You misunderstand.

Sounds good to me. When I added enough LF to approach the weight of the LV-909 setup, I had about 6.5k dV. So yes, when it comes to bigger ships with low TWR, LV-Ns are still king."}]}
