One thing that blows my mind is the sheer scale of the world you are given to explore. When you consider the total landmass added together of all the worlds, excluding Jool and Kerbol(the sun), it beats the largest game world out there hands-down, which many might say would be Daggerfall, but I don\u0027t consider that since apparently it is randomly generated. The only game world that beats KSP in size is of course EVE, but you can\u0027t land on planets short of switching over to Dust514.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the ability to build your own little communities on the worlds, one can hardly argue there is nothing to see. Already with .21 there is a massive terrain change to the Mun, promising the chance of many interesting discoveries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this can also be enhanced with mods, especially when you consider that player-made worlds can also be added through that device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a big amazing world out there.
