I want Kerbin atmosphere to go all the way out almost to 100km, without changing the atmosphere density at any existing point. So I\u0027m not trying to change the pressure at sea level, and not trying to change the scale height. Just the point at which it cuts to vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know how I can do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 70km, Kerbin atmosphere would be 84,250 nanopascals. At 100km, it would be about 0.2088 nanopascals. My guess is that it cuts off at exactly 100 micropascals, and I\u0027d prefer it cut off at a nanopascal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some calculations, I realize it cuts off at 101.326 millipascals, exactly 1/1,000,000th of sea level pressure.
