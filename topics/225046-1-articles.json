The entire team has been laid off, it\u0027s been near radio silence, and they\u0027ve confirmed to be having severe difficulty selling the IP and the game rights to other companies. The future of KSP2 is most likely going to end negatively unless something changes. I would like it to return and be revived somehow, even though I know this is extremely unlikely. Recent developments and investigative journalism have revealed that this is largely the fault of Take-Two Interactive. I have very little control over Take-Two Interactive as a random citizen of some random place that is inconsequential to their company, but there is \u003Cem\u003Eexactly one thing\u003C/em\u003E that I as a consumer can do to vocally express my distaste and exert some sort of force on the emotionless behemoth that is Take-Two Interactive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI, as a previously-semi-frequent customer of Take-Two Interactive\u0027s games, will refuse to buy their products or fund them in any form unless they make the decision to maintain or revive KSP2\u0027s development. To put it short, I\u0027m boycotting T2.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand there\u0027s very little chance of this doing anything. I don\u0027t really care, I\u0027m doing it anyway. It\u0027s not just in the hopes of eliciting a response from T2, it\u0027s also out of principle. I fundamentally cannot justify supporting them and their actions. It\u0027s the same reason I try not to buy things through Amazon or spend my money on YouTube Premium. Sure, these services may make my life a little more enjoyable and convenient, as some games from T2 may. But I have to draw a line because I do not appreciate it when the choices of where I spend my money directly support things I disdain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat T2 did to the development of KSP2 is, in my moral code, inexcusable. Their actions were the primary cause of KSP2\u0027s fate whilst they allowed the blame to be redirected to the largely-innocent development team. It is obvious Intercept Games made a few mistakes, but they were given a very difficult opening by the grandmaster, and even one minor blunder would\u0027ve been enough to ruin the game. I do not blame Intercept Games. I do not blame Nate Simpson for overpromising and underdelivering (his entire job was to dream big, and dream big he did). I do not blame the programmers for making a buggy mess of a game that took a whole year to become nearly as stable and half as performant as vanilla KSP1. I do not blame the community managers for not telling the community just how difficult and rocky things looked from the inside, and instead assuring us that everything was going fine. I see no reason to when the core of their problems was the funding they were given, the task they were given, and the time they were given. All of these problems were, for the most part, the cause of Take-Two Interactive and their demands for KSP2\u0027s production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy boycotting T2, I\u0027m not missing out on much anyway, they\u0027ve sorta shredded whatever trust I had in their ability to properly manage a game development/production studio. They had a few games I was interested in, and I\u0027m a fan of a few of their series, but there are many other game development studios out there that I\u0027d much rather support. I\u0027ve been considering buying Hades due to its good reputation, but recently, I\u0027ve found it much easier to resist buying it and being perfectly satisfied with the games in my library. Maybe Civilization VI would\u0027ve been nice to try, but I\u0027m much more easily dissuaded by the price tag than I was a few months ago, and perhaps I can instead look at other 4X games. Sure, I\u0027ve been wanting to try Sid Meier\u0027s Railroads! for a while, but honestly, maybe I should just go outside and visit the cargo train yard in my town and do real actual trainspotting. I have no need for any of their games, especially when they could just lay off a game\u0027s entire development studio if the short-term forecast for a game is in the red, simultaneously stifling the future potential of the game as well as uprooting the lives of dozens to hundreds of hardworking developers. This is the kind of thing they\u0027ve been doing for a while-- KSP2 just happens to be probably the most publicized, most recent, and largest example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoin the boycott if you feel like it, don\u0027t join if you don\u0027t feel like it.
