This is the sixth iteration of my Tylo hardware, this took some effort (see also \u0022Best Explosions\u0022). Rule-of-thumb estimates for the lander and ascent stage performance were obtained by flying the stuff on Kerbin. But actually flying Kerbonauts there I did only twice: the first time I killed them, and then I started building Tylo-specific hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got very far with the beginner approach of gradually making my standart rocket/lander stuff bigger for each new destination, before Tylo I never left anything in orbit but returned with part of the stuff that landed. Mun, Minmus, Duna, Pol, even Vall worked this way, and up to this point I had always brought my Kerbals back. This changed on Tylo, were three Kerbonauts impacted at a scary speed. So I had to solve Tylo, it would suck to see it whenever going to Jool and feel defeated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut doing Tylo without knowing what the stuff I was putting together could actually deliver is STUPID.
