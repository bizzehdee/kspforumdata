This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply not true, it is not a fundamental condition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can find only an average, statistically, as to what happens.-feynman lectures physics introduction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work with reverse genetics and penetrance you are too aware of the laws of mass action as it applies to biologicals and behavior. I mean one thing he gets sort of wrong, that physics changes with scale, but is not true, there can be quirky people\u0026lt;-me, bacteria, stars or galaxies. There is uncertainty at all levels of observations, the difference at the quantum scale and larger scales is that the QS uncertainty has a core definition, where as uncertainty at the large scale may have an intrinsically complex and unresolvable maltiparametric basis. I suspect that even at the atomic scale there is a certain smoothness in space that becomes chaotic at Planck\u0027s scale, these becomes the quirks with a potential uniformity between these, and there might be scales below these where this uniformity becomes chaos that are only fathomable by handling uncertainties on the Plancks scale.
