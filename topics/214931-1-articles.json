This was a feature later added to KSP1 (1.12), and I am sure the devs, who are also KSP1 players, will add this as the game progresses.

It has been used successfully a number of times, so I know that staging, fuel lines and everything else on it works. I am developing a craft designed to go to Duna and remain in orbit while some of the crew descend in a lander in \u0022Duna Mission\u0022 workspace. I surmise that the lander I developed in \u0022Mun Landers\u0022 would work perfectly. Instead of making the craft again, and potentially making an error in the build process of my already proven lander, I can simply call up that individual craft and place it in the new workspace and build my Duna vessel around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something I\u0027ve just started doing in KSP1 - developing common craft that can work independently but also work as part of an \u0022ecosystem\u0022 for other missions. I\u0027ve shifted to keeping craft in orbit and sending up a refueller and swapping out crews as/when desired (I swap out my crews to distribute experience evenly - career mode, heavy focus on Mun/Minmus landings currently - haven\u0027t gone interplanetary yet: have a probe on its way to Eve at the moment), essentially a \u0022dress rehearsal\u0022 for true interplanetary vessels. So by having common craft I can design new vessels around my existing designs, instead of developing (usually inferior) bespoke designs for each vessel like I have in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
