I\u0027ve been loving the stronger stacked connections for rocket builds but I\u0027ve just come back to a rover that I was working on in 0.23 and I\u0027m now wondering if radial connections are now weaker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d been working on a rover in 0.23.0 that was designed to be very rugged, in tests it was proving to be pretty indestructible in crashes/rolls at around 40-50ms. It has I-beams that protect it as it tumbles along the ground and even when flipping over many times it usually only lost a light or two. I could basically roll it down most hills and after repairing the wheels it could carry on again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever now in 0.23.5 its roll bars are extremely flimsy and just shear off, even at low speeds. The wheels are also much more prone to falling off completely too. I\u0027ve heard some people saying that craft from previous versions had issues so I rebuilt it completely from scratch but the roll bars still fall off in low speed crashes. The main body and roll bars are stock parts, but it also had a number of mod parts so I did another rebuild in my completely stock install. But the roll bars still broke off just as easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave radial connection gotten weaker? Has anyone else had similar structural problems in 0.23.5 with designs that had worked before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a few pics of the rover;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/B5LWX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Each radial tank is attached to the next inboard by 1 radial decoupler and 2 struts. Period. Yet the innermost radial joints can still hold up all the mass outboard of them, and the whole thing can hang on 2 launch clamps in the middle without anything even sagging, let alone breaking.

Perhaps there are more noticeable differences between parts now, some like decouplers seem really strong, possibly other connections are not as strong. I\u0027m going to try and make the roll bars out of radial decouplers or perhaps use radial decouplers as the connection points for the I-beams. In my original design the I-beams are connected to the rover via the small cube struts and in the crash reports it is the connection between the strut and I-beam that breaks. The cube struts are also radially attached but they\u0027ve only broken off a couple times.

By replacing them with radial decouplers the roll bars returned to being strong enough to withstand crashes. I didn\u0027t like the look of the decouplers thou so I tried a couple other parts. It seems that basically any other radial part worked fine and in the end I\u0027ve used M-beams as the mounting points. Even attaching two M-beams together is stronger than when using the small cube struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a couple close ups of the new connection for the roll bars;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MA7QDJW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MA7QDJWl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MA7QDJWl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/US7DtpS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/US7DtpSl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022US7DtpSl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s interesting is the cube strut is one of the parts that doesn\u0027t have a physics significance. In the past I\u0027ve had issues with the octagonal strut and more recently the new decoupler from the NSAS parts which also don\u0027t have physics significance.
