When 1.05 came out, KSP automatically updated and broke everything (obviously). I reverted to 1.04 on steam and re-installed all the mods (most of the RO and RP-0 set). However, now in any career mode the procedural stack decouplers don\u0027t work. I tried reverting to RP-0 0.39 and Procedural parts 1.16 (the last \u0022working\u0022 configuration for me) but they are still broken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stage them, they make the sound effect and smoke comes out, however they do not separate anything and I can\u0027t stage past them. Manually deploying them does not work either. The tt-38k radial decoupler is also broken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known issue? Should I try uninstalling KSP and reinstalling 1.04 from somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T09:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use Procedural Parts, but for next time it\u0027s a good idea to have a backup copy of your KSP install if you\u0027re running a heavily modded version (like with RO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set Steam to not update KSP unless you launch it, so that you have time to move your install out of the way when people start talking about an update soon.
