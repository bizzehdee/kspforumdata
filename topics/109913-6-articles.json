Download the zip from [that link](https://github.com/Aelfhe1m/Historian-Expanded/releases) and copy the content of the GameData folder into your own KSP GameData folder. Documentation on using and configuring Historian is in the [readme](https://github.com/Aelfhe1m/Historian-Expanded/blob/master/README.md) - several example layouts are included in the download. Happy to help if you have any specific questions.\n\nThe new update I\u0027m currently working on will be compiled against 1.1.3 however.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-20T11:12:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2016 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Aelfhe1m**"}]}
