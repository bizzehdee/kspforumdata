This will give you some indicators that are crucial to rendezvous properly. You use the Ascending and Descending nodes to get your ship on the same plane as the target ship -- by burning a little bit in either the Anti-normal or Normal directions (respectively)\u00A0at the nodes. Once the ships are in the same plane, the ship that is in a lower orbit will catch up to the ship that\u0027s in a higher orbit. It is especially useful if you make the orbits cross just a little bit. The game is supposed to put two \u0022intersection indicators\u0022 on your orbit that tell you how far away the target ship will be at the intersection points. The bug is that only one of them usually shows up. But in general, you wait until an orbit where the two ships will approach fairly closely, and then you adjust your Pe and Ap with prograde/retrograde burns until those intersection indicators say your distance will be less than a kilometer or so at that point. And then you wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you are close, you go into targeting mode on your navball and find the retrograde indicator. If you lock on to retrograde, and burn until your relative velocity is 0.0, then you are stopped right next to the other ship -- all ready to dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T11:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key thing is that to gain on a target you need to slow down, meaning you drop your periapsis, take a shorter path than the target and therefore catch it up. \u00A0To have a target gain on you, you need to accelerate, raising your apoapsis and taking a longer path than the target so it catches you. \u00A0That seems counter intuitive when you first start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor LKO it\u0027s generally easier to launch ahead of your target as you need to go higher to let the target catch you, if you launch behind it you need to go lower and you might not have much space to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T11:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made an album to demonstrate maximising cash-for-player-time out of \u0022rescue kerbal in orbit of Kerbin\u0022 contracts.
