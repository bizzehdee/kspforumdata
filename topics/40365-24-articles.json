If we want to derive thrust from the exhaust, the gamma rays and neutral pions are useless because we can\u0027t control them, they simply leave. The charged pions are useful because if we perform the annihilation in a magnetic nozzle, we can direct them and get thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, pions are much much less massive than protons and antiprotons, so to conserve energy these pions leave with absolutely enormous velocities (significant proportions of c). That is the exhaust velocity of our antimatter engine. Specific impulse is related to exhaust velocity by V\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E = g * I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E. So, if we have massive exhaust velocity, we neccessarily have massive specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a given amount of antimatter, let\u0027s say 1mg, we can annihilate it with 1mg of matter to get ~180GJ at 100% efficiency but a lot of the energy is lost as gamma rays and neutral pions. Let\u0027s say we keep 20% of the energy as useful charged pions, that means we have 36GJ of propulsive energy to work with. If we annihilate 1 mg of antimatter/second we have 36GW of thrust power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Power = 1/2 * g * I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E * thrust. So, if we rearrange this equation we have 2*3.6x10\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003E/(9.81 * 10\u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003E) = thrust. Thus, thrust = 73N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you\u0027ll see the large upgraded antimatter reactor produces 405GW, just over 10x the figure we have above, so if we scale it up... 405/36 * 73 = 821N or just under 1kN for annihilating the same amount of matter as that large reactor does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can derive more thrust from an antimatter reactor by heating a propellant like hydrogen, this means that much of the energy goes into heating these particles and we have a large numbers of hydrogen atoms moving quite quickly, rather than very few pions moving at close to the speed of light. By doing it this way, we reduce the specific impulse to increase the thrust.

Look at the Gamma Rays, though, which are actually electromagnetic radiation. Gamma rays are also within solar power processes. you said a lot goes to Gamma rays and neutral pions (which I need to look up soon), but you basically said a small fraction of the reaction goes to usable thrust. The remainder may not be thrust, but it\u0027s energy, and last I checked, if you put a solar panel up in the middle of the sunlight, you get energy. Well. you said you had seen Stargate Atlantis, right? Remember that time whenever Lt. Col. John Sheppard was sent into the future a few thousand years? Atlantis was supposed to survive a few more thousand years so that he coudl go back in time, and fix everything the right way.

One said that the closer the sun, the more energy would be absorbed, so, say you create a chamber that the antimatter and matter reacts within, and through the process you explained, turn a bit of it into thrust, and turn the rest of it into electrical power through reprocessing the gamma rays like solar power.
