So far, I\u0027ve widened the body to make full use of the air intakes and their ducting, as well as leveled the nacelles with the fuselage and wings, while also removing that oddly placed intake on the tailplane. This dropped the wave drag from 1.31 to 1.2. It still feels a little sluggish, but I think some area ruling might be able to help out here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf curiosity, what did you use to colour your planes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagically, aerodynamics are working like they used to again, even though... nothing should have changed significantly, so I\u0027m totally baffled. All of the planes, yours and mine, seem to be flying as we designed them, ridiculous AoA values and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: So, I pitted the Spite against the Rafale, guns only, and it won three fights undefeated... so I pitted it against 2 Rafales at the goading of my friend, and... it was surprisingly even. The Rafale duo won 3 of 5 fights, and lost 2. I\u0027m going to have to pit the Spite against the Flanker next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther update: The Flanker is scary maneuverable, but I couldn\u0027t exactly call it even, because the precoolers kept ripping themselves off due to aerodynamic stresses, for some reason. Might want to look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther further update: The USAF fighter is amazing. It\u0027s ability to maneuver at just about any speed is ridiculous... It\u0027s been beating the Spite about 70% of the time in guns only duels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, my aerodynamics started acting wonky again, which is weird, because it occurred within the same session of play, causing the Spite to start stalling at around 17\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, rather than around 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I haven\u0027t figured out any methods of reproducing it, so I can\u0027t really even bring it to ferram4\u0027s attention and expect a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm...

As a result, both make good AI drones. I snuck a probe into each of their bodies so they should be setup to act as drones. Unfortunately, the Flanker is a bit fragile. I\u0027m aware of that problem - it\u0027s because I removed the front and rear struts for aesthetic reasons. If you add them back (strut the precoolers together, then strut the precoolers to the main body in the front and back) its durability becomes unrealistically good. However, this adds 8 more parts and looks bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Flanker is a bit stumpy. The tail needs to be extended by 1/3rd and the intake/precooler/engines need to be moved back. However, there\u0027s no stock part that looks good as an extended tail section. I used the structural tubes from Infernal Robotics rework and they look great in this role, but I\u0027d like to keep the mod requirement for each craft to a minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe USAF is as close to perfect as I can get performance-wise.

FAR analysis tools (the pretty graphs and scary looking numbers) are importand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: green line is your cross section, yellow basicly how good/bad you area ruled. Blue is pressure coefficient, allthough I am not sure in what way that matters, because I have no clue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that using fairings as nose section usually leads to severe overheating problems at high speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you do the top speed shots, open FAR flight data. That shows whether you\u0027re able to keep that speed using your engine power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u017E for J\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4ger just came up as a big, messed up letter in KSP, so I decided to just leave it to a normal A. Also, J\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4ger just means hunter, so I put Luft in front of it for a bit more precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try getting the graphs asap, but I can\u0027t for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
