Procedurally generated vehicles, if anything, would be my jam - procedurally generated NPC actors that you can interact with/work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBut the point I was getting at is that people are billing KSP as this enormously complex game so full of content that it is entirely due to Squad that they are pouring hundreds of hours of time into the game.\u003C/strong\u003E What I am saying is that \u003Cstrong\u003ESQUAD has significantly\u00A0less\u00A0to do with this than is being assumed.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat SQUAD does is provide you with is maybe 100 rocket parts and a small assortment of planets with extremely bland surfaces, such that you can barely tell any landing site from any other, and none of them are particularly interesting to look at. They set the orbital trajectories of the planets, and the heights of their atmospheres, if any. And they provide a movement engine for your rockets to go places in. I\u0027m not saying that this is a bad thing in itself. But it\u0027s not a very large amount of content, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E not a management sim game, and I definitely would sympathize with people not wanting to pay $40 for it. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe vast majority of the content that makes the game interesting is the ships and vehicles players build by themselves. And if you want to do anything particularly interesting with them aside from \u0022go places\u0022 or \u0022dock\u0022, you have to download mods created by other players.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I agree that a large part of \u0022the point\u0022 of games like these is for players to build their own spacecraft/vehicles/whatever! I love that aspect! \u003Cstrong\u003EBut SQUAD provides absolutely nothing to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E with your creations aside from going places or docking.\u003C/strong\u003E And while learning how to do this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E difficult/complicated, that isn\u0027t due to SQUAD\u0027s careful game design, it\u0027s due to physics!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what I wanted to get at, in essence. So again, I\u0027d definitely sympathize with someone not wanting to pay a 2x jacked up price for a very small update to a game that is largely featureless if you consider SQUAD\u0027s contribution, and thus the portion of the gameplay that you are paying money for. People are talking about the game as though the hundreds of hours of enjoyment they got out of it were entirely due to SQUAD, but I don\u0027t think that this is true. It\u0027s like saying that you would be okay with paying someone else $500 for a ball peen hammer because of all the things that \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C/strong\u003E can build with it using your own time and your own effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo with that said, yes, I would personally like there to be some kind of management aspect.\u003C/strong\u003E The most defining aspect of management/strategy sim games, IMO, \u003Cstrong\u003Eis that you have a lot of units (spacecraft modules, people, etc) that can interact with each other\u003C/strong\u003E to produce novel situations that you must deal with. KSP right now has none of that. Your Kerbals don\u0027t serve any purpose other than to be cute impediments to your spacecraft\u0027s stabilization system. Your mining bases don\u0027t serve any purpose other than to refuel your ships to keep going somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d like is at least something akin to the Kolonization mod, where you have to manage resources across multiple long-term bases. But in the long run I\u0027d like to actually have to... \u003Cem\u003Emanage\u003C/em\u003E a \u003Cem\u003Espace program\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGive Kerbals some degree of AI so they can \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E things without your direct command.\u003C/strong\u003E Let Kerbals control and auto-manage spacecraft systems, and let them have basic personalities so they can be happy or satisfied or angry and they can help you out or revolt against their dire condition and mess things up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMake it so that you actually have to take care of the health of your crew\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eplan strategies for exploring and inhabiting the solar system that involve more than one spacecraft at a time\u003C/strong\u003E without requiring you to constantly, exhuastingly switch around between ships and fiddle intricately with the flight controls of every single unit for minutes or hours at a time. Don\u0027t force me to build gigantic space stations piece by piece all by myself! There is nothing interesting to me about launching a payload to Kerbin orbit or rebuilding a booster for the fifteen thousandth time. Let me focus on building and launching the actual \u003Cem\u003Emodules\u003C/em\u003E that \u003Cem\u003Edo interesting things\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMake science actually interesting.\u003C/strong\u003E There\u0027s nothing fun to me about clicking on some boxes to make a money counter called \u0022science\u0022 tick up. Implement some actual science in the game if you\u0027re going to have it at all - collecting and recording observational data, and using it to make decisions that actually matter to your space program. Let my scientists refine their analyses and models of planetary/asteroid surfaces based on spectrometric data and sample collection missions. Let me share my results easily with other players so we can cross-reference and compare techniques. To make this interesting, I think to some extent the planets and asteroids will need to be seed-generated so that no two players can use the exact same results, but they will use the same techniques.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMake management actually interesting, too.\u003C/strong\u003E Counting money isn\u0027t strategy in itself. There needs to be deadlines (or at least people to keep from dying), there needs to be catches, there needs to be NPC characters or factions who can actually get angry with you if you mess things up, and impose or threaten restrictions on you in a way that\u0027s meaningful to the other aspects of gameplay and the requirements of your hardware and your Kerbals.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd in the long run, let your Kerbals and space habitats develop their own dynamic community/economy and squabble amongst themselves.\u003C/strong\u003E You don\u0027t need to simulate down to nose hairs - you can have Kerbals with a handful of stats and personality traits, and that\u0027s sufficient to allow for a wide range of interesting interactions. Likewise with habitats and economic interaction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying rockets is nice, but I don\u0027t just want to fly rockets to places where there\u0027s nothing else to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t to say that the way KSP is right now is necessarily bad or unfun. But once you\u0027ve exhausted the challenge supplied by Kepler and Newton, there is not much else to it unless you want to do self-imposed challenges. I\u0027ve squeezed out about all the fun I can from that. I don\u0027t think people ought to have to pay $40 for that experience when the game has already sold so well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry, but then you have the wrong game. KSP is a game where you build rockets and fly them to other planets. What SQUAD contributes to it is the platform, a physics sandbox where you can create your own rockets and rovers and space stations and planetary bases. The things you have listed are simply out of scope for this game concept. Also, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to deny that the game has not improved much in the past years. A lot of people have put an insane amount of effort, time and creativity into this game and this clearly shows.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you mentioned that you have exhausted the possibilities that keep this game interesting for you - how many hours have you spent with it until you realized that?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a simple calculation: How much have I paid for how many hours of enjoyment?

If you want to add more to your first Lego model you have to buy more kits... and more... and more. With KSP you just download mods from the community. You don\u0027t just get part packs from the community, you get utilities too. AND you can make your own, if you so choose.

KSP or Lego?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is fun, cheap to expand on, and educational. Yes, Squad haven\u0027t finished it yet but that is because they are constantly improving on it. It\u0027s like complaining that World of Warcraft or Eve Online isn\u0027t exactly the same as it was on day one. Or maybe why was ANY game given a sequel. Squad wants to give us the best possible game. Most games are going for $40-$60 now (including Lego games). Previous price for KSP was the early access price and if you missed that then it was really your own fault for not buying it then.
