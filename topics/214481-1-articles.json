I\u0027m all for beauty in all of its forms!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only very mild objection to cosmetic-only weather is the possibility of dissonance between the visuals and what you\u0027re feeling. I think it would feel \u0022off\u0022 to be landing in a beautifully-rendered thunderstorm without any wind effects on your craft, or have a beautiful snowstorm with no snow piling on your craft, or with snow piling on your craft but things like solar panels still working like nothing\u0027s the matter, or, for that matter, see beautifully-rendered ocean waves but not bob on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand everybody\u0027s gotten used to driving through boulders in terrain scatter and that\u0027s pretty immersion-breaking too. (They do want to make scatter configurable though, which indicates something about how they feel about it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
