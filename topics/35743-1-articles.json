Perhaps I\u0027m just projecting on them and they are always just in varying states of mouths-agape. As the game progresses towards letting you select your crew it would be cool to give them unique personalities that would impact their animated reactions to various mission events, for example; apprehension prior to liftoff or orbital maneuvers, panic from excessive G forces or spinning out, boredom during uneventful stretches of time, and excitement upon arriving at stations/moons/planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RazorWolf19","CreatedById":62293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T17:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Emotions are dynamic and they change with the events of the flight.
