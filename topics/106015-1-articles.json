Can\u0027t remember which)\n\n6) Do a barrel roll!\n\n**Result:** \n\nThe external camera scene is clipped at the top corners when rolling, all the IVA elements are fine. See Imgur Album, images 4 \u0026 5 show the clipping.\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:** \n\nStop complaining about such a minor thing and enjoy KSP in Triple screens. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
