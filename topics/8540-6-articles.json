You\u0027d have to be looking really close to see the landing gear flex, and I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s worth the time it would take to implement. Same goes for retractable gear, for me, not worth the effort unless it\u0027s really easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about the exit hatch problem with it not being attached to the command pod. Not sure what could be done there. Unless there\u0027s some setting for where the exit is, does it have to be the edge of the model? If there is some coordinate setting (just thinking out loud) of where the exit is, seems you could set it anywhere you wanted in relation to the model itself. Then, you could have it exit at the cargo pod hatch. That would be nice if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a problem though, once I got a guy out of the hatch, I couldn\u0027t get him back in? There never popped up the \u0022Grab\u0022 or \u0022Board\u0022 prompts, the guy just floated away and the jet pack controls were all weird, I never could get back to the Eagle to get back in. Same goes when it\u0027s landed, the hatch is on top, and if you\u0027re walking around on the ground, there\u0027s no way to get to it. I only tried this on Kerbin itself, so the jet pack isn\u0027t strong enough to lift you off the ground to get back in. This also could be my clumsiness with EVA, still not used to it much yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, great work, it\u0027s been fun flying around in one of my favorite scifi space ships. Now, if someone could build the Cygnus from the Black Hole movie, that would be incredible. How big was that thing again? lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxsil","CreatedById":4017,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T14:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh, i can swear i remember then retracting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, i know about them not doing it in the show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, i still love this mod\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedSpar","CreatedById":6185,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T16:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nori\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nori\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn your website the get it here for MechJeb is point to the old forums. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for finding that.
