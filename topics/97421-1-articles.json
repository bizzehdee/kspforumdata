Like the moon will have a circle that once you enter, you will be subject to the moon\u0027s gravity, and if you zoom further out, you can see the Earth\u0027s SOI (which of course envelopes the moon) and then if you zoom into different planets you can see how far out the SOI extends for each of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen plotting courses in KSP (for example) to the Mun, I can see the icons for where I encounter and escape it, but I really don\u0027t have any idea of how big the SOI is, so it makes it a little harder to plan. Also in simple rockets, it shows how gravity affects your flight path. Like you are flying right on a path to the moon, but then the line curves to show what happens when you enter the SOI as you close in. In KSP I can see the flight path to the Mun, but no representation of what path my ship will take once I get there. Is there a way to see this, or am I not understanding what the game is already showing me?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T05:09:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 05:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T04:58:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn answer to your title question, no there is no visual representation of spheres of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing in career mode, you will need to upgrade the tracking station, I believe, in order to see patched conics in the map.
