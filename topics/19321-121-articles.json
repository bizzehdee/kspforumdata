Then go to static analysis and take down the maximum Cl that you can achieve without a tail strike (you\u0027ll have to use your judgment for that). Multiplying them will give you lift area; multiply that by 0.5 * 1.225 kg/m3^3 * velocity^2 and you\u0027ll get the total lift at any velocity on the runway. Then take the plane\u0027s mass in tonnes (also in the Derivatives tab) and multiply that by 9.81 m/s^2 * 1000 kg / tonne and you\u0027ll have the plane\u0027s weight in N. Lift has to equal weight for liftoff; you can solve this out to get you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evelocity = Sqrt(mass_in_kg * 9.81 m/s^2 / (0.5 * 1.225 kg/m^3 * Cl * Area))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027ll tell you the velocity you can take off at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T01:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s definitely the thorough answer I\u0027d hoped for.
