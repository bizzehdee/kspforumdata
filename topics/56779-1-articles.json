You might try flying the stock KSP rocket Kerbal X. It has enough fuel to get you to orbit and back, but only when you get the moves down right. My style of flight: Turn on SAS (press T). Throttle up full. Fire that ignition. The Kerbal X staging requires that you press space again to release the support clamps. As you slowly climb, you will see that the boosters empty at different rates. When each set of boosters depletes, press space to jettison the empties. You will end up with the large single engine in the central stack. When you reach about 10,000 meters altitude, use your D key to cause the ship to fly towards the East. Settle the central dot so your angle is at the circle marked 45 (degrees). As your stages use up fuel, space again to jettison and fire the next stage. When the ship is about 30,000 meters altitude, switch to map view (M). Tab up the Navball and move your view of the planet so that you can see the apoapsis flag on your line of flight. While your cursor is over the flag, you can see the projected apoapsis. When it reaches at least 71,000 meters altitude or so, press X to shut off your fuel. Press D again until the dot in the center of the Navball view is just above the horizon line of the ball (the dot is still in the blue field). Once your ship icon is close to the apoapsis flag (say, 10 seconds to go), throttle up again. You will see the flightpath grow into a circle and the periapsis flag will appear. Wait until the flags swap positions and press X again. You will likely be in a decent orbit at that time. Your results may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, watch the plentiful video tutorials out there on the subject, as suggested in prior posts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: my suggestion assumes you are in sandbox mode.

Check out Scott Manley tutorials. I believe I learned mostly through trial and error, then realized how I could do better through videos like his. You\u0027ll be amazed at how easy it is once you give it some practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my little tutorial: Using a stock ship (Kerbal X should do I guess) so we know that the ship itself is capable of orbit, launch full-thrust straight up until you reach 10,000 meters. Then, turn the ship to the right and point it somewhere between the top of the NavBall and the horizon on the NavBall (where the blue part meets the orange part). Blue means you\u0027re pointed up, orange means down. What you\u0027re doing here is what\u0027s called a gravity turn. Keep an eye on what stages are finishing their fuel and jettison them. Keep an eye on how high your apoapsis rises in the Map view, and cut thrust wherever you are once it gets somewhere about 70km (you can instantly cut all thrust by hitting X). That is where the atmosphere ends. Contrary to popular n00b belief, you do NOT need to burn waaaay out there. Low orbits are far better for pretty much everything, as they have benefits that may go over your head for now, so don\u0027t worry about that too much for now. Once you reach your apoapsis (or maybe just a little bit before), begin burning right on the horizon line. Your prograde vector (the green circle with three prongs) should be sitting there, indicating what direction you\u0027re moving in. Try to keep the heading perfectly at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA if you want a nice equatorial orbit. What you\u0027re doing here is called the circularization burn. You burn until you hit at least 70km on your periapsis. Congrats, you\u0027ve made orbit!
