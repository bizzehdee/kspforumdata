Pixels per inch in your graphics program doesn\u0027t matter at all once it goes in game. If you meant pixels-per-inch of your model... then that\u0027s a harder question. The answer is - it depends on the inch. If you get WILDLY different texture densities in a model, it starts to look weird... but within reason, you want more pixel density on the parts of your model that have more detail. So it depends on your part. If there are details like hatches, ridges, flanges, windows, seams of a different material, access panels, rivet strips... you want these to have more texture density than a broad, flat, featureless panel would. It\u0027s not a GREAT tutorial, because it was just supposed to show people how I made a part in 30 minutes, but you can watch my youtube video, starting around the 8 minute mark, at\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBxqAXnqavk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E to see how I gave more priority to the detailed parts that people were actually going to see over things like the end of a fuel tank that will be hidden from players for 99% of the flight. Again, not a texturing best practices tutorial... I leave a lot of unused pixels in my rush, but it will give you an idea.\u003Cp\u003E2. It depends on what you\u0027re making. I wouldn\u0027t use anything bigger than that for a single part... For my landertek mod I\u0027m using one 2048X1024 for everything - about 20 parts... For my dreamchaser replica, I pushed it to 2048x2048, for a complete space plane with about a dozen parts in the same texture. For a single part I try to stick to 512X512 max for most simple stuff. Use what you need to use to make it look good, but keep in mind that KSP has big memory limitations and your mod will get uninstalled if the RAM to Awesome ratio is too high. Frequently, as you can tell from my examples, I\u0027ll decide to combine a bunch of parts into one texture so I\u0027ve got the freedom to stretch out the things that really matter and shrink the things that don\u0027t and get the most efficient use of pixel space possible. I\u0027ll post those textures tomorrow, if you\u0027d like to take a look at how I\u0027m doing it. The two mods are done very differently, as I\u0027m still learning a lot, but seeing someone else\u0027s process may help you develop your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I don\u0027t fiddle with any of the import settings... I import .tga and export mbm... and i just do that because that\u0027s what the tutorial I first learned from did. If you ARE using textures with any dimension larger than 1024, you have to tell Unity the new max-size. And take a look at your parts.. in game... both with and without compression on the texture import, to see if you can live with it. I frequently find that it\u0027s worth the switch to true color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I would say yes- a blocky bumpmap is worse than no bumpmap at all.. so I usually make them at full quality. That may be wrong- someone may post some great tips tomorrow for getting by with smaller normal maps and we\u0027ll both learn from it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost some screen shots of the parts, the uv layout, and the texture you\u0027re working on! It will help us make suggestions! Get as much advice as you can on making them efficient, but if they don\u0027t look good in the end... nobody\u0027s going to use them no matter how much or little ram they take up. One final note - many texture artists work at BIG resolutions then downsample. Don\u0027t be afraid to make a 4096x4096 photoshop file, then decide later if you want to shrink it to 2048 or 1024 or 512... you can look at all three and make an informed decision... you can always shrink but you can never scale up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T07:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022artwhaley\u0022 data-cite=\u0022artwhaley\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou can always shrink but you can never scale up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note that shrinking can cause fuzzy details, depending in the specific circumstances.
