For example it\u0027s far from clear that solid-boosted hydrolox is all that great of a thing, let alone that a lifting body RV is useful (if you don\u0027t need crossrange, wings are worth less than nothing). SLS would have been better than STS, but then again almost anything would have been.\u003Cp\u003EWhile solid-boosted hydrolox is cheaper than kerolox-boosted hydrolox (that\u0027s why NASA scaled back from liquid to solid boosters for STS), what\u0027s expensive here is the hydrolox part. A pure kerolox LV is actually cheaper, IIRC, and certainly less dangerous for crewed missions. Solids and crew are a bad mix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI share the sentiment about wings. Unless you need them for crossrange or to recover expensive launch engines (Space Shuttle style), wings are nothing but dead weight that you need to carry back and forth. Plus they increase the surface area requiring heatshielding which adds even more weight and caused a lot of problems in the Space Shuttle. Capsules seem to be the way to go for now, and they can also be reusable even if they land on water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrangely NASA seems to trust SRBs a lot. In the canceled Ares I the whole first stage was a large SRB (which produced too much vibrations for crew... hence the cancellation). Now, I never heard of a SRB exploding, but they can\u0027t be throttled or shut down in case of trouble either. So why does NASA love SRBs so much? Is it perhaps because it\u0027s cheaper to make very powerful boosters with solid fuel? Kerolox is cheap but engines like the F-1 are very expensive. Or is it because of Space Shuttle legacy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"okan170","CreatedById":268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T22:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheaper to develop.
