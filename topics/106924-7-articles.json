From a developers perspective it also consists of the plugin and some shared parts/data.\n\nThe original idea for splitting it up was partially to allow people to only install the part they would be interested in to avoid cluttering up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/Tech Tree with unused parts but also to be more friendly for low-bandwidth users, especially if an update or patch only affects part of the collection.\n\nHowever, in practice, every component has been updated and re-released whenever something got changed to ensure consistency.  \n\nThis would make it a little bit easier for new releases as well as removing spam from AVC and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.  \n\nThoughts, comments, suggestions?  \n\nEDIT: Just as an aside, the individual release packs have been downloaded about 30 times each, whereas the complete pack was downloaded over 1150 times.. that\u0027s nearly a 40:1 ratio!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-12T16:08:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2017 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by micha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foozle","CreatedById":167814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-12T18:34:27Z","Content":"The downloads history speaks for itself, and at less than 15MB it\u0027s pretty small for a parts pack.\n\nIf you just do the all-in-one I expect few, if any, folks will be disappointed."},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-13T05:48:48Z","Content":"Personally I use everything except for the \u0022Kemini\u0022 section of this mod.
