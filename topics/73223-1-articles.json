Players of the old Sim City are probably aware of things like the \u0022Nuclear Disaster\u0022 scenario, \u0022excessive traffic\u0022 scenario or \u0022massive flooding\u0022 scenario. The game itself is still a city-building sandbox, but you start the game with an objective to achieve rather than just \u0022build a metropolis\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scenario you\u0027re on about could be called \u0022Deep Impact\u0022 \u003Cem\u003E[edit: asteroid crashing into planet, for people who haven\u0027t read the original thread]\u003C/em\u003E. There could perhaps be another scenario based on a predicted massive Kerbolar flare. Maybe you could start the game with a fully functioning Duna base but they\u0027ve had a critical malfunction and you have 60 days to get the parts to them and fix the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock game probably would need to be modified quite a bit. I think having a \u0022Scenario API\u0022 for modders would be part of it.

Given I\u0027m not suggesting that players be forced to pick a starting scenario and could just play the game \u0022vanilla\u0022, are there any particular starting scenarios that people here would consider a fun way to start a career mode game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T11:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this already a thing?

Not quite the same as the Sim City-like scenarios I was on about though. You can pretty much load one of the \u0022scenario\u0022 save files and completely ignore the scenario, right up to letting a big asteroid smack into the planet with zero consequences asides you gaining an extra rock to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T02:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but also remember that there have been scenarios since at least .21, and it\u0027s not a finished game yet. I definitely expect to see some more by the time it\u0027s actually officially a game, but KSP is a sandbox-style game, where it\u0027s the player\u0027s imagination at the heart of the game, not pre-made scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
