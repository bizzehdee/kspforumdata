The large decouplers tend to behave really weird, e.g. as I\u0027d drop a stage, they would phase through the droptank, separately from the tank being dropped (as if they were immaterial separators). At another occasion they would refuse to drop all with a single stage - if I had four of them in a stage, I\u0027d need to press space five times - one for \u0022stage\u0022 and then four times for the four decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T23:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a kraken that at 1000000 times more drag force than at kerbin at sea level at5.6 m/s the kraken will chuck you at the speed of light cubed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T23:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022322997am\u0022 data-cite=\u0022322997am\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is a kraken that at 1000000 times more drag force than at kerbin at sea level at5.6 m/s the kraken will chuck you at the speed of light cubed\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m torn between asking how you know this, and running for the hills of Minmus to escape the ensuing fireball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
