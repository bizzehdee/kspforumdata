It is impossible to land with FAR. When i try to touch the ground, far decides that i\u0027m actually aiming to it. When it touch it, far decides that a flat spin would be nice. When i turn on the brakes, it decides that i should roll my plane a little, just to lose a wing. If i try using SAS, it wobbles like crazy. If i use the pitch and/or yaw controls, it flares in all directions that are possible. I\u0027m getting mad. Any suggestions?\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I think i sould give up on planes. The plane i\u0027m using is my new jet, Which landing speed is of about 160-200 m/s, but can land on higher ones and can acellerate at 3.15 Gs near sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re landing at a bit more than half the speed of sound at sea level.. Sounds to me like you need more lift. Use flaps for landing \u0026amp; takeoff, and activate spoilers when touching down to decrease the lift. There\u0027s also a possibility that you need to relocate your landing gears. There\u0027s a landing gear diagnostics vid around somewhere but I can\u0027t seem to find it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Found it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/el8t5kEylRM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last advice: struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-01T07:27:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2014 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MAKC\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T15:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like you\u0027re hitting very high angles of attack and stalling the wings.
