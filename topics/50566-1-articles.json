Since most of us aren\u0027t rocket scientists, we do things wrong. Fixing that problem generally involves either a new rocket design or different maneuvers while in space. Having to launch an entirely new rocket just because some tiny thing went wrong seems more tedious than useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GangreneTVP","CreatedById":73430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T19:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe game can of course have multiple saves, and any claims to the contrary are simply incorrect. \u003Cp\u003EYou can even have multiple saves in the current version of KSP, but it\u0027s a kludge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit F5 to quicksasve.

I can understand your frustration though. Similar things have happened to me (and sometimes still do). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you that a better save-system would be an improvement of the game. One of the responses was a list of other games which, like KSP, don\u0027t have such a system. That list is besides the point and i could easily write down a list of games with such a system ten times as long (which would be besides the point as well). The point is that the KSP savefile system currently is inadequate and should be improved in order to facilitate the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
