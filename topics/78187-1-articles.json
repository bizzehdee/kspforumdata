I was wondering: if you turn off Kerbal respawning does that mean that each particullar Kerbal doesn\u0027t come back or will there be no new Kerbals spawning to take a dead Kerbal\u0027s place? i.e. If you kill all of your Kerbals will there be no new spawning or respawning Kerbals to pilot your craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuel","CreatedById":67851,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T12:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first one, they don\u0027t respawn.
