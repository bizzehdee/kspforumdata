If you plunge into atmosphere at sharp trajectory, your craft spends less time in \u0022burning up\u0022, which means slowdown duration is shorter and might be insufficient to slow it down for splashdown. Try shallow trajectory, it exposes your craft in \u0022burn in\u0022 longer, but also slows your craft down a lot more. Also, if you think you\u0027re safe (craft not burning anymore) eject the heat shield if you\u0027re about to splashdown. This is very important, if you land on the ground, keep the heat shield. It might get destroyed on impact, but it serves as cushion for the part above the shield. However, if you\u0027re about to land on water, eject the heat shield, since there\u0027s no \u0022cushioning\u0022 on water impact. (unless your craft has a lot of parts on impact, then some might survived) As such, a splashdown will instantly destroy a part without cushioning effect which could have devastating result on small part vessel like reentry pod. Your pod might survived if it has been cushioned by heat shield destruction on ground landing, but on water, it\u0027s different story. 4 parachute is more than enough for mk1 pod (overkill in my opinion). Also, if you think your pod is too heavy, just reduce the ablator on heat shield. I rarely used more than 20% (sometimes even 10%) of heat shield from reentry if the reentry angle is right (except on multiple reentry on more than 1 planet)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-28T15:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223642370\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221564326582\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you plunge into atmosphere at sharp trajectory, your craft spends less time in \u0022burning up\u0022, which means slowdown duration is shorter and might be insufficient to slow it down for splashdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think if \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
