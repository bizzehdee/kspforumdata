Steel core rounds are much more likely to ricochet off of hard surfaces and will do so at anything below around 80 in relation to the path of the projectile. Tanks fire two main types with specialty rounds for certain occasions. AP rounds are kinetic penetrators designed for taking out other tanks and armor and consist of a sabot surrounding a tungsten or depleted uranium penetrator these will not ricochet since they are harder than just about anything and have enough momentum to punch through atleast some of anything. The other rounds are HE (us army uses a hybrid HEAT High explosive Anti-tank) or high explosive which won\u0027t rich ocher since it wille xplode\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are a bit misinformed there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormer M1A1 tanker here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the M256A 120mm gun on the Abrams M829 and M830 rounds are APFSDSDU rounds and HEAT. The APFSDSDU round is Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot Depleted Uranium round, DU rounds will richochet or skip off armor, they are used because they are the densest projectile out there. The Russian use Tungstun core rounds because they are cheaper, but not as dense, they compensate by fireing them at a MUCH higher muzzel velocity then the 120mm rounds of the US and most NATO nations. And the Russians have developed armor now that is designed to help make the APDU rounds skip off of their tanks. The newer T-90 and T-80s have the Kontact-5 reactive armor system which is quite ingenious and very effective in tests. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HEAT or High Explosive Anti-Tank round is a simple concept of taking a shaped charge and melting a copper lining cone into a projectile of superheated copper that will melt its way through most armor in the world without the need for raw brute force to penetrate. So it can be fired by a MUCH lower muzzel velocity gun and still have the same penetration level at all ranges and all angles of attack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some other rounds still out there, like the HESH round, which is a High Explosive Squash Head round which hits a tank and flattens itself against the outside armor and explodes, sending bits of the interiour armor into the tanks crew compartment. Or in simple terms it turns the inside of a tank into a blender by creating spalling (my spelling is horrible today)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the plain and simple HE round, and that is just as it says, High Explosive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern tank armor isn\u0027t as simple as tank armor back in WWII. Now you have Reactive armor, spaced armor, ceramic composite armor, combinations of any of the privious armor.
