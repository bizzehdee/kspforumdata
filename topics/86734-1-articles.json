If the star was collapsing at the speed of light, it would take hours for large red giants, but it\u0027s not. Those stars are so huge that any visible change requires a much longer time. Imagine stars the size of Jupiter orbit. Typical red supergiants. There are even larger ones. How long would the collapse last? The outer layers would probably never even move. The inner layers would do the work and push the outer ones away, but even they are enormous and don\u0027t move near the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for supernovas. For some stupid reason, popular science has raised generations of people thinking it looks like fireworks or atomic bomb.

There isn\u0027t a reason why in certain cases a black hole couldn\u0027t exist in the center for a significant amount of time without the star collapsing.
