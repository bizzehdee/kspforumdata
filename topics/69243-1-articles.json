I plan on not being very active as from past experience, I am aware that the internet tends to bring out poor behaviors from me. I have a specific difficulty: in getting a proper Molniya communication system set up. I plan on asking about this specific issue once I\u0027ve felt I have done all I could do to solve the problem. Maybe I could get help and maybe my work would be valuable to others. I\u0027ve searched for \u0022Molniya\u0022 and I do not believe the topic has been extensively discussed before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have an undergraduate physics degree and I claim to be reasonably intelligent. This is a far way away from having and real claim to expertise and I am sure there are plenty of people more skilled in the math and science relevant to the game here then me but I enjoy doing both and have little experience in orbital mathematics. I probably won\u0027t watch the forum much but I do not mind being contacted to contribute with specific technical questions. I do not believe that I would be helpful in ship/craft/rocket design as I have no engineering training but I might be able to contribute to issues relating to orbital mechanics. My second post should give a better idea of my abilities and limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If dealing with specific technical (in terms of the math and science, not technical in terms of the programing) issues I will maintain good behavior in either a group or individual setting. I am offering a willingness to be contacted about issues I might enjoy dealing with or could help on; I am not asking to be contacted in such situations. I may pay some attention to the relevant forum threads but not enough to prevent me from missing a topic I might be able to offer help with. If I am never contacted to contribute then that\u0027s fine, but I want to make sure that the offer exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I want to contribute what I can to this community but I can be a bit awkward if you couldn\u0027t tell. I hope I\u0027ve introduced myself well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T16:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Ben, and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a very wide variety of players from all over the world all interested in space so I\u0027m sure you will find some like minded people here, as with any new community it can take some time to settle in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy it here and have fun both on the forums and in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T00:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, and welcome to the forums. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T02:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello! sounds like you should go meet the folks at the science labs.
