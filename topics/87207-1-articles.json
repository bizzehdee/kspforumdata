However, it is pretty much baked into it and can\u0027t be used as an API, if anyone else wants in on the action. I was originally planning to separate the system in the long run, but since RoverDude has expressed interest in the idea, let\u0027s start working on that now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to have an API in place that will allow the definition of perk trees, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eshamelessy ripped off\u003C/span\u003E inspired by the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111229143714/elderscrolls/it/images/4/4a/The-Elder-Scrolls-V-Skyrim-Magic-Skill-Tree.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESkyrim\u003C/a\u003E system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, there will be multiple independent trees, each one defining the various perks (or skills: what\u0027s the best name?) in a tree structure where perks are unlocked sequentially. The trees will define the possible paths and skills, and each kerbal will have his own personal set of unlocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlocking the perks will be done by expending perk points. A perk point can be of two types: shared (it can be used for any kerbal the player sees fit) or personal (it can only be used on the kerbal that acquired it). Additionally, a perk point can be restricted to a set of perk trees or left available to spend on any tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe acquisition of perk points will be left entirely for the mods to implement, so that every mod can use whatever logic makes sense for it. For example, you might want to unlock a perk point every X hours of flight, or only upon particular events... your choice. In the same way, OPS will only handle the perks, not their effects: client mods will be entirely responsible for the implementation of whatever effect they like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a technical point of view, my mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83755-CrewFiles-persistence-files-for-individual-kerbals/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrew Files\u003C/a\u003E already provides the necessary tools to store any information about a kerbal, while perk trees information can be safely stored in a scenario module. Of course, perk trees will be defined using cfg files, and this brings us to the second half of the proposal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will also need a shared set of basic perk trees. Much like Community Resource Pack, using them will not be mandatory, just convenient as it would allow standardization between any mod that wants to use a perk system. Just like CRP, of course, anyone will be free to implement their own perk trees and use them instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I haven\u0027t started implementing it yet: we are still in the concept phase, but not for long. So, I\u0027d like to know what you think of this, and if you see any obvious problem / missing feature / whatever. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T18:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E110% behind this.

Once they\u0027ve received 2 perks, their next level up makes them a leader within their area of specialisation which gives them a perk which gives bonuses to those working around them with that area of expertise. So, a Chief Engineer with an Engineers underneath him/her who specialises Power systems, gets bonuses for his/her expertise (say in Electrical and Fuel systems, so there is a cumulative bonus laid onto their perks). Mission Commanders give a bonus to the perks of everyone on their ship. Expeditionary Commanders give a bonus to everyone in orbit around the same body as them (i.e., part of the same expedition).

Stats and perks sit in a quite complementary place to each other, and I suspect there\u0027s a natural fit for some perks to influence per kerbal stats. I had been thinking of migrating keepfit over to Crewfiles (still might) but storing current fitness using this library would be better because I could also support some perks and also natural ability - a kerbal with high activity drive (or to state it oppositely, a low couchPotato) status would have their fitness impacted differently.
