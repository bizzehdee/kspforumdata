I have a station hub docked to an asteroid via three grabbers (technically their mod grabbers with other functions, but i\u0027ve already ruled out a mod as the source). I had the thing locked to a rock I pushed down to a 1000km orbit by all three. When I came back to it, it had moved so a) the rock was no longer in the same orientation as before and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E two of the grabbers were not visibly connected to the asteroid (though the right-click GUI still indicated they were attached). This a known issue and is it going to be addressed or do I need to log a bug report?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also noticed my asteroid tugger was jumping around when I would enter and exit time warp as the claw randomly repositioned itself (and the craft with it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
