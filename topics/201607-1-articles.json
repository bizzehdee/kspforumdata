Its very frustating that it shows you some thing that change compleatly when you advanced time only 15 days. It change the direction of the ship in a hiperbolic orbit, compleatly. You can look it in a\u00A0 few seconds video in my youtube chanel https://youtu.be/IJkzUOJX4P4. I cant up the video here, but i send it to the support. I expend 1030 hours in this game, and its very frustating how when you arrived in most dificult places its broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if anybody find this mistake but its very frustrating.

Also when entering an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E your game should slow your warp to 50x and it didn\u2019t here which might have caused the physics engine to miss a cycle and have your orbit change (if that\u2019s how this works I don\u2019t know\u00A0how the game actually \u00A0runs). I would recommend not warping that fast unless just cruising in solar or an eccentric orbit because it can mess things up and has for me in the past (I\u2019m talking my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E dropping 2 million km in front of my face.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
