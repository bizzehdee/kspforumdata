I thought I would use fuel \u003Cem\u003Eonly \u003C/em\u003Efrom the first 3 boosters stack tanks? I have had issues with Jumbo 64 tanks when stacked \u0022booster fashion\u0022, in the past, however. I have a feeling that all 3 tanks in each stack are not correctly \u0022connected\u0022 and not transferring fuel. I will launch again checking all 3 tanks in each stack as fuel is burned.
