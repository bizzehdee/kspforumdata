I am trying to do a real space progression with real parts etc, however, I have installed realism overhaul and it\u0027s great but I am struggling with the locked throttle with the Vostok space craft, I have had to bring fuel all the way down to practically zero and even then it\u0027s still too much, the engines are also completely overpowered and i\u0027m reaching an AP of 80km in a matter of seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have already tried to bring down the throttle limiter to, again, around zero but it\u0027s still way too powerful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone else uses this mod please advise me on two things, 1)is there a way of disabling this aspect of the mod, and 2) if not on the previous, how can I slow down the engines so I am not blasting into space within seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
