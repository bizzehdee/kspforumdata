However, without the integral part you will see a constant error that the controller cannot get rid of (if you set for example 5000m altitude the controller might hold 4912 instead). The derivative part will help with avoiding oscillations (I think, I\u0027m no control theory guru \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is a PID (propotional, integral, derivative \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) controller which needs tuning. That can get difficult (it is a per craft business) and I kinda guessed around until the script stopped ripping the tanker apart. It still only works when you are close to the height and speed it should hold. It\u0027s even worse with heading, mainly because I have not yet managed to read roll value and thus use heading to control roll. So if you\u0027re off to one side the plane will roll into a curve towards the correct heading, but it doesn\u0027t stop to actually fly a curve, it rolls and rolls and rolls and crashes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you are on course it works most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just to be clear, the lock steering to up \u002B R(whatever) method that is shown in the video above didn\u0027t work for a plane as large as my carrier, that\u0027s why I rolled my own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-18T18:39:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2014 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by the_bT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"munseeker","CreatedById":110850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T19:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlight testing my Duna lander design un-kerbaled to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the first landing I discovered that a 30-ton lander does not come to rest easy if there is any horizontal velocity left.

When I attached the claw and released the tug (It was attached by the claw to free up the docking port for docking) I got a massive phantom force on my station. Before I knew what had happened, Cloudbase Kerbin-1 went from a neat 87-by-88km orbit to a 41-by-132!

All it has for manouvering is a probe tug (on the top left) and a MMU (on the bottom of the middle section) and these are not meant for moving the whole thing. But I decided that I had to try to rescue the thing regardless. I had to disable the RCS on the probe tug because it was causing me to rotate when I thrusted forwards, so that left me with 2 usable thrusters. I tell you, shifting 106 tons of space-station 36m/s on two thrusters is a daunting task, even without the fact that I was gonna pass through atmo. In spite of these issues, and another one which I\u0027ll get to, I eventually managed to put it on a 72-by-110km orbit, where the station will remain until I conjure up the patience to put it in a less eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Other Issue: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPhantom Forces\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the incident that caused my stations\u0027 orbit to go all wonky, I noticed something else.
