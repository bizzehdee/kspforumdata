As you increase a number in floating point, the mantissa grows larger and larger. This leaves less room for the remainder portion of the number. Now when you\u0027re doing serious math on those numbers like adjusting where something is suppose to be or be going, and you don\u0027t have much remainder portion left in your number calculations, things get a lot less accurate. Which is where the kraken bug you speak of is coming from. It has also been determined that the kraken bug (math inaccuracies) occurs more at 750m/s than any other speed (discovered so far).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when you say, send out the telescope to 967 AU (or whatever that figure is) that is a long way from where everything else is. This also means that high time compression is going to have to be used. And this also means that either the probe is getting less remainder portion in its positional numbers for calculation or the other stuff you left behind isn\u0027t getting them. When you \u0022are the craft\u0022 that craft is at 0 position in space. So other things that are not close to you are at far positions in space. So, you can either time accelerate at objects around Kerbin/Earth or \u0022be the probe\u0022 and accelerate there. But something is going to catch hell once the distances of 967 AU get realized.

Biomes are meaningless to it. You basically land several landers, ideally 6 to maximize the science value, on the planet. One near each pole, and 4 equally distant from each other along the equator and then start crashing things into the planet. You can repeat it but after a few the science goes to nothing and you have to transmit the data after each impact. There\u0027s no data loss in transmitting but it takes *a lot* of electric charge power to do it, so I recommend putting several batteries and RTGs on the landers if you cant go nuclear with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
