Especially if you used a custom flag. Wherever the persistent file says it goes (it\u0027ll read something like Myfiles/flags/mycoolflag)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you\u0027re awesome enough to have named your flag the above, you\u0027ll just have to make sure you create the folders off of gamedata \u0022Myfiles/flags/\u0022 and then within it put your file named \u0022mycoolflag.png\u0022 (or whatever extension)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
