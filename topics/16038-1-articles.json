I know I have to burn in some angle, but I am not sure which, I\u0027ve tried some stuff but that only seems to change my Pe and Ap.

You want to tip your orbital plane a whole 90 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a polar orbit, only two points lie along the equatorial plane. Those two points will be where you do all your thrusting, spread over several orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome terminology: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrograde: the direction of your orbital path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetrograde: the opposite direction from your orbital path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal: 90 degrees counter-clockwise to the plane of your orbit. Make a circular shape with your right hand to represent an easterly orbit. Your thumb will point up along the normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntinormal: 180 degrees opposite the normal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend this approach:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. As you cross the equator going North, turn toward the normal, in this case a heading of prograde (90 degrees, East) and thrust. Time your burn so it\u0027s a minute before and a minute after, but not much more than that. You\u0027ll see the plane of your orbit begin to tilt east at the top, with your burn point forming the pivot point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. After your burn, your prograde marker will be offset from a 0 heading by a few degrees. Make a note of this offset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When you\u0027re passing the equator on the other (downward) side of your orbit, burn 90 (\u002B the offset) from step 2 for the same amount of time. This will continue to tilt your orbital plane clockwise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Burn each time you cross the equator. As your orbit tilts, always thrust at along the normal and watch the growing offset in your prograde and retrograde markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Repeat as necessary until your orbit is aligned with the equator. It might take several orbits, and a lot of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-04T20:42:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2012 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by pebble_garden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T19:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you cross the equator, burn in the 135\u00C2\u00B0 direction until you come back to your orbital speed.
