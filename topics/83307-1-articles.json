I initially posted this in support, but upon reading the stickies and reviewing that forum, I realized it was more for crashy-sort of issues. This, while technically a bug, is probably more of an physics engine-limitation/ship design question, so I\u0027m going to repost here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/N8ir_Dkow5M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYoutube Link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mod I\u0027m using is MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepeated issue with this ship exploding or falling apart. Sometimes it also \u0022accelerates\u0022 (acts as if an engine is on) and the orbit changes when it\u0027s not supposed to. It happens under acceleration or freefall, with autopilot or SAS on or off, with torque wheels on or off. It has happened in Kerbin orbit, sun orbit, Ike escape trajectory into Duna orbit, in atmo during Duna aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is actually two ships: the nuclear tug in the back and the lander/science ship in the front. The lander/science ship seems to be the problem: it has happened once or twice just to that with the tug undocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I design the ship so this won\u0027t happen? KSP is pretty much unplayable with this relatively uncomplicated ship, it took countless quick-saves to get to Duna. I did use the terrible barely-working \u0022Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector\u0022 piece, and the four \u0022arms\u0022 on the lander attached to that piece wouldn\u0027t work with symmetry. I created one arm, and then had to copy/rotate it to create the other 3. Is that the problem? Or is it something entirely unrelated to the hub max piece?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-30T17:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2014 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jaevko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T01:06:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any part clipping going on?

Also, Pegasus ME\u0027s might be clipping up and down the length of the lander. Surely those tiny pieces aren\u0027t the problem?

This Kraken only happens at certains times during different parts of orbits. For example, during a \u0022Krakenless\u0022 part of an orbit, I can save, reload, and do anything and everything trying to get it to attack the ship, and nothing will happen. During a really bad part of an orbit, I am unable to maneuver for even a second without it striking hard and fast. Reloading it multiple times doesn\u0027t help: when this happened orbiting the sun trying to perform an intercept orbit to Duna, I had no choice but to put time acceleration on and wait another whole year until there was another opportunity to perform the burn (at which point the Kraken decided to go away and completely stop causing trouble for a bit). For that reason, I am having doubts about the whole part clipping theory (why would it come and go like that depending on the orbital situation?)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-30T16:38:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2014 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jaevko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roadkill","CreatedById":111931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T17:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Claw is right about the craft, Jaevko. When I hyper-edit the top portion of your craft into 100,000 km Kerbin orbit, it\u0027s as stable as a rock.
