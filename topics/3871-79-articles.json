The more mods/parts you have, the more memory you use. If you can reduce memory per part, you can increase the amount of parts. The only way to reduce memory/part is, as far as I know, to downsize textures. I usually set diffuse maps (the normal textures) to 256*256 and normal maps (the ones that tell the game where to make it look like there is an indent or bump) to 5112*512. Emmissives also go to 256*256.
