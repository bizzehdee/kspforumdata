They\u0027re a simple design, with four parallel sets\u00A0of 1x6 OX panels, and two 2x3 OX panels on the side,\u00A0but there\u0027s a problem - once extended, they sit fine for a while, but then they just start spazzing out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pUXBbAs.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pUXBbAs.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s quite crazy and amusing at the same time \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0I have no idea what\u0027s causing this, it happens with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on or off, there are reaction wheels and HECS command modules on the modules, and even when detached, the modules will just fly off into space spazzing out to the point where they turn into a magic chaos ball (\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DwDUzaA.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eclick for gif here - doesn\u0027t want to embed into the post\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E).
