But it does seem pretty clear at this point that they are still using a garage band development model even after their game has hit the big time. The devoted fans are screaming for more, and it is really very slow in coming. Modders are cranking out content way faster than the core development team is. I understand that there was a physics port and that\u0027s a whole lot of work for no content advantage, but still it is not unreasonable to expect them to have taken this ball and run\u00A0further with it by now. \u00A0If that\u0027s because they have in fact taken the bulk of the revenue from KSP and put it towards other ventures, leaving us out in the cold, then I do think it is pitchforks-and-torches time.

But it does seem pretty clear at this point that they are still using a garage band development model even after their game has hit the big time. The devoted fans are screaming for more, and it is really very slow in coming. Modders are cranking out content way faster than the core development team is. I understand that there was a physics port and that\u0027s a whole lot of work for no content advantage, but still it is not unreasonable to expect them to have taken this ball and run\u00A0further with it by now. \u00A0If that\u0027s because they have in fact taken the bulk of the revenue from KSP and put it towards other ventures, leaving us out in the cold, then I do think it is pitchforks-and-torches time.

The team was small (and absolutely inexperienced in software developmant and game design) but passionate. If Early Access pours in the money (and it did), Squad was able to surve the time of development and it would have gave them the opportunity to hire additional professionals to get the job done. Professionals like design and render artists, sound artists and \u0026amp; engineers, experienced developers and - for me one keypoint - game designers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut they didn\u0027t...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that saddens me. The game showed really high potential. But they were never able to make this dream come true.
