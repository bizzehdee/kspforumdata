Given that my SSTO rocket parachutes back to land, in what way are you changing the meaning of \u0027SSTO\u0027? If someone means a vehicle that relies on wings or other shape for aerodynamic lift I think the term is \u0027spaceplane\u0027. If \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E vehicle (theoretically) just needs a \u0027splash and dash\u0027 to be ready for another mission then SSTO still doesn\u0027t mean spaceplane, however you mis-define it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that SSTO isn\u0027t synonymous spaceplane. That was my first statement in my previous post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m providing the definition from wikipedia to avoid being accused of \u0022mis-defining\u0022 the term SSTO, and that definition points out that it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Etypical \u003C/em\u003E to use the term in reference to \u003Cem\u003Ereusable\u003C/em\u003E vehicles. I\u0027m \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E introducing the term. Reusable is, as pointed out in the wiki, typically part of the definition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the fact that this use is typical doesn\u0027t seem enough to avoid the snark on the forums. Do posters that want to avoid the trolls really have to say \u0022Reusable\u0022 in front of every instance \u0022SSTO\u0022? Even though it\u0027s obviously what is meant by vast majority of posters using the term?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANd yes, if you can get the vehicle back to the surface in one piece, then it\u0027s reusable. You posted a rocket that you claim is SSTO. Can it be reused? Do you have a way to get it back to the surface? Does it have chutes or some other way to survive impact? Does it have an RGU or automatically firing separatrons to deorbit it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t see any of those from your pic.
