Just install and run KSP and see how you like the performance. If that is okay, just play it that way. If not, you might want to upgrade.

Then, remove any screws closing the lid. Before opening the case, ground yourself by touching the bare metal of your case when still plugged in, a wall socket ground pin (and none other, be careful!) or other equipment you are sure is grounded. Unpainted central heating pipes are often used for this, though those are not \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E reliably grounded. You would preferably not wear synthetic materials and other things that build up static electricity easily. Cotton is typically a safe option. After that and removing the power cable from the PSU, it should be pretty safe to open your case, as long as you do not stab things with screwdrivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECleaning is fairly straight forward. Do not use a vacuum cleaner, as those can throw vast amounts of static potential around. Just manually remove clumps of dust. You could use a cotton cloth or even a soft brush if you are careful about static build up. To get in between the fins and remove thin dust layers, you could use a can of compressed gas made for this purpose. These are available online for moderate amounts of money. Just be sure not to spray the cold liquid directly on things, as this could be potentially harmful. Never blow on things with your mouth, as tiny bits of saliva can wreak havoc on PCBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T22:00:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weegee","CreatedById":72084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pipcard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pipcard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI bought \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883229310\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis computer\u003C/a\u003E in 2012.

As for getting a new computer, I would definitely recommend building it yourself, unless you are worried about doing it right (though it really isn\u0027t that hard).
