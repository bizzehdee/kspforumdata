The Tech Tree is one of, if not the, key driver of progress through the game. Reputation and Cost are both limiters, but unlocking the Tech Tree works like a progress indicator. The Tech Tree is completed too early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The first several weeks/months of my space agency were exciting, full of satellite launches, test flights, and trips to the Mun and Minmus. Then progress sort of stops as we wait months and years for transfer windows to come and missions to transit to and from Duna, Eve, etc. This change in pace is uncomfortable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral Bad Solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Make the Tech Tree last longer by making science more difficult to come by, either by making it more grindy or by limiting the science near Kerbin to require other planet exploration. This is bad because a) grind is bad. And \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E - though this is highly speculative - I think people expect the kind of large rockets, nuclear engines, tech to go to other planets. Although you can Scott Manley your way there after unlocking one or two tech nodes (or half of the Tech Tree in a less exaggerated example), I don\u0027t think this is what players expect, and although the challenge may be fun for some, in general it\u0027s not fun for most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Add future rocket tech to the Tech Tree. I appreciate Squad keeping the tech to current or \u0022near future\u0022 or whatever the standard is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Keep up the pace of \u0022maintenance\u0022 tasks even while you launch missions to other planets - allow Rep to degrade over time, make monthly agency bills, loose Rep and Funds for allowing contracts to expire, etc. Although I love contracts for launching satellites, at a certain point space around Kerbin is too full and I want to move on to the next challenge. Requiring me to pay attention to these mundane details while I want to time warp is tedium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Good Solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these problems can be fixed by adding stock life support to the late stages of the Tech Tree. Not only does this stretch out the Tech Tree but it would do so at the exact time when crewed missions transition from a week or two to Minmus and back to a year or two to other planets. In other words, with proper balancing you can make life support optional for in-Kerbin activities (just don\u0027t forget about your guys in the Minmus base until you retrofit an air scrubber or whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith contracts incessantly wanting to go to the Mun and Minmus, being able to make multiple trips to these destinations is a reasonable requirement meaning you can cycle crew, supplies, or simply evacuate the base if you haven\u0027t unlocked life support yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock life support would add another dimension to interplanetary travels which means that even though the Tech Tree (the current version) is filled out and you have very nice rockets, there\u0027s still a progression of technologies that make subsequent trips better, easier, longer. For example, I would either content myself with sending probes to several planets to harvest science, or I could send a crewed mission but I don\u0027t have sufficient life support to linger so it has to be quick or I have to have a small crew compared to the number of snacks, etc. But as I unlock the nodes in the extended Tech Tree I am able to send a crewed mission for longer or with less supplies (because they\u0027ll be recycled) or however the mechanic works. This would also be an opportunity to include some pretty parts as stock, everything from an inline and radial life support widget which turns electricity into go-juice to an inflatable habitat which has a huge supply of keep-em-alive-crackers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcknowledgments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife Support has been suggested a lot, so has \u0022better\u0022 Tech Trees. I haven\u0027t seen a lot of traffic about the pacing of missions changing over the course of a career save. I think this is a novel solution to \u0022fix\u0022 several issues in one go and therefore worth mentioning. I am sensitive to the fact that there are radically different play styles across the community, I\u0027d be interested to know if this wouldn\u0027t work for you. Mods implement different levels of detail of \u0022life support\u0022 because people want everything from no life support to every-little-detail life support, I\u0027m confident that any system that ever becomes stock will be pretty simple (one, maybe two, quantities to keep track of) which is all it\u0027d take to implement this suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust saw your thread in the other thread.

The proposed mod by RoverDude is interesting in that it doesn\u0027t enact permanent consequences (by default, anyway) for failing to meet its requirements. Kerbal ships essentially become uncontrollable once out of supplies, just like probe cores do when they run out of electricity. There\u0027s a little more complexity (and fun!) to it, but that\u0027s the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the parts for life support can vary by tech levels. Assuming dedicated life support is not required for the short trips within the Kerbin system, the first life support parts can come along around the time the game starts giving space station and planetary base contracts, which is suitably mid-game and should be enough for easy trips to, say, Eve, Duna, and Dres at least (creative players will always be able to go further).

Make a distinction between commercial \u003Cstrong\u003EContracts\u003C/strong\u003E (most all parts testing, most all satellite launches, and a FEW of the \u0022science/survey\u0022 contracts would be \u0022commercial\u0022) and Kerbal Space Center (your program) \u003Cstrong\u003EMissions\u003C/strong\u003E. The latter are ALL Explore type missions (more would be added), most all the science/survey missions, most of the base/station missions, and a small number (early on, largely) of the satellite contracts and parts testing.

The distinction does give a little immersion value, but also reduces it a little- where is my space program getting this extra money from? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, I\u0027m also not sure about two. Most of our costs, mainly new vessels, are big, up-front costs, which makes getting big lump sum payments practical. I imagine a system like this would end up making you do a lot of otherwise pointless warping to save up funds, which could feel more of a grind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was warping until a budget/payday, rather than warping until you\u0027ve collected enough, then I imagine it would seem a little different, as long as the payment system is balanced so you could earn enough to do a lot on interesting/productive things in between payouts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, (As I\u0027ve posed before,) my thoughts on time based payout gameplay:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, I\u0027d prefer it if the game could do without the explore contracts altogether.
