The Tech Tree is one of, if not the, key driver of progress through the game. Reputation and Cost are both limiters, but unlocking the Tech Tree works like a progress indicator. The Tech Tree is completed too early.\n\n2) The first several weeks/months of my space agency were exciting, full of satellite launches, test flights, and trips to the Mun and Minmus. Then progress sort of stops as we wait months and years for transfer windows to come and missions to transit to and from Duna, Eve, etc. This change in pace is uncomfortable.\n\nSeveral Bad Solutions:\n\n1) Make the Tech Tree last longer by making science more difficult to come by, either by making it more grindy or by limiting the science near Kerbin to require other planet exploration. This is bad because a) grind is bad. And ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) - though this is highly speculative - I think people expect the kind of large rockets, nuclear engines, tech to go to other planets. Although you can Scott Manley your way there after unlocking one or two tech nodes (or half of the Tech Tree in a less exaggerated example), I don\u0027t think this is what players expect, and although the challenge may be fun for some, in general it\u0027s not fun for most.\n\n2) Add future rocket tech to the Tech Tree. I appreciate Squad keeping the tech to current or \u0022near future\u0022 or whatever the standard is.\n\n3) Keep up the pace of \u0022maintenance\u0022 tasks even while you launch missions to other planets - allow Rep to degrade over time, make monthly agency bills, loose Rep and Funds for allowing contracts to expire, etc. Although I love contracts for launching satellites, at a certain point space around Kerbin is too full and I want to move on to the next challenge. Requiring me to pay attention to these mundane details while I want to time warp is tedium.\n\nThe Good Solution:\n\nBoth of these problems can be fixed by adding stock life support to the late stages of the Tech Tree. Not only does this stretch out the Tech Tree but it would do so at the exact time when crewed missions transition from a week or two to Minmus and back to a year or two to other planets. In other words, with proper balancing you can make life support optional for in-Kerbin activities (just don\u0027t forget about your guys in the Minmus base until you retrofit an air scrubber or whatever).\n\nWith contracts incessantly wanting to go to the Mun and Minmus, being able to make multiple trips to these destinations is a reasonable requirement meaning you can cycle crew, supplies, or simply evacuate the base if you haven\u0027t unlocked life support yet.\n\nStock life support would add another dimension to interplanetary travels which means that even though the Tech Tree (the current version) is filled out and you have very nice rockets, there\u0027s still a progression of technologies that make subsequent trips better, easier, longer. For example, I would either content myself with sending probes to several planets to harvest science, or I could send a crewed mission but I don\u0027t have sufficient life support to linger so it has to be quick or I have to have a small crew compared to the number of snacks, etc. But as I unlock the nodes in the extended Tech Tree I am able to send a crewed mission for longer or with less supplies (because they\u0027ll be recycled) or however the mechanic works. This would also be an opportunity to include some pretty parts as stock, everything from an inline and radial life support widget which turns electricity into go-juice to an inflatable habitat which has a huge supply of keep-em-alive-crackers.\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nLife Support has been suggested a lot, so has \u0022better\u0022 Tech Trees. I haven\u0027t seen a lot of traffic about the pacing of missions changing over the course of a career save. I think this is a novel solution to \u0022fix\u0022 several issues in one go and therefore worth mentioning. I am sensitive to the fact that there are radically different play styles across the community, I\u0027d be interested to know if this wouldn\u0027t work for you. Mods implement different levels of detail of \u0022life support\u0022 because people want everything from no life support to every-little-detail life support, I\u0027m confident that any system that ever becomes stock will be pretty simple (one, maybe two, quantities to keep track of) which is all it\u0027d take to implement this suggestion."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:54:34Z","Content":"Just saw your thread in the other thread.

Right now, he\u0027s able to finish the whole tech tree without going further than Duna orbit. He\u0027s proposing some new tech nodes (related to life support) to the game to spread the tree out (costing more overall and requiring more science from further places).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One solution would be that the first biome you do experiment in gives full Science, the next one gives 2/3, next 2/4, 2/5...\n\u003E Science rewards from contracts could be significantly reduced or completely removed.

If a player is not yet sure about how to go interplanetary or is just enjoying themselves scraping every biome of Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus, that\u0027s fine. Once they grow bored of it, or want to reach the last segments of the tech tree (probably their least favorite nodes, since they would already have picked the best for their playstyle by this point), they\u0027ll go interplanetary without much prompting.\n\nFinally, Some rebalancing of science rewards and costs of tech nodes is needed (and currently being worked on by the devs! We\u0027ll have to see what Harvester came up with).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the life support solution wouldn\u0027t really help, it would essentially create a hard wall that stops any progression until you grind trough it. Some kind of life support would be good, but I think interplanetary flight should be near the middle of the tree, not at the top.\n\nLife Support doesn\u0027t have to be extreme. The proposed mod by RoverDude is interesting in that it doesn\u0027t enact permanent consequences (by default, anyway) for failing to meet its requirements. Kerbal ships essentially become uncontrollable once out of supplies, just like probe cores do when they run out of electricity. There\u0027s a little more complexity (and fun!) to it, but that\u0027s the idea.\n\nAlso, the parts for life support can vary by tech levels. Assuming dedicated life support is not required for the short trips within the Kerbin system, the first life support parts can come along around the time the game starts giving space station and planetary base contracts, which is suitably mid-game and should be enough for easy trips to, say, Eve, Duna, and Dres at least (creative players will always be able to go further). A few more parts going up the tech tree can give more flexibility the further along the tech tree you go (different size containers, recycling capability, generation of life support resources in the field)."},{"CreatedByName":"Frank327","CreatedById":115926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T17:24:44Z","Content":"I think there\u0027s other reasons than just the game balance that makes people finish the tech tree before going interplanetary. \n\n1. Many people still play the career mode the same way as before money was introduced. Everybody got used to making big ships to hoover up all the science at their destination without much concern for the money it would be costing or the (IRL) time you\u0027re spending on it. I think players who started KSP after money was introduced will play it differently, not bringing lots of science equipment with them to cut costs and move on to new moons/planets earlier looking for more challenges and money. \n\n2. The game is balanced in such a way that time doesn\u0027t have much of an effect. I think the devs were expecting people to just skip months or even more than a year on end to get to the transfer window of duna or eve. If you do a few missions on mun/minmus and then head straight for the transfer window of duna, then the pace of the research would feel a lot more natural. \n\nI can only speak from my own experience, and I didn\u0027t completely finish the tech tree after visiting duna/eve/ike/gilly on moderate."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T18:04:47Z","Content":"I\u0027m playing a RSS 6.4X kerbol system career with LS, etc. My career is now year 18 I think, and I finished the tech tree (including 1000 science parts added by PF, KAS, etc) and have not sent manned missions past Minmus yet.

Another way to do this is one I suggested in another thread.\n\n1. Make a distinction between commercial **Contracts** (most all parts testing, most all satellite launches, and a FEW of the \u0022science/survey\u0022 contracts would be \u0022commercial\u0022) and Kerbal Space Center (your program) **Missions**.

Make science *useful*.\n\nOne, rebalance the science gained in general, generally speaking, significantly downwards.\n\nTwo, make contract appearance dependent upon completing other contracts.\n\nWant to land on Duna? Knock yourself out. Want to get offered \u0022Land on Duna\u0022 or other lucrative Duna contracts? Then you need to first complete the \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contract which is no longer the current contract, but instead one that examines the atmosphere, maps it (\u0022science from orbit\u0022 (maybe set up like a satellite contract with a low, polar orbit required)), etc. Have the \u0022Land on Duna\u0022 contract like a station construction contract where the craft has to be built AFTER accepting the mission. Now, you need to send a mission to not land, and study Duna first. The same would be true of the Mun, etc. Jool? That means you need to send a probe first (manned or not), that roughly places first manned landing on a Joolian moon at some point after year 7 at best, assuming you send a Jool probe as soon as the first low dv window pops up. Duna is not bad until day 200, so early game gets your probe to Duna by the end of the year at some point if you get right on a Duna mission. That means you get the data to open the landing missions and the next good Duna window is mid year 3 to late year 3 (arrival at Duna early -mid year 4).\n\nThis at least spreads the career out to several years.

In multiplayer games, the reward is winning. In single player games, there are things a game gives you which powerfully drive gameplay, even when we are unaware of it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I know we\u0027ve discussed this previously, but for the purposes of this thread: I would rather see something less superficial than the system proposed in idea one.

Remember that many of these ideas are not posted as what I would wish for, but rather what I think is easy for them to do, given the assumption that the gross mechanics of the career are not going to change. I\u0027d wager that the gross mechanics are not going to change, so I hope that they might see that there are ways to make time matter within their (broken) system.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Plus, I\u0027m also not sure about two. Most of our costs, mainly new vessels, are big, up-front costs, which makes getting big lump sum payments practical. I imagine a system like this would end up making you do a lot of otherwise pointless warping to save up funds, which could feel more of a grind.\n\nThe POINT of my ideas is \u0022pointless warping.\u0022 I **want** people to have to warp. They said that \u0022warp to waypoint\u0022 was a thing for 1.0. Add a button that warps to day 1 of the next calendar month (using 50 day minmus months). Your large rocket needs 2 months of your budget for that project? Accept mission, hit the button twice. 2 months has passed. Without this, in the current game you accept the \u0022contract,\u0022 build the rocket, and fly it 30 minutes of less after accepting it. Maybe you warp to the destination and back\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 a day passes on Kerbin. Unless you are warping to completion of a Duna return mission or farther, effectively no time passes in game. I launch missions, but continue to do Kerbin SoI missions\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 as a result, time only passes in my game for Kerbin-Minmus transfers at most, or perhaps a few orbits for a rendezvous. I rarely warp for an encounter with a distant world, as I am doing resupply, etc. UNless people warp all distant missions to completion, time barely passes in KSP, you go from no spaceflight, to massive munar/minmar bases before the first low-energy transfer to Duna appears.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If it was warping until a budget/payday, rather than warping until you\u0027ve collected enough, then I imagine it would seem a little different, as long as the payment system is balanced so you could earn enough to do a lot on interesting/productive things in between payouts.\n\nYeah, I posted the warp to month thing in another thread about this concept, and forgot this time. The commercial contracts would pay right away, not be a budget thing, BTW. 2 ways to get funds.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ideally, I\u0027d prefer it if the game could do without the explore contracts altogether. I mean, we don\u0027t need to be walked through the whole game. Inform the player of when launch windows are, and give them things worth going to the planets for, and they will go.\n\nI\u0027d be all for this if there was fog of war in the game, useful science, etc. Right now, I want career to have some drivers. Right now, I consider more of the non-explore contracts to be nothing but a grind to get funds to do the explore contracts. Might as well play Science mode, I guess.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey tater!\n\u003E I\u0027m not a fan of the existing life support options for that exact reason. I\u0027m very excited about RoverDude\u0027s proposed system, because it requires the player to be concerned with life support, and perform resupply missions, while letting you ignore stations and flights in progress that you aren\u0027t interested in playing with.\n\nI\u0027d have mine set to death, so roverdude\u0027s would not change much for me along those lines.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This seems to be a very small change that mostly comes down to the names of things and changing the rewards around. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s wrong, since it sounds more logically laid out (the contract types being separated by funds-generating and science-gathering is cool) but I don\u0027t feel it changes anything in the long run, since players will still be doing the same things. With the right balancing and tuning, this would work fine, but the impact wouldn\u0027t be huge.\n\nThey will be doing the same things, but their program will do them over time, instead of unlocking the entire tech tree long before a Duna launch window appears, which is what the game is like now. Adding time mechanics then allows for concepts like a space race, time based challenges, etc.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Here, I have to disagree. Sure, if you want to eliminate redundant part-testing contracts, a good rebalance might be in order, or *maybe* give the entirety of \u0022Mission\u0022 contracts payout right away, so you have enough to do all steps of the mission as you go. But why would you ever enjoy sitting at the space center and playing the timewarp-stopwatch mini-game?\n\nSquad has said there would be a warp to waypoint function in 1.0. Have \u0022warp to the beginning of next month\u0022 button. The point is to move the calendar forward. It is less grindy to hit that button a couple times than it is to click away to get a few parts contracts you can do in 1 flight, then test them on the pad to get the same funds. Career right now is mostly grind, IMO.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you are playing a more complex game that manages ongoing incomes and expenses and there are other time-constraints, THEN it makes sense. But the base game is very likely not going to go that route. I personally would not enjoy that level of management, since it detracts from the time I would otherwise be spending building things and flying missions, and I *think* most players are in the same boat I am.\n\nMy point is that time should matter for all kinds of other mechanics. I\u0027m pretty disinterested in the \u0022management\u0022 idea as a game. My ideal *career* KSP game would be time mattering, with an AI opposing space program that I am competing with.\n\nI think LS alone adds constraints that improve gameplay."},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:10:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Better solution: Take the focus away from the techtree, and make the game more about doing space stuff than unlocking stuff.\n\u003E It needs an aim other than \u0022unlock parts for going to space by uh, going to space.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E I know we\u0027ve discussed this previously, but for the purposes of this thread: I would rather see something less superficial than the system proposed in idea one.
