Found plenty of designs that use later parts, but virtually none that use the early ones. There is one caveat however, you need the LV-909 Terrier rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapabilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fly to above 17km to grab those survey missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Relatively stable in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Low take off speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Science Junior and Goo canister - excellent for biome exploration on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Adaptability to mission requirements - it has 4 intakes, 2 can be removed and extra goo canisters added, or even a science junior. Also fuel can be altered if you go for a altitude mission or just cruising for biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Using yaw controls flips the plane in a weird barrel roll. With all my sincere efforts I couldn\u0027t solve it, steer the plane with pitch and roll controls, which is actually quite easy. Small yaw increments are not that bad, but they have a certain jerkiness to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Sometimes, if using less than full throttle and NO SAS, plane would turn on the runway. I ended up replacing the wheels and move them further out(rear ones), makes it very stable during landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Its a hybrid, because well, normal jets flame out around 12-14km so you need a rocket engine to reach above 17 km. It uses the LV-909, small, light rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to use and tinker with it, my knowledge on building planes is fairly limited, I\u0027d be very happy to learn how to improve on design\u0027s flight characteristics. Kept the center of lift behind the center of mass and at a slight angle towards the back, that way the plane has a natural tendency to climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s67.photobucket.com/user/Zamolxes77/media/screenshot0_zpsionnuc2t.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/Zamolxes77/screenshot0_zpsionnuc2t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zpsionnuc2t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s67.photobucket.com/user/Zamolxes77/media/screenshot1_zpszhy3bgfs.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/Zamolxes77/screenshot1_zpszhy3bgfs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1_zpszhy3bgfs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
