If Kethane wasn\u0027t random placement. As in, if Kethane was present in higher amounts in places like craters.. where things have impacted a planet/moon.

Perhaps Kethane is deposited on the surface by a high density stream of particles hitting the surface, or perhaps it grows there, or maybe its formation is not reliant upon any currently known geological process or from surface impacts. It might be someone simply PUT IT THERE!!!... DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snicker* Har har!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t recall what it was named, but there is a mod out there which lets you target a landing site and possibly track it. It might be MechJeb... I don\u0027t recall. I think Scott used it in his Reusable Space Program videos though. I am fairly confident MechJeb has some functionality in this regard though. If you are able to target a landing site, I think that would help solve your problem - or at least you wouldn\u0027t need to swap back and forth between the two more than a few times (and certainly not whilst landing).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T18:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I can land pretty much wherever I want...
