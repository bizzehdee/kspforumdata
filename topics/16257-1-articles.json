Yeah I was thinking about something like that. There are however some challenges. I would like to not only calculate the energy consumption and generation of my controlled vessel, i want to calculate it for all vessels in the relay network. That seems very hard to do to me right now. Basically, as far as the game is conserned, vessels that are too far away don\u0027t really exist. I certainly don\u0027t know of any way in which they can run any code. I do kind of have an idea for a workaround based on the way i currently communicate with vessels who don\u0027t really exist, but would be very complicated to implement. Smarter men and/or women than me need to do the fieldwork in the electrical API field. I hear that it\u0027s coming. When it does, i think i will add power consumption to this plugin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould like to do more with power, not only with the ever requested power consumption.
