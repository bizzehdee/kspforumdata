So yeah make some thinly veiled threats to keep breaking the rules no matter what, that certainly helps your cause doesn\u0026#39;t? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can still make and sharecraft, even cooperatively. It has been stated many times now. There just won\u0026#39;t be a rb thread, but you can use the exchange thread. Just don\u0026#39;t roleplay it like a real company in the sense of acting out parts it\u0026#39;s not hard to understand is it?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou were graciously given some time to backup all your work by the devs, in fact they could have easily just erased the whole thread if they wanted. There is nothing that says they have to let you backup or move your work over, sans rp of course, to the exchange. But they let you. So maybe count that as a blessing in a difficult situation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey have since said that rb will be a hidden archive after the change to allow people to link to it and work on changing things over after the change as well. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs as for the company part, you can still brand your stuff with a name if you like. It\u0026#39;s perfectly ok, for example look at Roverdudes stuff for USI, or Taraniselu for TAC even TriggerAU for trigger tech I think it is? And several others that brand all their work. The difference you ask? Well when you go into their thread they talk and act like a regular person, they don\u0026#39;t roleplay a ceo or a company at all. They don\u0026#39;t play or act out bits ever. There is a big difference and keeps things nicer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow being upset is generally fine, as is voicing your opinion and pushing for change. But honestly I hope one day many of you realize that your actions in this thread alone have probably done more to validate this decision by the devs. The amount of asinine, insolent posts, and plain lack of respect shown toward squad and the mods trying to get change kind of amazes me. You may be unhappy and I do understand it to some extent, but it was no need to act the way many have, and continue to do so here, towards the mods or anyone really.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ni would be upset if some of my contributions I have made to a couple threads went away too,I invested time in it and it\u0026#39;s nice to have the history yes. But My life would continue as normal, if a persons life won\u0026#39;t because of that, then they really need look into some help as there are issues there. But things end, this game or the whole world could end tomorrow. Squad is a small company and things can happen much easier and quicker to a small company, good or bad. Squad does not have to provide us with a forum. They don\u0026#39;t have to allow us to create, use, or share mods or crafts at all. But they do and they have established rules and are working to enforce them for what I see are perfectly valid reasons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nand really the main point to really think about now is that if you all had just followed the rules and avoided the role playing altogether you probably wouldn\u0026#39;t be in this mess. And if you\u0026#39;d like to continue making and sharing craft which I\u0026#39;m sure many people including me to a small extent, would like, just put aside the rp aspect and things will be fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut honestly most of you have gotten so rediculous in your responses to this, that like I said you have more than anything done so much to validate the devs/mods decision.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m sorry but \u0026#39;follow the rules and everything will be OK\u0026#39;, without any further justification, is rarely a good argument. Rules are not immutable; if enough people can break them without causing harm to themselves or others, then perhaps its time to review and maybe change them to something more manageable. Blindly following The Rules just because they\u0026#39;re The Rules is just as bad as ignoring The Rules just because they\u0026#39;re The Rules.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour circular argument of an unpopular decision being justified because it was unpopular doesn\u0026#39;t hold much merit either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, judging from what I\u0026#39;ve read on this thread, there was a wide spectrum of posts on the RB forum, ranging from \u0026#39;clearly within the rules\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;harmlessly skirting the edges of the rules\u0026#39;, to \u0026#39;clearly breaking the rules to the detriment of others.\u0026#39; Punishing everyone on that spectrum, for the sake of the people on one end of it, is unfair.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegardless of anyone\u0026#39;s personal feelings about the RB forum, this announcement was a poor piece of change management. Squad have a forum (for better or for worse) where players metaphorically take to the streets in defense of the Round8. A forum where there are long discussions about fragmenting vs clamshell fairings. I do wonder how they imagined those players might react to having an entire section of the forums deleted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe decision to close the RB thread, as originally presented, looked arbitrary. I hear a lot on this thread about how the role-playing got out of hand in the past. Fine - then the correct decision would have been to close down RB (with a warning) at that time, not some indeterminate time later.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, whether or not the decision was objectively justified, presenting it as \u0026#39;this is how its going to be - deal with it\u0026#39; was not a good way of getting people to agree with Squad\u0026#39;s position, especially when those people had relatively little time to \u0026#39;deal with it\u0026#39;. One arbitrary looking decision also, understandably, prompts concerns about the possibility of other arbitrary decisions happening later on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI accept that everything looks obvious in hindsight but I\u0026#39;m also willing to bet that if Squad had simply chosen to leave RB up as a read-only section of the new forums, then this thread would have been an awful lot shorter. It would have been clear that they were respecting (or at least tolerating) existing content, whilst still having a place for new, similar content shorn of any elements that had been found to cause problems in the past.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T09:21:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 09:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T09:26:32Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027BlueCanary\u0027]The thing is, there\u0026#39;ll be lots of threads by people who\u0026#39;ve left the forums, and those will not be backed up.
