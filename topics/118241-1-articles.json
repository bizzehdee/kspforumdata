I had a question in regards to heat radiators;\n\nHas anyone ever absolutely needed heat radiators for a mission? The only time I\u0027ve really overheated while going interplanetary was during the long nuke-engine burns, and even then the heat dissipates shortly after. I have heard something along the lines of overheating affecting the efficiency of engines, but I\u0027m not sure. \n\nAnswers will be used for future reference, so thank you in advance.

Task was to get to Minmus and back in a very short time. I relied on a large heat shield to protect me on a 7km/s return. As it turned out, the LV-Ns generated enough heat to significantly deplete my ablator from the heat shield. No amount of radiators could entirely prevent this, but a few slowed it down enough to make the mission survivable."},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T12:49:47Z","Content":"I took them with me on my first mining rig, assuming that having bloody big drills grinding up the surface of a planet would generate substantial amounts of heat. \n\nThen I remembered that since I was on Minmus I was probably mining mint sorbet.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T13:25:51Z","Content":"They are useful if you use LV-Ns with smaller parts. I did have a couple ships blow up to overheating from LV-N without radiators. I\u0027m fairly sure my asteroid tug would be twice as much pain in the neck as it was (and it was a lot already!) if I didn\u0027t add the radiators (\u0022small thermal control system\u0022) to the tiny tanks on which the LV-Ns were mounted. After a continuous burn of over an hour they showed up with orange bars. Though I\u0027m sure standard small radiators would suffice even then.\n\nOTOH the \u0022Large Thermal Control System\u0022 - I doubt it\u0027s useful beyond sundiving.
