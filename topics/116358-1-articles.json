I remember it said something to me (I forget what, though I think it was some sort of indirectly threatening greeting). I was terrified in the dream as I tried to respond with a simple \u0022hi.\u0022 My lips were sealed shut. I still remember bolting up to a sitting position after waking up and quietly saying \u0022hi.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother one began with my sister having a bunch of friends over at my house, and then I think an alarm for a natural disaster went off (The disaster in the dream turned out to be a volcano, but I do remember the initially reported disaster being different). We locked them in a concrete vault for protection, and drove away from the house in our van (which couldn\u0027t fit all of them) to safety. After the event, we came back to the house and went to the bunker. No noise was heard inside of it. We opened the door and all that was left was skeletons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was that one dream where I was outside at night and had my head chopped off by a mysterious figure on a horse. I originally thought I had been OK (since it hadn\u0027t hurt), but then once trying to feel around did I realize what had happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a tornado dream where I figured out it was a dream but couldn\u0027t change it or escape it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore recently, there\u0027s been a few as well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my mid-Spore years (2011-2013), I made friends with a user who roleplayed a lot using dragons (He has since sworn off of role-playing, which I am glad about. I never did it [unless you count picture-wars, but that was nation role-play, {Bracket-ception} which can be quite fun]). Somehow that wormed my way into my dream one night, and I wound up with what I call the \u0022pod car dream.\u0022 It involved me watching the events of the dream unfold almost like a movie. The main character, who was completely inspired by my Spore friend, lived in a dystopian society heavily controlled by the government. He was a happy soul, either 12 or 13, and he was told that he was a \u0022mutant\u0022 by a doctor. Being a mutant meant that one would be subjected to life in a pod car for pretty much their entire teenage life, which would leave them heavily emotionally changed once they emerged. That\u0027s pretty much the plot that dream presented before it ended, though I have since molded that plot and added many more events in the future to create what could possibly be one of the best Spore GA tragedies ever made, if I can find the resources and time to make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I\u0027ve been typing for awhile.

We began making our way outside, seeing the building light up on fire as we got out of it. The entire block was on fire. I remember walking across a wooden catwalk with one of the buildings right next to it on fire, being heavily nervous that the catwalk would light up while I was standing on it. Me, my father, and other bystanders got to a safe distance away from the flames, which were consuming every building in sight, and at the end of the dream I was trying to decide whether it was better to escape by taking the pathway or the stream (Though I think it actually ended with my just running as far away as possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my set of dreams.

We were both on our way back home. He suggested we\u0027d take the bus 22, but it had departed at 8:40 and it was already 8:45. I then told him we should use the bus 543 instead, then get off at the nearby gas station and change to the bus 510 which would take us home (these are all actual bus routes where we live - 22 used to run right through our neighborhood, and 510 still does. However, 543 doesn\u0027t use the same stops as 510 - in fact, it goes in a completely different direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, we got on the bus and noticed it was right-hand-drive. That was really weird because we drive on the left in Finland. The driver was a middle-aged woman, probably between 50 and 60 years old. The next thing I remember is that we were driving down a small, bendy asphalt road in the middle of a birch forest. I, my friend and the driver were the only people on the bus. Then we arrived at large parking lot. Next to it (on the right side, when viewed from the entrance) were several low garage-like buildings. The parking lot itself was full of orange traffic cones that appeared to form a racing course of some sort. There was also a white or silver Cadillac Escalade parked on the opposite side of the parking lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe driver stopped the bus and told me to take the wheel. I can\u0027t remember what happened next, but just before I woke up, I was chasing that Cadillac around the track. In a freaking bus. I was already pushing the thing to its limits. The woman was talking to me via a walkie-talkie. She told me to drive faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually quite surprised I could remember things this well. I usually forget my dreams within seconds of waking up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
