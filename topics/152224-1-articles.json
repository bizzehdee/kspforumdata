A launcher built according to the specs below is very well-behaved and has ample \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get into a 80Km \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nStage 1: 1.5TWR and ~1750 delta-V\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStage 2: 1.0TWR and ~1750 delta-V\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWatch your drag and your weight balance - any asymmetrical drag or weight will tend to pull you off course\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLastly, I use my prograde marker for most of my launch with the goal of being at 45 degrees by 10Km.

Your nose will drop past 10 degrees and won\u0027t be in-line with the prograde marker, which isn\u0027t ideal but you\u0027re not moving very fast yet\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen I hit about 170m/s switch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to Prograde. This brings your nose in-line with direction of travel and minimizes drag.
