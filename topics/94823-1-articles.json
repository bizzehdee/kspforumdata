It always feels to me like the other way around. Once the chute is deployed, the ship itself often changes orientation to be correct with the chute. Not to mention that you can very easily force rotate your vessel to not be along the vector of the chute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T22:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not which end is wagging which \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E just wish I could find how to reference the two parts of the model \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T22:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EModuleParachute parachute_module = [ref_to_module];\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETransform transform = parachute_module.part.FindModelTransform(parachute_module.canopyName);\u003Cbr\u003E//Now modify the transform to point at the proper direction\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might help?
