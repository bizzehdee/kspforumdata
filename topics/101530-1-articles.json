Today I have a question that might be stupid, but, even if I\u0027ve been following space exploration everyday for a couple of years now, I had never thought of. In fact, I didn\u0027t come up with it, a friend of mine did. So, the question is **why is the Opportunity rover lasting so long on Mars?** Sure, a lot of space probes have exceeded their warranty dates. However, rovers are very different. The wheel system, for example, was designed to last only 90 days, and now, 3953 Sols later, it\u0027s apparently doing better than Curiosity\u0027s wheels. My question is why? Did the engineers back then think that the martian surface was much more hazardous than it actually turned out to be? However, my question doesn\u0027t refer just to the wheels, but to the entire rover itself. I\u0027m not even sure whether or not there\u0027s a precise answer(s), but either way thank you to anyone that will reply."},{"CreatedByName":"epoca","CreatedById":136475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T14:55:52Z","Content":"That\u0027s a good question.

So I\u0027m guessing they overstimated the wheel-damage risk for Opportunity and understimated it for Curiosity? Curiosity\u0027s wheels do look much more fragile (that\u0027s probably because they wanted to make them as light as possible, but now it\u0027s a big problem for the rover. I remember sometime last year they had to change the rover\u0027s path plan to avoid further damage).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The mars exploration rovers had to survive a much rougher landing than curiosity, bouncing around on airbags for a while, so they\u0027re probably build a bit tougher.\n\nThat makes sense, but the question still stands. If they built Opportunity and Spirit a bit tougher, then why did they think they wouldn\u0027t last long? From what others have posted here, it appears they probably didn\u0027t think that the martian wind would blow off dust from the panels so often.\n\nThanks everyone!

Now we know it possible and so we can invest more in the missions.\n\nMemory is alot more dense now than it was then, and you can easily have all the redundancy you want, but as the number of communication satellites in Mars orbit increases, you also can send alot more data, which means that the mission demands increase. I think they don\u0027t really need vehicles that last more than 4 years, after that amount of time they are due for technological upgrades and new instrumentation, time for a new mission.
