Just a few examples of some of the higher quality ones I use, and what they do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERealism: If you\u0027re not yet fully comfortable with the game, I would suggest laying off these for a while, but they\u0027re worth looking into nonetheless\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFarram Aerospace Research (FAR)\u003C/strong\u003E: Adds a drag model and actual functional lift to aircraft. Allows for better spaceplane creation/flight, among other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeadly Re-entry (DRE)\u003C/strong\u003E: Does what it says. Adds re-entry heat (requires heat shields) and your ship and crew are much more susceptible to g-forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIonCross Crew Support\u003C/strong\u003E: Adds oxygen requirement and CO2 buildup in crew capsules. You\u0027ll need to add O2 tanks and CO2 scrubbers for your crew to survive any major duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/strong\u003E: Requires a communitcation network be established for your unmanned craft. Also incorporates a command delay based on the distance your coms have to travel (i.e. 0.5 sec delay from any command input to a craft orbiting Minmus).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPart Packs: Addon parts to increase your ship building options (either aesthetically or functionally speaking)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/strong\u003E: One of my \u0027must haves.\u0027 Greatly increases the number of options you have in fuel tanks and engines. Also gives you a lot of fairings and other aerodyamic parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EB9 Aerospace Pack (B9)\u003C/strong\u003E: If you get FAR, this one is also a must. Greatly increases the amount of wings and other aerodynamic parts. Great for building spaceplanes, among other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBobcat\u0027s American and/or Soviet Packs\u003C/strong\u003E: Two separate mods; the Soviet pack concentrates on the Soyuz series of rockets, but also includes the Buran and Kliper orbital spacecraft. The American pack contains the more recently conceived ARES I \u0026amp; V launch vehicles as well as the Orion craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBobcat\u0027s H.O.M.E.\u003C/strong\u003E: Pack to assist with the colonization of other worlds. Contains a variety of modules to help in this manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKOSMOS Space Station Parts\u003C/strong\u003E: A variety of Soviet space station parts (also some very awesome solar panels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFusTek Station Parts Expansion\u003C/strong\u003E: Another good variety of station parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural Wings (pWings)\u003C/strong\u003E: Just a couple small but very useful parts. Think of a wing that you can adjust to pretty much any (flat) shape that you want. Very helpful when making replicas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EISA MapSat\u003C/strong\u003E: A couple small parts and a plugin that allows you to map your planets and moons from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKethane\u003C/strong\u003E: This is a pretty big one. Adds the resource \u0027Kethane\u0027 to all celestial bodies in your game. You must scan planets to find it, drill to extract it, and then convert it to whatever fuel you want. Really good once you start to get bored, as it add some decent goals and what-not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPlugin Addons: I would recommend waiting for a while before downloading these. Although some are completely harmless (Crew Manifest), if you start relying on certain ones (MechJeb) before you\u0027ve got the game down, it can really hamper your experience.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew Manifest\u003C/strong\u003E: Plugin that allows you to empty/fill your crafts on the launchpad/runway. Also transfer crew between pods while on a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProtractor:\u003C/strong\u003E Plugin that allows you to see the phase angles of the planets for ease of launching interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMechJeb\u003C/strong\u003E: Sort of an all-encompassing mod. The reason I say wait a while before getting this is that this mod can takeoff, land, dock, setup maneuver nodes, etc. for you. Personally I use it for the multitude of information it provides (I used the auto-dock once. Found it was prohibitively heavy on the RCS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Controller\u003C/strong\u003E: If you\u0027re looking for a bit more structure in your gameplay (in lieu of a career mode), this mod gives you a bunch of missions to complete, adds a basic monetary system, and basically just focuses the sandbox a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m obviously not saying you should get all of these, I\u0027m just pointing out some of the good ones that I have either used in the past, or are currently using now. It\u0027s all down to taste. There are some good mods that are absent from this list, like Flight Engineer (or whatever it\u0027s called). I\u0027ve omitted them only because I\u0027ve never used it, therefore cannot comment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T05:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbove list is awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would add :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPX - A bunch of parts that will become stock (the dev of this mod was hired by squad). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS - Kerbal Attachment System, it adds a couple of winches, attachments like electromagnets and grappling hooks.

Use the ones you want, don\u0027t use the features you don\u0027t want to use. Ignore the haters who say Mechjeb is cheating. Don\u0027t rely on it too much until you learn though, because the autopilots make things really easy. The information windows are really useful when building rockets though, since they give the total mass, TWR and delta-v to help you plan things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPX: A few extra parts that are useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane: Adds a mineable resource that gives some purpose to what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaPunch Parts Pack: Lots of parts including 3.5 and 5 meter stuff for really big rockets, plus a wider selection of engines that are all fairly balanced to be in line with the stock engines. Personally, I removed parts from it I don\u0027t use like the fairings and the extra fuel tanks that are basically the same as stock but with different textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW rocketry is also popular, but I don\u0027t use it. My system hates having lots of parts, and NovaPunch gives me what I need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuantum Fuel Transfer System: Think of it as fuel hoses. Makes transferring fuel easier, and works with the kethane mod as well. Takes a little practice to learn how to set it up and you need to put the transfer nodes where your kerbals can reach them via EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer: I find it funny and it drives the roommate crazy, too.
