A big one that connects the two vessels for the transfer to Duna and a small one to connect the capsule to the cruiser for the transfer back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: What happens is this: If I disconnect the big docking port (that was connected in Kerbin orbit in the first place) the lander starts to spin uncontrollably und disintegrates. Explodes, basically. Like it is in a seperate frame of reference after decoupling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if I disconnect the small one (that has struts stabilizing it and is basically just an adapter in between the two vessels), everything is fine.

Then, still with SAS left off, undock the ships. And if that doesn\u0027t work, then I got nothin\u0027.
