It seems NASA has not developed the matter further. If you ask NASA why, they will not reply. Reason is that you need the same amount of fuel or mass to brake and to accelerate, but you need to carry the fuel or mass to brake with you, when you accelerate, and then ... you get too heavy. And as soon as you get close to any planet or moon, the local gravity will accelerate your mass too and attract your mass, so you will go faster and faster ... and you\u0027ll crash.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, we get it.
