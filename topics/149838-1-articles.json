I can spin them off, which is a waste of fuel. But it didn\u0027t seem to happen if I saved / reloaded before attempting EVA. The engine shroud came into play because I\u0027d often have fuel to spare in a transfer stage, and I\u0027d use that to start a descent burn. I\u0027d then decouple that stage almost right before landing, and the subsequent stage had a shroud that was also decoupled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wanted to verify if the behaviour I\u0027m seeing here is from this bug, and if the save / reload before attempting EVA worked around it. I wondered at first if the\u00A0EVA Follower mod\u00A0caused this, but then I remembered this didn\u0027t happen on craft without fairings or shrouds, and remembered Sal\u0027s FAQ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is from the 1.1.3 build about two weeks before the 1.2 pre-release came out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-5Cg_4BQXo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-14T01:54:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2016 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Fecyk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClairifying why I wanted to ask this question\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal101","CreatedById":157058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T11:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a bug caused by fairing that is still attached to the craft after deployment and it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142245-eva-bug-in-113/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2800068\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehas been fixed in 1.2\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
