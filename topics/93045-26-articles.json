However, you can still stage. And that\u0027s all they did with those early sounding rockets (they don\u0027t even have any means of steering - no reaction wheels, no gimbals, no control surfaces).\u003Cp\u003ENote that in RP-0, you always need an avionics package to control the ship; even having a pilot does not seem to be enough if you don\u0027t bring one of the avionics parts with you.
