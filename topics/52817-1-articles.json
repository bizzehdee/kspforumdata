When they try to tie two tanks together in a stack, they usually get the initial attachment to \u0027stick\u0027 (IE you see the retainer and have a waving end you can stick to something else).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I get is when the engineer tries to attach to the next tank, most of the time the end never wants to stick to the next tank. (Or if they do, the ends seem buried inside the tank and you cant really see them or tell if they are attached).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe QA guys are going nuts and turnover in the strutting division is reaching really high levels with morale at an all time low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a consultant we can call in who knows all things strutty?
