His name was Jebediah Kerman and with no flying experience nor a completed degree in rocket science, he was going to be the first of his kind to set a step on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. The reason why the Facility hired Jeb still remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries of the planed, though some say that it is for his loving smile, whereas others claim that it\u0027s Jebediah\u0027s badass courage that makes him the no. 1 choice in space commanders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img29/1597/ksp6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img23/2/ksp7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp7.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E(Jebediah is posing like a photo-model before entering the glorious spacecraft) ...

Liftoff! The engines roar while Jebediah and his crew wait in suspense. The crew (consisting of Bill and Bob Kerman, who strangely look familiar) shares the same surname as Jeb (although they aren\u0027t family), which makes him feel more at ease in the scary, massive universe. The flight to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was a long and boring one, with many missed maneuvers and a gravitational slingshot that almost pulled them into an orbit around the sun. Finally, 45 hours and 30 Game of Thrones episodes later, the Mun-Habitation-Unit mk8 circled in a near-perfect orbit around the targeted M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and now was the time to throttle up, facing the earth, to make a smooth landing on the ground-grey surface of the old nifty orb of night. As Bill and Bob ran around in panic in the operation vessel, Jeb kept calm and had the whole operation under control. The landing was smoother than salesman\u0027s selling-story and Jeb evacuated the spacecraft to see the most majestic natural wonder that the old Roman Kerbals called \u0022The eye of the moon\u0022. How the old Roman Kerbals even knew about the Moon Arch is another unsolved mystery, since the arch is permanently facing in the direction of Not-Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img46/1265/ksp8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp8.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img221/410/ksp11.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp11.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E(Just like the movies) ...

At least, that is what the cute little Kerbals thought when they re-entered the vehicle. During his trip to the Arch, Bill had taken over the vehicle. He persisted in visiting the other side of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, so they could take a picture of Kerbin, for Bill\u0027s scrapbook. Easier said than done, it turned out. Bill, claiming he could fly just as well as Jeb, launched the rocket and flew to the other side. Bob, green of jealousy and bored to death, just sat there doing nothing. One moment, when he became a little thirsty, he pressed the \u0027Tea\u0027 button expecting a nice cup of the finest Earl Green to be served by a lovely blonde Kerbal. The panic of Bill, caused by a sudden uncontrollability of the rocket, made his daydream scatter into a million pieces. Around 13 seconds later the whole spacecraft followed the example of Bob\u0027s dream. Jeb, like the badass he is, managed to contact the Ground-Facility and left a message on the voicemail (all employees were busy at the moment, since the KFC (Kerbal Football Championship) was on TV). Eight hours later, after the L.O.S.E.\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AE-team won the trophy in the KFC-league, a second rocket took off to save the poor lads from the distant crescent. Led by Tyrone Kerbal, the rescue team made a long but stable flight to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Other than in Jeb\u0027s spacecraft, the other crew members (Boris Kerman and Han Solo) enjoyed the flight and did not take over the vehicle. It took Tyrone 1 mile with his EVA-Jetpack to join the hungry desolated colleagues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img560/8412/ksp15.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp15.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img194/8284/ksp18.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp18.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E(Cpt.

Bill and Bob shared the detention-pod, the lowest pod with the most heat from the main engine. Han Solo wrote an autobiography of his life during the flight. he claimed to have seen big hairy monsters with crossbows and dark masked giants using red Lazors as a weapon. \u0022Too much fantasy\u0022 Jeb and Boris sighed at the same time. Tyrone pressed the \u0027T\u0027 button to stabilize the vessel for the landing, hearing a scream from the lowest pod.
