I was under the impression if a user was making his own contract, then he is usually making it for a specific vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm on the fence about the payouts right now for custom contracts. I have been playing around with it for weeks or so. And in my first few missions was able to Bring home 1.3 million. It made for a different game play experience though. IE making more vessels and having the wiggle room to do side missions of my own without any contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a nutshell I really need an opinion on what others think of the contracts payout. If we go by old standards of How MC worked then they pay out way to much. But in the defense of the system, they also are very Diverse in what you can do with those payments. Makes things interesting... Only caveat I have for this, is that it seems that Kerbal Space Programs .24 system and beyond is going to be pretty lax in this area.. I don\u0027t even think they are going to charge for vessels by the way it sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole idea about Custom Contracts was to cater to other mods needs.

After installing Devbuild 6, when hitting a Munar encounter with a manned crew, I would get a G-spike that would kill the crew. 9 times out of ten. I had this happen to me previously while running the city lights and clouds devbuild, and removing it resolved that. When this happened again, removing MCE Devbuild 6 resolved it. I\u0027m currently running version .43. Is there anything you can think of in MCE that would cause an issue? The log immediately following the spike showed a bunch of \u0022key not found in dictionary\u0022 messages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also having a different issue with Version .43. For some reason, when I load a saved game, my MCE progress doesn\u0027t load -- it loads up like its a brand new save. However, if I exit back to the main menu, then re-load the game, my MCE save loads. I can\u0027t find anything in the log to indicate an issue -- I\u0027m hoping this is a known bug. I\u0027ve tried creating a new save and coying my data from the persistence and MCE backup files to the appropriate spots, but it still happens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know your thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinux x64 user btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, can\u0027t think of what would cause a G spike like that from MCE.. MCE really does not do anything in this area other then read info. And only area MCE uses a dictionary (Part of code) is with Custom Contracts values for planet info. If its at all possible next time it happens if you could possibly get me a copy of the Outputlog.txt file for I can see what that dictionary reference is pointing at, I might be able to figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI travel to the mun all the time in current game and have not had this happen yet. So it would be interesting to see what this could be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso its possible if you have too many parts mods installed that your game is bugging out because its using to much ram. usually when the ram goes nuts, the first thing to start to go is Physics calculations. Thats why they have the Texture reduction mods for you don\u0027t go over 3.5 Gigs of ram.. (which KSP can\u0027t handle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would make sense in this case, becuase city and lights is ram intensive.
