It measures acceleration, integrates to find velocity, and integrates again to find position. Unfortunately, the coordinate system that kOS is using makes no sense. How do I make my own ship-centered coordinate system with X pointing east, Y pointing radially up, and Z pointing north? And, since the origin is at the center of the ship, will that make all accelerations in that reference frame zero since it can\u0027t accelerate relative to itself?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-05T04:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsounds like a question for \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/63481-dunbaratu/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002263481\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/63481-dunbaratu/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dunbaratu\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
