I\u0027ve tested it against NASA data on the solar system over a century, and while I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d trust it for planning actual missions it does appear stable and to closely resemble reality if not exactly match it.

If you do get use out of them, or have problems with them, or have suggestions, let me know!

Seems to be a bit unstable! Though admittedly there\u0027s still a bit of error in the input of the start state, I\u0027ve not properly converted the mean anomaly values on the wiki into correct true anomaly, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027ll be a big enough change to stabilize that system. Once I do it\u0027ll be interesting to do a long run and see if the Jool system settles down into a stable state after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatThePath","CreatedById":123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T18:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright!
