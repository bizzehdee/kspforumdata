When you were aerobraking, what attitude did you use? One thing that can help is to try to maximize your drag, e.g. flying sideways rather than engines-first, at least until the heating gets up to the point where you need to go engines-first so that your more temperature-sensitive components don\u0027t get fried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI highly recommend airbrakes, they\u0027re extraordinarily effective. Cheap, light, convenient radial attachment, come with their own built-in hotkey. They can slow you down significantly while you\u0027re still way up high, and have the added advantage that you can turn them on/off while you\u0027re aerobraking. This makes it less touchy (i.e. you\u0027re not totally committed at the time you choose periapsis-- if you have an \u0022oh crap, my periapsis is too low\u0022 moment, just ease up on the brakes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, I\u0027m not sure why the middle tier of fuel tanks were the ones that got the hottest?
