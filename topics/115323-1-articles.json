One thing that can help is to try to maximize your drag, e.g. flying sideways rather than engines-first, at least until the heating gets up to the point where you need to go engines-first so that your more temperature-sensitive components don\u0027t get fried.\n\nI highly recommend airbrakes, they\u0027re extraordinarily effective. Cheap, light, convenient radial attachment, come with their own built-in hotkey. They can slow you down significantly while you\u0027re still way up high, and have the added advantage that you can turn them on/off while you\u0027re aerobraking. This makes it less touchy (i.e. you\u0027re not totally committed at the time you choose periapsis-- if you have an \u0022oh crap, my periapsis is too low\u0022 moment, just ease up on the brakes).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I\u0027m not sure why the middle tier of fuel tanks were the ones that got the hottest?

(Think it was 42.6km, might have been 43.6). Couldn\u0027t have taken much more heating and only lowered my apoapsis from 46,000 km to 20,000 km. (About 60m/s by my reckoning).\n\nA smaller ship (Midsized Rockomax tank, Poodle engine, and a three man capsule). Got down to 37 km and lost about 240 m/s. But it also was mostly empty in fuel and smaller (less weight for cross section area) so I figure it just works better for smaller craft.\n\nOne the ship pictured, the middle tanks were full."}]}
