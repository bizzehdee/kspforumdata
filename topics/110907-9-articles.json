It\u0027s fairly sensible.\n\nWhat is not fine is thinking you are better than others for not using mods or saying that people who do use mods are in any way cheating or not playing the game how it should be played. There is no way the game should be played, everyone plays their own game.\n\nMyself I don\u0027t have many part mods at all. I mainly install RPM, FAR, EVE, RT, KCT, ScanSat, RWsaturatable, persistentrotation, KAC, KER, MJ, Proc Fairings, Proc Parts, some contract mods and some mods that fix errors the stock game (claws bug fix, turn off temperature gauges etc)\n\nIt\u0027s nice to not need some mods I used to use like solarpanelfix, DRE etc. Now their behaviour is stock the game is better for it. \n\nA nice surprise is the new heating system.\n\nI like mods because they make the game harder and more pretty. I landed a kerbal on every body in the system within 4 weeks of buying the game all stock. Then I thought \u0022Oh, is that it?\u0022 and looked at some mods.\n\nEDIT :\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The reason I mod a game is usually because I have played it long enough and a bit bored with it.\n\u003E I start installing a few mods, hey this looks/is great!\n\u003E \n\u003E A few more mods later, and I am soon spending more time looking at mods, testing/playing with mods and the game play becomes secondary.\n\u003E \n\u003E modded game revisited months later and nothing works...\n\u003E \n\u003E Loving KSP at stock...\n\nI can still play all my old modded games.
