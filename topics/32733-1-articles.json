This little beauty takes three Kerbals and two 6 passenger vehicles to the Mun and has enough fuel for the return trip back, sans vehicles. Why two cars? Because I\u0027ve seen how you drive on the mun, that\u0027s why, and you\u0027ll appreciate having a spare standing by. The Nina has a very wide spread making landing on all but the steepest slopes possible, though obviously the flatter the better. The Craft file is all stock for Version .20.1 but I highly recommend adding MechJeb2 and ISA Mapsat add-ons to be sure you\u0027re not wasting fuel or time searching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures Include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDocking Port\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERCS thrusters - though hardly needed except for docking\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETwo 6 passenger vehicles for exploring\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESturdy frame - very reliable \u0026amp; well balanced\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVehicles include roll-over recovery features and full science pack\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVehicles will operate manned or unmanned\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPink Floyd\u0027s Dark Side of the Moon lighting package\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperating Tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy perferred method of flight is to launch to 80km using Mechjeb2 for a circular orbit, fly to Mun and select a landing zone using ISA Mapsat maps and Mechjeb2 lander guidance. This routine has always afforded me a safe return trip home with this vessel. I also recommend activating the brakes before releasing/staging the rovers else they may roll away and be a little difficult to retrieve. I would also keep the speed 10 m/s or less unless in very smooth terrain, the low gravity of the moon makes for some surprising twists and turns at high speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/nina-v1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload the Nina here\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1365.photobucket.com/albums/r747/jdeaux44/Nina_zps9cfdd5c6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Nina_zps9cfdd5c6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-14T02:10:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2013 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jean Deaux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J0hnsmine","CreatedById":66501,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T08:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! i got it myself and it inspired me to do other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T11:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s certainaly adaptable.
