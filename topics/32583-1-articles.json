AFAIK this doesn\u0027t work because the root part of an assembly is never the docking port unless that\u0027s where you started building it as an addon to another existing ship. It is doable, but it takes planning in construction, and you sometimes have to \u0027build backwards\u0027. Place a docking port on the piece you\u0027re working on where you want the next piece to join, then place another docking port facing the first (using the wasd/qe keys to rotate it to the way you want them joined) and then start building your next module.
