Stripped down to the basics, if you are doing a gravity assist at a planet, and you perform a 10m/s burn at a periapsis velocity of 1000m/s vs a periapsis velocity of 100m/s, your energy return is higher when you leave the SOI.

We are only concerned with the change we get by making the burn, and for simplifying things, lets say our mass is 2kg.

There\u0027s a lot of other math involved in entering and leaving the system, but that\u0027s basically what Oberth says.
