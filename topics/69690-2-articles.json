For 6 or more, however, the lab is a much better call. Make an ultra-light lander, bring a lab and spare fuel, and you can get all the science off Minmus or the Mun with a relatively small investment. My classic mission for the Mun in that regard uses a lab, a Rockomax 32 fuel tank, and a lander so sprightly that it has only an FL-T200 for fuel. It visits all 15 biomes, gets all the science, and the lab cleans up the experiments once it returns to the mothership in its polar orbit. The net profit from this is almost enough to unlock every tech tree node on its own; by the time you have all the science necessary to run the mission, it\u0027s more than enough to complete what remains of the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E The way I always did it, if I thought I was going to visit four biomes, I\u0027d take four of each type of science-generating part.
