One thing I might be changing is to -slightly- shorten the SRB segments; as it is now the 5-segment booster is a -bit- tall when used with the 35m tank (likely related to the fact that 64% scaled SLS should actually be ~5.5m in diameter, rather than 5, but I\u0027ve used the full 64% scaled height values). Anyhow I\u0027ll likely release them as-is for this weekend, let me know what you think of the SRB heights; will hold of on doing anymore texture stuff on them in case of geometry changes (and adding the jettison hardware to the model).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, strongly thinking on \u0027slapping together\u0027 a set of 3.75 and 2.5m lifetrs by rescaling the 5m (tanks/engines/srbs) downward; would certainly function acceptably as a placeholder until new textures could be made (for the tanks/srbs), or new geometry made (for the engines).

There should be no more white un-textured parts in the next release. Trying to get all the still-WIP stuff to the \u0027just needs textures finished\u0027 stage, as at that point I am done messing with Unity (where most errors and frustration will occur).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason I released the un-textured parts was to get some feedback regarding the overall balance and feel of the parts; as I cannot even start UV unwrapping or texturing until the geometry has been mostly finalized, and the balance would influence the geometry, it was far quicker and easier to use the untextured parts for the initial \u0027testing the waters\u0027 release. I will probably do similar test releases of new parts in the future -- put out an untextured \u0027test\u0027 part to check the balance and get feedback on it before it is too late to change things (as after I have done the UV unwrap and AO bakes it is -very- difficult to change geometry cleanly... requires remaking major portions of the model, re-exploding the parts, re-setting up AO bake proxies, re-baking, and finally rebuilding the model from the base and proxies after all changes have been made, and re-exporting to unity, and re-compiling from unity for KSP). For example it took me about two hours to rework the new SRB skirt hardware into the SRB model; and that was without needing to rebuild or re-unwrap stuff; that was all time spent re-proxying, re-baking, and re-building from proxies. And I -still- have to re-export the models from Blender into Unity, recompile them in Unity for KSP, and re-mask and export the textures (another hour or so worth of work). At least programming, for all the complexities it has, has a simple \u0027push the button and copy the finished file\u0027 setup; only takes me like 30s to compile and update the plugin (a big part of why I so dislike modeling and texturing, and would much rather concentrate on coding, if only there were an artist willing to help make these parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this is the -dev- thread, and these are all dev/testing releases, I feel releasing test parts/unfinished stuff is acceptable.

We should shoot for a small and medium booster, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking for the medium lifter, since you\u0027ve already had the ICPS since the begging, there could be a Delta IV Heavy and such. And for a smaller booster, I was thinking like another kind of Delta, but the Delta II\u0027s 9 solid rocket boosters might conflict with your low part count solutions, so what about an Atlas V 401 or something? Just something small. :b\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus with the Atlas V, there have been many ways to do it that involves very little part count.(CCB fuel tank and RD-180 one part, adapter and second stage decoupler one part, RL-10a engine and Centaur fuel tank one part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, an Atlas V in your art style would be absolutely amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few posts ago I mentioned I was thinking about rescaling the 5m tank/srb?/engine geometry down for 3.75m and 2.5m lifter parts (at least for a set of test parts, will likely design specific geometry for at least the engines for other lifter packs, and updated textures on the tanks). These would form the lower stages for the smaller lifter packs, and I would likely design some size-specific upper-stages for use with them as well. These two sets of parts would likely be branded as Series-A, to replace the retired Apollo inspired stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill likely be keeping the engines separate from the fuel tanks for these as well (for the lower stage/lifters); the part-count reduction will have to come from eliminating the need for fuel-tank stacking and the pre-built engine clusters and upper stages. Sadly from my time trying to develop the SC-B balance, I\u0027ve realized that \u0027one size fits all\u0027 tank\u002Bengine setups... well, aren\u0027t. It sounds good in theory, but ends up not being modular enough to make good/efficient use of in game. I would rather have 1 extra part (for the lifter engine cluster), than have to design multiple different core lifters or be stuck with a single model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso considering the creation of a couple sizes (and lengths!) of service modules (with integrated RCS, SAS/ASAS, engines, and solar panels/generator of some sort); I noticed I was needing to create service modules with unbearable part count (for a service module anyway) just to deliver stuff to my stations;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll run some balance numbers and see what I can come up with regarding using some rescaled stuff; might even be able to throw together some test configs for this weekends\u0027 release (would use existing models and textures, just rescaled in the config for smaller parts/use).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T21:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s perfect!
