One thing I might be changing is to -slightly- shorten the SRB segments; as it is now the 5-segment booster is a -bit- tall when used with the 35m tank (likely related to the fact that 64% scaled SLS should actually be ~5.5m in diameter, rather than 5, but I\u0027ve used the full 64% scaled height values). Anyhow I\u0027ll likely release them as-is for this weekend, let me know what you think of the SRB heights; will hold of on doing anymore texture stuff on them in case of geometry changes (and adding the jettison hardware to the model).\n\nAlso, strongly thinking on \u0027slapping together\u0027 a set of 3.75 and 2.5m lifetrs by rescaling the 5m (tanks/engines/srbs) downward; would certainly function acceptably as a placeholder until new textures could be made (for the tanks/srbs), or new geometry made (for the engines). Any desire to see these added in the short-term? (They will be coming properly in the long-term, but would be quite a ways out; likely sometime after KSP 1.1)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T16:06:44Z","Content":"If the nose cones and nozzles aren\u0027t going to have textures, I\u0027ll just use KW.\n\nStill, its good the core stage has a texture.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T16:24:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T16:14:39Z","Content":"You should put the updated releases into the DropBox folder that way I don\u0027t actually have to download the latest release!

In fact, I\u0027m pretty sure I just stated that **-none of these textures are even close to finished**- (wording was \u0022have basic textures with finalized UV map, so all that is needed ... is finishing textures\u0022). What is shown is a very rough first pass, with nothing more than AO bakes and some initial color to give it some contrast for various parts. With that said, the textures will likely be as you see them for this weekends\u0027 release (unfinished/WIP), as I cannot finish/work more on textures until I know the geometry is finalized (which needs testing, which means it needs to be released as-is first ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ). \n\nYou are still more than welcome to use KW parts, though I don\u0027t think their SRBs will be able to match these for thrust or booster capability. If I remember correctly, the largest of KW SRBs is ~85t; the -smallest- of my SRBs (2-segment) is ~79t. The thrust is fairly linear with weight; the largest of my SRBs is ~200t, and will put out \u003C2x the thrust of the largest KW booster (if I\u0027m doing my math/remembering the stats for the KW stuff properly).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You should put the updated releases into the DropBox folder that way I don\u0027t actually have to download the latest release!

In the meantime, if you have updated any descriptions/etc in there, please let me know and I\u0027ll get them merged for tomorrows release. Could possibly upload a \u0027pre-release\u0027 version of my dev assets at some point today if you wanted to get started on testing/updating the brand-new parts -- just let me know if wanted/needed. \n\nThe main reason I haven\u0027t been updating it so far is that I was unsure if you had made any changes, and did not want to overwrite them. Will have to come up with some sort of system so that I know when you have updated things/know to look for changed files/know that I need to merge the changes in. Would suggest using GitHub and Pull Requests if it wasn\u0027t such a huge learning curve to get setup and working (as it is intended exactly for these types of situations, synching assets and code between multiple developers). (If you -are- interested in going this route, let me know, we can get it set up, but there would be some training invovled)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E PS: Shadow, how do you plan to showcase it? Are you going to release it or is there a twitch channel I\u0027m unaware of?\n\nI\u0027m terrible at PR, marketing, and advertising. And there is not an internet connection in Montana capable of doing streaming (residential at least generally caps at \u003C5mbps upstream bandwidth, need ~20mbps for streaming), so twitch/etc is off the table. Could potentially upload videos (if I were any good at making them) to Youtube/etc, though it takes hours. Last time I tried doing showcase videos (for a Minecraft mod I was developing), they took far too many hours to make for a simple 5-10 minute video, and ended up of questionable quality.\n\nSomewhere closer to KSP 1.1 I\u0027ll likely start working on putting together the official \u0027release thread\u0027 with some updated Imgur albums of the \u0027finished\u0027 stuff to show off the various parts and their basic intended purposes. And that will likely be the extent of my \u0027showcasing\u0027. I have neither the time nor skills to do much more.\n\nHaving said that, if you (or anyone else) is interested in developing some promotional material (after the parts are finished), I would be very appreciative and happy to add them into the OP (and give you a special entry in the credits ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T17:44:05Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t made any changes, and I\u0027ll let you know if I do.

Are the tanks and engines going to have those basic textures on the update this weekend?\n\nThey will all have basic / unfinished textures for this weekend\u0027s update (pretty much exactly what was shown in the renders earlier this morning, perhaps some minor updates/improvements). There should be no more white un-textured parts in the next release. Trying to get all the still-WIP stuff to the \u0027just needs textures finished\u0027 stage, as at that point I am done messing with Unity (where most errors and frustration will occur).\n\nThe only reason I released the un-textured parts was to get some feedback regarding the overall balance and feel of the parts; as I cannot even start UV unwrapping or texturing until the geometry has been mostly finalized, and the balance would influence the geometry, it was far quicker and easier to use the untextured parts for the initial \u0027testing the waters\u0027 release. I will probably do similar test releases of new parts in the future -- put out an untextured \u0027test\u0027 part to check the balance and get feedback on it before it is too late to change things (as after I have done the UV unwrap and AO bakes it is -very- difficult to change geometry cleanly... requires remaking major portions of the model, re-exploding the parts, re-setting up AO bake proxies, re-baking, and finally rebuilding the model from the base and proxies after all changes have been made, and re-exporting to unity, and re-compiling from unity for KSP). For example it took me about two hours to rework the new SRB skirt hardware into the SRB model; and that was without needing to rebuild or re-unwrap stuff; that was all time spent re-proxying, re-baking, and re-building from proxies. And I -still- have to re-export the models from Blender into Unity, recompile them in Unity for KSP, and re-mask and export the textures (another hour or so worth of work). At least programming, for all the complexities it has, has a simple \u0027push the button and copy the finished file\u0027 setup; only takes me like 30s to compile and update the plugin (a big part of why I so dislike modeling and texturing, and would much rather concentrate on coding, if only there were an artist willing to help make these parts).\n\nAs this is the -dev- thread, and these are all dev/testing releases, I feel releasing test parts/unfinished stuff is acceptable. Anything that gets released in the public release thread (which doesn\u0027t exist yet) will be \u0027finished\u0027 as far as textures and geometry are concerned (balance is an always ongoing process, and will likely never be considered complete).\n\nBit of a preview of the added SRB skirt hardware (nose hardware will likely be in the texture where applicable, as it appears to just be nozzles built into the nosecones).\n\n![CFzUjgd.png](http://i.imgur.com/CFzUjgd.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T21:04:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And another thing I just thought of...

These would form the lower stages for the smaller lifter packs, and I would likely design some size-specific upper-stages for use with them as well. These two sets of parts would likely be branded as Series-A, to replace the retired Apollo inspired stuff. \n\nWill likely be keeping the engines separate from the fuel tanks for these as well (for the lower stage/lifters); the part-count reduction will have to come from eliminating the need for fuel-tank stacking and the pre-built engine clusters and upper stages. Sadly from my time trying to develop the SC-B balance, I\u0027ve realized that \u0027one size fits all\u0027 tank\u002Bengine setups... well, aren\u0027t. It sounds good in theory, but ends up not being modular enough to make good/efficient use of in game. I would rather have 1 extra part (for the lifter engine cluster), than have to design multiple different core lifters or be stuck with a single model.\n\nAlso considering the creation of a couple sizes (and lengths!) of service modules (with integrated RCS, SAS/ASAS, engines, and solar panels/generator of some sort); I noticed I was needing to create service modules with unbearable part count (for a service module anyway) just to deliver stuff to my stations;\n\nI\u0027ll run some balance numbers and see what I can come up with regarding using some rescaled stuff; might even be able to throw together some test configs for this weekends\u0027 release (would use existing models and textures, just rescaled in the config for smaller parts/use)."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T21:10:33Z","Content":"That\u0027s perfect!
