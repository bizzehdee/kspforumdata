If you\u0027ve had an experience with mud in real life, then post your experience as a reply to this. Feel free to post pictures, videos, and/or links. We can all admit that at least a few of us have been in mud-related situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s mine: I was walking down a green belt path along a river. I decided to take a break to eat lunch. But I made a mistake. I thought I was stepping onto a piece of solid ground. Nope! My boot sank straight in, and I sank up to just below my knee. Luckily, because it was a rainy day, I was wearing rubber boots. But, because I hadn\u0027t sank all the way with one, I stepped out with the other one too. Both boots sank to almost their tops. About 2 inches (4-5 cm) of the boots were visible. I tried to pull my right boot up. No movement. I tried the left boot. Same thing. I then decided to step out of my boots and on to the green belt path. I then slowly stepped as close to the mud I could get without getting my feet dirty. (My boots were already dirty enough.) Luckily, my boots had handles on them which were \u003Cem\u003E supposed \u003C/em\u003E to be for pulling them on. Instead, I used the handles as grappling hooks of some kind. The right one started coming out, and wow that revolting suction sound as it came out. I then put it on and repeated this process with the left one. I put it on too. I then continued walking down the greenbelt. After I had walked about 100 feet (About 33.3 meters), someone else asked me what happened. I told him what happened. He wished me luck to not get stuck again. I then found a rock path down to the river. I thought to myself, \u003Cem\u003E That would\u0027ve been useful to know about earlier! \u003C/em\u003E. I walked down to the river, washed my boots off, and ate my lunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, post your muddy experiences/encounters as replies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T07:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really, but when I was 5, I fell into a muddy hole.

Due to a severe drought, Therthar lake had receded significantly, exposing the lake bed. We found tire tracks leading across it so we followed them out across the lake bed. What we didn\u0027t know, is that even though the surface appeared dry, underneath was mud the consistency of cheese. The lead MRAP broke through the top crust and sank up the top of its wheels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, its was the middle of summer, and it was about 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 out, and we were all in full combat kit furiously trying to dig out our truck. To makes things worse, while we were digging, one of our humvees sank through too. We were in the middle of nowhere, no support from friendly units, no cover from enemy attacks on the flat lake bed, most of us outside the protection of our armored vehicles digging. We would have been sitting ducks against an attack, but fortunately we were in such a remote location that I don\u0027t think the locals even knew where we were. So we called in for a recovery crew to come help us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, after many hours, we dug a ramp out behind the MRAP and used another MRAP to pull it out. But the humvee had sunk into mud that was more like yogurt. We couldn\u0027t dig it out because the mud kept filling back in. The recovery crew that was supposed to come help us was being slow as well. Took them hours just to put the convoy together, and they kept getting lost on the way (part of the problem was that our reported position was right in the middle of the lake on their map, they kept asking us if we were giving them the right coordinates, due to some miscommunication they thought we had sunk in water, and not through the dry lake bed). They didn\u0027t show up until around midnight (our first vehicle sank in before noon), by that time the sand flies were out in force. Swarms of tiny biting little buggers that apparently are not repelled by bug spray. I cannot remember a time in my life where I have felt so relieved as when that humvee was finally pulled from the mud and we got the hell out of there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, future patrols in that area went around the lake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T13:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC no ... in MUDs, yes, but not in mud\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T21:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESun, you do seem kind of obsessed with being stuck in mud.
