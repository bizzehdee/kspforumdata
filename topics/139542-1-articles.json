Parts which create a lot of drag implicitly have a lot of air hitting them, and therefore, suffer strongly from shock heating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Radiators can indeed help you manage heat. However, you should not usually need to cool heatshields. They have ablator that removes heat by burning off. Ablator isn\u0027t just a meaningless resource that\u0027s simulated to disappear to look nice, but KSP literally simulates the pyrolysis process of the ablator consuming heat energy to destroy itself. The higher the temperature of the heatshield, the faster ablator burns off, and therefore, the more heat load the heatshield can take. If you cool the heatshield with a radiator, it will not ablate as much. Which may be desirable if you want to aerobrake repeatedly, but if one round is all you need, then the radiators are useless dry mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Yes, only the exposed parts heat up. If your tail heats up, your tail is exposed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe part of the vessel which is pointing into the airstream creates a \u0027bow shock\u0027, which is kind of an umbrella that deflects the airstream to the sides, thereby shielding the stack above the nose. However, if your craft is very long, of if the rear sections grow wider than the front ones (or both), then the bow shock may not be large enough or close enough to shield the entire craft properly. Also note that if you are not pointing 100% prograde/retrograde, then your tail may simply swing out of the protected zone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) A radiator panel on the top, near the nose, might help, since it should be shielded by the craft for most of the reentry (if you place it into the correct spot).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that? Reentry profile makes or breaks your plane, literally. Don\u0027t spend too much time in the upper atmosphere, unless you plan to skip out again for a while, because the upper atmosphere has barely any drag but enough heat for it to accumulate. Drag increases much faster than heat buildup with air pressure, so you want to go as low as you can without exceeding the heat tolerance of your craft. If you stay high, there will be less heating, but the heat will soak into your craft over time as you wait for the near-nonexistant drag to do something, and you\u0027ll be glowing red hot before you even lost any appreciable amount of speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, take as much heat load off of your nose as possible. The nose is always the first to go, and once you get into the thicker atmosphere, the nose is naturally forced to point into the airstream (you know, as noses are designed to do). So to avoid having too much pre-soaked heat in your nose, and to spend too long in the upper atmosphere, you want to do the pancake maneuver. Orient yourself belly first into the airstream. Not just a little, but literally perpendicular, broad side of the barn, maximum profile. The Shuttle did the same! Hold that orientation as long as you can, until the airstream eventually forces you to flatten out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, you need to check your trajectory. If you continue to keep your nose up, this may lead to you gain altitude again. That\u0027s called a skip reentry,\u00A0 and can help you reduce the heat load by giving you some time to radiate away some of the heat your craft has accumulated as it flies a suborbital arc before descending again. However, if you\u0027re aiming to come down in a specific area, that may not be desirable. You\u0027ll be forced to put the nose level. But that makes it bear all of the heat, which is not good for its health, and this is also the plane\u0027s lowest drag profile, so you don\u0027t slow down properly. Instead, you should roll to the side and pitch up, like you\u0027re trying to fly a curve. This will put more of your belly into the airstream again, so you get more drag and less heat on the nose. After a while, roll the other way and pitch in that direction instead, effectively flying consecutive S-turns. The Shuttle did that, too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo return to the aerobraking question: that, too, boils down to essentially the same. You need to avoid putting all your head load on one \u0022nose\u0022 part, and you want to put a large surface into the airstream to create drag. The technical term for this is \u0022ballistic coefficient\u0022. A high ballistic coefficient means you have very little surface, and a lot of mass behind it. Such a thing will cut through air like an arrow and hardly slow down at all. A low ballistic coefficient means you have a large surface that doesn\u0027t weigh much, like a sheet of paper. It slows down very quickly. That\u0027s why you pancake your spaceplane belly-forward into the atmosphere. And that\u0027s also why your heavy interplanetary mothership fails to survive while trying to hide behind one small heat shield. The mothership either needs more area to brake with - or, it must shed some mass. Otherwise you won\u0027t be able to aerobrake with it effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncreasing area can mean something like mounting the new inflatable heatshield. It\u0027s only 2.5m while stowed, but when deployed, it clocks in at a massive 10 meters. That\u0027s almost the size of a hexagon built out of seven 3.75m heatshields, all in one conveniently stored and launched part! Mind you, this one does not have ablator, and while it is very heat tolerant, you can try supporting it with radiators for added safety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-11T18:10:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2016 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T21:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222575457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139542\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462987578\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162106\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BoPET\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, BoPET said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s an interesting problem\u00A0(and for some reason I haven\u0027t found a comprehensive answer to it yet -\u003Cs\u003Emaybe I just googled too bad but nevermind\u003C/s\u003E): since recent updates it seem that aerocapture became an extremly dangerous and almost impossible thing - especially if we are talking about gas giant aerobraking.
