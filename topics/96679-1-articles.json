Often the Visual Surveys, Temperature Scans, etc. take place in space already, and the Science from Space Around [X] seems redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the arguments I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve frequently read is how easy it is to abuse the Science from Space Around [X] contracts to get free funds with just a satellite and thermometer even if it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t actually give science. (Yes, I am guilty of this myself!) The Visual Surveys, Temperature Scans, etc. on the other hand have both science specific and location specific requirements. That is, you need to conduct orbital maneuvers to take the (specific) measurement in the correct location so eventually you have to send up a new satellite or more fuel. Granted, you still don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to actually have scientific gain from the measurement, but you can only collect one temperature scan from near space anyway, and these contracts often require at least 3 measurements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne factor in favor of Science from Space Around [X] is that it requires you to transmit the data, while the Visual Surveys, Temperature Scans, etc. do not. I actually saw a discussion on this topic previously on the forum recommending that a transmission requirement be added. The advantage of requiring transmission is that it requires the probe to have sufficient electricity (and potentially recharge between measurements). Another problem with the Visual Survey, Temperature Scan, etc. is that, for atmospheric bodies, I have only ever seen the measurement requirements within the atmosphere so that doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really count as science from space.

Right now, for temperature scans, near space is one biome and if you return the science you get the full value; it isn\u0027t incremental like goo and materials bay and the thermometer is reusable. Hmm...now that I reread that, it kind of makes sense - I can look at a thermometer 50 times no problem and would the temperature of near space change that much (if your altitude is constant)? Maybe that is why the contracts have a science reward. I know that is a very controversial topic in and of itself, but it does make up for the times when your measurement doesn\u0027t actually give science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really cool to have the contracts linked to something specific, but I don\u0027t know if that is possible since they are procedurally generated.
