For example; I set Jeb off on a mission to the moon and landed but accidentally jettisoned my engine so he is stuck - I was pleased to have an excuse for a rescue mission. I head back to the assembly and load up another rocket with an extra unmanned pod on but when I prepare for launch I see Jeb is the pilot for this one as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it seems like a tiny problem to most but I\u0027d just prefer it be another of the pilots. I\u0027ve also heard that when two duplicate kerbal\u0027s get close together one ends up being deleted and I don\u0027t want to get all the way back only for one Jeb to disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything I can do in the future to avoid having the same kerbal spawned twice in a row?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T22:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem...
