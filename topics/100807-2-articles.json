Everybody understands now! And because knowing Scott Manley is related to Captain Picard requires knowing who Captain Picard is and because that requires knowing what Star Trek is, Star Trek inspires countless millions to pursue a STEM carrier, boosting technological advancement by A LOT! After the first successful test of an Alcubierre-capable spaceship in 2063 (and an associated first-contact-event), everything else happens mostly according to the Star Trek backstory as well. Also, Scott Manley and his family are frozen cryogenically and woken up in the 24th century, when they serve aboard the USS Enterprise D under Captain Picard. Scott Manley and Captain Picard become good friends, a DNA test shows they are, in fact, related rather closely (taking into account the time difference).\n\nI wish for a cybernetically improved body."},{"CreatedByName":"Overfloater","CreatedById":94031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T13:39:05Z","Content":"Granted: u\u0027re like Terminator but with feelings and senses and all that stuff.\n\nI wish all flies and cockroaches were sent to Mars.
