I need to edit it in the modeling program but have been so busy.\n\u003E \n\u003E Aerodynamics have been tricky and has been the biggest issue here.\n\u003E \n\u003E It has been modified so much to correct it and I feel it is mostly ok.\n\u003E \n\u003E In order to get it right we can do 2 things.\n\u003E \n\u003E I can make a patch which modifies its aero. My best guess.\n\u003E \n\u003E this means downloading patches and getting feedback from users for a better new version. \n\u003E \n\u003E Or if you are willing you can adjust it to how you think it should be or what works better.\n\u003E \n\u003E thats if you are willing to edit the configuration text file.\n\u003E \n\u003E I usually dont have much time to actually play ksp unfortunately.\n\nThanks for the response. If others feel that the aerodynamics are fine, then I guess I need to learn to fly the thing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). If anyone out there has had success regularly landing the shuttle, I could use some suggestions on a good descent profile. I\u0027ve tried several approaches:\n\n1) From a 100km orbit, lower my periapsis to 45 km to be to the east of KSC. During descent, I maintained a pitch angle of 30 degrees to bleed off speed. Once I get near about Mach 4, I start pitching the nose down more towards the horizon to stop horizontal speed bleed off (usually near the mountains west of KSC) to hopefully glide in the rest of the way, but once I get about Mach 1.5-2, is when the shuttle rapidly loses horizontal speed and I start dropping out of the sky. Also, using TAC fuel balancer, I tried dumping my remaining monoprop to various amounts to see if that helped any, but I noticed no change in reentry.\n\n2) I found this video on Youtube:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTGVz5-xCWM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n (warning, audio is loud). Not conventional compared to the real thing, but it worked for that person so I figured I\u0027d try it. Well, since the reentry is steep, my shuttle just goes \\*poof\\* due to heating. Tried mimicking it exactly, but it doesn\u0027t work for me (person may be using lower heating setting). Edit: watching again, they are using an older version of CSS since their shuttle isn\u0027t one part.\nBy the way, my physics settings are all stock settings, except I lowered the conduction factor per Starwaster to alleviate random part overheating, so my aero should be working as expected. No DRE and no FAR installed.
