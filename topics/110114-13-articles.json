When I was SPL, I had some experience with a bunch of boys who didn\u0027t want to be there. It made their experience bad, and it brought the rest of the troop down, too.

I couldn\u0027t have done it as a Senior.\n\nAt the beginning, I didn\u0027t know what to do. I felt thrust into a position with little experience.\n\nBut I decided to pretend I knew what I was doing so everyone would trust me to do the job. And lo and behold, pretending to lead is a very good way to learn how to lead. I grew into the job, so at the end I felt confident in my abilities and I learned about what my limits are.\n\nA quick hint- you don\u0027t have to do everything yourself. Know when someone else can do it better, and trust them to do the job. And know your own limits."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-23T19:36:03Z","Content":"Have an update on my life:  \n\nBoth of my parents are currently unemployed, as am I.   \n\nBoth of my parents do not have a house or residence, and neither do I or my siblings.\n\nMy dad is again struggling with his Bipolar disorder.  \n\nI\u0027m trying desperately to catch up in my online college courses, which is hard cause we\u0027re staying with my grandma who has no internet, so I have to go to my Aunt\u0027s house to use her internet to do school on my desktop.

This is my first post since last year, as it\u0027s pretty much the first time I\u0027ve been here. I cannot say that I\u0027ll be on here again soon.  \n\nWith the sincerest of apologies, I bid you all farewell until the next time I\u0027m on here.
