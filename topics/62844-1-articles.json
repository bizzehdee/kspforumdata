Gotta remember that gravity on the Mun is a lot lower than on Kerbin and you don\u0027t have any atmosphere to keep you from flipping (with wings ofc). I\u0027d remove the middle wheels and make sure they all face straight down. Also, you might want to think about replacing them for TR-2L wheels instead which have more traction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUberGr","CreatedById":78026,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T00:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, indeed. The suspensions are barely flexing at all... I used these ones because on Kerbin they do so much better, plus they are faster than the small ones.

Not the very small ones, the other gray wheels, they are a similar size to these.

If you get going fast, you\u0027re going to have a bad time so don\u0027t worry too much about speed but good control is necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of things I figured out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut linear RCS ports on the rover pointing straight up. That way if things start getting squirrelly or you need more traction you can translate into the surface and give yourself down-force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS as the very bottom of the rover parallel to the ground also helps (if you catch a crazy jump it also gives you the ability to right the rover before landing). Be sure to turn SAS on and off when you change pitch and grade on the surface otherwise it is more of a hindrance than a help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about rover designs much like those RC cars that you can flip and drive any way, that there is no \u0022up\u0022 position on the rover, both ways are up. then put a bumper that if it lands on its side it will cause the rover to roll to one set of the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtect important things with girders. the ones that can take 80m/s of crash tolerance. Protect your wheels with those as you\u0027ll have no kerbals to service them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave, a lot... sometimes you\u0027ll be rolling down a hill get going a little too fast and your wheels will self-destruct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also a good idea to figure out what wheels are your steering wheels. Probably only your front wheels should steer on a 6 wheel design, maybe the front and rear. Center wheels helping steering make things very hard. It can make a world of difference. Same with braking. Center and rear wheels brake, maybe only rear.
