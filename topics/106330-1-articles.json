Is this :\n\n1) a bug and iwont be able to complete it ?\n\n2)normal, and i just have to orbit (first suborbital, then circularize) to get twice as much money ?\n\nI didnt accept it yet cause im not sure. Anyone knows ? \n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T17:56:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hcube**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrogdog","CreatedById":66879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:47:08Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t done it myself, but someone mentioned that you can do these missions in parts. For example, if you have two tourists who each want a sub-orbital, you can do them one at a time.\n\nSo, presumably, same thing here. Two flights to finish this one. I don\u0027t think you can do it at once because I\u0027m pretty sure that you need to recover to complete each phase as bringing them back alive is important."},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:48:10Z","Content":"I think you could do it at once.

When you are in suborbital flight that part will complete, then once you circularize that part will complete.\n\nIt\u0027s like this, you will notice later on it will start asking for multiple things like:\n\n- sub-orbital around Kerbin\n\n- fly-by of the Mun\n\n- orbit Minmus\n\n- sub-orbital Minmus\n\nThey can all be done in 1 flight if you so desire, but you can recover \u0026 relaunch if it\u0027s convenient for whatever reason.\n\nAlso the contract starts to give you multiple tourists (2, 4, 6) with their individual needs (although in my experience always the same bodies).\n\nSo some will want a combination of the following: a fly-by, an orbit \u0026 a sub-orbital flight. I\u0027ve yet to see a request for landing on another body, but I doubt there are none available."},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:31:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E bringing them back alive is important.\n\nUghh, they\u0027re so picky."},{"CreatedByName":"Poofer","CreatedById":110117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:33:37Z","Content":"you can indeed just orbit if it requries sub-orbital and orbital, since you\u0027ll do a suborbital before actually circularizing."}]}
