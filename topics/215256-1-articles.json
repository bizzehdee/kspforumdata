Not sure if this is new to this patch, or not, but here is the bug description:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the procedural wing editor is opened, you cannot select the wing part individually (for example, using the Select tool or the Translate / Rotate tool). \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/eybgcra\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScreenshots in an Imgur album here\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteps to reproduce:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Place a command pod and an attached fuselage / fuel tank. Then, place a wing part (this happens when using mirror symmetry or 1x symmetry, I have not tried it with other symmetry modes). Select either the Select tool or the Translate / Rotate tool. Notice that you can select the wing part and manipulate it individually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, open the procedural wing editor. Using the Select tool or the Translate / Rotate tool, notice that you cannot select the wing part individually. When trying to do so, you can only select its parent part(s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this is not a high priority, as it\u0027s easy to work around (just close the wing editor).
