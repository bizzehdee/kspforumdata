As far as I can tell it\u0027s supposed to be a sort of cross between a RAPIER and a NTR rocket. Oddly though it says air augmented it doesn\u0027t actually take ATM or AIR. I\u0027m also not sure why it has two modes as they are nearly identical. I tested a flight and never needed to change the mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming my mod hasn\u0027t changed it, RAPIER has 105kN and at mach 3.7 it has 465kN, 3200ISP in AirMode. It masses 2t and has Vac \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 305 requiring \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

So static thrust is just under 5x that of a RAPIER and is still 29% better than the RAPIER max while massing 0.79t less. In space it has 3x the thrust of the LV-N1, yet massed on 40% as much, oh and has 100 more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get it is supposed to be a more high tech engine so I can see some of this, but generally there is more give and take. Multimode engines will weigh a lot more and will usually have lower overall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E for instance. Or maybe just a worse \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is the tradeoff. I would say at the minimum the weight needs to go up a lot. It is supposed to be a nuclear style and given it\u0027s higher thrust vs the NERV, I think it should mass more than that. As far as the thrust, it seems odd to me it\u0027s highest thrust is static and that it doesn\u0027t require ATM/AIR. Though I suppose it does require fuel regardless.

I was looking at configs, can a multimodeengine have 3 options or is it limited to 2? If it can have 3 you could do what NF does and have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E option with lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E if Cryotanks is installed. If you can\u0027t have 3 options, you could consider just making it a optional patch either in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or maybe using patch manager. Personally I would think anyone that has Cryotanks installed would want to use the Liquid Methane option anyway. The fuel mass savings are very real...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may be outside the scope of what you want to do, but I really like the drop tanks and they could provide a possible solution for reasonable H2. If there could be a Cryofuel version that has a lower temp limit, but also a much lower dry mass. Something not able to do reentry but should be able to make it to orbit intact.\u00A0 Unfortunately the existing tanks are a bit small compared to some of the fuselages.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-04T18:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/41334-nori/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002241334\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/41334-nori/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nori\u003C/a\u003E Switching on the engines, yes.
