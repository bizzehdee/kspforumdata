After I downloaded 1.0.1, I went and built a shoddy, unstable plane with two turbojets attached. I throttled it up as fast as it would go, and once I got to a certain speed I lost control authority. The plane pulled nose up hard, lost a lot of speed, stalled, and then entered into an uncontrolled spin. \n\n![Jy9NAtN.gif](http://i.imgur.com/Jy9NAtN.gif)\n\nAt that point there wasn\u0027t enough airflow over the wings for my control surfaces to have any effect, and of course I crashed shortly thereafter. Now I\u0027m a huge flight sim fan, and for it to be possible to have what looks like a spin after a stall, in KSP, just got me all giddy inside. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
