Starting this new space program the decision was to only ever transmit one result from one type of experiment in one biome, or retrieve once.

Though It\u0027d probably be pretty easy to keep it as is and add at least 3 or 4 distinct Biomes for it. You\u0027ve got one or two poles, you\u0027ve got high lands and you\u0027ve got ice seas.
