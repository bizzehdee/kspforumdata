If you are unfamiliar with those terms, deltaV is a measure of how much maneuvering your rocket can do and TWR is the rocket\u0027s Thrust to Weight ratio. So those are the numbers you need to balance in weight, speed, and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not using any mods, get a pencil and paper out (or build a spreadsheet) because it\u0027s a lot of numbers to keep track of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo figure out how much deltaV your craft has, you need to know the fueled mass, empty mass, and ISP of the engines.

Then it\u0027s simply Thrust/Mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not opposed to mods, MechJeb (MJ) or Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER) will provide you deltaV, TWR, and a whole ton of other information. I have used both and prefer MechJeb (mostly for layout reasons), but for some reason some people have a huge personal problem with MechJeb. MJ includes an autopilot (if you want to use it), but both will provide the info you\u0027re asking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Worst at Video Games NA","CreatedById":112021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T13:41:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to figure out rocket efficiency, I always remind myself that each stage negatively impacts the stages below it. i.e. if you want your final stage to have several fuel cells and lots of mass, that means every subsequent stage that\u0027s responsible for lifting that monstrosity has to be that much more powerful, and by the time you reach the very first stage it\u0027ll take a tremendous amount of impulse to move your rocket even a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you keep that in mind, and make sure the stages on top are very light, allowing your stages below it to do most of the work, then your rocket should be much more efficient.

It is ratio of rocket\u0027s initial mass to the mass of payload it is able to carry to its destination. For travel from Kerbin surface to Kerbin orbit about the best reachable ratio is about 20%, meaning if you try very hard, you may deploy 1/5 of your initial rocket\u0027s mass in orbit. In most cases rockets are nowhere near that efficient and payload fraction 5-10% is common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means if you have 100 tons of payload, you\u0027ll need to launch about 1000 tons of rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith given set of engines, there\u0027s no way around that - you may get above 20% with the recent engines but I strongly doubt you can beat 25% limit. The only thing you can improve with bigger rockets is granularity of engine thrusts and fuel tank sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to be more efficient, you need to build spaceplanes or at least use jets for initial lifting as they have ridiculously high efficiency. They may increase your part count a lot, too, and spaceplanes have many of their own limits as well - they\u0027re not really suited to be scaled way up in current KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T14:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T14:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you should consider \u003Cstrong\u003Ehow\u003C/strong\u003E you are flying your rocket into orbit. If you fly to 10km pointing straight up, pitch over 45 degrees, then burn until your Ap is at the right spot, then you\u0027re wasting some fuel. There was an \u0022Efficient Orbit\u0022 challenge here somewhere (found it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39196-Launch-Efficiency-Exercise-Updated-for-0-21-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E), which you could mine for details. There are some MechJeb auto-ascent settings you could use in that thread, so you should be able to mimic some attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor stock KSP, you want an initial TWR (thrust-to-weight ratio) of around 1.5 - 2. Any more, and the air starts pushing back too much in the lower atmosphere and you waste fuel. Once you\u0027re above around 30km it doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s also more efficient to throtle back in the upper atmosphere as you travel to apoapsis. If you have a huge burn to make at Ap, then you\u0027ll waste some fuel during that burn as well. Ideally you want one long burn from launch to Ap that gets you in a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps, and good luck! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T23:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found the advice here useful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the vertical phase of your ascent, watch your speed against those \u0022checkpoint\u0022 values.
