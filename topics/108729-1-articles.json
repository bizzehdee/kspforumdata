You don\u0027t need a lot more extra dV to handle that (less than 50). But do spare yourself a total of about 5.5km/s vac dV to prepare for rescue maneuvers you would need on Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get inclined Mun orbit, you can use a maneuver-in-the-middle method:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst get LKO. Next, maneuver to Mun\u0027s SOI, with Pe close to the desired orbit. Then (crucial part) in the middle of the eclipse, fire normal or anti-normal to change the inclination - this should be really easy; by properly adjusting both the previous intercept maneuver and this middle maneuver, you should be able to get any orbit you want with little extra dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all these are better handled when you focus view on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another trick of doing rescue missions from orbit. Actually you don\u0027t need to match the orbit of your ship with the poor man\u0027s. I\u0027ve done many times to rescue LKO poor mans with a ship staying Ap~100km Pe~70km. The point is, as long as you can get close enough (which requires some dV adjustment) to take control, you can just use EVA jetpack to match your ship\u0027s orbit instead. Jetpack is much more powerful than it looks:D, and it saves your dV from your mothership a LOT. You can even just put a hitchhiker there and it effectively scans the whole circular orbit in a few periods and it\u0027s really effective batch rescuing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MissStabby","CreatedById":31168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Cybersol, After i discovered the \u0022curveball\u0022 i was thrown with this mission i reverted back to VAB to build a stronger rocket, though also i had to do some other non-ksp things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGonna try the approach tonight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@FancyMouse, note that the stuck kerbal is not stuck inside the moons SOI, though it will pass through it in a few orbits, i know about the jetpack trick and have used it in the past a lot, though the range you have to get to is relatively veeeery close when dealing with 10k km orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest challenge is the fact that both the orbit is inclined, the inclination point is nowhere near apoapsis/periapsis, the apoapsis and periapsis vary by about 2900 km and if its not done fast enough my kerbal guy gets to hang out with eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as a bonus, if i \u0022fail\u0022 the mission i have to take a huuuuuge rep and money penalty! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any ways to get more precise info on the orbit specs, ill post them so someone can see place a pod the same orbit in their game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith 3 orbits this ought to be possible if a little complicted to explain.

I never actually execute this burn as plotted (I do the normal rendezvous of reducing relative velocity whilst pushing the retrograde marker towards the away-from-target marker), but it lets me know what to expect in terms of delta-v and burn time. The good news is that matching inclination out here is much cheaper than doing it in LKO, especially when combining it with the prograde (and radial, as you\u0027re unlikely to meet at an apsis) component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing from a 100km by 100km orbit to 11.5Mm by 8.2Mm costs 1250m/s, not including any inclination change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should then be about 400m/s to drop your periapsis into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere... if low on fuel by then in your case, just reduce the apoapsis to get out of the way of the Mum - you can send up a second rescue craft to meet the first one! But I would have thought that if you can orbit the Mum and return, you\u0027d have enough fuel for this intercept and return, unless you\u0027re trying to match inclination in LKO. Your craft (guessing what you have based on the image) has about 3200m/s in the first stages (assuming the liquid engine is off until SRB jettison, which may be a bit hard to manoeuvre) and you have about 2800m/s in the upper stage. If it takes you 4000m/s to get.into orbit, the remaining 2000m/s should be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this without manoeuvre nodes would be a lot trickier.
