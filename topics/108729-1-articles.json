You don\u0027t need a lot more extra dV to handle that (less than 50). But do spare yourself a total of about 5.5km/s vac dV to prepare for rescue maneuvers you would need on Mun orbit.\n\nTo get inclined Mun orbit, you can use a maneuver-in-the-middle method:\n\nFirst get LKO. Next, maneuver to Mun\u0027s SOI, with Pe close to the desired orbit. Then (crucial part) in the middle of the eclipse, fire normal or anti-normal to change the inclination - this should be really easy; by properly adjusting both the previous intercept maneuver and this middle maneuver, you should be able to get any orbit you want with little extra dV.\n\nAnd all these are better handled when you focus view on Mun.\n\nThere\u0027s another trick of doing rescue missions from orbit. Actually you don\u0027t need to match the orbit of your ship with the poor man\u0027s. I\u0027ve done many times to rescue LKO poor mans with a ship staying Ap~100km Pe~70km. The point is, as long as you can get close enough (which requires some dV adjustment) to take control, you can just use EVA jetpack to match your ship\u0027s orbit instead. Jetpack is much more powerful than it looks:D, and it saves your dV from your mothership a LOT. You can even just put a hitchhiker there and it effectively scans the whole circular orbit in a few periods and it\u0027s really effective batch rescuing."},{"CreatedByName":"MissStabby","CreatedById":31168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:44:19Z","Content":"@Cybersol, After i discovered the \u0022curveball\u0022 i was thrown with this mission i reverted back to VAB to build a stronger rocket, though also i had to do some other non-ksp things ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nGonna try the approach tonight. \n\n@FancyMouse, note that the stuck kerbal is not stuck inside the moons SOI, though it will pass through it in a few orbits, i know about the jetpack trick and have used it in the past a lot, though the range you have to get to is relatively veeeery close when dealing with 10k km orbits.\n\nThe biggest challenge is the fact that both the orbit is inclined, the inclination point is nowhere near apoapsis/periapsis, the apoapsis and periapsis vary by about 2900 km and if its not done fast enough my kerbal guy gets to hang out with eve.\n\nAlso as a bonus, if i \u0022fail\u0022 the mission i have to take a huuuuuge rep and money penalty! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nIs there any ways to get more precise info on the orbit specs, ill post them so someone can see place a pod the same orbit in their game."},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:19:10Z","Content":"With 3 orbits this ought to be possible if a little complicted to explain.

You would need to reach him within one or two period.\n\nMy take for high orbit rescues are, fix inclination in low orbit (including at launch), then go Hoffman, but make Ap slightly inwards, while being slightly behind. Then when reach Ap, circularize, and then do adjustment from there. It took me some trial and error to get it right, but at least it worked for me in terms of precision, and the adjustment shouldn\u0027t result in more than half period to reach the rescue point.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T10:23:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse**"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:37:46Z","Content":"Can you set manoeuvre nodes?\n\nI have a similar rescue on going (it came as a bit of a shock to find a stranded Kerbal so far out), though further out than the Mum\u0027s orbit in my case - I don\u0027t think I have a collision to worry about. My steps:\n\nGet into LKO.\n\nTarget the stranded craft and find which ascending/descending node it\u0027ll pass through next.\n\nSet a manoeuvre on your orbit opposite that node and plot a burn out to it. You want the intercept marker to appear bang on the node and for the target craft not to have reached it at that point. If it has gone past, you\u0027ll have to aim for the other node.\n\nRight-click the node and advance the burn orbit by orbit until the nearest approach is closest to the intercept. Ideally they\u0027d meet, but this is unlikely.\n\nPlay with burn (e.g. add a bit of radial) to change the transit time so that the target craft catches up/is caught by you, until the intercept is within a few km.\n\nPlot a second burn at the intercept point and add a whole bunch of prograde, radial and normal until the orbit you\u0027ll go into matches the target pretty closely. I never actually execute this burn as plotted (I do the normal rendezvous of reducing relative velocity whilst pushing the retrograde marker towards the away-from-target marker), but it lets me know what to expect in terms of delta-v and burn time. The good news is that matching inclination out here is much cheaper than doing it in LKO, especially when combining it with the prograde (and radial, as you\u0027re unlikely to meet at an apsis) component.\n\nGoing from a 100km by 100km orbit to 11.5Mm by 8.2Mm costs 1250m/s, not including any inclination change.\n\nIt should then be about 400m/s to drop your periapsis into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere... if low on fuel by then in your case, just reduce the apoapsis to get out of the way of the Mum - you can send up a second rescue craft to meet the first one! But I would have thought that if you can orbit the Mum and return, you\u0027d have enough fuel for this intercept and return, unless you\u0027re trying to match inclination in LKO. Your craft (guessing what you have based on the image) has about 3200m/s in the first stages (assuming the liquid engine is off until SRB jettison, which may be a bit hard to manoeuvre) and you have about 2800m/s in the upper stage. If it takes you 4000m/s to get.into orbit, the remaining 2000m/s should be enough.\n\nDoing this without manoeuvre nodes would be a lot trickier. You can burn out to meet at a node visually, but I don\u0027t know how you\u0027d calculate when to do the burn so as to intercept the target."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:42:54Z","Content":"And one more suggestion - replace your pilot pod with a probe.
