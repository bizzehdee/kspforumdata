I think I was launching the game from the launcher by mistake which of course doesn\u0027t enable OpenGL mode.\n\n---------------\n\nEDIT: I fixed the problem! The game is set to run in 64 bit mode by default.\n\nI happened to run the launcher.exe and go into the advanced settings, and saw that the \u0022Run in 64 bit mode\u0022 option was enabled.

Worked perfectly fine in .90 and previous versions.\n\nNone of the above solutions worked for me.\n\nI finally deleted the Squad folder in the Registry (which alone didn\u0027t work) and then deleted the settings.ini. I also edited the new registry key to a lower resolution (1280x720) rather than 1920x1200. With the -popupwindow and -force-opengl options, it finally started in a smaller window. But when I went into the settings menu and changed the resolution back up to 1920x1200, it crashed with the same error again.\n\nStarted from scratch, this time bumping the resolution up 1 setting at a time, it let me go larger and larger until I hit 1768x992, where it crashed.\n\nI enabled fullscreen mode, and noticed my monitor was still running at 1920x1200, and just scaling the game to fit, which is interesting.\n\nI am running nVidia drivers v350.12.\n\nVery concerned, as just a few graphics mods usually pushes me over the RAM limit in DirectX mode, even with ATM.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T19:21:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Castun**"},{"CreatedByName":"leftler","CreatedById":100432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:01:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I also edited the new registry key to a lower resolution (1280x720) rather than 1920x1200.
