The first one is not. \n\nI don\u0027t have a problem with the control surfaces being inside the plane, but I do count them as wings. As such, that MASSIVE nest of clipped evelons on either side of the cockpit is completely unacceptable. I\u0027m willing to excuse the ones that are a little clipped into each other symmetrically, but only just. \n\nThis was a little obscure in the tournament post and clarified later, but if you have a gun on your plane which can rotate (The Vulcan turret and the .50cal turret), its \u0027Max Pitch\u0027, \u0027Min Pitch\u0027, and \u0027Yaw Range\u0027 all have to be set to zero. This isn\u0027t the case on either of the planes, and while I edited the both to comply with the rules, it seems like you weren\u0027t aware of or misunderstood this when designing them. So, to clarify. \n\n1. Control surfaces count as wings, and while I\u0027m okay with them being inside that the structural panels and even the ones that are a little clipped into each other from symmetry, the \u0027nest\u0027 of clipped evelons on either side of the cockpit is not acceptable and disqualifies the plane. \n\n2. These planes do not follow the naming scheme. I rectified this, but it is worth noting. \n\n3. Turrets have to be set to 0/0/0 for maximum pitch, minimum pitch, and yaw range. Also rectified, but somewhat breaks the planes. \n\n4. Please state what weapons the points went into. I counted it up on the second plane and it was fine, but didn\u0027t bother on the first since it\u0027s not acceptable in its current form. Simply writing out what weapons/countermeasures you\u0027ve spent your points on saves me a massive amount of time, and while it\u0027s not something I can disqualify you over, I would very much appreciate it if you did this in the future. \n\n5. Also nothing to do with disqualification, but you should know the structural panels won\u0027t really provide much defense for those evelons since BDArmory weapons deal damage through heating rather than impact. Radiators and heat shields would, though. \n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Would this be acceptable, this chine to wing joint? \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/KLJxwlTl.png](http://i.imgur.com/KLJxwlTl.png)\n\nI don\u0027t see anything wrong with this, but I don\u0027t see what you think would be wrong with this either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-06T03:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CreativeCombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr_Hubris","CreatedById":149789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T03:24:17Z","Content":"noted...\n\ndo what you wish with me entry (change the planes fly em as is use two of the acceptable ones)\n\nill get it next time ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nand ill format my future posts accordingly as well, my apologies for my sloppy posts I\u0027ll work on it as best as I can\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-06T03:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr\\_Hubris**"},{"CreatedByName":"CreativeCombat","CreatedById":112338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T03:51:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E noted...\n\u003E do what you wish with me entry (change the planes fly em as is use two of the acceptable ones)\n\u003E \n\u003E ill get it next time ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E and ill format my future posts accordingly as well, my apologies for my sloppy posts I\u0027ll work on it as best as I can\n\nYou can edit the planes to be in compliance and resubmit them, or create an entirely new pair of planes.
