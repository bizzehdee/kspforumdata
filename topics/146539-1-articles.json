It can be hard to correlate it with the contract because there is no indication what the waypoint is for, other than the name. So you have to remember the name between Mission Control and the Tracking Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA nice QOL improvement would be to show a globe of Kerbin in Mission Control, showing the waypoint.
