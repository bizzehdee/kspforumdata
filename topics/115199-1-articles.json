Cool enough. But, this setup alters the COT of the whole rocket without any apparent reason. If i remove the said sepratrons, everything comes back to normal.\n\nI acutally use moded CM and sep\u0027s, but the issue does not seem to come from the community coding, as you can see :\n\n![oCHX0Ij.png](http://i.imgur.com/oCHX0Ij.png)\n\nWhatever is put underneath doesn\u0027t change anything.\n\nI tried several setups; short rockets, tall, lined, clustered, fairings. It seems I can\u0027t manage to straight it up.

No fuel = no thrust, and no thrust = no impact on CoT display.\n\nIf it\u0027s actually producing weird thrust like that, then it sounds like something\u0027s broken symmetry-wise. Check they\u0027re actually placing, and there\u0027s nothing weird going on with either that fuel load or thrust limiting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T14:01:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mic\\_n**"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T14:01:47Z","Content":"Older versions had slight rotation/angle errors on pointed modules/tanks/parts, such as the command pods.

But, more important, you were right; putting sep\u0027s anywhere else than on the CM solves the problem (I was stuck on my retro-landing thing). It is definitely a bug.\n\nThank you guys."}]}
