I can see you followed a tutorial that suggested you use Cube unwrap, which is great if it s symmetrical evenly shaped object, but in the case of a bent pipe, no. Use a different projection method, there is several to choose from, I will use 5 types on one model, it depends on what it requires.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ahappydude","CreatedById":458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T04:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking about gimp haha but im more familiar with ps.

All I do in Unity is tell it what type of texture I want to to be, spec, bumped etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I love 3DsMax and Lightwave, but blender is free and runs on practically any PC I put it on and doesnt require me to sell my soul to use it.
