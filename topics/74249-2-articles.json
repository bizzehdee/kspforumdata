(Though, MJ has a vessel cost calculator, which would GREATLY simplify things on the budget system.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERO would be nice, to a point, though I think I like the standardised sizes of stock more than IRL randomness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 massively expands what you can do, as does KW, though less so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP-Fairings is also good, but I can do with Cargo Bays and KW if needed too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for weapon systems, Lazor is alright, and PoleCatEZ\u0027s D12 B9 expansion supports it nicely, using FS model changing code, but ID\u0027s Skillfull is superior to the Lazor guided missile system. Speaking of D12, why isn\u0027t it an option? It is practically made for this. Skillfull also gives an IFF marker, which makes AutoTurrets work well for defending Key areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFS is not entirely necessary, as the plugin is included with other packs (And that\u0027s the only really good and valuable part for this.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP-Dynamics confuses me sometimes. While being very cool and useful, the CoL marker is more than a bit buggy in my experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDammnedR? Never really used it to any great gain, but I\u0027ve got some neat ideas for it in the future, so a bit more of a maybe on that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinion on the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this the right spot for this? It\u0027s not exactly a challenge, is it? More of a RP/Warfare game if you ask me. That said, I am deeply interested, and it would provide me a good starting point to get back into RSS, while giving an experienced player something more interesting to do. Whoever\u0027s team I join, I want to do some SpySat launching, and I have a sneaksy and generally D***ish way of deploying them. I think that Skillfull should be mandatory, as well as an IFF tag on every ship core, along with including Tem affiliation in the name of the ship, and player tag. This isn\u0027t real warfare, its a game, and I don\u0027t like the idea of another player taking advantage of my stuff because I thought he was friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FanaticalFighter","CreatedById":77314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T14:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Deathsoul said, RealFuels, PP and FAR are pretty much required for RSS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we need some better mechanics, though. Most of the gameplay I see right now coming out of this is land based, and KSP is best played in SPAAACE! Here are some ideas we can use to make the orbital gameplay better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERECON SATTELITES:\u003C/strong\u003E Maybe we can make it so that you can only attack a base over which you have sattelite visibility or something, and to attack said base, your sattelite needs to have been around the target for 12 hours. This\u0027ll make for interesting integration of space combat as recon, as well as a platform for reaching the enemy, and also allow for more interesting strategic gameplay. e.g. a side could focus on deploying geostationary defenders above its critical bases that\u0027ll stop the enemy from targeting their base through geostationary orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETURN BASED SPACE COMBAT\u003C/strong\u003E: Because KSP is an international community, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be able to have interesting space combat unless we follow a turn based system. Any team could, say, declare a certain region of space, say a particular orbit near a space station, as a combat zone, and then proceed to attack said space station. The team has to have declared combat zone before they match orbits with the target, because otherwise, its kind of unfair to the defenders. Then the defenders should get their turn and until their turn is finished, the attackers shouldn\u0027t be able to do anything other than drift along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on another note, I think we should also use separate private threads (there are many websites that allow you to host private threads) where the teams can discuss missions. Instead of allocating resources in something like an actual meeting, which I know from experience is impossible to organize in an international community, the teams (with perhaps a team leader to organize things) can discuss things there. Perhaps individual members could submit proposals as to what they want, and this would help the teams to allocate resources to each team member. Say a member proposes a long term spy satellite to monitor enemy launches, while another proposes an experimental missile system, while someone else proposes a ground based defence system. The team leader could prioritize the development and building of crafts as he/she sees fit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WH40krules","CreatedById":79752,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T17:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the teams could communicate on skype?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
