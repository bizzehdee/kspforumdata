I\u0027d visit the Mun first - changing inclination to match Minmus will require a lot of thrust, but changing inclination to meet the Mun from a Minmus launch will be harder still. Best you get rid of the weight of your Mun ascent stage/fuel first. (Unless of course, you\u0027re going to be fueling up when you get to the Mun by Kethane mining or something, but I\u0027d still go with Mun first.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be worried about that TWR when it came to landing on the Mun, though. The Mun is surprisingly unforgiving of a low TWR. More than one of my (thankfully un-Kerbbed,) Mun landings have ended in \u003Cem\u003Ehilarity\u003C/em\u003E when I found my craft had enough dV and TWR to kill horizontal speed, but not enough (of one, either, or both,) to kill vertical speed. If you watch Scott Manley, he tends to use a rig with about \u003Cem\u003Efive\u003C/em\u003E Rockomax 48-7S engines, four radially mounted around the fifth. That set-up will give you a thrust of 150 for the weight of half a ton, which is \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E better than even a KW Rocketry Vesta. (If you\u0027re going with a radial engine setup like that, just remember to make sure the fuel stacks all have equal amounts of fuel, otherwise you\u0027re liable to find your outboards or your inline motor flaming out suddenly. It\u0027s not a disaster if that\u0027s how you planned it, but if you didn\u0027t, it will be. Don\u0027t count on fuel lines, they\u0027ll vamp the inline engine\u0027s fuel to keep the outboards going.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, though... I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re doing that, other than to say you did. I\u0027d just send two missions, one to each of the Mun and Minmus simultaneously. Easier requirements, you can bring back Science! from both without lugging dead weight down to a surface and back both ways coming and going, etcetera. If you\u0027re just looking to plant a different flags on two bodies in one mission for bragging rights, though, you\u0027ll want to at least have a two-kerb lander, since I think Kerbs get one flag per mission. (Or you can transfer between lander and mothership I suppose.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, though, I\u0027m not sure which will cost less dV, and it probably depends largely on the alignment of both the Mun and Minmus.

I\u0027d orbit the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and then land with a lander that would take off and transfer to Minmus. The Minmus lander would be much smaller than than M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar lander, and would land and the whole thing would head back to Kerbin.\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I would get the \u0022heavy lifting\u0022 out of the way first. I feel like the loss of dV due to carrying all the mass of a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar lander out to Minmus and then \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to land would be greater than the loss of dV doing an inclination change from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to Minmus (which can totally negated by doing the transfer at a asc/desc node, btw).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using an Apollo-style LCS (Lunar-Command-Service Module) variant, though, Minmus first \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E be more efficient. I think it would rely heavily on craft design, which would, in turn, rely heavily on personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would seem that way, but the gravity of Minmus is so low that carrying that extra Mun weight to Minmus balances out the burden of carrying the Minmus weight to the Mun. Also, the transfer windows seemed a lot easier to manage leaving Minmus since you have to mess with inclination much less during transfer to the Mun. This way you don\u0027t have to sit around and wait for the orbit ascending/descending nodes. (I did my flight from Minmus-\u0026gt;Mun when Minmus was at it\u0027s lowest point of inclination in orbit.) Once you are in the Mun SOI, inclination changes (due to Minmus transfer) to return to Kerbin are pretty much not required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T22:51:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorThomas","CreatedById":94499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T22:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, I think Minmus first is just the easiest way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Smidge says, it\u0027s easy to encounter the Mun on your way back from Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo those who think it\u0027s easier to go from Mun to Minmus...have you ever tried going from Mun orbit up to Minmus? It\u0027s not easy. Playing with the maneuver node, you\u0027ll see you can\u0027t easily fly \u0022up\u0022 from the Mun to Minmus. What I saw available was to go to Minmus from the Mun when it was on the \u003Cem\u003Eopposite\u003C/em\u003E side of Kerbin. However, if you start at Minmus and head back to Kerbin, on your way home, you could stop off at the Mun easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I would not bother to make orbital inclination changes while in Kerbin orbit before going to Minmus. Just a waste of fuel. Instead do a Hohmann transfer to Minmus altitude. When most of the way there, you\u0027ll find your velocity drop to something suitably minuscule, like 100 or even 50 m/s. Then do a very low Delta V burn to adjust your path so that it intersects Minmus, simples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T00:04:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MajorThomas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecomments on inclinations\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
