Your truck is in clear violation of height restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- your cab floor (and therefore your cab) is below the wheel line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your truck overall is too low - it must reach a height of minimum 1 Long I-Beam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- please note that you are using an odd resolution which makes the screenshot seem squashed so I cannot tell the actual height of your vehicle. However, it looks smaller than the cargo on top of the trailer is, which is an indication that something isn\u0027t tall enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Trailers are NOT part of the race - they are only required to demonstrate that your vehicle IS in fact a useable cargo transporter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your trailer may be a flatbed trailer if you prefer, however you DO need fixed railings on it to secure the load - use I-BEAMS or panels, that\u0027s up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No Powered wheels on the trailer for obvious reasons. We are measuring performance of the truck not the trailer after all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rear spoiler is to be mounted on a structure extending from the tail section of your truck. The thing you attach your back wing to must NOT be part of the \u0027\u0027load-bearing\u0027\u0027 Chassis or overall structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou said that your truck wheelies when you unlock the Klaw. It does sound like you need a 4 wheeled trailer, with a set of wheels at the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you need to change the structure of your truck so that the trailer and it\u0027s weight is spread OVER the back wheels, as opposed to BEHIND them. I will have to put that to the test myself to be honest but at least in theory it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like you are were going for a Class-6 truck - in which case a full 44.444 ton load will be a little bit much for your vehicle. Trucks overall have the CoG offset towards the front of the vehicle. This is perfectly natural - \u003Cstrong\u003Emy truck during braking stands on the front wheels only due to KSP physics.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Koolkei\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 6 of your truck wheels can (and I suspect due to competition between races, SHOULD) be powered. However, your trailer wheels should not be powered at all. Some might argue this is irrelevant since you are not racing with the trailer anyway - but in principle, you are not allowed powered wheels outside of your truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the RCS placement, I meant the back of the truck itself, as in the overall structure or what is recognized as the \u0027\u0027tail\u0027\u0027 section.

It will slow down your reactions on ALL controls - including rover controls. Alternatively, check if you can drop the CoG without altering the exterior of your truck.
