As expected it was flying close to perfect, had no issues beside the mysterious wobbling effect if you steer (not sure if that is intended either). The next thing I did was to replace just the jet engines with rocket engines, and suddenly the otherwise perfectly balanced plane rotates like crazy instead of actually flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried basically everything to get it stable: more wings, stabilizers, different engines, different thrust settings, but whatever I do: with jet engines the plane flies perfectly, with any kind of rocket engine it rotates and crashes like crazy, and I can\u0027t figure out why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone please enlighten me on this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E Answer from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/12867-Red-Iron-Crown\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERed Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

With an airbreathing engine liquid fuel is drawn from all tanks in the stage evenly, minimizing the change in location of CoM and maintaining CoM/CoL relationship. With a rocket engine, the tanks are drained front-to-back in a single stack, causing the CoM to move rearward as forward tanks drain.
