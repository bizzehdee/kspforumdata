The cached config loaded by the game has changed, but something doesn\u0027t seam to be respecting that change.\n\u003E \n\nThe entire PARTUPGRADE system is stock code, and a stock system.  I don\u0027t do anything with it aside from what you see in the configs (e.g. there is nothing in my plugins that is messing with things).\n\nI\u0027ll see about testing some of this when I get a free moment at my home computer.  Your patches looked like they should have been working (mostly, at least the recent ones posted); and if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E cache looks correct, it would point towards the error being somewhere in the stock code.\n\nHowever that doesn\u0027t really make too much sense, as the stock code is merely loading from those config nodes, which have already been adjusted by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E by the time the stock code sees the data.  Unless for some reason the stock code is skipping the ModuleManager altered configs and loading the files directly from disk.  Which is why I had suggested asking in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E thread -- if there is a conflict with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E and stock code, they will be the ones who would know about it.\n\nOne other suggestion would be to clear out the ModuleManager cache files (physics, tech-tree, configs);  who knows, maybe its patching the configs correctly, but loading an old unaltered tech-tree file.\n\nOne more, probably final, attempt at bracing geometry/animations for the inflatable-torus-centrifuge parts.  Two bracing/reinforcement variants; wide, or skinny.  I really like the look of the \u0027wide\u0027 one when deployed, but sadly there is no good way to animate it; it will always distort when retracted, which makes the bracing look bad.  The skinny variant I think looks acceptable; it keeps the same width in both stowed and deployed states, and has minimal distortion during the animation; it also keeps the bracing setup simple and workable.\n\n![F6eYaZk.gif](http://i.imgur.com/F6eYaZk.gif)\n\nLooks like keeping things simple is the only way these will work out (for me anyway).  Someone with more time (and patience, and who actually likes doing modeling) could come up with something better; but I\u0027ve already spent far more time than I had set aside for figuring out the animations (spent the last 2 1/2 days working on it, with close to zero progress, which is about the extent of my patience).\n\nGoing to work on unwrapping the rest of the larger torus, and begin working on the central pillar geometry, crew tube, and truss geometries."},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T17:37:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The entire PARTUPGRADE system is stock code, and a stock system.

Even with the skinny geometry I have to bash things around a bit at the mesh level to keep things from clipping or showing back-faces.\n\nWorking on how to best do the windows.  Or even ***-if-*** to do windows.  Seems like I have two choices there: windows that get distorted with the mesh scaling, or using a method similar to the HAB parts and keeping the window mesh the same size while manipulating the surrounding geometry / beveling.  So, here are a couple different window concepts.  Top of image = HAB styled window.  Left = very large window panel (distorted in animation), right = circular window (distorted in animation)(e.g. similar to DOS), bottom = smaller window panel (distorted in animation).\n\nI\u0027m leaning towards either the top or bottom options, probably more towards the bottom.  Yes the bottom one gets distorted in the stowed state, but I think it looks the best while deployed.  The top option offers the least distortion during animation, but looks kind of bad in both the stowed and deployed states.\n\n![U9WMWeh.gif](http://i.imgur.com/U9WMWeh.gif)\n\nSo I guess the question for today comes down to -- windows, or no windows?   \n\nIf they are included I\u0027ll likely go with the option on the bottom (smaller inset panel, scaled with the rest of the mesh).  It is simpler to model and looks fairly nice when in the deployed state.  For this smallest torus I would likely include one or two per quarter (so 4-8 total on each side).  Larger torus would have more windows, keeping about the same spacing between them as on the small torus.\n\nI\u0027m also okay with not having windows.  It goes against the \u0027deluxe habitation\u0027 concept a bit, is much simper to model, animate, and texture, but makes for a bit of a \u0027plain\u0027 looking part."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T19:40:56Z","Content":"Windows.

Will look much better after I get some more detailed texturing on it (proper normals) and finish up the central pillar geometry. \n\nPillar is currently 1.25m at the top/botom, tapering down to ~0.8m in the middle, with the crew tube being ~0.7m in diameter (should be big enough for a non-helmeted kerbal to fit through).  Really not sure of how much more it could be improved given the limitations imposed by the animation.\n\nStill a bit torn on the windows.  As was pointed out, having windows in a rotating habitat is just asking for some dizzy astronauts (is that a thing?).  Would make more sense with the slower rotation speed on larger parts.  But I also think they add a nice bit of detailing to an otherwise simple model.  Eight might be too many though (rather 16, as they are on the back side as well); may cut it down to half of that number for this particular part.\n\nContemplating counterweights for the rotation; certainly doable, and a nice bit of easy to add detail.\n\nMost of the style/concepts/methods can easily be applied to the larger torus parts, and I\u0027ll likely start doing the rough geometry work on them for the bracing/etc.  The largest ones are going to be a bit more detailed / have more bracing on them, probably with alternating windowed / non-windowed segments."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T22:32:12Z","Content":"Wow!!!"}]}
