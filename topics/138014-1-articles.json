Now I\u0027m dealing with real aero issues, and this one is baffling me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to launch a rocket, and these are the two iterations of it (in reverse order of development, compared to how the album is ordered):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qbZr2/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know CoL is generally supposed to be behind CoM, but hey, I\u0027m trying out \u0027realistic\u0027 designs, so no fins. I feel like logically, it should still work, but MJ\u0027s autopilot always ends up losing control somewhere between 3km and 7km, depending on the settings. I\u0027ve tried changing AoA, toggling Corrective Steering, modifying the Ascent Path (currently I\u0027ve got it set to begin gravity turn at 0.8km and 75m/s, ranging from 50-80% shape in my tests)... and I still can\u0027t get this thing to space. Either aero forces drag it way down or drag it back up, which then ends in the rocket spinning out of control and breaking up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelp. MJ autopilot makes this game playable for me, because I\u0027ve been through enough manual launches that I\u0027m not really in the mood to even supervise the launch stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-24T20:13:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2016 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Box of Stardust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T23:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222536963\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138014\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461528312\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112527\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Box of Stardust\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Box of Stardust said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know CoL is generally supposed to be behind CoM, but hey, I\u0027m trying out \u0027realistic\u0027 designs, so no fins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn that case you really have to watch out for your weight distribution and might want to use one short but heavy 2.5m upper stage instead of two long and light 1.25m ones. And you have to remember that even if you use a more sophisticated aerodynamic model, the fuel flow rules are still extremely basic and stacking multiple small tanks will always result in a CoM that will drop during the first phase of the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T02:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s gonna be hard.

Real rockets have more sophisticated control systems than MJ, so trying to make totally realistic rockets doesn\u0027t make all that sense, especially with Kerbin\u0027s small size.

It\u0027s just that in the modern day, with highly sophisticated computer avionics and quick-gimbaling engines, you can get away with very statically unstable craft. Also note that in real life engines gimbal much, much more than in KSP, and the rockets have a much smaller fairing in relation to their total size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
