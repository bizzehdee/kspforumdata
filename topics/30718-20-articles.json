Fortunately, the cluster of pinholes around each corner of the poster section weren\u0027t visible from a distance, although the corners were starting to look a little worn. The fluorescent tubes high above him cast pools of light and oddly angled shadows across the vehicle assembly building; lending a stark immediacy to the finished mural.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb walked around the half assembled \u003Cem\u003EEve\u003C/em\u003E capsule to get a better view. Behind him, Geneney emerged from his office, carrying an armful of fabric. He stopped, letting the moment linger. \u003Cem\u003EJeb, a half built spacecraft and an outlandish plan in front of them both. If Bill was here now, he could capture the entire Kerbin Interplanetary Society in one photograph.\u003C/em\u003E Quietly, he joined Jeb by the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt doesn\u0027t seem real does it, Genie?\u0022 said Jeb softly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney squeezed his friend\u0027s shoulder. \u201CHard to believe,\u0022 he agreed. \u201CDid you manage to get the nameplate finished?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s right under that dust sheet,\u0022 Jeb said, \u201CNot as neat as Bill\u0027s work, but I think it\u0027ll do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney lifted up a corner of the sheet and peered underneath. A small, polished copper plaque twinkled at him; secured to the spacecraft hull by four gleaming, round headed rivets. The letters \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E were engraved on one corner, alongside the familiar tilted rocket logo but the rest of the foil was taken up by one word and a single digit. Geneney brushed his fingers gently over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think it\u0027ll do very well, Jeb,\u0022 he said quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stifled a yawn. \u201CDoubt anyone will be looking at it too closely anyway,\u0022 he said. \u201CC\u0027mon, Genie, let\u0027s get those screens hung up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mill shut down with a heavy clunk and a rapidly fading whirr of high speed cutting tools coming to rest. Pneumatic actuators hissed, snapping the tool-changer out and back, and swapping the cutter for a slender steel wand, tipped with a polished ceramic ball. Wernher watched the touch probe begin its pre-programmed dance over the newly machined injector, flitting over the gleaming alloy, darting towards it, backing off, then approaching more cautiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSatisfied that the measurement program was working, he removed his goggles, hung his protective gear on its peg, and jogged over to the vehicle assembly building in search of breakfast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Wernher emerged from the canteen, clutching an egg-and-greenleaf wrap, a crowd of kerbals had gathered around the ropes surrounding the \u003Cem\u003EEve\u003C/em\u003E capsule. Wernher blinked, \u003Cem\u003ESince when did we starting roping off parts of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u003C/em\u003E He took a bite of his wrap and went over to investigate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAny idea what this is about, Wernher?\u0022 asked Ribory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shrugged. \u201CNo idea,\u0022 he said, \u201CJeb mentioned something about an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E test last night though - maybe there was a leak?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory sniffed. \u201CDoesn\u0027t smell like it,\u0022 she said. She pointed at the drapes hanging from the wall. \u201CMonoprop would have made a right mess of those too. Besides, nobody told the capsule team about any testing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks like it\u0027s been mothballed,\u0022 said Ordrie gloomily, \u201CReckon we finally ran out of money.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob shook his head. \u201CGeneney\u0027s been pretty chipper lately,\u0022 he said. \u201CAnd trust me - it\u0027s just not Jeb\u0027s style to mothball a perfectly good capsule whilst there\u0027s even half a rocket to launch it with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd we\u0027ve got a lot more than that,\u0022 said Wernher, \u201CLast of the T-thirty injectors is on its inspection cycle, Bob.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe babble of anxious speculation died away before Wernher\u0027s matter of fact tone, leaving a lot of very puzzled kerbals staring at the shrouded capsule and muttering amongst themselves. Wernher left them to it and went over to inspect the hanging drapes more closely. \u003Cem\u003EHmm, why bother stapling them in place? \u003C/em\u003E He hooked a finger under the edge of the sheet and prised it carefully away from the wall. \u003Cem\u003EHang on - there\u0027s something underneath these. Looks like a poster...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s pulse began to race. \u003Cem\u003EI think you\u0027ve got a little announcement to make haven\u0027t you, Jeb? And I doubt you\u0027d go to all this trouble if it was bad news. Which means...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u0027t suppose you left me any greenleaf, Wernher?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStartled, Wernher jumped back, nearly bumping into his grinning friend. \u201CUhh, plenty in the fridge, Jeb.\u0022 He gestured at the crowd gathered around the shrouded capsule. \u201CI\u0027d get it before someone sees you though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what do you think, Wernher?\u0022 Ribory turned her head and realised that she\u0027d been talking to herself for the last two minutes. \u201CWernh... JEB!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone\u0027s head snapped round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey boss!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat happened, boss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u0027s with the sheets over everything?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb raised his hands to fend off the jostling throng of kerbals. \u201CWoah, woaaah - everyone take it easy. There\u0027s been a little change of plan that\u0027s all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat plan, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean - change of plan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre we mothballing the ship, boss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gestured for silence. \u201CI\u0027ll tell you all about it in a minute folks, once the rest of the team are here.\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clock ticked over to 8:30, just as Edsen pushed open the door to the vehicle assembly building. He was promptly greeted by a clamour of voices from the entire Kerbin Interplanetary Society, all gathered round a fabric draped shape. He hurried over to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey guys - what happened to the capsule?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s right there, Edsen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u0027s it doing under those covers?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb cleared his throat. \u201CI was just getting to that, Edsen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared solemnly at everyone. \u201CAs I was saying, there\u0027s been a little change of plan. We\u0027re still going to launch Eve 2 but after that, Project Eve is cancelled.\u0022 He hooked a thumb over his shoulder. \u201CEve 3 isn\u0027t going to fly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a stunned silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou might have told us earlier, Jeb,\u0022 said Ornie quietly, \u201CPropulsion team have been workin\u0027 round the clock on that booster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s right,\u0022 said Ordrie, \u201CWernher\u0027s been up since dawn, working on the last engine! Waste of effort that was.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone looked at Wernher, who was leaning casually against a wall and not looking at all perturbed by Jeb\u0027s bombshell. \u201COn the contrary, Ordrie, I don\u0027t think it was wasted at all. Right, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned at the bewildered faces staring back at him. \u201CThere\u0027s no fooling you, Wernher. You got my scissors, Genie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight here, Jeb,\u0022 replied Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Jeb and stepped up to the wall drapes. \u201CGive a kerbal a hand here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney reached up with his own scissors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProject Eve is no more,\u0022 Jeb said. \u201CBut now good kerbals, we give you...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo pairs of blades snipped shut and the dust sheets plummeted to the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022....the Pioneer Program!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen gaped at the mural spread out behind the shrouded capsule. On one side, the familiar cloud streaked sphere of Kerbin glowed amidst the star speckled blackness of space. On the other side, the cratered, plaster-grey Mun provided a stark contrast. White lines, arrows and a whole flotilla of different spacecraft decorated the space between and around the two orbs. \u003Cem\u003ELooks like a flight plan but where...\u003C/em\u003E His heart leapt. One of the spacecraft had been drawn right on the edge of the largest Munar crater. And, right beside it, somebody had drawn two kerbonauts and a flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey went for it. Great Kerm, they went for it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie blushed as everyone turned to stare at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That they did, Ornie,\u0022 laughed Jeb, \u0022That they did!\u0022 He whisked the dust covers off the capsule, revealing the gleaming plaque underneath. \u201CEve 3 isn\u0027t going to fly, my friends - but Pioneer 1 \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022 He raised his hands. \u0022And I can see that everyone is busting with questions, so before we get to those, how about I run you all through the flight plan first?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA buzz of excited assent ran through the crowd. Jeb picked up a spare piece of antenna from the workbench next to him and waved it at the mural.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OK, the basic plan isn\u0027t much more complicated than the ones we used for the Muna 2 and Muna 3 flights. From low Kerbin orbit we do a trans-Munar injection burn, coast, and then do an insertion burn into Munar orbit. Powered descent to the surface.\u0022 Jeb\u0027s eyes gleamed. \u201CThen we launch from the Munar surface, rendezvous, and prep for trans-Kerbin injection. Aerobraking re-entry and parachutes to splashdown as usual.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie whistled, \u201CThat\u0027s a lot of flying, Jeb. Gonna take one helluva booster to lift all that fuel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded. \u0022Yep. Genie and I went through the numbers with the folks at Rockomax, and doing the round trip with a single ship needs a much bigger rocket than either of us can put together any time soon. Likewise for a couple of the other flight plans we thought up. So eventually we came up with this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb jabbed his piece of antenna at the image of Kerbin. \u0022It\u0027s a bit easier to go through the flight in reverse. We use an Eve... sorry, a \u003Cem\u003EPioneer\u003C/em\u003E capsule for re-entry and splashdown. The service module provides the juice for trans-Kerbin injection.\u0022 The antenna traced a path back to the Mun. \u0022The lander is a separate craft. It goes out to the Mun docked to the front of the capsule. We undock, fly it down to the surface and back, re-dock, and then jettison it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pointed at a larger spacecraft in the middle of the mural. \u0022The capsule, service module, and lander are boosted towards the Mun by a disposable Kerbin departure stage. That stage is jettisoned during the coast phase and we use the service module engine for Munar orbit insertion.\u0022 Jeb tapped the mural. \u0022Ademone reckons that Rockomax have the heavy lift capacity to get the lander and Kerbin departure stage to orbit from Foxham. We launch the Pioneer capsule and service module from Barkton on the usual booster, and put everything together on orbit. We\u0027ll be launching to an inclined orbit of course; Rockomax can\u0027t launch directly to an equatorial orbit and they\u0027ll be pushing their systems just to \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E to orbit; changing planes isn\u0027t an option.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb put his antenna down and looked expectantly at the crowd of kerbals. He wasn\u0027t disappointed; the questions came thick and fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fraid not, Camrie. Launching everything on a single booster would make things easier for sure, but it would take a crazy amount of engine clustering to pull off, even with Skipper engines.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, the telemetry and control linkages between the spacecraft and the departure stage are going to be tricky. I figured you might have some ideas there, Bill?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The guidance systems were accurate enough for the Muna 2 and Muna 3 trajectories, Neling. We should be OK.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We think so, Lucan. We worked the numbers twice and the service module should have enough delta-V for both manoeuvres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Almost like somebody planned it that way,\u0022 said Geneney dryly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just thinking ahead, Genie; just thinking ahead,\u0022 said Jeb airily. \u0022What\u0027s that, Bob? Oh right, yeah that\u0027s the missing piece for sure. To be honest, I was kinda hoping you could handle that? The lander is probably gonna be a joint project and you get on pretty well with the Rockomax folks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahh - now \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E is an excellent question, Ornie. Nope, we\u0027re not going be shooting straight for the Mun. You want to take this one, Genie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure,\u0022 Geneney said calmly. \u0022OK people, we\u0027ve got a lot of hardware to build for this.Then we have even more training to fit in for the crews and flight control teams.\u0022 He retrieved a piece of chalk from his pocket and began to sketch out a timeline on the wall. Jeb slipped away unnoticed, closing the canteen door behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The current plan is for a three stage program. Stage One is ground team integration; Stage Two is flight hardware construction and qualification; Stage Three is gonna be bootprints on the Mun time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe smiled faintly at the disappointed looks on some faces. \u0022Don\u0027t worry folks - there\u0027s going to be plenty of flying before we get to Stage Three. First up is the Rockomax crewed flight - and we\u0027re going to lend them a hand. Two hands actually; we\u0027re going to build them a target, and we\u0027re going to lend them a flight control team.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Target, Gene?\u0022 asked Wernher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rendezvous target, Wernher. Modified Moho booster with a docking adaptor on top instead of a capsule. We\u0027re gonna need all the docking practice we can get because, without docking, we\u0027re not even getting out of Kerbin orbit. Communications during the CORDS flight were also pretty rough in places, and we need to straighten that \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E out. Plus the Rockomax pilots need to get used to working with \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E flight control team.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The second Stage 1 flight will be Eve 2. More joint flight control operations, this time to get our pilots used to working with Rockomax controllers.\u0022 Geneney\u0027s eyes flicked from Ornie to Ordrie to Edsen. \u0022The flight objectives have also been substantially upgraded. Assuming you guys are up for it, Eve 2 will be a full duration shakedown of the capsule and service module systems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen raised his hand. \u0022Does that include engine tests, Gene?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022Simulated Munar orbit insertion and trans-Kerbin injection burns; both at periapsis. Total delta-v is a little under two kilometres per second. Not quite enough for kerbostationary transfer but you\u0027ll still be busting the Moho altitude records.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What about the heat shield, Gene?\u0022 said Ornie\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The heat shield will be fine,\u0022 replied Geneney. \u0022All the ground tests were positive, ablation on the recovered Moho capsules was in line with predictions, and we\u0027re building in a healthy margin on top of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked dubious, \u0022I don\u0027t know, Gene. I don\u0027t mind taking the risk that something will go wrong but I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E want to know that we\u0027ll get home if everything goes right. Isn\u0027t there some way we can test the shield at Munar return velocities?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney scratched his head. \u0022I\u0027ll have a think,\u0022 he said, \u0022We could probably do something sub-orbital with one of the Mohos.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Put an RT-5 under it,\u0022 said Bob cheerfully. \u0022Launch \u0027em straight up, flip \u0027em over and light the Trashcan on the way down.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And hope we hit the sea and not our own heads,\u0022 said Geneney dryly. \u0022Like I said - I\u0027ll have a think.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what\u0027s the plan for Stage 2?\u0022 said Wernher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Glad you asked,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022At the moment we\u0027re thinking it\u0027s going to be a minimum of three test flights, probably more if we don\u0027t hit all our objectives the first time out. First up will be a shakedown test of the Kerbin departure stage. Then we prove out the lander in Kerbin orbit. Full Munar flight duration, docking and undocking with the Pioneer capsule, flight testing of all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and guidance systems, simulated Munar descent burns - everything we can think of.\u0022 He nodded at the expression on Wernher\u0027s face. \u0022Yep. I think we\u0027ll need more than one flight for all that too, but we\u0027ll give it our best shot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And the third flight?\u0022 said Wernher quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All-up rehearsal for the landing,\u0022 said Geneney simply. \u0022Everything bar the final powered descent, and launch from the Munar surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie raised a hand. \u0022Why bother with a rehearsal?\u0022 she said, \u0022Seems like a long way to go to not bother landing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably because we\u0027ll have our hands full just getting to the Mun for the first time,\u0022 said Ornie. \u0022No sense overloading everyone with the landing too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney coughed. \u0022Second time actually, \u0022 he said. \u0022How else did you think we were going to test the Kerbin departure stage?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA broad grin split Camrie\u0027s face. \u0022Now, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s more like it!\u0022 she said. \u0022Don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve picked the crew yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not yet,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022Not all of them anyway. The plan for the Stage 2 and Stage 3 crews is to have one pilot each from us and Rockomax. I\u0027ve no idea how Rockomax intend to pick theirs, but we\u0027ll be going with our usual method. The third slot is for the commander though - and we\u0027ll be picking them from kerbonauts that have already flown.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a rumble of discontent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know, I know, it\u0027s not the way we run things, but Ademone insisted - and just so everybody is quite clear - I agree with her. These are gonna be big, complicated flights, people, and I want a bit of experience on board. We\u0027ll still be picking our commanders from the basket so don\u0027t worry about that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So who goes first?\u0022 said Ornie, \u0022I assume we\u0027re takin\u0027 turns with Rockomax?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They do,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022First flight to the Mun will launch with two Rockomax crew on board.\u0022 He surveyed the crowd patiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford was the first to get it. \u0022Hang on, Gene. Does that mean...?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It does indeed,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022We only get one seat on the first Munar flight people, but if everything goes to plan, we get two for the first Munar \u003Cem\u003Elanding\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe smell of fresh coffee filled the air. Jeb wheeled in a large trolley, and was promptly mobbed by excited kerbals. Lucan\u0027s voice rose above the din.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So who \u003Cem\u003Egets\u003C/em\u003E that first seat, Gene?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Already sorted, Luco!\u0022 Jeb called out. \u0022Eve 3 is changing her name but she\u0027s not changing her \u003Cem\u003Epilot\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s stomach lurched.
