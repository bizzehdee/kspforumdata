I think you\u0027d be farther ahead applying it in the form of a painted effect. the problem of course is that as far as I know, no coding in the framework of KSP for this currently exists beyond the flag decals, and even then that was a recent addition and it has very strict criteria for placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf he could add cumulative decals of bullet damage, yes, it could be very pretty, but it could also be a clippy eye-straining nightmare. Decals overlapping each other on the same layer have a tendancy to cause \u0022flickering\u0022 where the graphics can\u0027t make up their mind which is on top. The only solution to this would be to have them either A: apply collectively to a \u0022damage\u0022 layer on the texture file, like paint brushes. this would be very resource intensive, or B: apply a visual stack thread priority based on age of decal. this would increase RAM footprint. and regardless of which he used, anything with a collision mesh that doesn\u0027t align perfectly to the graphical mesh is going to have magic floating bullet holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it bluntly, there\u0027s no easy way to do this, or it would have already been done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca","CreatedById":13436,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T23:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tanya Sapien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tanya Sapien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it bluntly, there\u0027s no easy way to do this, or it would have already been done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand.
