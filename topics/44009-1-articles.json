The map view and maneuver nodes shound\u0027t be available in the very beginning. I figure that the map view would be achievable quite quickly, and the maneuver nodes not far after that. It\u0027d be kind of like the early days before they added them. It was very difficult to just get into orbit in those days and that\u0027s how I feel that the early game should be like with R\u0026amp;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T03:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs someone else who was there in those early days, and wrote a program to provide proto-map screen information before there was one, I disagree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the math that goes into producing something like the map screen was developed by the 17th and 18th centuries.
