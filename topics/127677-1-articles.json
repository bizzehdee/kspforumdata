In my physics tab in the alt\u002Bf12 menu show that the ModuleManager physics is loaded an not physics.cfg. I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to set physics.cfg as the default. Is there a way to do it? I\u0027m running the 64bit work around and have a ton of mods. I hope it\u0027s an easy fix and I won\u0027t have to go mod by mod to find the culprit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
