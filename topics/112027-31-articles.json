Looking into it, it appears that I\u0027d have to have my patch run AFTER the SystemHeat patch that makes all these nice radiators play nice with the FFT engines, and I\u0027m aware of how to do that.\n\nHowever, what I\u0027m not aware of how to do is how to edit the values of the fixed microchannel radiator variants that are available thru B9 part switching. It seems to me that I\u0027d have to delete and re-write the entire B9 part switch section of the config file, which seems like a chore when I\u0027m only interested in changing the numbers on maybe 5 lines of the patch.\n\nI thought I had a good handle on how to make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches, but apparently my knowledge (or the features of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E itself) fall short on this kind of thing where the value you actually want to edit is deeply buried inside a sub-node of an actual PartModule.\n\nAny thoughts?
