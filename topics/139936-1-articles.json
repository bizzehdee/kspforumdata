But I find these contracts very difficult, considering you get these right from the start of your career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I started KSP, I didn\u0027t know how difficult they are and tried to finish some. Because airplanes are also difficult as a beginner (and due the lack of parts in early career) I tried to visit the spots with suborbital flights, trying to eyeball for the spot in map view. This took a veeerrryyy long time till I even visit one of the 3, and then I finally decided to not do these kind of contracts anymore. Pain-in-the-ass without airplanes, pain-in-the-ass with airplanes when you are a beginner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow lets talk about visiting specific spots on Mun/Minmus, which I imagine is even harder.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTargeted landing is a huge feat, like docking. I finally managed to be good at taget landing, this was necessary to send ships to my Minmus colony (which is not on the equator!). However, visiting spots needs you not only to hit a ground target, you have to manipulate your trajectory to go through a specific spot, not only one time, no, you usually have to visit 3 of them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, really, who does this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make it short: I don\u0027t get the purpose of these contracts. To hard for a beginner, to grindy for veterans.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr, maybe, I am doing something VERY wrong and they are easy-as-pie in reality.
