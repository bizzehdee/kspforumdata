They\u0027re pretty straightforward compared to most of my work. Here\u0027s an example, and a link to my DeviantArt page if anyone wants references. I\u0027d love to work on some models and textures and help out, since I\u0027m no good at programming or coding for game plugins, at least I can contribute something to the community hopefully. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![uN3JW9n.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uN3JW9n.jpg)\n\n[http://jaredthedragon.deviantart.com/art/Wine-by-the-Window-2014-436674135](http://jaredthedragon.deviantart.com/art/Wine-by-the-Window-2014-436674135)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T01:49:34Z","Content":"I use Autodesk Maya 2008 to model parts for KSP. The DAE FBX plugin is required to be able to export the models into .dae format. I can then get them into Unity and into the game fairly easily. The only thing I have noticed is that if I want to make a 1.25m tank I make a cylinder with a scale factor in the X and Z-axes of 1.25. You can then export this, but once you get it in KSP it is twice as large as it should be, which I believe is due to the way in which Maya defines cylinders. So the only issue I\u0027ve had is that I have to set the rescaleFactor to 0.5 instead of 1, but that\u0027s it as far as I\u0027ve been able to tell."},{"CreatedByName":"JaredTheDragon","CreatedById":137445,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T05:38:14Z","Content":"Thanks for the tip, TheShadow.

Nothing special obviously, but given some illustrations and direction I can model and texture just about anything.

We already have modular Thrusters, Reactors, Generators, IRSU Refinery and now also modular propellant tanks. The only problem is that I want to switch their model/textures when you switch their content in the VAB. I also need Thrusters which can switch nozzle optimised for differnet atmospheric pressures (low, medium, high or vacuum ISP).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T08:34:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 08:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitefr","CreatedById":128155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T12:30:24Z","Content":"I\u0027m using Maya for work but i am mostly doing 3D Animation stuff and some python programming in Maya.\n\nI want to start making mods for KSP but before that, do any of you have any tips ? \n\nThanks !"},{"CreatedByName":"avghunter","CreatedById":84614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T22:04:32Z","Content":"i use Maya2015"}]}
