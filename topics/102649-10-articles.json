This subject.\n\nLet me see if I can manage to hit the high point properly.\n\n***There is inferred ambiguity in the way the question is phrased.

The conveyor belt is designed to exactly match the speed of the wheels, moving in the opposite direction. Can the plane take off?\u0022\n\u003E \n\nThe problem is in one little phrase: \u0022the conveyor belt is *designed* to exactly match the speed of the wheels\u0022.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWell, it can mean one of two things:\n\n1. The conveyor belt is designed to measure the tangential speed of the wheels and adjust its speed to match.\n2. A series of conditions unspecified in the problem has resulted in the situation where the tangential velocity of the wheels is equal and opposite to the vector of motion of the surface of the conveyor belt.\n\nIf the correct meaning is (1), then the conveyor belt will attempt to match the speed of the wheels, *but will not be able to do so*. The plane takes off. This is the most straightforward interpretation. The question says nothing about what *will* happen; it only says what the conveyor belt is *designed* to do. Whenever the conveyor belt detects the wheels moving, it will immediately attempt to match their speed, which will increase their speed, which will cause the conveyor belt to accelerate faster and faster in an attempt to meet its designed performance criteria. Meanwhile, the plane merrily takes off without even noticing.\n\nIf the correct meaning is (2), then circumstances are quite different. Nothing the conveyor belt does can exert a rearward force on the plane greater than the mass of the plane multiplied by the coefficient of kinetic friction in the wheel bearings. Therefore, the only circumstance where the tangential velocity of the wheels is equal and opposite to the vector of motion of the surface of the conveyor belt is one where all velocities are zero. The plane is not moving, but neither are the wheels or the conveyor belt, because everything is turned off.\n\nObviously, I feel (1) is a more accurate interpretation. The question never says anything other than what the conveyor belt is designed to do. It is at this point that many will try to shunt explanation (2) back into (1), saying \u0022But what if the conveyor belt has instantaneous acceleration?\u0022 But this is neither specified nor even implied in the original question.

If the plane were moving backward, the wheels would be moving slower than the treadmill.  Therefore, since the problem states they are moving at the same rate, the plane is stationary.\n\u003E \n\nThe problem doesn\u0027t state that the wheels are moving at the same rate as the treadmill. It states that the conveyor belt is designed to match the speed of the wheels.\n\nLet us suppose the 747 is stationary on the treadmill, ready for takeoff. The pilot throttles the four engines to 100% and then releases the wheel brakes.\n\nUp to this point, the conveyor belt cannot move. If the conveyor belt is designed to match the speed of the wheels, then the conveyor belt cannot move unless the wheels are moving.\n\nHowever, we must acknowledge that the conveyor belt can have NO impact on the plane or its wheels unless it moves. So it cannot inhibit the initial motion of the plane. Therefore, the plane is free to move.\n\nIf the plane is free to move, then it will begin moving. If it begins moving, it is not stationary. If it is not stationary, then the treadmill will not be able to match the speed of the wheels, even though it will attempt to do so. Thus, the plane will take off.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 30 minutes ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Speed of wheels\u0022 is problematic to me. Is it the linear speed of the hub with respect to the ground? Or it could be the speed of the outer rim with respect to the hub, or it could be an RPM value, and there could be other interpretations as well.\n\u003E \n\nThe way it is generally understood is that \u0022the speed of the wheels\u0022 targeted by the conveyor belt is defined as the revolution rate multiplied by the outer wheel circumference. Not that people sit down and do the math; that\u0027s just what the assumed interpretation typically arrives at. This is also the only interpretation that leads to any problems. If you interpret it as \u0022the linear speed of the hub with respect to the ground\u0022 then there is no problem; the conveyor is merely accelerating to match the forward speed of the plane which doesn\u0027t produce any issues at all."},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-15T14:36:35Z","Content":"Ok, I\u0027ve been watching this thread with some sort of amusement for the last few days.

Thrust moves the plane forward; the motion of the air over the airfoil produces lift. If the plane is somehow held stationary, then all the thrust in the world will do nothing to lift the plane.\n\nOf course, there is no way for the conveyor belt to hold the plane stationary, no matter how fast it goes.
