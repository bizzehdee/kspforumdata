First, I got my Phase Angle correct but I\u0027m at a bit of a loss on Ejection Angle. I started my burn at what I thought was the rough ejection angle in relation to Kerbin\u0027s trajectory around the sun but Engineer\u0027s Rendezvous info shows some number that is close but not exactly when I ejected. So is ejection angle the location in my Kerbin orbit that I want to start my burn, or the prograde angle that I should be heading in when I burn or after I burn. A bit hazy on the details and don\u0027t really know how to get this set before I burn. (Been following this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I managed to get a close approach. Then at a point along my path I plopped an adjustment node and got an encounter. But my intercept numbers are a bit higher than this (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u003C/a\u003E) by about 300dV. (This is a guestimate since I haven\u0027t actually gotten to orbit yet). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, as this is my first interplanetary trek, I realized it was going to take some time because of waiting around for the phase angle, but... what do you do for 50 days? I put a comsat in geosynchronous orbit and am just super warping til the next window (I\u0027ve got LKO ships ready to go to Dres and Even when their windows open too). With career mode going I need the science to go on so I guess I\u0027m sending intermediate packets back and just waiting!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-19T00:52:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2013 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Oddible\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T01:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) You should center your burn on the ejection angle. Put a maneuver node there and try to divide your burn roughly equally before and after the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You can warp at max speed with a ship on the launch pad at KSC before you launch it. So, the ideal thing to do is just warp on the launchpad with your interplanetary ship until your launch window arrives, then launch. The Kerbal Alarm Clock mod can help make sure you don\u0027t overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
