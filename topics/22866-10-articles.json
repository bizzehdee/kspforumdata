Simply don\u0027t add the overhang/deck parts to the hull. The hull sides can be used with hangar flooring to create a pseudo cargo ship/tanker looking ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to consider is that with all the improved loading solutions you can simply load the aircraft into the carrier. Or possibly land a Snjo Firespitter seaplane and winch it up into the hangar with KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of ship size the parts are fairly large, at a minimum 1 bow 1 stern and 2 side hull sections (left and right) will be the smallest design possible using carrier parts, this is what I usually build up and call the \u0027grasshopper\u0027 as it\u0027s very short \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly you\u0027ll have the Runabout.
