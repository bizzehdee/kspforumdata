The really annoying thing is that it isn\u0027t just a set amount like 0.5EC/s, it appears to be a percentage. After the last image I posted I deployed two solar panels. Instead of getting 2.4EC/s like I expected I only got 1.2EC/s for a 50% decrease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my main modded game I discovered that if I put a electrical lock on the engines (using the mod \u0022ModActions\u0022) then I lose less charge.
