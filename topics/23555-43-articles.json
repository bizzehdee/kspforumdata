I have 4 containers, each with 1 pipe end, 1 pylon, and 3 connector ports. I grabbed one box, set up the pylon about 25m away, and attached the pipe end and ports to the pylon. I then built a pipe from the pylon to one of the 4 connectors on the refinery itself. The refinery also has 4 radial horizontal winches with anchors to act as guy wires. Every time I load the refinery, it gets thrown into the air and detonates. There are no EVA Kerbals in the area, only 2 flags to mark landing zones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I\u0027m starting to wonder if I built atop a kraken nest, because this is happening 100% of the time.

Geofdun, trying to escape the summoned kraken, launched the ship in hope of reaching Munar orbit. He and the entire ship spontaneously detonated about 2m off the ground. On switching away and back, the pylons themselves leaped into the air as soon as physics started.

The only things that really need tweaking generally are the placement parameters for the part\u0027s position on a Kerbal\u0027s Back, and the size they take up in a container.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll note though that there\u0027s two themes in the parts that are included by default: They allow radial attachment, and they\u0027re small. He hasn\u0027t included large items a Kerbal probably couldn\u0027t carry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far as I know, none of the tiny fuel tanks allow radial attachment.
