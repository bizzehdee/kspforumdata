My main reason for this is to setup a rescue mission and would like to land the vessel as close as I can to the original site if at all possible. Also this would be done without mods, I am sure there is a mod that could do this for me (mechjeb maybe?) but I want to do it by hand if possible. I currently do not have anyone stranded, but I want to do a video showing my unmanned lander pod actually working, since I found out my rescue setup does in fact work the way I thought.
