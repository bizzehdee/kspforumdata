It is done in Blender and Unity and I have a test rover in the game. The problem is at higher speeds on planets with lower gravity the rover flips over (it works perfectly fine on Kerbin). I tried adjust the weight but different planets have different gravity so that doesn\u0027t work. I was thinking I could make a plugin for the rover that keeps it from ever flipping over. (I know it wouldn\u0027t be realistic, but the rover isn\u0027t meant to be realistic, it\u0027s meant to be fun.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never made a plugin before, so I was wondering it this is even possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is possible, can anyone point me in the right direction to get started.
