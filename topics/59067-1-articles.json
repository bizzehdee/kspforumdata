If you choose the manual node, you get the normal node gizmo. However, if you hit \u0022Create automatic maneuver node\u0022, you get a window with a few options, if you\u0027re in career it depends on your progress and if you\u0027re in sandbox you get all options, circularize and change inclination for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the action wanted requires a specific location in the orbit, it moves the node there, for example for a Hohmann transfer (window) or a orbital plane match (AN/DN).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think about this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T10:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B how about \u0027adjust delta-v to minimise min diet to target orbit\u0027; so one could more easily find a manoeuvre to rendezvous non circular orbits. Currently for circular orbits I lay a manoeuvre node, prograde till the orbits will touch, then drag the node around seeing where the rendezvous is - it\u0027s much harder (in a tedious way) for non circular orbits. Given that the predicted new orbit after the manoeuvre appears \u0027by magic\u0027 why not have the result fixed and the input appear \u0027by magic\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
