I don\u0027t think the radiators - especially the\u00A0large ones - are typically meant to be mounted on the centerline of a vessel. Rather, they\u0027re intended to surface mount radially\u00A0or, as is the the case on the real-life\u00A0ISS, mounted on a lateral truss offset from the main modules of a station. In that case, they\u0027re fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T04:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelp, in light of two conflicting opinions, I\u0027ll go ahead and post a bug report and see what happens. \u00A0I\u0027ve also added the large TCS to the album for completion\u0027s sake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
