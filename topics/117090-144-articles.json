Little camp-site at the top of the mountain we\u0027ve been working on for about 12 years now, slowly fixing it up.  We like to bring chainsaws and other tools, and have been building outdoors wood-log furniture for it for awhile; tables, benches.. more tables...  Beautiful place, though gets a bit chilly at night even in the middle of the summer; think we say about 20f one of the nights we were up there (thankfully that was only in the late night, early morning).  Ohh.. and bears.  There are bears up here... big ones, and not too-far-away.  Gotta be careful with your foodstuffs so as to not attract them, and gotta keep your bear mace and/or large caliber weapons handy.\n\nOverall it was a good trip; lots of good food was eaten, lots of beer/drinks were consumed, only a few minor injuries incurred, and only got rained on for a few hours out of the 3 days being up there.  I\u0027ll see if I have any pictures from last year (didn\u0027t take any this time), as it really is a very beautiful place.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Qwarkk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quick something i noticed today about the Soyuz crew pods; both the ascent and descent pods have a crew capacity of 2 in this mod, but in real life they can both carry 3.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If this is intentional, please ignore ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Right now SSTU Soyuz use stock mk2 iva.

It is mostly limited to two crew due to size; there is no way three giant kerbal heads would fit in those things (they barely would fit through the extra-large hatch as-is).  It also makes a nice 2-crew early-career mode pod system; as in shortly after you have the tech/skills to make it to orbit with some slapped-together-stock-stuff, the SC-A stuff should unlock and give you something less... cludgy... to take to orbit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:54 AM, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That seems to be specific to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E configs.

As such, a full-wrap-around-variant would not fit/work as a cargo bay.  I have \\_not\\_ started working on any structural parts yet; those are still quite a ways off.  Solid-sided cargo bays are also planned, but are also a ways out.  How far?  No clue, gotta finish the wheel stuff first.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E 2.) Sorry, but no.  Docking ports require MODULEs in order to function.  Stock code does not support MODULE switching at runtime, so this is not something that I can do.  Adapters/end-caps/simple structural bits, sure.  Anything that requires a MODULE to function... nope (hmm... maybe I should start bugging NK about this now, try and get such things supported in 1.2....).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I -do- have a resizable \u0027welding\u0027 docking port planned (and the plugin-code 3/4 written and already working for it)... but alas, as with structural parts and other station parts... gotta finish up that wheel stuff first.\n\u003E \n\n1. Yes, I was referring to making a structural part for space stations. SXT mod has a truss similar to this, but unfortunately it doesn\u0027t stretch to any length and without tweakscale, you can\u0027t resize it. A solid one of these \u0022cargo truss\u0022 would be excellent building material for space stations. And if you\u0027ve already addressed this as part of the station parts on the Git that you plan on making, forgive my ignorance on this matter and proceed to \u0022These are not the droids you are looking for\u0022. \n\n2. That sucks, but it\u0027s totally understandable why that is. But, there are plenty of docking/connector ports that I can work with to accomplish this, thanks for the input on that. I do remember you were working on such code, but those wheels come first, by all means. This was just an observation that I noticed and was looking through the eyes of a mod user who wouldn\u0027t be using other mods, other than yours, to utilize the cargo truss. \n\n3. Glad to have you back and I hope you enjoyed your camping trip. I, too, enjoy the great outdoors as often as I can get around to doing so. But, since it\u0027s summer here in Georgia and the eastern diamondback rattlesnake is prolific in these parts, I will have to wait until the end of fall/beginning of winter to hit the ole campsite. In anycase, I hope you are rested and doing well. I did, however, go to Kennedy Space Center for my birthday/father\u0027s day present. That truly was better than any camping trip.... almost ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T17:58:59Z","Content":"Sounds awesome---black or brown bears?

But they are out there, not too far up the trail/mountain.  The FWP / forest-rangers always stop by our camp at least once and remind us while we are up there (as if all of the signs aren\u0027t enough), and there are pretty large fines/etc if you don\u0027t take the proper precautions (e.g. don\u0027t leave your food or trash out overnight...)."},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T08:30:31Z","Content":"This has probably already been asked so I apologize in advance for duplication.
