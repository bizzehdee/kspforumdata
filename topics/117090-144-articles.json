Yes, I was referring to making a structural part for space stations. SXT mod has a truss similar to this, but unfortunately it doesn\u0027t stretch to any length and without tweakscale, you can\u0027t resize it. A solid one of these \u0022cargo truss\u0022 would be excellent building material for space stations. And if you\u0027ve already addressed this as part of the station parts on the Git that you plan on making, forgive my ignorance on this matter and proceed to \u0022These are not the droids you are looking for\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. That sucks, but it\u0027s totally understandable why that is. But, there are plenty of docking/connector ports that I can work with to accomplish this, thanks for the input on that. I do remember you were working on such code, but those wheels come\u00A0first, by all means. This was just an observation that I noticed and was looking through the eyes of a mod user who wouldn\u0027t be using other mods, other than yours, to utilize the cargo truss.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Glad to have you back and I hope you enjoyed your camping trip. I, too, enjoy the great outdoors as often as I can get around to doing so. But, since it\u0027s summer here in Georgia and the eastern diamondback rattlesnake is prolific in these parts, I will have to wait until the end of fall/beginning of winter to hit the ole campsite. In anycase, I hope you are rested and doing well. I did, however, go to Kennedy Space Center for my birthday/father\u0027s day present.
