This is a \u003Cstrong\u003Edeliberate game design decision\u003C/strong\u003E from the developers. However, I believe that the rationale behind this decision should be discussed, if only due to the fact that many mods have adressed time-based mechanics, and in doing so were able to improve the experience of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of \u003Cstrong\u003Etime-based mechanics\u003C/strong\u003E are we talking about? Which game tasks could improve game experience by taking time to complete?

Shouldn\u0027t we have to wait, \u003Cstrong\u003Eat least in Career Mode\u003C/strong\u003E, for our engineers and technicians to build the craft? The Mod \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Construction Time\u003C/strong\u003E adresses this (and does many other things). The fact that there\u0027s a mod indicates a demand for it, although it would make sense to have a feature such as this something that could be toggled in the difficulties/settings panel. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperiments:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E all the existing experiments are instantaneous. It makes sense for stuff like sample collecting, but it does leave our kerbals without much to do while waiting for the next transfer window. Some mods have experiments that are performed over time or get science points in a steady trickle, such as \u003Cstrong\u003EScanSat\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003EStation Science\u003C/strong\u003E. The fact that you can leave an experiment running in a vessel and go fly another one helps creating the illusion that the entire space program is alive and dynamic, and that the kerbals in the currently active vessel aren\u0027t the only guys working in a given time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding Upgrades:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E re-constructing or upgrading a building in the space center happens in the blink of an eye. This is a bit unsettling to a player familiar with RTS mechanics, or anyone who played a SimCity game. In fact, we expect building something as large as the VAB to take time more than we expect travel between planets to take time, since popular fiction has mostly disregarded the proper size of space. In this sense, it\u0027s a big break in our sense of immersion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EResearching: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003Eunlocking a new node in the tech tree also happens instantly.

Some of the most popular mods that are resource collection to the game, such as \u003Cstrong\u003EKethane \u003C/strong\u003Eand \u003Cstrong\u003EKarbonite\u003C/strong\u003E, make the gathering of resources something that takes time. Given how the devs have avoided time-based mechanics, will they go the same route?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore going any further, I think we should adress the motives behind the devs\u0027 decision \u003Cstrong\u003Enot to have any time-based mechanics\u003C/strong\u003E in the stock game. It\u0027s been stated several times - mostly, if I\u0027m not mistaken, by MaxMaps in the Squadcasts - that HarvesteR chooses not to have tasks that take time to perform simply because the player can use \u003Cstrong\u003Etime warp\u003C/strong\u003E to fast forward to the task\u0027s completion. However, I\u0027m not convinced by this justification, and I\u0027ll try to show why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying in space takes time. So there\u0027s one time-based mechanic that is in fact the very soul of KSP. We don\u0027t have magic hyperdrives, wormholes or warp jumps that take our ships instantly, let\u0027s say, from Kerbin to Duna. A trip between those planets takes months. And yet we can use time warp to fast forward to its end. Does that mean that the time of the trip is meaningless, and we might as well have instantaneous travel? Of course not. In fact, the time warp makes the whole experience bearable - we don\u0027t have to wait months of real life time to get our kerbals to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo KSP already has its own temporality. Other time-based mechanics should contribute to create a sense of meaningful in-game time, even if the player can choose to fast-forward ahead. It causes a \u003Cstrong\u003Edisjunction \u003C/strong\u003Ein the player\u0027s experience that the passage of time is so important to a side of the game while being completely irrelevant to another: in the time it took to get a ship from Kerbin to Duna, the whole KSC was rebuilt more than once and its technology advanced twenty years (if you have enough science and funds saved, you can even do it in the time it takes to get a ship from ground to orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to disclaim that, while I\u0027m arguing for greater player immersion, I\u0027m not adopting a \u003Cstrong\u003Edefense of realism\u003C/strong\u003E. More realistic features do not necessarily mean a better player experience, since they may add undesirable levels of complexity (game complexity should be emergent, it should happen as the result of the interaction between simple elements that can be known by the player). A good game strives to be intuitive - which is related to how we expect the game world to work, by relating it to previous experiences (such as reality, but also movies and other games).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s think about this issue for a moment. Leaving aside the fact that we\u0027re used to a lot of these features as they are right now, ask yourself: would the game be more interesting by having more time-based mechanics?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T00:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe resources point is in the what not to suggest list and chances are just for that one point this thread will probably be banned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut other than that good points\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T00:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commander Jebidiah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commander Jebidiah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe resources point is in the what not to suggest list and chances are just for that one point this thread will probably be banned.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread isn\u0027t suggesting resource gathering, it\u0027s suggesting that it be a time-based mechanic when it\u0027s added (i.e. 0.91 if plans don\u0027t change), so it isn\u0027t covered by the do not suggest list.

Perhaps it\u0027ll give a rapid science gain at first, and gradually slow down as we approach full understanding of a given sample. Also, there could be a mechanic in which the number of scientists and size of the lab are considerations.

It was a munbase core, and the hapless new recruit pilot was on a now suborbital trajectory (periapsis was ~60, but apo was not much above 75, so it was gonna decay fast if focused) in a cupola module. I had a \u0022tug\u0022 I made (really a pretty normal CM/SM combo with the mk1-2 I use for rescue, etc) at the station nearby, and I tried to rescue him FAST, even though without focusing on him while he was in the atmosphere, nothing would ever happen to him\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 because it was FUN to do the fastest intercept, rather than the best intercept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a generalized time-based scheme that OP suggests (or KCT, etc) allows for a space race as well, even if totally abstracted. The game could spawn in competing ships at some points in time (like it does for stranded kerbals) that would be en route tot he mun, or duna, etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 could be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T15:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Parkaboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Parkaboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHarvesteR chooses not to have tasks that take time to perform simply because the player can use time warp to fast forward to the task\u0027s completion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP in its current form encourages timewarping because it has no way to manage multiple ongoing missions (a l\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1 Kerbal Alarm Clock).
