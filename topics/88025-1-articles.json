I am Mrab Ezreb. I got started with programming with batch (ah, those were the days, when I felt like I could do or hack anything I wanted with my haxorz.bat) then HTML (that didn\u0027t last long) then lua (in minecraft with computercraft) then java (want to make mods for minecraft). I have mostly forgotten batch (curse you windows 7!) and html (meh, they have website creators, and besides, flash websites are all the rage.) Lua, well, It kindof just got mixed up with java, and I don\u0027t remember it that much. Java, I mostly remember, but I haven\u0027t done much coding recently. I would like to know how to write a mod for KSP, pretty much from scratch. Could anybody help me out with that?
