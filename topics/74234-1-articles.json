I\u0027m afraid that soon even procreation can not handle without the help of a computer :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little joke :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love computers but everything has its limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery had bad days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday such day.happened to me \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI live in Wroclaw, is a very beautiful city in the southern Poland, approaching the end of the semester. Today I had a test of English language level B2 2, moreover, I do not know what my English Language course for graduate studies, I had 4 semesters of English at the undergraduate, moreover, I believe that my level of knowledge of the language is sufficient. Unfortunately, the program of study requires that we went to English. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, today was the problem of urban transport, normally I use the trams are fast and do not stand in traffic jams, but today was the problem I reached only half the route, Than tram stopped, and before us another stop 5 trams and not going on while track was free and it was no traffic jam at all. It turned out that the computer system which manages public transport is crashed.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to take a taxi to be on time for the exam, it cost me 9 z\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 and i was late, and a lot of nerves, I was really pissed off, but i have really good English teacher, he examined me while he really don\u0027t have to do at all:-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em wondering are our Polish motorman and urban bus drivers are such idiots that they can not ride without a computer? Does your computer have them all show? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all in communist time (though I\u0027m too young to remember it, I was born in 1986) drivers and tram drivers, do your job without a computer. Even 10 years ago did not have this system and it did just fine. These were funds from the European Regional Development Fund for infrastructure development Very Happy And today was opposite. Thus i must admit that this system really improved our mass transit, the bus and trams, are more reliable and better keeping schedule than before, especially the electronic display showing actual arrival on every tram on bus stop are really cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-05T21:36:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2014 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pawelk198604\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T20:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can survive with a lot less than computers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/product/9780007274932-item.html?s_campaign=goo-PLATest\u0026amp;gclid=CjkKEQjwqsCcBRDt7_Gts5a91YYBEiQAm-wYER-MgmCboNTZGgmENJjmq2VO19Mht_3h_nIKLBGLarjw_wcB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/product/9780007274932-item.html?s_campaign=goo-PLATest\u0026amp;gclid=CjkKEQjwqsCcBRDt7_Gts5a91YYBEiQAm-wYER-MgmCboNTZGgmENJjmq2VO19Mht_3h_nIKLBGLarjw_wcB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only difference between a human who can survive in the wilderness without the aid of any industrial technology and one who can\u0027t is knowledge (excluding the obvious like physical or mental disability, disease, and so on).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T20:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUrban transportation is computerized to reduce congestion.
