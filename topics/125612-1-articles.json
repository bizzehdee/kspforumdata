The textures for the fuel tanks of SpaceY are also glitchy and every texture overlaps at once. \u003Cbr\u003E\nI am also having issues where mods such as KAS show the parts, like a winch, but no GUI is available for me to control it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd HullCameraVDS also does not let me use the cameras. They are shown in the parts list but they do not work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy is it not working? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am on Windows 10 so I know that can cause issues but I think I have seen other Windows 10 users use the mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I have the recent module manager update and FSfuelswitch in my gamedata folder)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks\n"}]}
