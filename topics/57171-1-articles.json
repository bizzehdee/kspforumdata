You need to rendezvous again with Kerbin SOI, which may take some time. Basically you need to change your orbit to one slower if you are ahead Kerbin or faster if you are behind Kerbin.

Mechjeb has a rendezvous calculator that may be able to automatically pilot you toward an encounter, but it\u0027s no magic solution if you don\u0027t have the delta V. Also last I checked, it really likes to start from circular orbits, which an accidental slingshot manouevre probably hasn\u0027t given you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive you\u0027ve apparently shot past Mun and into a stellar orbit, I guess there\u0027s part of your orbit that is still near Kerbin\u0027s orbit? One option could be to be very patient, use maximum time warp and keep orbiting around until the two markers (for your ship position and planet position at closest point) to get close enough that a minor burn will get an intercept. This may take quite a few orbits, though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also recommend hitting F5 to quicksave before committing to any burns, so you don\u0027t waste fuel on something that doesn\u0027t work.
