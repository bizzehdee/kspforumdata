I\u0027m not 100% happy with it, but it does work (just don\u0027t even think about physical time acceleration). I didn\u0027t see a thread about them specifically (who wouldn\u0027t want to make one after seeing the mk1 airplane parts?), so I finally managed to build, launch, and land one.\n\nIn the images there are some RemoteTech parts on the craft, but I removed them for posting. The .craft file is here: [https://bpaste.net/show/c4135b6c0a35](https://bpaste.net/show/c4135b6c0a35)\n\nA few (crappy) beauty shots. Obviously I\u0027m not a very good photographer. Frankly, flying this thing is so annoying (it gets easier with practice, as it turns out) so trying to get a pretty angle and all that is kind of hard, and it was nearing dusk, so Kerbol wasn\u0027t working with me, either.\n\n[![screenshot0.png](http://s2.postimg.org/9fpbel8ad/screenshot0.png)](http://postimg.org/image/9fpbel8ad/)\n\n[![screenshot1.png](http://s2.postimg.org/iorhoph6d/screenshot1.png)](http://postimg.org/image/iorhoph6d/)\n\n[![screenshot2.png](http://s2.postimg.org/wwh6dctv9/screenshot2.png)](http://postimg.org/image/wwh6dctv9/)\n\n[![screenshot3.png](http://s2.postimg.org/f7pflqi45/screenshot3.png)](http://postimg.org/image/f7pflqi45/)\n\n[![screenshot4.png](http://s2.postimg.org/uhtw6o305/screenshot4.png)](http://postimg.org/image/uhtw6o305/)\n\n[![screenshot5.png](http://s2.postimg.org/wno7166gl/screenshot5.png)](http://postimg.org/image/wno7166gl/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T00:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kelmv**"},{"CreatedByName":"Riftmann","CreatedById":101626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T08:50:50Z","Content":"Not bad.
