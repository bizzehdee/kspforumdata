What thrust is is the engine pushing air at a certain speed out the back of it. When the speed of the aircraft matches the exhaust velocity of the engine the engine stops providing thrust (there are other factors involved but that\u0027s the main point) VTOL engines are designed to allow you to lift off vertically and transition to a relatively low speed horizontal flight, not get to to space on their own.
