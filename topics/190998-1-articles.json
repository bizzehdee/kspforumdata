I have tried EVAing my kerbals from the rover into the floating lander, I can enter the vehicle but firing the engine has no effect and I cannot maneuver at all. Apparently I am moving 9.2 m/s relative to the surface. I then sent a kerbal back to my rover to try driving out of physics distance but now the rover is stuck in place cant even use reaction wheels to rotate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try to replicate and upload a screenshot when i get home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else experienced this, know the cause or workaround?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda ruining my career save right now as I was planning on building many bases/rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dirkidirk","CreatedById":200064,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-14T15:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsame thing happened to me (on an Xbox), fixed it by reverting to a previous quicksave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SecondChance","CreatedById":196731,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-18T13:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyep reloading an older save works most of the time it seems, I cant seem to replicate it now either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
