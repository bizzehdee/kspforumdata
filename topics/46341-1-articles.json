While I was never told what the licencing costs for the Minecraft set were, or if there even was one, I don\u0027t think that getting a free licence is part of the qualifications. I highly doubt that LEGO got the BTTF licence for free. Really, I see no reason for LEGO to turn down this project. It meets all their requirements, the only threat is whether Squad would want to allow them to produce the set. Currently, I could see them turning it down, since the game is still technically in alpha and all. However, this project likely won\u0027t reach 10,000 supporters for a while, so that should help with convincing Squad. At the same time, I could see Squad giving it the go-ahead even with the current situation of the game, and possibly even if LEGO doesn\u0027t pay a licencing fee, due to the huge amount of free advertising the game would get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, so far Cuusoo sets have actually had some of the lowest price per part ratios in recent LEGO history. Usually a licenced set has a price/part ratio of somewhere around $.10-.12 per part. But the average price/part ratio for Cuusoo sets so far is about $.08. Past Cuusoo sets have been expensive simply because they have a lot of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheNerdyOne_","CreatedById":78120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T22:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RawChicken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RawChicken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAWesome idea!
