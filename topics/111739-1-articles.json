I see the ReShade effects becoming popular lately, but that shaders are a bit fps expensive for my taste...\n\nSo... although I\u0027m a total noob with all this... I\u0027m trying to add a blur/dirtylens shader ( [https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/9133](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/9133) ) in KSP.\n\nAs far as I know, I need to put the shader in a project (unity), add it to the camera and later compile it for KSP.\n\nI don\u0027t find any usable tutorial or forum thread about this topic.\n\nI can add the effect into a new project, even tune it (without preview)... but I don\u0027t know how to port it to KSP.\n\nI\u0027ve seen this too: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109269-Custom-Shader-Loader-2-0-release](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109269-Custom-Shader-Loader-2-0-release)\n\nBut I don\u0027t know if the camera counts as \u0022child object\u0022. I\u0027m not even sure about how to identify the cameras, to apply the effect properly... So I don\u0027t know if this is useful for me.\n\nCan someone give a hand to a fool like me?"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T18:11:44Z","Content":"It\u0027s not possible to use an assetstore package directly in ksp, and Custom Shader Loader is for parts only, so you\u0027d have to write up your own plugin.\n\nFirst, you\u0027d have to load the assetstore package into unity and copy the individual assets (shaders, textures, etc.) into a folder in /GameData/, and load those using code.Then, you\u0027d have to copy the scripts included in the package into your own plugin, and add the script to every camera you want to add them too, once again using code. Probably just the flight camera, IVA cameras, and the planetarium camera.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T18:14:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**\n  \nI suck at using words"}]}
