Is there a way to change the axis rotation of a part so that it is faving z forward instead of -x forward. I am aware this can be done via a parent game object but that will not work in this setup.

Basically is there a way to cause a part of a model to have its local rotation be 0,0,0 but have its axis oriented as if it was 0,-90,0 without using a parent object to reset tge orientation because all of the parts are arranged in a stack and changing one would change all of them not just the one I need to change. As I say this I think I may be able to fix it. By seperating the stack...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
