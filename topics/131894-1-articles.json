After performing extensive testing on drag-reducing designs, the biggest problem that my SSTO crafts experience is overheating because of their very (ironically) streamlined design. Parts will often heat up and explode, leaving a suborbital debris field and an eventual demise at sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general idea for SSTO space planes is that they should take the shallowest ascent profile in order to take advantage of the relatively efficient air breathing engines (usually the RAPIER) to gain as much horizontal speed as possible before switching to rocket mode for the final burn to apoapsis. In KSP, at an altitude of around 18,000m - 24,000m rocket parts will overheat and explode if exposed to speeds roughly above 1,400m/s. This will mean that speeds are limited to below 1,400m/s until the craft gets to a high enough altitude (which is beyond air breathing engine\u0027s capabilities) and where closed cycle engines take over for thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been doing some careful design considerations and have seemed to breach the 1,400m/s speed barrier and reached around 1,600m/s on an air breathing system with little to no overheating. I\u0027ll need to perform more testing as I have done in my previous threads before sharing my findings with the KSP community. I would also like to mention that I use vanilla parts and vanilla aero. For now, the results appear promising, as it would mean that I would need to carry even less fuel to achieve orbit with SSTOs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ztuuUKI.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztuuUKI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime I would like to ask the KSP community what their limiting factors were when they designed their SSTOs.

With 100% recovery on the runway, the cost of hardware can be taken out of the equation, so the only metric when figuring out the \u221A/kg of a SSTO is the cost of fuel... and therefore payload fraction. The higher it is, the more payload and less fuel that your SSTO is (as a fraction), so the better \u221A/kg you get to orbit. So yeah, maximize payload ratio, and the cost will go down a low as it can.
