Imaging a ruler laying across a sphere. This is your horizontal velocity essentially. You can also think of it as a flight path with no gravity. With gravity, it is like bending that ruler. You are moving \u0027up\u0027 at an angle, and gravity pulls you in. Without resistance, you are then curving around. If your horizontal velocity causes an increase in altitude counter to that of the pull of gravity, orbit will increase. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get closer, the pull of gravity does get stronger. However whether you escape or create orbit is entirely related to your velocity relative to the suface. So if you are going 4m/s when you hit 4000, you will keep decreasing.

A canon is on hill V firing canonballs to the right. Fire the ball slowly and it does move sideways, but gravity also pulls it down and it lands at D. Fire it a little faster and gravity still pulls it down just as hard, but it\\\u0027s also moving sideways faster, so the ball goes father before landing at E. Fire the ball somewhat faster, and as the ball travels, the earth curves away underneath it, so the ball goes even farther before hitting the ground at F, and faster/further still at B down there. But at a certain speed, the orbital speed, the earth (or whatever) curves away at the same rate that the canonball falls/flies. The ball really is falling (freefall), but will just keep falling and never hit the earth. Of course, this illustration pretends earth has no atmosphere to slow the ball down, but the idea still works if you just imagine the mountain sticks up out of the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewton.
