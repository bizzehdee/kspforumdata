Currently bigger ports keep the vessel more rigid simply because they are bigger, and small ones let the whole thing twist and sway like crazy. Perhaps the more complex ports (resource transferring ports) would not be as strong, and they may become uncoupled under enough stress, while the mechanical clamps that transfer nothing would hold firm as if it was one ship. There could also be different shapes - such as square, or hexagonal ports, that would be more effective structurally, and transfer resources/crew, but would be more difficult to dock (though the forced alignment could be an advantage). Furthermore, port magnetism could vary, so that some ports are much easier to dock than others, due to a greater or lesser pull when they come neer. There could also be a (very expensive) \u0022universal\u0022 port, that would attach to multiple other ports, but would be much larger, heavier, and thicker than standard ports - mainly used for stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"av8r1","CreatedById":135981,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T04:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current game makes you upgrade the research center before you can transfer resources, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that, if the clamp-o-tron Jr. was available before that point, you could use the Mk. 1 command pod to perform very Gemini-like missions, in which docking was the whole goal of the mission.
