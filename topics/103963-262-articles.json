Using that method, I avoid having to install a fresh copy of scatterer every time I switch between mods. Devs that don\u0027t use that method are the people that you should bring that up with. Not the scatterer dev.\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003E \n\nTHIS!\n\nA few of us fought hard bugging Blackrack to work towards good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E compatibility and we should all be thankful that recently he reworked the config structure to do just this.

I\u0027m not exactly sure what to call it so here is a screen shot.  I turned off and on most of the setting for scatterer without any luck.  I\u0027m using 1.2.2 on a Mac, recent OSX.  I\u0027ve only installed this mod on a clean install of KSP.  Any guidance would be awesome.  Thanks.\n\n![nwSvNm1.png](http://i.imgur.com/nwSvNm1.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-28T22:17:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2017 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Bucky9000**"}]}
