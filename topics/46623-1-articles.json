Figured I should start a stream of thoughts of where I can go with this. So, here we go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe World of Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince every character, building, plant, and item has to be drawn (and I\u0027m obsessed with details) I figure some serious world-building will be in order just so I don\u0027t go nuts. I\u0027ve been thinking about these kinds of things for this game for years since I started playing and below are the general ideas I\u0027ve come up with or adopted from others. I will stick to what Squad has said as much as I can but given the game is still in Alpha there will sadly be a lot that I have to make up (or adapt to the story) and will be proved inaccurate as time goes on. Oh well, here goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESetting:\u003C/strong\u003E There will be cities of course, a growing space program (they\u0027ve launched Kerbals, explored the moon, sent probes to other planets, but not much else yet). There are roads, farms, grocery stores, office buildings, television, radio, flat-screen monitors, basically a lot of familiar-looking things but with a few twists here and there. Tech will be a mix of Space Race, Shuttle era, and today\u0027s networked age. Tech like touchscreens, smartphones, tablets, and onward will reside with the superheroes to give them that magical edge among the population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbals:\u003C/strong\u003E I see them as curious, inventive, clumsy, and almost child-like. They are not very safety-minded and yet many are risk-averse if they clearly know the dangers. They have a \u0022good-enough\u0022 mentality in attempts to solve a problem (duct tape, band-aids, and space-tape will do for them). I see them as compulsive infomercial junkies, going nuts over As-Seen-On-TV ideas, and their garages and junkyards are full of half-working gadgets. Examples of any additional behaviors I\u0027ll probably make similar to Despicable minions, the Pit droids from star wars, Jawas, LEGO game people, Rabbids, DuckTales\u0027 Launchpad McQuack, the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, and Richard Scarry characters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBiology:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ll just say their bodies have a skeletal structure (since it looks cool in art), but it is strong and flexible like a reinforced cartilage or something. They have general amphibian or reptilian internal organs with perhaps a plant-based twist. I\u0027ll make them omnivorous though just so there\u0027s a variety of ways to express their meals in images. I will attempt to stick with the cloning idea, perhaps an unspoken understanding that their consciousness is preserved in the community and they can come back should something befall their bodies. As this would be a communal birthing, I don\u0027t see a need for Kerbals to couple to procreate. I see simply two sexes sharing genetic material with the pod-pool or something to create succeeding generations. While they look both similar and different, they are the same biologically, neither more advantageous over the other in any category. This brings up issues of immortality but as long as I treat it like it\u0027s no big deal then the story should flow ok. Even if you are immortal you will still feel pain, fear, sadness, etc. so Kerbals would try to avoid these things in conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of genders. For the purpose of the story, and to give readers characters they can identify with, I do need to establish what girl-kerbals look like. The choices presented to me I\u0027ve shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.spaceflightonline.net/images/kerbal_comic_gender_styles.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbal_comic_gender_styles.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERelationships:\u003C/strong\u003E Let\u0027s just assume that every Kerbal considers the other a family member, childhood friend, or life-long-friend, depending on where know that person in life. Now of course, since everyone is friendly to one another, that means there aren\u0027t many conflicts between them except maybe over sports teams or whose music player/computer company is better. This means \u003Cstrong\u003Eno Kerbal supervillains\u003C/strong\u003E. Now one would assume aliens then would be the next logical choice. Well I\u0027m leaning to just having alien creatures like the Kraken rarely pop up. Instead, the great enemy will be robots, AI that some zany scientist cooked up and forgot to flip it off when he went home, creating Skynet or something. And I will explain how this came about and what the first AI villain is called. This allows me to have human-shaped, animal-shaped, and space-ship shaped villains throughout the story, and little resistance to smashing them to pieces for the evil-doers they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory:\u003C/strong\u003E Who knows what they evolved from, but we\u0027ll just pick up from the Cave-kerbal era and assume their development came at the expense of long extinct creatures that my son declares were giant bug-dinosaurs. Good enough for me. I\u0027ve always wanted to draw a T-rex Beetle. After the meteor strikes on Kerbin that wiped out these monsters, the Kerbals went underground until things got better. Since emerging I\u0027d say they retained some of their \u0022dig down\u0022 tendencies like Hobbits did, but largely build above ground like we do. I\u0027d like their cities to have developed a look of both being open and yet arranged in such a way they resemble a busy, interconnected rabbit warren. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs above, their only contention among themselves is based around trivial things like sports or products. Think Apple vs. Android, Rice vs. Texas. Companies even go along these lines. Instead of political parties they have fans. Before civilized times, arguments might come to serious blows, or at least attempt to. Each side would stock up what weapons they could, but ultimately one side would do something clumsy and wipe themselves out, letting the other side win by default. And so bit by bit Kerbals settled the ways they resolve fan conflicts and today they are generally one happy planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen one day, a scientist accidentally sent a camera up into space and for the first time in their history, Kerbals saw their planet alone in the darkness. This simple change of perspective galvanized the entire planet with the goal of exploring beyond their world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Below are minimalist images I made back in 2011 as background flags for an international kerbal mission. I\u0027m sure some of you can guess which flag represents what rival company/fan-base. I will be re-tooling some of them to serve in the comics.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.spaceflightonline.net/images/kerbal_flags_sml.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbal_flags_sml.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEconomy:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ll probably have some kind of exchange going on. Budgets and resources might be talked about as a constraining factor. Don\u0027t know what it\u0027ll be with, maybe some kind of kerbal bucks or credit, or simoleons or something. There aren\u0027t any crazy greedy moguls running around. The desire for wealth doesn\u0027t drive Kerbals, sometimes it just happens, and they then after paying for food and gas will blow it all on celebrations or goofy gadgets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArt styles:\u003C/strong\u003E Kerbals are fond of circles and hexagons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuperheroes:\u003C/strong\u003E Superheroes are fiction to Kerbals too, but the rest of the setting mimics their own. As for hero origins, well what can I say; with Kerbals haphazardly experimenting with all manner of radiation, chemicals, wavelengths, explosives, and devices you\u0027re bound to have a few crop up. The catch is that it only happens to that particular Kerbal once. If they die, they lose all their powers and come back as a normal Kerbal. This means when Kerboom goes into peril, Jeb is holding his breath while he turns the page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe superheroes will be analogs. You can expect mashups and gender changes of your favorite heroes, to keep things interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStory Mood:\u003C/strong\u003E As Kerbal as possible while maintaining suspense, action, and conflict.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunicating:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027m going to do something strange with this. Since Kerbals read/write English but don\u0027t speak it, I will attempt to simulate this by only having Kerbals speak in speech bubbles with an icon or two, much like The Sims and their moods. The idea is to have you look at the icon, have your brain recognize it, but also hear the kerbals mutter it in their own language. This will get tricky at times, but it\u0027s an amusing idea for me to try. Where needed I can at least have a narrator translate in English. This is the same method I would try if I ever made flash animations or youtube videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.spaceflightonline.net/images/kerbal_speech.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbal_speech.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-28T07:00:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2013 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hayoo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded images for flags and dialgoue\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T02:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this.
