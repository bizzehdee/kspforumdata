I designed my lifter, got everything prepped and eventually got it into LKO, but my ship wiggled around so much that I was way off equatorial orbit. I tried to correct it, but ran out of everything including RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuge fail...but I still had a space station in LKO!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I sent up a ship to refuel it...huge success, this was my first time docking two ships together! I was able to get the thing two thirds of the way filled with fuel AND fully fill the RCS systems. TIME TO GO TO THE MUN!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I flew the thing to the moon, got my intercept set up and executed. But I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to make an Orbit! \u0022Ruh Roh!!! USE THE RCS!!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsed up all my RCS and managed to get into an orbit with a Periapsis of 7k and an Apo of 1.6 Million at a crazy crazy non equatorial orbit... Technically...mission accomplished...BUT NO! SEND THE MUNAR PROBE REFUELER!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaged to match orbit and Dock a refueling ship with an engineer to fix some broken solar panels (Thought you could...apparently not), but accidentally hit space bar and detached my engines... But I did refuel the RCS Systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd result, Munar Orbiter Alpha is in a stable circular orbit of 30k...but still not a totally normal equatorial orbit. totally out of RCS AND no engines, probably need 200 more dV to finish getting things perfect...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you guys think I should send ANOTHER ship to join the party? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SDEngineer","CreatedById":101148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RogalDorn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RogalDorn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaged to match orbit and Dock a refueling ship with an engineer to fix some broken solar panels (Thought you could...apparently not), but accidentally hit space bar and detached my engines... \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;ALT\u0026gt;\u002BL is your friend - always lock your staging when you don\u0027t expect to be doing any soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun story though.
