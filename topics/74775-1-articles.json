I\u0027ve seen this message several times before and never gave it much thought. But, then I started thinking; As of version .23.5, money isn\u0027t a part of the game if you don\u0027t count mods. And, looking at the terrified faces of most of the kerbals when I launch, they\u0027re aren\u0027t doing it for the enjoyment. According to the loading screen, there is a need to motivate them, however. So, how do you motivate kerbals that don\u0027t use money and obviously don\u0027t really want to be launched in a questionable, highly explosive, rocket unless you strap them in and lock the door so they can\u0027t get out. Is it a mixture of snacks and cattle prods? Or is these a kerbal version of the mafia operating behind the scenes that are providing us our victims... um... I mean... volunteers. What are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dat_Spacewaffle","CreatedById":101662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T18:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just let them play with the Kionel train set in the astronaut complex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T18:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think, kerbals spend a lot of time watching the stars and dream about going to space... just like we do... and as they seem to have nothing to care about but how to fulfill their dreams... motivation is not a real question.
