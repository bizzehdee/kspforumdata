You\u0027ve got your rocket flying below 35km or something like that. You jettison stages, equipped with parachutes that you\u0027ve verified can return the stages safely to the surface. But as the stages slide past 2.5km, they vanish, claimed by the Kraken or what have you. And your well thought-out recovery plan is turned to so much hot air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly this is unsustainable if we\u0027re gonna start charging fees for these disappearing stages.

All probe bodies and command pods will contain what we shall call a Tracking Beacon. This tracking beacon allows the game to selectively continue rendering physics for any object attached to it. Also included will be a separate radially mounted Tracking Beacon Unit, that serves the same function but doesn\u0027t allow you to control the parts. When spent stages equipped with Tracking Beacons are detached and slide past 2.5km, the game continues selectively rendering these objects all the way until the Tracking Beacon, which will draw power at a rate similar to small probes, runs out of power, the stage has splashed down, it has been recovered, or the Tracking Beacon has been deactivated (with a right-click context menu option/action group of course). This would allow a simple (methinks) solution to the Disappearing Stage problem, and finally allow us to recover and reuse those lower stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I\u0027m not a game designer, so I\u0027m not sure that selectively rendering specific parts is as easy as I think it is.

The simulation would first determine what orientation your craft is likely to fall at, and then uses that orientation for the initial parachute calculations. If the simulation determines that your reentering object is shredded, it would continue to simulate any debris that contains a parachute until it hits the ground. Your craft would then be re-oriented by the simulation to match its new likely fall angle caused by the opening of the parachutes. The \u0022full\u0022 parachute opening would work similarly. Hitting the ground would be the tough one to simulate, I think. When your craft touches down, it would, of course, simulate the effects of hitting the ground. If you land on a slope, your craft may buckle and tip over. If the craft has many parts, it could buckle under its own weight. There are a lot of variables in this situation.

The problem with setting the origin to the sun (say) is that the numbers for the distance between the sun and your ships get very, very large. As the numbers get larger and larger the room for precision gets smaller and smaller, and you start getting rounding errors. This is where the kraken came from: different parts of your ship in very slightly different positions end up with differently rounded numbers and your ship ends up being torn apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad\u0027s solution to this was elegant: make the origin of the world be the ship itself! In other words, the origin of the game\u0027s co-ordinate system actually moves with you. Since only things in a short range of the \u0022active\u0022 ship are ever undergoing physics calculations the distance to any of those things is small and there is no problem with rounding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the limitation of this is that you can\u0027t load things a long way away.

It wouldn\u0027t make sense to be able to easily use an experimental SRB on all your launches by slapping a couple parachutes on the side; if you want to use an experimental SRB (or an experimental part in general) on another mission, you should have to take special steps to ensure that it works right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the biggest issue with letting you recover dropped parts: KSP doesn\u0027t have reentry heating, or maximum aerodynamic stress, or anything like that. It\u0027s really, really easy to slap a bunch of radial parachutes on a booster, and the parachutes don\u0027t weigh a ton. 3 stock radial parachutes are enough to safely recover an ARM LFB and stock nosecone; 5 suffice for a Mainsail (with its lower impact rating). they weigh only 0.45 tons. That means that recovery becomes trivial for all but the smallest rockets (where the 0.15 tons for one parachute could actually matter). Recovering should not be easy. I\u0027d *like* to be able to reuse parts of my boosters, and it\u0027d be realistic to have that idea, but doing something like this would practically eliminate the point of designing for reusability. Budget should encourage careful design, where you actually have to think about how to recover as much as possible, and it\u0027s hard to recover everything; if you can just slap a few parachutes on and call it a day, there\u0027s zero challenge in designing for recovery, and pretty much every single ship becomes trivially fully recoverable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"palioxis1248","CreatedById":100635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T03:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually the real reason I opined for tracking beacons instead of just rendering for every booster with parachutes on or something like that is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay your 1000 part rocket undergoes rapid spontaneous unplanned disassembly at 20km.
