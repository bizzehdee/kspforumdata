Problem, I have no experience writing CFG files or any kind of code what so ever. I am wondering from everyone\u0027s point of view should I give it a try? I would love to make some new science parts and other pieces but would need help doing the writing for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T16:16:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo for it.
