There\u0027s already official servers for TF2, PUBG, dozens and dozens of games, so it\u0027s proven to be an effective platform and honestly you\u0027d have the support and help of the rest of the forum no doubt as you created the server for it.\n\nJust an idea.\n\n[@Deddly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62955-deddly/) also wow, when did you become Lead Mod?
