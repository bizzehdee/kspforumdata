I had a number of contracts active, including one to set up a station at Kerbin, another to set up a station at the Mun, and a third to set one up at Minmus. I already had some partial assets at Minmus, that, when docked, and with the addition of two more parts, gave me a nice little starter station at Minmus. The weird part is that when I assembled the station at Minmus, all three contracts completed, even though I do not have any crewable parts in orbit around either Kerbin or the Mun!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe contract was offered by \u0022Duna One\u0022, if that makes a difference.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I don\u0027t really care that the game gave me the credit for those contracts...I was just wondering if anyone else had seen the same thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-19T18:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts can be glitchy like that sometimes- I\u0027ve had a contract for landing on an asteroid complete when I docked to a space station and crewed interplanetary mission contracts complete just by going up to orbit and back down.
