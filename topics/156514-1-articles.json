The counter is now counting up to zero but in the 2 years it\u0027s been up there I\u0027ve only managed the one batch of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave I missed something or is this a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lunar Sea","CreatedById":164137,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T23:07:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting.
