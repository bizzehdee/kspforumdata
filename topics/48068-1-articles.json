Basically, you could (possibly 50 years in the future) go to a doctor and have implanted somewhere near your heart a USB drive. Of course, unless you had a memory stick implanted as well (in a place other than the heart, I\u0027d hope) you could only do one thing with it: Charge your mobile device of choice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is that it would work due to the fact that the heart is made of self-stimulating muscle that uses very small amounts of electricity to cause a spasm which beats the heart. Pacemakers are pretty much the opposite of my idea; instead of taking power from the heart, pacemakers actually help \u0022shock\u0022 the muscle to stimulate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other half of the idea: if you had this implant and charge a mobile device, and if your heart couldn\u0027t produce the required amount of energy, it would be a simple matter for the heart to produce extra energy to regain the balance. In this sense, charging a device would actually make your heart stronger as it beats faster and makes up the energy lost through charging!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is just an idea, a theory.
