We don\u0027t need to have an orbit. Tricky part is that we will attach rocket to a plane. So that, plane will take us to 10 km (30,000 feet). From then, rocket will launch itself from the plane and reach 110 km altitude. Rest is free fall (without burning hopefully).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#4d5763;font-size:14px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\nI have installed real solar system and realism overhaul mods.

enough codes until it magically appeared.\u00A0 A system that obviously scales poorly).\u00A0 Gallager later went on to \u0022write the book\u0022 on error correcting codes, where he didn\u0027t even bother to include his own code because no conceivable computer could use it.\u00A0 Much later (1990s) somebody invented the \u0022turbo codes\u0022: these were codes that could essentially achieve Shannon levels of correction and simply changed everything (the jump in performance was so high plenty of guys in the field insisted it was a hoax).\u00A0 Since they were patented, there was a certain reason to try to find other methods of achieving the same thing (since it was clearly possible).\u00A0 Eventually somebody dug up Gallager\u0027s LPDC codes that were now possible to
