In contrast, after 30 years of research, the VASIMR has only obtained about 50 percent efficiency in test stand burns of a few seconds\u2019 duration, and that is only at high specific impulse. When the specific impulse is reduced, the efficiency drops in direct proportion. This means that the VASIMR\u2019s much chanted (but always doubtful) claim that it could offer significant mission benefit by trading specific impulse for thrust is simply false. In contrast, this capability has been demonstrated by the ion-drive that propelled Dawn spacecraft on its way to an asteroid. Finally, if it is to be used in space, VASIMR will require practical high temperature superconducting magnets, which do not exist.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the claims he makes are cited.

That is not the case. Mars missions are not occurring because they are high cost and high risk. VASIMR will not change that. It only serves as the transfer vehicle propulsion system.

However, do not use this article as justification. It is outdated, it does not cite its claims, and makes assumptions that are not grounded, among other issues.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was being lazy, I did not want to have to give the math involved. VASIMR has not changed all that much in 6 years, its still heavy, it still cannot outperform lighter technology that is older than it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy personal reason, even looking at the most recent specs, VASIMR still underperforms HiPEP with regard to Thrust to weight ratio, with regard to efficiency. HiPEP is scalable from as low as you want (for example using capacitors). IN FACT if you wanted the most stable system have twice as many HiPEP as you can power and alternate their use so that they run cooler and run them at the highest possible \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, that achieves the best efficiency, per weight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReason #1 Its not about how much KW you can use, its about how much acceleration you can produce per amount of fuel and per kilowatt. The 39 days to mars justifies VASIMR for the sole reason that if you have the power to burn from LEO to Escape velocity (3212 m/s) you only need 400 more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to reach Mars, but in 100 to 150 days. So VASIMR is something you add to the craft to make it get there in 39 days once you have burned to or almost to escape velocity. The problem is that you could almost do the same with conventional power given the extra added weight of VASIMR and the power supply. But the craft is already going to have solar panels, so just plop a few lightweight HiPEP on the backside and maybe a few more panels and use waste electricity to shorten the trip time. We are talking about the difference between 20kg of thruster versus a couple of tons. Its a no brainer, go with HiPEP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReason #2 I could not care less if humans went to Mars, if you want to send some joker there to die on Mars, thats fine 100 day trip aint going to kill him half as fast as living on Mars will. VASIMR will not get them back home. My only thing is get a sample return mission going, and that sample return mission is probably going to come on a conventional ION drive system that can shuttle materials back and forth from Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReason #3\u003Cstrong\u003E is that it will not pay off\u003C/strong\u003E, as already stated you have a technology that is a fraction of the weight, you can have multiple redundancies and in the end if one breaks you flip on the next one for the cost of one VASIMR. There is no scenario were VASIMR can pay off because you have this already\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust = 2 * 0.8 * KW / 95000 \u00A0 or Thrust = 2 * 0.72 * KW /54000\u00A0 This equation is tyrannical and VASIMR does not change or alter the equation, it never can, that\u0027s that. The best VASIMR can do is get efficiency in the 80 to 90 range.\u00A0 The most you can ever get is 100% efficiency. Power comes at the expense of something, and that something we do not have. We do not have a nuclear reactor and as far as I know, NASA is not planning one. Second there is no situation were radiative cooling and the reactor is going to produce 200kw of power unless the nuclear reactor exceeds 1 Megawatt, in which case the ship needs to be able to cool 800 MW of radiative heat, this involves mass also. For HiPEP we can have a system, light weight, essentially flat, small enough to run on solar power small enough and light enough to cool itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example of this is the Cannae drive, everyone talked about how it was going to change the world being 10 time more efficient than a photon drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nT\u003Csub\u003EPhoton drive\u003C/sub\u003E = 2 * Power /3E8 =\u00A0 0.000007 N/kw versus T\u003Csub\u003Ecannae\u003C/sub\u003E = 2 * Power/3E7 = 0.00007N/KW \u0026lt;----- not changing fundementally the thrust issue with electric propulsion systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReason #4, Build to the power, and not power that needs to add mass just to cool itself. If it is not self cooling, leave it near a cooling tower on earth. The future is better solar panels, they can be lightened and they can produce more power, but they can be cooled simply by changing their angle to the sun. VASIMR is doing the exact opposite, it is building to the power we do not have in space. IF we go by current specs at 34 kw per 14tons to get a ship with 200 kw would require 100t just for solar panels, not intelligent. The only reason ever to use nuclear power in space is to travel beyond the asteroid belt, for missions to Jupiter this may be neccesary. That justifies nuclear power, but it does not justify VASIMR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLS can get beat when Space X proves itself with the heavy project, but they have to prove themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-21T05:25:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2017 05:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-21T06:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223249140\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513827064\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002282292\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mitchz95\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Mitchz95 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEr, source?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral guys from JPL, not\u00A0NASA.
