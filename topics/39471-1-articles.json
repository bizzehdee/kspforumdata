Other ones are not so easy to figure out (like Duna\u0027s, where it is when Duna is a bit ahead of Kerbin, but it is hard to see when Duna is sufficiently ahead of Kerbin). Therefore I propose that in the map view, you can click on a button to toggle arc minutes/seconds markers on the orbits, so you can launch at very precise times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
