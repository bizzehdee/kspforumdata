When I place any thruster or mono propellant device on something, say a satellite payload, the thrusters will activate outside of their designated stage and either make the payload unstable during initial flight or the Auto-correction mechanisms will go crazy resulting in loss of control of the vehicle at some point on occasion. My suggestion to fix this is to change the coding to make them be off initially requiring either a stage activation or manual activation once the user is ready to use the control device.
