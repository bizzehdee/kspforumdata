But for the life of me I can not figure out how to reel the hose back in. If I drive the rover the hose just drags behind me and Bill the engineer can not pick it up to move it or any thing. I am sure I have done this in the past, I just can not remember how to reel the hose back in so I can make a different connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T22:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s always best to ask these questions in the mod\u0027s thread - you\u0027ll get the people most interested that way.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said: For the new hose, I believe what you need to do is walk Bill to the *end* of the hose - if you get close enough to the connector, it should prompt you to allow you to pick it up.\u00A0 Then walk it back and return the connector to the reel.\u00A0 (There is a bug if the hose is at max extension - if so, knock the end of the hose closer to the reel and and you should be able to pick it up.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T22:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.
