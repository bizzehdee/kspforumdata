I\u0027ve seemed to have stumbled on something unexpected.\n\nWhat I have here are 2 identical crafts where one has its boosters centrally attached to an adapter with attachment nodes, and the other where the boosters are also attached to attachment nodes, but have been radially displaced by the offest tools.\n\n![PWhLIMR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PWhLIMR.jpg)\n\n![ozyaMRa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ozyaMRa.jpg)\n\nInitial predictions would be that the one with the centrally placed stack to travel further, faster... Or at the very least both rockets will travel the same.
