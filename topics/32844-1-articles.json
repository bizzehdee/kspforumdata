Tanks are heated up by the engine and generate their own pressure. Of course, you need tanks that can actually hold 14 bar, then, but for LOX you probably want that anyways. BP temperature at 14 bar is quite reasonable for both. Make sure you have relief valves, though, or you might have serious problems. And I hope you are good with thermodynamics. This thing is not easy to design to make sure it can maintain the pressure at correct flow rates nor exceed the maximum pressure. Then again, if you don\u0027t know how to do these things, you probably shouldn\u0027t be building a liquid fuel engine either. These things tend to explode for very similar reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more classical solution is a centrifugal pump, but these things don\u0027t scale down very well. Also, heavy, pressurized tank is a much greater disadvantage for a large rocket. So pumps make sense there. For a small rocket, it\u0027s more trouble than it is worth, generally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do go with pressurized fuel, you might also consider switching over to liquid propane. The main reason Kerosene was used in V2, etc., is because it is liquid at ambient pressure. You don\u0027t need that feature with pressurized tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do end up actually building this thing, make sure you have a proper bunker for testing and that you can fire it up and kill the fuel flow remotely. If you actually get the sustained burn, the main failure mode for a rocket is a catastrophic explosion. And liquid rocket means metal parts that become shrapnel. This means you can\u0027t be just standing a few meters away or have a bit of plywood in between. That won\u0027t protect you. If you have nothing you can use as a proper bunker, at very least, dig out a ditch and make sure there is no line of sight from the engine to you, any other person, any houses, etc. If you need to watch it, get a web cam set up nearby, or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jokurr","CreatedById":57496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T04:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found the following through google:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cientificosaficionados.com/libros/cohetes.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.cientificosaficionados.com/libros/cohetes.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere they use gaseous nitrogen to pressurize the fuel tank, there is a diagram on page 41.

That\u0027s why the airplane\u0027s frame is built of aluminum, but engines aren\u0027t. Alloys are always easier to melt than any component as well, so that makes it even worse. Personally, I\u0027d go with steel combustion chamber and a carbon nozzle. (You can buy a carbon crucible and grind it to the right shape. You can find these for under $10 around here.) Failing that, make everything out of steel. It will still burn through, but hopefully you\u0027ll have time to run the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere are you getting the 1.5 ratio from? Are you by any chance using the molar ratio here? Kerosene is pretty close to a (-CH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E-)\u003Csub\u003En\u003C/sub\u003E, which does burn with oxygen at 2:3 ratio.

So by volume, you are looking at something closer to 18:42. Still more than 2x the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might be wrong here, though. The above numbers come from stoichiometry. It is possible that it is not optimal for a rocket engine. (Though, I can\u0027t think why it would be so.) Do you have a source for the 1.5 ratio? Other ratios will burn cooler, but it will also give you a lower I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. In other words, you\u0027ll waste more fuel to get the same thrust.
