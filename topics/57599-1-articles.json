I\u0027ve been playing quite a lot for the last 2 months or so and I\u0027ve found myself quite bored by the rocket command modules/pods. The single-passenger one isn\u0027t TOO bad but the 3 person module/pod is an eyesore to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen the Dragon 2 replica as well as the Orion replica but they seem to have many unattached parts. (They do both look amazing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking for additional well designed modules/pods/capsules or whatever. Any kick in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
