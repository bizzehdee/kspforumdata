Does anybody have any sort of idea about how one might go about doing that? One thing I thought about was determining the force exerted by a Kerbal Astronaut when he jumps, and then I could land on the various celestial bodies and time the amount of time it takes a karbal to reach apoapsis and retern to the body. I\u0027m not sure that would work or even be accurate enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T06:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d do it by calculating the mass of the celestial body and then calculating the surface gravity.

Then just use F = GM/(r^2) to find gravity at some r. If you want to know the surface gravity you can again use the data from your orbiting object, just subtract the value of r printed on the screen from the value of r from the centre of the body that you calculated, this should give you the radius of the body, which you then chuck into F = GM/(r^2) to get surface gravity. (I hope that makes sense xD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game will print out a value of velocity for your orbit, I assume to find the period, you could land one object on the planet to use as a stationary reference point, then time how long it takes for your orbiting craft to make one circuit back over the object (but the error would be on the order of minutes most likely). I\u0027m not sure how badly the errors would compound through the calculation, really depends on how accurately you can get your orbital period timing, hopefully the overall result wont be more than 10-20km out for the body radius of something the size of kerbin.
