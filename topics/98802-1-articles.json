It has no permanent storage (though you can plug it into a tape recorder and pray that it will be able to read that back properly in the future), and with the additional memory module I think she has 16kb of RAM. For a monitor, you find a very old black and white TV and hook it up (have fun doing this with a TV made after 1990. Thing uses a connection older than coax). We have a couple manuals for it that include some programs you can enter into it, including a fair few games (this wasn\u0027t the dark ages, computers could be fun too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, to really hit close to home for me though, I have to think of the PC my parents got when I was in grade 3 I think.I actually found a youtube video with what looks like the same computer, and seems to be fairly similar. Ours was probably 60mb RAM, 350 MHz processor, floppy and zip drive, 10GB HDD, no GPU. I remember that at the time, it was a pretyt fast machine, much better than the school computers or anything my friends had. I also remember how massive that 10GB and later 40GB HDD was, and now I think about how my current PC with 12 GB of RAM could have loaded the entire HDD of that computer into memory in addition to windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we used that computer until 2002 when I finally got my own, much better, computer with a top end AMD excalibur card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chain of computers for me is surprisingly short. I used the 2002 PC for...well it was supplemented with a second hand laptop in 2005. The laptop was not stronger than the PC. At some point in there the PC fried it\u0027s GPU randomly, and got a new one. I got a new laptop 2007, and it was marginally more powerful than the PC and took over as my main computer. I guess I used that for 3 years until I got an HP h8-1011 in 2010, and basically at the start of 2015 I finished most of my upgrades into the lovely computer I have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not that many jumps. Discounting the first laptop because it was barely an upgrade, I\u0027ve used only 5 computers counting the one I have now (and the upgrade as a new machine, since it basically is). In the span of 5 computers, I\u0027ve gone from the specs I listed above to a computer with a quad 3.5 GHz processor, 12 GB RAM, 4.25 TB of permanent storage, and a GPU capable of 2.7 TFLOPS (single precision).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I could take this machine back to 1998, it would be beyond a supercomputer. My younger self wouldn\u0027t have been able to comprehend how mind numbingly powerful this machine is vs the one my family had, or what I could possibly be doing with it that would require such power. I mean, the computer back then used less electricity than a 60W light bulb, and the one sitting under my desk now will draw probably 500W if you ask it nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other one I think about is the internet. Now, the internet existed before it was born, but it didn\u0027t become mainstream until the late 90\u0027s, at least, not relevant to my life until then. I would obviously have a slightly different perspective on the development of the internet if I had been an adult during that time instead of in elementry, but instead I get to honestly remember a time before the internet mattered. I think that\u0027s kind of cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother one to think about. They make Mini SD cards that are about the size of my thumbnail in at least 32GB sizes off the top of my head, and I think 64 by now. And the phone in my pocket has more power than at least my first computer, and my tablet has more processing power than my 2002 PC.
