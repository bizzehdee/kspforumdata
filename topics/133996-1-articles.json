Strange, because the maneuver arrow is pointing in the correct direction so the SAS should know which direction to apply torque in!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- It keeps accelerating towards the target direction, overshoots it, then comes back, overshoots again, etc... This, too, should be easy to fix. You know how much torque the reaction wheels can produce. When the rotational speed and angular distance to target are such that max torque would slow it down just in time to come to rest at the target angle, stop accelerating and start decelerating. If angular distance is delta, rotational speed is omega, and max\u00A0angular acceleration is alpha, then you should start decelerating when delta \u0026lt; 1/2 omega^2/alpha. Maybe start at a slightly larger delta and calculate alpha from delta and omega to avoid missing the target due to rounding errors.\u00A0If you\u0027re not directly on course to the target direction, split up the angular velocity in a component towards the target and a perpendicular component and give each a \u0022budget\u0022 of alpha/sqrt(2). When the deviation is small (both delta and omega), use only a small alpha but increase it when necessary due to aerodynamic forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- It uses a lot of electricity since it\u0027s constantly applying large correcting inputs while chasing the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike some people indicated, MechJeb has a much better SAS but it\u0027s also quite a bit slower.
