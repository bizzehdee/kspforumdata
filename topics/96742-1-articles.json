The spacecraft, dubbed the Chang\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2e 5, will next perform a soft landing on the surface of the moon. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mission is to collect four pounds of rock and soil samples before returning to Earth.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lunar orbiter that recently entered orbit is the carrier vehicle for the test of the return capsule that was flown a few months ago. It\u0027s called Chang\u0027e 5-T1 or CE-5-T1 (bit of an ugly name), and has no capability of landing.

The moon is \u0022rich\u0022 in He-3 only in comparison to the Earth, which has almost none due to its magnetic field and atmosphere blocking the accumulation of it. The actual resource density is still extremely small. It is thought to be between 1 and 50 parts per billion, and only in the uppermost layer (digging deeper will actually decrease the concentration). To put this into perspective: even if you had a hypothetical 100% extraction efficiency, you would have to grind through a minimum of 20,000 metric tons of lunar surface regolith in order to produce one single kilogram of helium-3. And that\u0027s a best case scenario. In the worst case, you might need a literal million tons of regolith per kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Helium-3 fusion doesn\u0027t exist yet. Even if you had a moon mining program producing an arbitrary amount of helium-3, it wouldn\u0027t matter because there is no fusion reactor that can consume it. And helium-3 fusion isn\u0027t around the corner either... even simple hydrogen fusion hasn\u0027t yet been made workable. The best that humany has been able to achieve was a power factor of 0.7 - that is, a test reactor briefly generated up to 70% of the energy needed to keep itself alive. To run itself with no net power loss, a fusion reactor needs a power factor of 1... and to produce electricity at prices per kWh competitive with coal and fission power plants, it would need a power factor greater than 20 (scientist\u0027s estimate, no such powerplant exists to provide actual pricing data). To be the purported \u0022free energy for everyone\u0022, it would need a power factor of well over 100, running constantly for decades. We were able to do 0.7 that lasted for a few seconds, after 50 years of research. Yeah, it\u0027s not going to happen anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Helium-3 can be artificially produced through tritium decay, and tritium can be artificially produced in fission reactors. In fact, helium-3 and tritium are routinely vented from naval reactors to get rid of them. Stationary fission power plants sell these products. They are available only in small quantities, but they\u0027re large enough for research purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) It costs less to buy synthetic helium-3 from a fission reactor than it would cost to create a space program, develop lunar travel and landing capapbility, develop lunar mining infrastructure and grind dozens of thousands of tons of lunar surface regolith for a handful of helium-3. There is no profit in helium-3 mining until there is a demand on Earth that exceeds the artificial helium-3 production capabilities of our fission reactors to such a degree that customers are willing to pay the markup for lunar-mined goods. This demand does not exist (see 2), and even if it existed, it would drive the necessary power factor required of fusion powerplants to be price-competitive with coal even higher than it already is expected to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an alternative, it is possible that helium-3 may be produced as a side product of other moon mining activities, for which there are potential business cases. But it\u0027s highly dependant on what kind of resources are found where. If you dig down deep for rare earth metals, you\u0027re not going to find much helium-3, because it exists only in surface regolith. If you mine permanently shadowed polar craters for water ice, you\u0027re not going to find much helium-3 because it is deposited by solar wind, and permanently shadowed areas don\u0027t get solar wind by definition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) China\u0027s government is not concerned with ending the world\u0027s energy problems. China\u0027s government is concerned with staying in power and improving China\u0027s national might. If it wasn\u0027t, it wouldn\u0027t be a totalitarian, single-party dictatorship police state that is known worldwide for the extreme lengths it goes to lie to and suppress its own citizens. It is not realistic to expect altruism without a revolution happening first (and this is highly unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T11:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@NovaSilisko The Chang\u0027e T-1 used a free return trajectory, i think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Streetwind What \u0022lie and suppress citizens\u0022?
