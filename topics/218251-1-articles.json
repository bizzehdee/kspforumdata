This dynamic is crewed space temperature, and with it comes the elephant in the room: Radiators in KSP don\u0027t do the primary thing that we the players (not the devs) expect of them... provide the \u0022EC\u0022 in \u0022ECLSS\u0022 (\u003Cstrong\u003EEnvironmental Control\u003C/strong\u003E and Life Support System for those who don\u0027t know the acronym).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy proposal is that, rather than have kerbals require something that\u0027s constantly threatening to run out (food or ElectricCharge) have the kerbals require to avoid something filling up (an \u003Cb\u003EEH: Enviro-Hostility\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0gauge). The layout of this life support dynamic is then:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Basic) Conditions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJust like with thermal mass, each part that holds crew has a capacity for heat (concerning life support only) and the rate it collects heat is determined by the part\u0027s volume and the number of occupied seats.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEach kerbal produces heat and is a danger to itself on EVA and in an environment which doesn\u0027t provide convective cooling and whose ambient temperature is outside of an ideal, tolerable range.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHeat absorption through insolation is a core issue\u00A0and is part of why the ISS has its radiators. If a vessel is under some measurable sun exposure in vacuum, it should produce some E-H just by existing, therefore, it should need ECLSS. Technically, this feature already exists in stock KSP but Kerbin would need to orbit lower than Moho for this to work properly so maybe this bit can be left out entirely, saving on some complexity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEquilibrium in this context is defined as whether the current internal temperature of a kerbal or crewed part is within or very near a given ideal temperature range such as 289 ~ 300 K. The more that the part or kerbal deviates from this equilibrium range is the faster that the E-H gauge fills\u00A0(it\u0027s like a timer, not a resource holder) and if it fills completely, kerbals die, even inside the part.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRadiators can opt in as protections against positive E-H (Overheat), but only the white, low temperature ones should as they are meant to be used for ECLSS. The gray metal and black Graphene high temp ones are meant to be used with things that normally run super hot and should not opt in as ECLSS parts. This keeps the white radiators fully relevant on a vessel that has heavy smelters or atomic devices on it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOptionally, the actual heat of a part doesn\u0027t always need to be respected (as to avoid disastrous interference by the timewarp heat bug) but a form of \u0022virtual heat\u0022 alone could be respected. Maintaining equilibrium then comes down to just having enough compatible radiators to offset the total E-H produced by kerbals and resource converters.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Advanced) Conditions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEnviro-Hostility goes both ways. Negative E-H (Overcool) of a part or kerbal can arise from a ship or kerbal: Being far enough from a star that it gets 0 insolation; Orbiting\u00A0in the shadow of a planet; Being landed or splashed under a frigid\u00A0atmosphere.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdjacent crewed parts (see: Connected Living Spaces) can serve as buffers to one another and slow the increase of E-H.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is only one bar for E-H and its value is always positive. The measure of hostility is only the effect of how far the ambient temp deviates from the ideal temp and this measure only needs to have positive numbers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParts that have resource converters in them can also produce E-H as an effect of their modules running (such as the LS recyclers in MKS\u0027 habitation parts).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome parts can opt in as heat producers and protections against negative E-H. Some may find plenty value in the idea of the threat of freezing death in their Mars/Duna base.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn summary, the idea of this life support is that there is an environmental hostility gauge whose fill rate depends on how much the environment temperature differs from the ideal temperature of a kerbal. Some but not all radiators are ECLSS compatible and allow for minimizing this differential. While kerbals have a melting point of a whopping 800 K, death by overheating doesn\u0027t wait for that temperature. (If kerbals are anything like humans they would die at just under 400 K.) The ideal temperature range could always be configurable so users of Deadly ReEntry could tighten this as they need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-06T19:09:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2023 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JadeOfMaar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-06T19:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting idea.
