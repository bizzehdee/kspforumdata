I\u0027ve watched several youtube movies and still I\u0027m not getting how the heck I intercept another object in orbit of kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still in the early stages of research and made an unmanned satellite, with a jr science lab.

Basic concept is first getting an intercept with your target. It sounds like you already know this and so i\u0027ll leave that step out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step is, to reduce your velocity relative to the target. On the navball, it will change automatically to Target 230m/s from orbit 2300 m/s or whatever it happens to be. You can change this manually by clicking on this part of the nav ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming u have a good intercept, when u get within a good distance that u feel confident you can decelerate fast enough, change direction so your facing the marker that is a circle with a cross through it, yellow one. This is so you decrease your relative velocity towards the target to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter it becomes 0, your distance should change minimally. At this point, u want to face in the direction of the target, I think its the purple/pink marker with the circle. Might be wrong. Basically u want to point yourself towards your target. Then increase your velocity. This will decrease the gap between you and the target. You may want to slow down as you get close, so u don\u0027t crash into it. It helps if you have a good intercept with a close distance and your both traveling in the same rotational direction. It is possible if your a good pilot to do it from other ways, just be harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is basically what you do. After you have a successful intercept point with the target from those manouver nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have trouble getting an intercept, one method is to adjust your alighment with your target to 0 degrees, the two green markers on your orbit, like arrows. Then increase your velocity so your orbit loops round and intercepts your targets orbit.

Or you can manage it without the intermediate stop - you will find you can trim the position of your retrograde vector overtop theirs as you approach with off-angled thrusts. It\u0027s a bit difficult to describe, but basically any off-angled thrusts you do will \u0027push\u0027 the retograde vector, so you can use that to fine tune your approach.

YOUR orbit should now be elliptical... with its periapsis (or apoapsis from a higher orbit) at your original orbit\u0027s altitude and the apoapsis (or periapsis from a higher orbit) at the target orbit\u0027s altitude... That point where the two orbits meet is where you want to rendezvous with your target.. but since you can\u0027t just floor the accelerator like you would on earth (since changing speed = changing orbit), you must time when you do your burn so that when those two orbits meet, the target is in exactly the right position NOW to meet your craft when you get to apoapsis (your rendezvous point) at the exact other half of the orbit you are on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point to consider is that both your orbit and the target\u0027s orbit must have exactly the same inclination. That is easy to determine in KSP since once you mark a target it shows the inclination difference (they show up as two dart markers on your orbit after you\u0027ve selected a target.. or one if the target is on an escape trajectory.. like an asteroid).. and you can use maneuver nodes to adjust that. This is important because if the orbits DON\u0027T have the same inclination, then there are only TWO points your orbit where it will cross the other orbit\u0027s path (when looking at them side on).. You want those suckers to be aligned at ALL points so that when you adjust your orbit you have the minimum distance between your apoapsis and the target orbit, no matter where your maneuver node is placed in your own orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point to keep in mind is that as much as possible both orbits should be as circular as you can make them (apoapsis ~= periapsis)... that is important for what comes below..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the 2nd point of Hohmann transfers. Its not just the touching orbits.. its waiting until the target is just in the correct position in its own orbit so that given its speed and YOUR speed you both meet when the orbits meet. If you are below your target (in altitude), then generally you\u0027ll be behind your target when starting your burn (since you are currently going FASTER than your target). Planning Hohmann\u0027s is easy if both orbits are fully circular.. wait until your target is up orbit of you if you are lower (i.e faster).. back orbit of you if you are higher (i.e. slower).. then lay a maneuver point a bit ahead of your craft and adjust the orbit until its apoapsis (if you are lower) or periapsis (if you are higher) just touches the other one.. arrows should appear showing the target\u0027s and your relative position at the point the orbits meet (as well as their distance at rendezvous.. you must hover over the arrows to see this). Now slide the maneuver node around until you\u0027ve minimized the rendezvous distance (this is where its important to have circular orbits.. if you DON\u0027T, then you must adjust the apoapsis/periapsis as you drag the node around..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve mastered this doing circular orbits.. you will have a basic understanding of orbital intercept mechanics for interplanetary travel.. since those are just hohmann transfers done over months rather than minutes. Further.. once you get to an intuitive understanding of all this.. you\u0027ll understand how to match orbits under less than ideal circumstances (i.e. one or both orbits are non circular).. which is important for doing things like asteroid intercepts or intercepting objects in elliptical orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some video explanations of this.. as well as one that uses pictures taken at points in the process.. but its not the pictures that are important.. its the concepts.. if you have more questions.. ask..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-23T22:37:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2014 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by weezl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T21:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022weezl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022weezl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince you wish to rendezvous.. you can just point at your target and fire your booster.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s singularly bad advice.

If your orbit is intersecting your target\u0027s orbit more than once, you\u0027ll get the purple and orange markers, if not, you\u0027ll only get purple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you will want to plan a Hohmann transfer so that one set of markers comes very close to one another. That means your closest approach distance is short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is actually pretty easy to do. Suppose your target is in a 200 km orbit, and you are in a 100 km orbit. Now plan a maneuver node, and simply drag prograde until your projected orbit just intersects your target\u0027s orbit. The purple and orange markers should appear. (*) Now grab the maneuver node by its central ring, and drag it along your current orbit, until one set of markers gets really close (it doesn\u0027t matter which one.) Hover over them to see the actual projected approach distance. The closer it gets to zero, the better. Then execute that maneuver.

RV is very hard at first, but once you crack it you\u0027ll find it gets easier and easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first learned when I had Jeb stuck in EVA orbit around the Mun. I sent a rescue craft, got it into a similar orbit, and then spent hours (literally) tweaking at maneuver nodes, making tiny burns. Eventually I got the hang of it, in the process learning a couple of key principles, and I\u0027ve been able to do it ever since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I\u0027m not against MechJeb at all; I use it all the time.

I\u0027m also quite critical of how MJ makes RVs.

I think the best thing is to get into a very similar orbit, then tweak it so it\u0027s either slightly higher or slightly lower than your target. If the target is less than half an orbit ahead of you, you want to be at a slightly lower altitude, so you\u0027ll circle the planet faster and catch it up. If it\u0027s less than half an orbit behind you, you want to be slightly higher altitude, so it circles faster and catches up with you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s easiest if you just make the orbits slightly different. Maybe just 5km or 10km difference in altitude, instead of burning out to a much higher orbit and then trying to Hohmann your way back in to the target. That works fine, and is much quicker (in terms of in game time), but it\u0027s more complicated. Admittedly, what I am suggesting is basically a mini-Hohmann, but you don\u0027t need to think of it like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have a similar orbit, but a slightly different altitude, just time warp until you\u0027re close to the target (ie close behind or in front of it, don\u0027t keep warping until you are exactly above or below it, you want to make your correction burn before that point). This warping might take ages (many orbits, possibly many days) but what\u0027s the hurry? If your altitude prevents you from time warping quickly, then just go to the VAB, put a lander can on the launch pad (just a can, it\u0027s not going anywhere). Then switch to map, where you\u0027ll be able to see your two ships in orbit, and now you\u0027re on the ground you\u0027ll be able to time warp very very quickly, and days or even weeks can pass in no time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, once you do this, you\u0027ll have a close encounter (say 20km or less). You can then very gently burn prograde (if you\u0027re at a lower altitude) or retro (if you\u0027re higher) so your orbit meets that of your target somewhere on the other side of the planet. This will be a very small burn, so be extra gentle with it. Once done, warp to just before the point where your orbits meet (map will show it as the closest approach), and it\u0027s time to start using the navball with the target marker to make your very small corrections, to perfectly align your orbits, and to move very close. That\u0027s a separate skill, which people here can also help you with, but the first challenge is to get the two ships close to each other, on a very similar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orangewarning","CreatedById":113062,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T11:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t give up!!! watch scott manleys tutorial, it helps you to know what to watch out for.
