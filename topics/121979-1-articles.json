By manipulating the maneuver node, you should be able to place your periapsis and apoapsis right on top of the targets periapsis and apoapsis. Make sure the ascent and descent nodes are zeroed as well, and make the burn when you reach the maneuver node.

But this is combated with the ability, even necessity, of right clicking and selecting the target docking port as the target, not just the target vessel. This makes is so when you point at the target in the navball, you are pointing directly at the docking port.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E------------\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor some reason I can\u0027t turn of Italicized and I don\u0027t want to retype it =P.
