It seems that Russia barely touches solid fuel at all. Is there a reason for this, or is this just one of the characteristics of two space programs developing independently?"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T01:25:41Z","Content":"You made a correct observation, that Russia primarily use liquid for everything, however the reasons are various and complex.\n\nIt comes down to difficultys in the technology at the time and pseudo-cultural/historical views of scientists and engineers who, back then and still do, prefer to work with liquid rockets.

Although the basic design is simple, designing the internal cavities of a solid booster is a complex business. The solid fuel grain has to be custom-shaped so that the combustion follows a specific burn profile depending on the launch requirements.\n\n![PzDnY.gif](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PzDnY.gif)\n\nAs you can see, those grain shapes aren\u0027t exactly intuitive, and it took lots of trial and error to figure them out. This means that it was much harder to repurpose a solid booster for different missions. Both the US and Soviet space program were originally designed with repurposed ICBMs, and those early ICBMs were all liquid-based, because it gave better control of the flight profile, which meant greater precision.\n\nLater on, both nations switched to solid ICBMs, because they can be launched instantly, whereas the old liquid ICBMs required a long fueling and preparation time before being launched."}]}
