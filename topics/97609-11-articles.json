If 1.0 is on-par with the 2 previous releases, it would be good enough for the Kommunity, but not potential buyers who are unfamiliar with the quality of early access releases. That would lead to reveiws such as, \u0022I have waited for the full release of this game for more than a year. I was quite dissapointed with the quality of this game, as it does not feel complete, the art assets are not uniform, the career mode is somewhat hard to understand and it crashes often on my computer.\u0022 There have probably been reviews like this, but Squad has had the \u0027Early Access\u0027 shield to deflect these critcisms by saying that things will be fixed in the next update. Potential buyers would be turned off, thinking (incorrectly) that this is something of a final update.

IMO, both would be good. On the overhaul side, if clouds will be added, it would be best to do clouds and Planet overhaul at the same time, mods that have been made for EVE and TextureReplacer are examples of overhauls. On the new Planet(s) side, GP2 is the most requested planet, and there are 10\u002B mod packs for the Kopernicus mod, and most of them have a Gas Giant beyond Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStock Revamp.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the integration of Porkjet\u0027s excellent space plane parts, the other parts look dated and low quality.

NecroBones has also created a texture replacement for stock tanks that makes them look much better. The assets issue is not becoming of a game entering 1.0, and I suggest that all of the parts be remade by hiring a skilled modder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERealism.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most hotly debated topic, realism appears to be getting addressed with the Aero overhaul. However there are many other Realism features that have been requested, though the top ones are re-entry heating, ISP scaling, and some sort of antenna/communication overhaul. Re-entry heating has been on the to-do list for a while and will hopefully be included in the next update alongside the now atmos. Antenna/Comms are less popular, but something along the lines of AntennaRange or RemoteTech, the latter being a lite version.

The 2nd, a test release using Unity 5 Beta. IMO, GP2 can wait until 1.1\u002B but the all the assets need an overhaul.

Yes, Squad stated more content will be added after the release of 1.0, but what if reviewers shred apart the game after release because of (many) bugs and perhaps an unpolished state of KSP?
