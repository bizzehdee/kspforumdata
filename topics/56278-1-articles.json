The only way you can make this work with stock KSP is to keep the probe as the active ship all the way down until it is firmly landed on the ground. Switching away from it at any time below the threshold altitude will result in it being deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other side of it is that yes, parachutes won\u0027t work on anything other than active ships (i.e. the current active ship and any other ships within 2.5km of it).
