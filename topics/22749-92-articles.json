I know I was a little confused for a while myself. Basically what it does is allow you to create a .cfg file you can list parts in the game and change their values without actually messing with the original part. The main reason modders like it, is you can have multiple mods change things on the same part and none of them will conflict unless 2 or more mods change the same value... like electric charge in the Mk2 command pod or such. The great thing about it is, if you don\u0027t like the change a mod made, you can simply delete the .cfg file the modder had made. Otherwise, if the modder changed the actual part, then your left trying to find the part in your back up folder... assuming you made one. \u003Cp\u003EAs far as the nuts and bolts of how it works, you basically call up the part you want to change, then list the property you want to change or add, then list the value. I good example would be johnsonwax\u0027s link on post #458. I hope this helps to clear things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDat comment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zakkpaz","CreatedById":62361,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T03:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asmi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022asmi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy not?
