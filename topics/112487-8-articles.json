The mere fact that science abandoned Celsius for Kelvin argues against that. Metric spread because of the role of strong central governments and their desire to modernize and make a statement while doing it. India for instance, went metric as a way of distancing itself from Britain after independence, most countries went metric for reasons that had nothing to do with the usefulness of the system. There\u0027s a great book called \u0022Measuring America\u0022 by Andros Linkslater that deals with the history of measurement in general and the U.S. history in particular. It also contains a concise history of all the systems that went into the U.S. system, including the metric system. It\u0027s a revealing book, and an excellent read if you\u0027re interested in the subject, doubly so if you\u0027re also interested in land, which is what measurement standardization was largely about in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T07:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YNM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022YNM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuess that\u0027s due to the language used (I mean June 6 is easier than 6th of June) ?
