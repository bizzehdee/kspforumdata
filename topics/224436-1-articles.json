This one\u0027s spicier. I just randomly came across an article effectively repeating RocketStar\u0027s press release, and I kind of wanted to take this one apart a little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get the tl;dr out of the way, the claim is that they are boosting their 1U pulsed plasma drive with fusion to give it an extra kick \u0022for free\u0022. How much of a kick isn\u0027t really specified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no point of going over an article, so lets just go to the source with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://rocketstar.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FireStar-Discovery-Release_FINAL-1.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERocketStar\u0027s Press Release\u003C/a\u003E. Note that they are referencing real experiments that have confirmed the reaction and talk about the upcoming flights of their\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecurrent\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0FireStar drive, but don\u0027t say much about the fusion results beyond detection of gamma and alpha radiation. Which is cool in itself, but doesn\u0027t say much for the practical side of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do specifically clarify in the press release that the \u0022fusion boosted\u0022 really means \u0022fusion-triggered-fission-boosted,\u0022 which is something that needs to be taken apart a bit. Specifically, the claim is that by introducing boron to the water, which is used as main propellant, they are getting boron-proton fusion, which results in an unstable state of carbon, which decays to alpha particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe release does not specify the isotopes used, but boron does come in\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003EB and\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB, with the latter being more abundant and more interesting of the two. The process\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB \u002B p -\u0026gt;\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC is of interest here. As we all, know,\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC is stable, however, there is a rather well known \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-12#Hoyle_state\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHoyle State\u003C/a\u003E of carbon which isn\u0027t. The natural way in which Hoyle State comes up is when stars burn helium in their cores. The process involves two\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003EHe nuclei coming together to form a highly unstable\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003EBe nucleus, which has just enough time to collide with a third\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003EHe nucleus to form the Hoyle State of\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC. The latter is highly unstable, and is almost like the 3 alpha particles bouncing around in a common strong force potential than a real nucleus. Consequently, most of the time it decays back to three alpha particles, and the star has to try again. Occasionally, however, the\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC\u003Csup\u003E**\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0state emits a gamma, decays to a lower energy\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0state and finally to ground state\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC. The Hoyle State has 7.7MeV above carbon\u0027s ground state, which is a lot. The full proton-proton cycle is about 24MeV. So we\u0027re talking a good fraction of typical nuclear energies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn paper, this works. The total binding energy of\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB is 76.21MeV and ground state\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003EC is 92.15MeV. That gives\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB \u002B p plenty of energy to form Hoyle State, so long as protons are hot enough to overcome the repulsion barrier. It is much lower for proton-proton or even D-T fusion, since\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB has the charge much more distributed through the larger nucleus, but I don\u0027t really have any numbers to attach to it at this time. I\u0027ll try to find either something from the cited SBIR experiments or other publications at a later point to try and get a back-of-the-envelope estimate for how much fusion/fission we are actually expecting in a chamber of a plasma drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we have that\u0027s probably pretty reliable are the specs of the current generation FireStar M 1.4, which does not involve any fusion/fission processes. Just a conventional pulsed plasma propulsion unit, utilizing water, ionizing arc, and an accelerator cavity. Since this is a commercial product, and validation experiments are apparently available under the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E, I have no reason to suspect them from being far off.

If the protons are accelerated by the field of the same strength, they can be potentially traveling about twice as fast, resulting in effective plasma temperatures of up to low mega-Kelvins on collisions. That feels like ballpark reasonable for what it\u0027d take for\u00A0\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB \u002B p fusion to take place. But again, I don\u0027t have good estimates for that at this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the net, interesting. I want to see the numbers attached to the claimed efficiency boost. Also, the fact that they\u0027re calling it a fusion rocket when it\u0027s really more of a fission rocket feels a little scummy, but maybe they were trying to not scare people with neutron radiation associated with fission? This is, if real, an aneutronic process, so it would be reasonably safe for the applications for which this is meant. Either way, a real nuclear-boosted drive that\u0027s commercially available is really exciting, even if the performance benefits are going to be marginal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, even the base model, without fusion/fission is a really nifty example of how far the commercial plasma propulsion has gone. A 1U propulsion unit that can provide a 3U sat with 4.6km/s of delta-V? Yeah, that\u0027s not bad. With the right planning, you can take your 3U from LEO all the way to Mars utilizing a boost from Luna.
