These \u0022thingies\u0022 are called *flanges,* and they make the beam stiff and strong in bending in the \u0022tall\u0022 (for lack of a better word) direction. The center part of the cross section (the *web)* carries shear loads and keeps the flanges separated. They\u0027re extremely important, and without them your beam would, at best, crumple like a piece of cardboard under load. And, as stated, they\u0027d cease to be \u0022I\u0022-beams.\n\nOkay, now that that structural endineering primer is over, the game doesn\u0027t go into that kind of detail in the loads simulation.
