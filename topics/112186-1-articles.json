It had some nice hotspots, lower gravity to get up and down from the surface etc. It all works fairly well, except I find the return trip annoying. Due to the inclined orbit of Minmus, my return orbit of Kerbin is usually (always) crazy inclined as well. I can get cirularized around Kerbin and then fix it, but that seems the most wasteful in terms of dV. I can fix a lot of it at Pe, but that generally requires a full orbit, which adds many days to the operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T17:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFix your inclination at apoapsis after leaving Minmus, it may take a bit longer before the right node is open, but it should be cheaper then doing it at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T17:58:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESet up a way station to match Minmus orbit, but at 0* inclination- will want it to be in front or behind in the orbit to avoid Minmus\u0027 SOI at the AN \u0026amp; DN.

That gives you ascending/descending nodes, which you can then use for making course decisions as commented below. (Another alternative is to park a little satellite in an equatorial orbit and use that as your target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1: Be equatorial starting at Minmus launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to do it: Wait until Minmus is at either the ascending or descending node of its orbit with respect to Kerbin\u0027s equator (i.e. where the plane of its orbit crosses the Mun\u0027s). Then launch directly into a Kerbin-equatorial orbit from Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Advantage: Minimum dV requirements. Only have to make one burn. Time-efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Disadvantage: Have to wait until Minmus is at AN or DN, which could be days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2: Mid-course correction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to do it: Just go ahead and launch from Minmus at any time. Your launch can include some normal/antinormal component at launch time to reduce your inclination relative to Kerbin\u0027s equator, but unless you happen to be at Minmus\u0027 ascending/descending nodes (see above), you won\u0027t be able to eliminate all of it. Set a maneuver node to make your target the Mun. At some point on your inbound journey to Kerbin, you\u0027ll pass through either ascending or descending node, hopefully when you\u0027re still very high above Kerbin. Set a maneuver node there to reduce your inclination to zero; as long as you\u0027re high up, this won\u0027t be a lot of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Advantage: Can launch whenever you want. Time-efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Disadvantage: More fiddly (have to do two burns). Not always super helpful for dV, depending where in its orbit Minmus is at launch time (e.g. if your AN/DN node on Kerbin approach is at low altitude, would be expensive to make that burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption #3: this is option #2 \u002B patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to do it: Basically, do your burn, make your initial periapsis pass past Kerbin while still inclined, coast up to a high altitude and make an inclination-correcting burn at your ascending/descending node to set inclination to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Advantage: All of #2\u0027s advantages, minus the \u0022can be expensive\u0022 disadvantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Disadvantage: Needs patience, involves doing an extra orbital loop and therefore adds days to the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice, I generally find that I go with #2, unless Minmus\u0027 placement at the time I happen to want to launch is especially lucky (in which case I go with #1) or especially unlucky (in which case I go with #3).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T18:02:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to wait until the Minmus orbit crosses Kerbin equatorial plane, then you are best off doing a mid-course plane change maneuver.

If you depart Minmus along a trajectory that is parallel to the equatorial plane, your AN and DN will be very close to Kerbin. Instead, when you depart Minmus, you must incline your trajectory so that you cross Kerbin\u0027s equatorial plane when you are still far from Kerbin. If Minmus is below Kerbin\u0027s equatorial plane when you depart, you should leave Minmus orbit along an inclined trajectory that will take you northward.
