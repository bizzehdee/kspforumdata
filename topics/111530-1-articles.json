It will properly use fuel no matter which direction I try to translate but only pressing L will produce an animation and thrust. If I hold down L and press another key then the new key will also fire properly until I release L. Below is my MM patch, I basically just copied over the differences from the vernor thruster. Is it something wrong with how I\u0027m doing it or is it a limitation game engine or the model file?\n\nThanks\n\n    @PART[mk3_shuttle_noseCone]{    @MODULE[ModuleRCS]    {        @resourceName = LiquidFuel        PROPELLANT        {            name = LiquidFuel            ratio = 0.9            DrawGauge = True            resourceFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW        }        PROPELLANT        {            name = Oxidizer            ratio = 1.1            resourceFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW        }        @atmosphereCurve        {            key = 5 0.001        }    }    !RESOURCE[MonoPropellant] {}}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T19:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mreadshaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:03:30Z","Content":"From memory, multi-directional bipropellant RCS is not something KSP supports."},{"CreatedByName":"mreadshaw","CreatedById":135349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:06:01Z","Content":"Well dang it!
