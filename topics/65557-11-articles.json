On an air table, a light tower would easily get rotated sideways, causing uneven air flow and unwanted thrust. On the flip side, there is no reason to consider the Cambridge experiment irrelevant.

Again, d is the distance between center of mass and the point where the string is attached to the gyro axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, a pendulum moves in an ellipse about the equilibrium point.
