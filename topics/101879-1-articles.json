But yesterday I was working to Photoshop (somebody else\u0027s) art of Space Shuttle into System, and it seemed to naturally evolve that way. Making the core inline means taking the ogive and making it a cylinder. Since the tank walls are the structure, the tank increased in size - room for a lot more oxygen. That means you have to stretch the hydrogen tank with another ring. But since the interstage between the tanks is the main structure supporting the vehicle from the thrust of the SRBs, it makes it too high for the SRB attachment point, so you have to add another segment.\n\nThis may just be a coincidence though. Is this (but less stupid, and done by professionals) the design process that led to the current configuration of Space Launch System, or something else entirely?\n\nHere\u0027s my Photoshop I think it turned out alright.

I just went off that and added the rocket engines and mounts.
