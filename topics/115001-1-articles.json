A step or two above (IE, next best in the series) in either one will do wonders. Also recommend upgrading your RAM to 8 or 16GB, one because its cheap enough that there\u0027s no reason not to (and good RAM will last a long time), and because it\u0027ll allow you to take advantage of x64 whenever its available (or you decide to use the hack to get it). If you go for more ram, be sure that your Windows install is 64bit.\n\nI\u0027d also put a bit more money into the power supply myself and get something a bit more powerful. But thats not totally necessary. From my perspective, I like to have my computers last a long time, so I always put a bit more money into the small stuff so they last. I\u0027ve had this computer since 2007 and most of it is still the original parts that nowadays are only just starting to fall out of the top of the line. If you wanted to go for a \u0022future-proofed\\*\u0022 type of build, then I\u0027d definitely also recommend upgrading to a full size tower and Motherboard so it\u0027ll be easier to upgrade.\n\n\\*In reality, no build could ever really be future proofed (unless you went into the future), but it is very possible to design builds that\u0027ll last an entire gaming generation, if not more, with minimal upgrades."},{"CreatedByName":"Cryova","CreatedById":147379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T02:50:43Z","Content":"Thanks Mate!

This means that Intel is going to be the best bet. You do not need hyper-threading or many cores, so a modern i3 with a good clock speed should suffice. If you want to optimize for other games too, more cores are the next step.\n\nThe AMD is great value for money, but as KSP performance primarily floats on one thing - thread performance - the Intel gains the upper hand there. If you want to build a system that is more suitable for a wider range of games, going for the AMD might be a better bet, as it has slightly more power when it is able to utilize all cores.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wow, very nice idea!

Upgrading is generally not possible (or a hassle and/or very expensive), so you will have to make do with what you have. The only common upgrades in laptops are memory and the hard drive, and your memory seems to be sufficient.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T13:42:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 01:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:29:28Z","Content":"Yes, it is a laptop.
