This thread will be updated with all relevant updates and information. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep everyone on the same page and to speed up installation I\u0027m bundling the mods together into repacks, with the associated KMP part list file included with all of the parts added. I\u0027m also looking at various ways to help integrate different mods into KMP, weather that be a small patch, or in the larger scheme a separate client. The goal of the separate client being to synchronize Kethane / Mapsat / whatever data KMP does not directly handle at the moment. So far the secondary client is in concept stage, and the only *modified* plugin included at the moment is kOS. Any modified versions of mods (patched / forked source) will have the source posted along with the repack, non altered mods can be downloaded from their respective forum posts and on spaceport. The mod versions will be posted inside the repack as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Modded Multiplayer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepacks/General Info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EServer (Release):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EServer Info (Release):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Version: repack003\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods as of now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKMP(v0.1.3.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry Continued v3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA Mapsat 4 Dev Build 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane 0.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELazor System v31\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS v0.4.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbitalConstruction Redux\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads v3.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkOS Scriptable Autopilot v0.9.2 (modified)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnown Issues: Kethane data does not persist through connections, due to this data being stored in the persistence file, but is otherwise functional. A solution to this is being worked on. When you disconnect from the server, you will more then likely wipe your Kethane data, keep that in mind. It is also extremely unlikely that your Kethane scans will match anyone elses, again, this is being worked on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also going to be running a testing server under the same url, different port, for the latest dev-build of KMP, assuming I can keep up or automate the build.

Mods that do not contain parts, (SelectRoot, EnhancedNavball, Fusebox) are generally client independent and are not included in the repack at the moment, but may be in the future. If a mod has published an update that I didn\u0027t catch, please let me know and I\u0027ll update the repack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-16T07:18:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2013 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Aphox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDistribution links removed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neurotoxin","CreatedById":70873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T06:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about the other mods but I know that you can\u0027t redistribute Kethane\u0027s files as it\u0027s against the license, you may want to look into that before offer modpacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nevermoto","CreatedById":83726,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T06:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022neurotoxin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022neurotoxin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know about the other mods but I know that you can\u0027t redistribute Kethane\u0027s files as it\u0027s against the license, you may want to look into that before offer modpacks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see any other way to keep everyone on the same page without a noob friendly drag and drop into the folder.
