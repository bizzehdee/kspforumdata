Plain and simple. I got caught up in a KSP group (not the forums, don\u0027t worry) that really wasn\u0027t that fun. I wasn\u0027t enjoying my time, I was stressing out, and I didn\u0027t want to turn on the computer to play Kerbal Space Program.

Despite the best efforts of the moderation team, the original game died in late October of 2019. I joined an offshoot that tried to recapture the magic, but it contained the same problems as the old and even more- toxicity, cheating, and the abuse of game mechanics that started to turn me off from KSP. However, that game- the chaos and destruction notwithstanding- was what made LATT. The nations you read about in the story all come from the game, and the game\u0027s death in October was the largest hit to my story yet. However, I was determined to finish Life At The Top, no matter the cost. Until March.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EWhen I wrote LATT, I did it in spare moments at school. I had inspiration from the environment around me (for some reason), and I was able to find little 5-minute intervals in my time at school that allowed me to write on. I was prepared to release Chapter 39- a thrilling story involving a wet and chaotic Carthian GP. I had initially planned to release it around the time of Friday, March 6th, the day before Spring Break would begin. [Edit note: Technically not true; I had a track meet on Saturday, so\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003ESunday\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\u00A0would be the start of the break. Technicalities.] However, the final few laps weren\u0027t finished, and I didn\u0027t want to release a rushed product. I went into Spring Break, jotting down ideas about how the story would continue and how it would go on, ready to return home. Then, the world was turned on its head. COVID rocked up everything. I returned home from Dallas on Wednesday, March 11th, but I couldn\u0027t find it to finish the chapter. School came, and the atmosphere was tense. We were preparing for the worst, and I didn\u0027t have an ounce of free time to finish the last few hundred words that would make for a thrilling end. On Thursday, March 19th, Texas suspended schools. I would never get the chance to finish the story, as stay-at-home school would take up most of the day. Around that time, the group I was in started to get toxic, growing my dislike of KSP further and further until I blamed the game for the struggles. Combine that with a general lack of inspiration in LATT, and I\u0027ve never finished Chapter 39.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EI want to say that I\u0027ll return, honestly, I do. However, with each passing day, it\u0027s less and less likely. Picking up the pieces would be a Herculean effort, and frankly, I don\u0027t think I have the strength. I\u0027ve written myself into corners; at best, the characters feel bland and unoriginal, and at worst, they\u0027re blatant rip-offs; the story is too repetitive; I don\u0027t understand the work anymore- on and on. I also have to look at the audience. Kerbal Space Program is, at its heart, a space game first, a jet game second, and everything else third. If you made an itemized list of what KSP is at its core, racing is down at or near the very bottom. Another problem with picking the story back up: My aspirations. When I started LATT, I had this grand vision- Jeb and Max each completing over 20 seasons, retiring in 2062 with titles in the double-digits to their name. As of Chapter 39, I\u0027m only in Season 3. The lofty goals I set myself were, at one point, achievable, as I was completing a chapter every week or so. Then it slowed to one every other week. Then a month. I lost the fire for the story, which is a big problem when you\u0027ve hardly started in the grand scheme of it all. Combined with an increasing workload (I\u0027m now in my final year of High School, preparing to apply to college), the quality and quantity of the story faltered. I set the bar too high with an overly ambitious project, thinking I would keep the same fire I did when I was young. That was my mistake.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EWhat\u0027s next?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EHonestly, I can\u0027t say. I removed KSP from my computer a couple of weeks ago to make space for F1 2019, and I can\u0027t see it returning to my desktop anytime soon. (Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s all backed up on a drive. I\u0027m not crazy.) I do have the LATT story on my school laptop, with backups in multiple locations across the internet. However, I do not see much of a return to writing on the novel, mainly due to the lack of inspiration and insane cabin fever thanks to the pandemic.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EHowever...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EIn April (I think, time is fuzzy when you\u0027re locked down for three months), I downloaded this exciting game called \u0022Automation\u0022 from STEAM. I had seen a few YouTubers build some wacky cars, so I figured I would come on over and see what the fuss was about. My first cars were terrible sins against the very existence of the machine we call the automobile, but I got better. I\u0027m making progress on a (slightly less) ambitious project of writing, continuing my racing themes with a novel I\u0027ve tentatively titled \u0022One Lap At A Time.\u0022 It follows four characters (Dylan Cooper, Calen Reid, Kate Star, and Marcus Rosen) in various racing series (Dylan with a GT/Endurance-style series, Calen in an F1 analog, Kate with Touring Cars, and Marcus in trucks) in cars that I\u0027ve built in Automation and ported over to the popular game BeamNG.Drive. This series allows me to branch out both various bits of my personality (from the confident and maybe a bit arrogant Calen to the shy and quiet Marcus) and my tastes in racing. One issue that I had with LATT was that I was locked into F1-style races. With \u0022One Lap,\u0022 I\u0027m able to branch out based on what interests me at the moment (Typically, my moods involving writing style last about a week before I switch to something different). The story offers me a new chance to select what I write and gives me the freedom not to be locked in. Another advantage with \u0022One Lap\u0022 will be how I go about posting and writing the story. The way that I wrote LATT was, to put it mildly, a disaster. I bounced all over the place with ideas, I changed my style as I went, and the first chapters couldn\u0027t hold a candle to my best work later in the story. When I post OLAAT (That abbreviation is going to need some getting used to), I\u0027ll already have the finished product written; posting one chapter regularly after I\u0027ve already finished writing everything. This allows me to be punctual while giving me time to write without the pressure of a made-up deadline that I imposed on myself. My current plans are to release the story to the BeamNG forums, where I\u0027ll judge interest. After that, since it doesn\u0027t mention the game at all and all names are made-up, I will possibly send the work to a publisher. Worst-case, I blow a few bucks on sending the story to the company, and it flops. Best-case, I can pay for college. We\u0027ll see where that goes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003EComing back to KSP, I\u0027m not sure what the future holds for DarkOwl57. With school ramping up, I won\u0027t have time to work on any bits of story, and even if I do, it likely will be OLT (That\u0027s slightly better, I think). Perhaps someday, when I\u0027ve finished my first big work, I\u0027ll come back and finish what I\u0027ve started, little by little.

Anyways, this is a simply beautiful circuit, with a blend between the ancient and the advanced. Teams have been struggling practically all week to figure out what their setup will be. Whether they\u2019re looking for a boost on the straight or fast cornering in the technical middle and final sectors, the teams and drivers are in for some excitement with this amazing venue. The circuit is just filled with beautiful corners, and I do not doubt that this track will become a classic within the next few seasons.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CAnd speaking of the track, let\u2019s do a rundown, shall we? Drivers come flying down the main straight, topping out anywhere from 170 to 200, depending on the setup. Then it\u2019s a heavy braking zone down through the Highway Chicane, two 90\u00BA corners that throw the drivers downhill into one of the most fantastic camera shots we\u2019ll see all year. After two left-handers, the drivers fly into an unbanked 180\u00BA corner that provides one of the highest lateral G\u2019s on the entire circuit with the next three turns- 6, 7, and 8- sending the cars through the park and under the trees.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CAfter whipping through the Terrace Chicane, the drivers fly down into the Old City- a stunning brick road that has been in this town for hundreds of years. One of the action zones, Turns 14 through 19, fast S-like bends that the drivers have practically been straight-lining all weekend, with a massive bump down on the corner exit. Another action zone, Turn 21- a deceptively tight left-hander out of the tunnel. There\u2019s some slight camber down out of the corner, and then a dash out of 22 up the hill.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CJer,\u2019 this is a great race track and an almost perfect setup for the first race in a country that\u2019s got loads of motorsport heritage. Arcazon Kerman, driving the 77 car, has had an up-and-down season so far, after DNF-ing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in the first round and scoring his first points last race in Tekkia after a stunning wet-race performance.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CAnd it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to have a repeat of last week\u2019s wet race- perfect conditions for this afternoon\u2019s race.

Carthia has to have the most unique pit lane I\u2019ve ever seen, with the actual pit lane \u003Ci\u003Eunder\u003C/i\u003E the front straight, thanks to the overpass bridge. The race grid was just as unique as the circuit, with an F-Tech on the pole. Max and I were in second and third, respectively, and Arcazon up in P6. This was following up a weird race in Tekkia, with Michael taking the win in a race that required intermediate tires all night.

Good luck, man.\u201D We gave each other a high-five before separating; Max to his car in second and myself back to my car in third. I nodded to the team and hopped into the car. The team started pulling on the belts as I slipped the helmet on. The world went silent for a bit, and I relaxed as I tightened the strap and pulled the gloves on. A far-off whining filled my headset as Landin came over the radio.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CRadio check, radio check.

I got a good grip out of the grid and came off the line with ease before tucking into line behind Max and Jesus. We were surprisingly off the pace all weekend in Carthia, and nothing seemed to work. The aero grip we\u2019d held both this year and last had seemingly jumped out the window- leading both Max and me to run more wing than we\u2019d prefer. We would have the same cornering performance as the others, but we were down on the main straight at top speed. Meanwhile, Monster was stepping up its game- scoring a landslide win in Tekkia from the pole. The whole race had sprinkles that never really cleared up, and the city streets at night couldn\u2019t drain the water away to give either of us much of a chance to close in.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs we went under a highway bridge in Turn 3, we passed one of the larger grand-stands on the track. They cheered us on and waved, and I heard at least a couple of air horns from the side. The trees provided some shade in the 7-8 turns, and I felt the G-forces tugging at me through the corners. The skyscrapers towered over us out of Turn 8, throwing a shadow over parts of the track. We weaved past a drain cover and into the 9-10-11 chicane- going under a large awning and out of the corners. Even as we rolled over the esses\u2019 curbs, the track felt slightly slick just because of the bricks alone. The car slammed over the dip and bounced off the track. The bump was rough on the car, but we glided over it at speed, so it didn\u2019t hurt the car too bad.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs the grid got set up, I exhaled. The wind shifted and allowed me to get some air into the helmet, allowing me to cool down in the shade of the skyscrapers.

I didn\u2019t get any wheel-spin at all and shot away. Jesus couldn\u2019t get the power down, and I swept past him on the inside. Max got a good start, but I drew alongside him down into Turn 1. I couldn\u2019t get past, so I let him go down into the corner and entered the first turn single-file. Jesus was under fire from behind by Michael. I rolled over the temporary curbing and shot down the hill, flying down out of Turn 2 with a full head of steam. We shot underneath the bridges, and I tried to make a move inside into Turn 4. Max sliced down, and I couldn\u2019t get by on the inside. I understeered a bit as we flew down into Turn 5, but I managed to get alongside out of Turn 6 on the inside.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI flew past and managed to keep the advantage in 8, with Michael just behind both of us. He dove inside on Max in Turn 9 and managed to get alongside. Max slid up out of Turn 10 and cut him off, but I ended up running wide out of 11- slowing up both of them and then bringing the rest of the pack up to us. Max dove up my inside and managed to get by, but Michael was trapped outside in Turn 13. He ran off the track on the bricks and flew up into the dust, almost spinning and losing valuable spots as we dove into the opening esses.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CAmazing start up at the front for the OTech cars, with Max Kerman taking the gap out of Turn 13.

Max joined me around the computer as I watched. Michael had gotten jammed to the inside into Turn 21 and hit the wall, smashing the left-front. The suspension on the tire broke, and he shot to the right, hitting the LakeFront outside. The orange car spun back across the track and collided with another vehicle as Michael went straight-on, blocking off 4 or 5 cars. The camera changed to show Michael getting out and shaking his head, the radio wire dangling from the helmet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CYou know, that uniform does look pretty good,\u201D Max said with a smirk as the replays showed the view from Michael\u2019s car. I could understand how Michael was a bit frustrated- there was nothing he couldn\u2019t have done differently. As the cars backed up, he ended up getting jacked up into the air up off of another car\u0027s nose. I shook my head and stepped back, turning to Max.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CGreat start there.

I noticed that the team was focusing heavily on the right-rear of his car. Curious, I turned to the replay screen. He had managed to slip underneath the carnage, but there was contact that almost spun him around. I could only assume that it was the LakeFront of Gardner.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFollowing a 15-minute break, we re-fired the engines. We had just one warmup lap behind the Safety Car before we got back running. The green flag waved, and we got off to a flying start down into Turn 1. I shot down the inside, but Max managed to play the defensive, keeping me behind as we went through the first corner. Jesus hounded me through Turn 2 but couldn\u2019t get past, darting back and forth to try and find a hole. Max got a slight lead out to Turn 5 and peeked through the turn as Jesus tried to go outside. I could see Arcazon getting passed into Turn 5, but I couldn\u2019t focus on it too long as I defended through Turn 6.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMax got up close to the wall of Turn 7 and lost time.

He just managed to roll past on the inside of Turn 10.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJesus followed me close throughout the Old City section, and I had to play defensive in the wide streets of the New City.

I was ready to set up my move out of Turn 11. The engine echoed off the wall as I edged closer- feathering the throttle to get traction in the off-camber corner of Turn 13. I went up the track near the white line to get a good run, but the rear stepped out on corner exit. The tires buzzed over the bricks as I threw it into the esses- the cars created sparks off the bricks as I skittered over the curbs. I rolled over the Turn 19 curbing, and the car bounced on the dip, sending up a loud crash from the rear. I lifted off the throttle and let the car coast through Turn 20, feeling the cool air of the tunnel going through my suit. I could see the skid marks on the tarmac from the first lap crash, but I ignored them- diving down into 22.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI focused on the red tail of the F-Tech in front of me, still aware of Max closing in from behind. We broke into the \u003Ci\u003ETraffico\u003C/i\u003E corner, otherwise known as Turn 23. The engine echoed off the centuries-old buildings, rattling the old windows. I flew over the dip between Turns 25 and 26, gently holding the throttle with the tires losing some grip as they separated from the ground. The sky was getting darker with each passing minute, and I could feel the air turning cooler with some wind.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CHey, if the weather\u2019s holding up, I\u2019d like to get off these tires,\u201D I radioed in, barely over-steering out of Turn 27 over the exit curbing. \u201CRears are starting to go off.\u201D I shot down inside into Turn 28 but couldn\u2019t get alongside, and we maintained the single-file running out of the chicane. Max dove into the pit lane, and I tried a fake into Turn 30. Max had started ahead of me, so I understood why he had come in first. I lost the rears on the corner exit but had the DRS run, drawing close. Jesus covered the inside, and I cut back outside. The crowd whistled and cheered as we flew down the hill single-file. \u201CHaving trouble putting down the power.\u201D We blasted through Turn 4 and into the Fountain Curve. The aero dropped as I got into the dirty air of Jesus, but I held on- leaning on the tires as hard as I could.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWe\u2019ll pit you in this lap; No rain from what we see down here.\u201D I threw the car out of 5 and into 6, a rapid 1-2 punch over the curbing.

Jesus, however, held the inside in the hairpin at Turn 9. The back and forth continued throughout the lap before we shot into the pits. I dove down into the heart-stopping pit lane entry and pulled into the underground pit lane, the lights flickering a bit underneath the bridge. I followed Jesus into the pits, turning left into a hairpin-like curve to the actual pit lane. He quickly pulled into the stall, and F-Tech got the car serviced quickly. \u003Ci\u003ECome on,\u003C/i\u003E I sighed to myself. \u003Ci\u003ELet\u2019s get this done.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI pulled in perfectly on the mark as the team lifted me, pulling the tires off and putting on new ones in a blur. The team held me as Jesus slipped past, but I jammed the gas and caught onto his tail out of the pit lane. The engine echoed through the tunnel, but I could still hear a massive roar from the crowd. We exited the pits, and I immediately began my pursuit of Jesus. We buzzed over the bricks on the exit, flying up to meet the track in Turn 4. Jesus didn\u2019t leave an inch of space, so I looked outside around the fountain. I peeked on the inside into Turn 6 but couldn\u2019t get a look. Instead, I was just biding my time until I could get by- trying to force a mistake. We both rocketed through the trees as darker clouds started to roll in over the mountain\u2019s peaks. I dove into Turn 9 and got the inside under the awning, but Jesus held the line for the tighter Turn 10. I tried to keep on the inside through Turn 11.

His tail disappeared into the \u003Ci\u003EFurioso\u003C/i\u003E section as I pulled out of Turn 24.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201C\u003Ci\u003EHuh?\u003C/i\u003E\u201D I asked in bewilderment as a few more droplets fell. I flew through the \u003Ci\u003ECurve Grande\u003C/i\u003E, running up the track and buzzing off of the curbs. I tracked right up next to the wall and came back down, feeling the new tires at work as a couple of sparks popped off the bottom of the floor.

I glanced at the pit board and saw I was down by only about a second, but I was focused on keeping the bright red car behind. I knew that Juan- the other F-Tech- was multiple seconds back from us and that Jesus was probably trying to back me up into his clutches. I blocked the inside, and Jesus shot left- electing to try the outside instead of risking a dive-bomb. I held the position into the chicane and went down the hill- Jesus still behind me. I spared a glance at the mountains as we flew through 132L, the nickname for Turn 4. Small streaks of rain off on the horizon were starting to fall, with flashes of lightning up in the peaks. I dove down into Turn 5, and Jesus backed off a little bit.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CDid we just screw up?\u201D I threw the car into Turn 6 and got a twitch of oversteer as I pushed. \u201CDid we screw up the strategy by making an early stop?\u201D The radio buzzed as I flew out of Turn 8.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWe need to go hard here, Jeb, push.

The grip is okay for now.\u201D I flew over the apexes in the 14-19 series of corners, feeling the tires at work. The engine was working as hard as possible, practically flying over the curbs. I shot out of 22, and the sprinkles seemed to stop- likely blocked by the buildings to the side. Jesus, probably after getting the same message, started his push after me. The sprinkles weren\u2019t much worse than little dots now, but I could feel it getting worse. \u201CHow\u2019s Max doing?\u201D I noticed the blue and white tail getting closer as I flew out of 27. The rears almost let go but held as I set on my hot-lap pace. Jesus dropped back a bit on exit- likely leaving space for an attack down the front straight. A flash of lightning briefly lit up the sky, its low rumble barely audible under the roar of the engine.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CMax is closing on Arcazon for the lead,\u201D Landin replied. \u201CYou\u2019re gaining by about half a second per lap; we\u2019ll double stack you when you box. Keep pushing and keep us updated about the weather.\u201D I pulled out of Turn 30 and opened up the DRS. I was too far back to make a move on Max, but Jesus wasn\u2019t- diving up my inside. He shot past, and I had to move up the track, trying to get a better run down the hill. Sparks flew out from behind as the car bounced over the bumps in the road, and I tried to make my move. The trees waved when I passed as a light breeze briefly kicked out the rear in 7. The drops were starting to get bigger as they hit the visor, filling me with anxiety. We both shot under the building cover and out over the drain strip, and I could feel the tires start to give up a little bit of grip.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CLosing the rears on power,\u201D I reported as we flew down the hill. Jesus locked up, and I went inside, but I only lost time in Turn 13. I could see the white and red car of Juan starting to appear every so often in my mirrors- the Aquarian closing in just a bit as Jesus held me up. The F-Tech was surprisingly good in the corners this weekend- a part of the track we\u2019d been having issues in all week, surprisingly. The tires shined with a little bit of moisture in the tunnel, and the wind howled. I forced the car through Turn 21 and had to manage wheel-spin out of the corner.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWe need to pit,\u201D I radioed in, darting around to see if I could pass Jesus. \u201CTires are done.

Boxing this lap onto wets.\u201D We went through the \u003Ci\u003EFurioso\u003C/i\u003E section, and I gave a gap out of Turn 26. The rain was coming down hard, and I almost lost the rear- the tires spinning in the water. We raced up to the high-speed right-hander, and all heck broke loose.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJesus held flat through the corner, but I let off the gas- letting the rears catch a break. Suddenly, Jesus broke sideways at the apex, sliding towards the wall at a little over 160 miles an hour. My eyes widened as he hit the wall with a concussive thud. Debris shot off the car as it rebounded against the wall- skidding across the track and right into my path. I went up the track over the curbing and managed to squeeze between the ruined car and the wall. The tires buzzed over the wood and the curbing, sounding like a yell as debris and curb sparked off the floor. I went back down the track and fish-tailed off the slick curbs before regaining control. Jesus slid off to the side of the track without any of the left-side wheels. The left-rear was buried in the wall and the front hanging limp over the nose. The side of the car, once a vibrant red, had white paint caked all along its face- the side-pod torn to shreds.

The rainwater flew into the air with the rooster tail, and I slid past Max into P2 before the braking zone. Arcazon covered the inside into Turn 1, and I couldn\u2019t pass- forced to go outside. I held my line in Turn 2, but Arcazon had a perfect launch out of the corner and blasted away. Again, I closed out of Turn 4, but he had the inside in 5- forcing me around the long way. I cut him in the next corner and tried to see through the spray as water assaulted my visor. I dove down the inside of 7, but he was there first, anticipating the move and forcing me to check up. I lost the rear out of 7 and ran up wide as I hit a puddle while Arcazon almost didn\u2019t seem to be affected by it. Suddenly, a red blur shot past my right side as Juan flew by out of Turn 8, capitalizing on the mistake. \u003Ci\u003EDamnit,\u003C/i\u003E I cursed myself as I slotted into line, watching as the two got some separation out of the corner.

We all took the esses carefully for the first time, but I still ran in a bit hot in 14. Arcazon got a little bit of oversteer, and Juan looked inside before he got some oversteer himself a corner later. I managed to catch up before catching a slide out of Turn 19, almost drifting over the Big Dip as we coasted above it.

I stayed in the slipstream as long as I could before feinting left to draw Juan over. As soon as he did, I darted to the right.

Besides the regular battle scars (Paint blackened by dirt and grime from the track, scrapes on the paint, etc.), I noticed that the right rear floor had a gaping hole in it where the aero bits typically were.

However, I can\u0027t share that with y\u0027all, since it would spoil the story! I can, however, tell you some analogies.
