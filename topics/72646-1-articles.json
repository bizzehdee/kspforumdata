Conversely a very experienced player looking for an extreme challenge could push up the costs to say 400%, with a x4 multiplier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf squad was to implement such a system it should allow all players (regardless of skill) greater freedom to customize their gaming experience to what they enjoy. A new player could avoid being punished by the economy while building, flying, crashing in new entertaining ways. While veteran players build more efficient ships to fly to and land on all the things for fun and profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time and all your work on the game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T00:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly tech parts, such as solar panels, could be quite pricy when they first appear, then go down in cost to reflect mass production and lower cost for production.
