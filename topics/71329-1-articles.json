By this I imply, is it possible to make it so that one is having a nice interstellar journey to say, eve, and on the way there, space debris is constantly hurtling next to or at him. Could it be done so that if it comes within x proximity of your craft, all time-warp halts and you have to deal with the problem. Should you choose to ignore it, the following scenario depicts the events:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJimmy is flying through space and wasn\u0027t paying attention. Some meteors were rushing towards his craft. Jimmy decided not to take evasive manuvers. Jimmy\u0027s craft was hit by a flaming rock. Jimmy\u0027s craft\u0027s tail section broke off. Jimmy was flying on one engine with low power. Jimmy Wasn\u0027t able to slow down in time and crash landed on Duna\u0027s surface. He is now stranded and cannot leave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did include something about low power in that, because in its current state, power is wierd in KSP. There is no real concern about power, especially because you can just put a solar panel or more importantly an RTG and not worry about a thing. When your power drops to zero, you\u0027re basically dead, but what about before then. I also propose the ability to route power to and from critical systems. This would make it more important to place your power generation in safe locations. It would be something like, with everything on, you can only afford X% power to engines, depending on your power grid within the ship. But if you were to lose an engine, or shut off your SAS, you would be able to route Y% power to the engines (likely over 100%, like what some space shuttles are able to do), essentially making you go faster. Or say that you don\u0027t need to go particularly fast, but your ship is very unweildy, so you take power from the engines and route it to your SAS systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two suggestions would tie together to make interstellar travel in particular, but much of the game as a whole, a decent amount more immersive and a little less, \u0022we\u0027re expecting a nice, turbulence-free, cruise at about X altitude, just sit back and enjoy the flight.\u0022 I just feel like, if you have enough fuel once in space, you can make it anywhere you chose (I\u0027m saying this in a very simplified way, I realise that you can\u0027t just have 9000 Rockomax Jumbo 64s and a 24-77 (the radial small rockomax engine) and expect to get everywhere and anywhere). Now, I wonder if this would be at all plausible ever in the future. The former portion of this would likely be far too taxing on the game if it were to use 100% accurate mechanics, so it would (if possible and if ever considered) likely have to be made so that, once the threat had been dealt with, it would be deleted from the game, as in, it wouldn\u0027t calculate the object\u0027s trajectory beyond that aformentioned X radius of the craft. What would you guys say to this? Is is remotely plausible, and would it help or hinder the game as a whole, especially if lose conditions (as mentioned in the \u0027already suggested\u0027 dev thread)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManaaniWanderer","CreatedById":28850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T19:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe devs don\u0027t want there to be any random failure chance in the game, so if you fail its because you didn\u0027t include enough fuel/parachutes/batteries/power-generation/etc. or didn\u0027t make the craft strong enough to withstand the forces you put it under.
