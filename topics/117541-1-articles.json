Other damage than blowing up parts. For example, your rocket is on orbit, and a sharp debree, for example, a structural panel hits your ship. Currently, the fuel tank wich is hit explodes, and your rocket will remain in 2 parts. Something should happen, like having the body cutted, and, if it explodes, the whole thing should blow up.
