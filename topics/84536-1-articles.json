When reaching my target it speeds up for no reason! Even when i got pretty much the same AP PE! And it don\u0027t speed up with a few meters a second, it speeds up a couple of hundred of seconds and just flies away. Resulting switching ships bugging out, spacecenter button acting up and twice corrupting the persistent file. I tried starting over twice, for some crafts it works fine but with other crafts it just acts up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso tried to randevou with hyperedit with the same reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen trying to recreate it with vanilla installation but i haven\u0027t noticed any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do my target fly away? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-13T23:37:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2014 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Iliketaco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
