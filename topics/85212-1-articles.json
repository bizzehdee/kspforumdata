I\u0027m using FAR/DRE so I have procedural fairings installed to let me protect payloads. The problem is the radially attached parts are not getting aerodynamically shielded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Munar lander is sitting in a procedural fairing with two radial tanks with landing gear attached. In the VAB they show up as shielded. When I transition to the launchpad they become unshielded from the radial decouplers out. All central parts are correctly shielded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried oversizing the fairings, changing the number of fairing panels, adding parts to the lander to change it\u0027s size, different orientations of radial attachments etc. I researched and found that more than two fairing panels in the SPH can cause problems due to symmetry but this is in the VAB with two panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso of note is when I decouple one of the side tanks on the pad, the other side becomes shielded again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/t4AQ8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
