But if you open the definition too wide then it becomes a useless term, devoid of real meaning. Most of what you describe is to me covered under basic physical laws or automatic reaction. I wouldn\u0027t call them signs of consciousness any more than I would apply that label to human reflexes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so everything you describe has some defined substance. If you say the planet, or the galaxy, or the whole universe, is alive and thinking, then I\u0027ll probably disagree no matter how much fun I\u0027ve had with that idea in the past. But at least they are objects you can say something about. \u0027Pure energy\u0027 is nonsense without some further definition. What kind of energy? Kinetic energy? Light? Heat? Arguably matter is energy, so anything could be described as pure energy! And the typical conception of a glowing blob of bright light is none of these thigns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitching gears, I feel that the idea that a robotic form means lack of empathy is somewhat lacking in imagination. If your machines are such that they can contain the whole of a human mind, then surely they can emulate the human emotions. In fact I rather suspect that they need to. I recall reading about studies that found humans deprived of emotion tended to be unable to do much of anything. There may be other effective modes of thought, but I expect any uploaded humans or AIs based on human thought will need the full range of emotion to be at all functional.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T00:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you about the term pure energy.

I recognize the method wanot defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as \u0027consiousness\u0027, I once again agree if you open the term too wide it becomes meaningless. However, what we see as automated reactions in a plant could very well may be the automated reaction we \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E see in ourselves. So, much as you have asked pure energy to be defined, I would require consiousness be defined. Personally, I think the current reading, \u0022Consciousness is the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.\u0022 as per the dictionary, means that plants do indeed enjoy consiousness. They are clearly aware of the forces of things acting upon them, and of themselves, and respond in kind. They do not build cellular phones, but \u0027go to sleep\u0027 when the sun fades and \u0027awake\u0027 when it rises, much in a familiar vein of our existence. That may or may not apply to larger forces, as we have no idea what it means to be a star. We think we know something about what they do, but just as the reasons a cat behaves the way it does eludes us, so too may the universe at large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, all that is needed is to define the size of the consiousness. If you examine the solar level, our consiousness no longer seems relevant. We can easily be relegated to bacteria like that within our own systems, things that cause and fight infections in the larger body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: As far as the robotics bit; according to the scale we have cyborg before robot. I have to imagine a large portion of our humanity is discarded during that time.

I also disagree when you say there is not a marked reduction in humanity, as those with prosthetics face amny kinds of predjudice.
