Maybe we can set the default volume in the cfg? I want mine down to 3. Seriously. Then I can crank the KSP ambience volume and rockets for MOAR BASS. I\u0027ve tried re-installing to the latest build, deleting the chatterer plugin cfg. but the volume just insists on resetting itself to about 80%, even though the slider says 3%. One touch of the slider and it immediately goes back to the proper 3%.
