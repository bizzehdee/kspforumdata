That excitement ended when I tried to launch anything. The pitch and yaw controls are inconsistent from moment to moment. One minute, pitch will angle up, the next it will rotate, the next turn it back and forth, and the fourth it does a complete 180 and then stops accepting any input at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, on occasion drops out of controls entirely so you sit there helpless watching your ship just react randomly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have played on PC before, so I know this is abnormal behavior.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
