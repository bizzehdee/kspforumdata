However this is not recursive. \n\nBut if you want to move fuel between part you can just call [part.RequestResource](http://anatid.github.io/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/class_part.html#a13c789e43671ec5a04be3f9156f39fdf) to request the fuel and then add it somewhere else. That would honor the resource flowmode. If it does not work for your need then you will have to recreate the whole fuel graph and make sure you respect the fuelflow\n\nI guess you could have a look at ksp \u0022tac fuel balancer\u0022 or \u0022Ship manifest\u0022 source."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T23:54:55Z","Content":"OK, I\u0027ll have a look at that fuel balancer thing...\n\nthanks for pointing me."}]}
