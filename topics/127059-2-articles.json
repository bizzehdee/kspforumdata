NASA DRAs are 35 Billion USD. Even Inspiration Mars got caught up in scope creep with multiple lifts and on orbit assembly, 2.5 Billion USD. A minimal direct one shot is much cheaper, Falcon Heavy \u002B a Soyuz is 0.1 Billion USD ( plus more costs I know, and Soyuz has the H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E problem ). Small simple and done would be better than large useful and never done.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe long duration medical data is pure science useful, and manned space useful. It\u0027s not enough to motivate the trip, it\u0027s not\u00A0the cheapest way to get the data, but if the trip was on it would be criminal not to gather the data\u00A0and it must have a dollar value somewhat less than getting it from ISS (because after 15 year we seem not to to have bothered).\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you have real plans for a manned Mars program (Elon Musk maybe, NASA maybe) then it sure makes sense to do flybys. You can shake out parts of the tech stack, build experience with the operating procedures, etc - you can do this while still grappling with the real hard problems of aerocapture (do it!),\u00A0Mars EDL, and ascent. All the reasons they did the Apollo flyby.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLong duration flybys could conceivably use people as a \u0027force multiplier\u0027 for autonomous components. You can throw a craft into a companion orbit to Mars so they do an \u0027extended flyby\u0027 where they spend months within a few light seconds for Mars, taking 30 mins out of the \u0027control loop\u0027 could greatly increase the flexibility, rate, and amount of data gathering possible from landed elements. Automated systems are getting better and better, but really still not that\u00A0great and \u0027man on Earth in the loop\u0027 must really slow things down.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think there would be some drama associated with the flyby, e.g. will (did) the maneuver engine fire near Mars to tweak the trajectory for a return, was enough ablator added to the capsule. That kind of ephemeral drama might help sell the idea of doing the flight and maybe get some support dollars, but there is a longer term awe and inspiration factor. A\u00A0a selfie of a helmeted face with crescent Mars and an Earth star could be as iconic as the \u0027earthrise\u0027 photo.\u00A0The moon was different after you could look up and think \u0027we\u0027 stood there and ran that dust through our gloved fingers, Mars and Venus will be different after you can look at the first star of evening and think \u0027we\u0027 threw someone\u00A0close enough to almost touch that and got them back safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T03:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my question: Why go minimal at all?
