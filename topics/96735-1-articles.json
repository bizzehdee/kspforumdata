(Possibly related to high Reputation?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my latest career save (0.90, lightly modded: EVE, KJR, KAC) I decided I was tired of the seemingly endless grinding-for-Funds in Hard mode and dropped back to Normal. My most impressive accomplishment so far is successfully deploying a probe into a 3-star \u0022minimal deviation\u0022 orbit around Mun. (I did unlock the tech for docking port and hitchhiker, in anticipation of those juicy lucrative orbital station contracts, but so far I only did one, and that\u0027s just in Kerbin orbit.)

Then there\u0027s always the raw distance (not a particularly valid issue objectively, but certainly an important psychological one for the inexperienced), and the holdover idea from most people\u0027s real-life notion that going to Mars is a WAY HARDER THING than going to the Moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, of course, there\u0027s the secondary reason for the original post: my own purely-psychological landscape.
