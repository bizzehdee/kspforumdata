Only allow one mod to use this (boo!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Force players to choose which mod to use (double boo!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Put on the big boy pants, toss the tree nodes together, and agree not to be jerky-jerks stomping over eachother until such time as we can use this without stomping the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 should not be that hard. Fractal\u0027s stuff is on far-end tech tree progression. Mine is on colonization and construction. Nert has his own sub-trees that are more.. um.. \u0027near future\u0027 than KSPI.

Otherwise you will have stomping again, and everyone loses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, once we can merge different sub-trees on a mod by mod basis, we\u0027re pretty golden because then we just do our own sub-sections and be done with it.

In addition to the excellent points he already listed, there is a vast number of additional arguments as to why it just isn\u0027t practical. I\u0027m going to be brief, because listing them all in detail would probably break the forum post character limit, but here\u0027s a short selection of reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EPart order concept\u003C/strong\u003E. In addition to the shape/style argument presented by Starstrider, you can also have conceptually different tech tree approaches. Stock KSP for instance orders its parts according to what it thinks is a good way for new players to learn the game. Another tech tree may order them according to the power level they have. Yet another might order the according to the order in which perceived RL equivalents were developed historically. You can continue this pretty much arbitrarily, and you\u0027ll never get even half the forum on the same page about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EPart scaling concept\u003C/strong\u003E. Stock KSP comes from a sandbox heritage and has a large number of parts that are roughly equal but serve individual niches. There\u0027s hardly any vertical power progression at all; even when the tech tree is fully unlocked, the LV-T30 is still going to be an excellent engine and just as useful as it was when starting a fresh save. That is why it can get away with ordering the parts almost arbitrarily. And some mods may share that approach, especially the stockalike mods; while others, especially the high tech mods like KSPI and Near Future, aim to introduce a power progression scaling. Both approaches are equally valid, and it is sort of possible to bolt a vertical power progression onto the end of the horizontal stock tree without disrupting it too much. But once you start adding mod after mod, you\u0027re just begging for the various approaches to clash violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EPart balance concept\u003C/strong\u003E. While we\u0027re on the topic of things clashing violently: scaling paradigms. This is the main thing that makes sure that (just to name a really popular example) you can never have Near Future Propulsion, Near Future Electrical and KSP Interstellar in the same tree and have it play well. It\u0027s not just that one part is like fifty percent stronger or weaker than another, oh no... here we have parts that deal in numbers different by a factor of \u003Cem\u003Eone thousand\u003C/em\u003E and more times. It\u0027s going to work for sandbox where you build things for aesthetics only, sure, but in career? Not going to happen. And in sandbox you don\u0027t need a tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ERebalance projects\u003C/strong\u003E. So maybe a user doesn\u0027t like it when things don\u0027t fit together like that, and he writes a MM config to change things. Maybe that MM config starts to become bigger and bigger, and he tells his friends about it, and eventually it becomes its own mod like the Stock Rebalance Project by stupid_chris. How\u0027s your standard tree going to account for a mod like this? It cannot. And therefore a standard tree cannot exist in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EPart bloat, meet empty nodes\u003C/strong\u003E. A tech tree with a high number of mods integrated is going to have \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E of the following, at the same time: 1.) random empty nodes because nobody will ever install all supported mods at once; 2.) nodes that randomly contain 40 parts and more because a dozen mods all add variations of the same thing. It looks bad, and it potentially plays bad.
