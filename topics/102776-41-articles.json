I could easily implement it back in now ofc, however would that be something people actually want? My current thinking is along the lines that Serran\u0027s oceans have dried up, leaving the surface dry, however there still is subterranean water on the planet. It\u0027s just I don\u0027t really want to add something unnecessary to the mod.

It\u0027s something that I have been putting off for quite some time, as although implementing the star itself is relatively simple, there are many other things to consider....such as; orbital allignments (changing all orbits to have a \u0027ksp-realistic\u0027 orbital allignment to take into account for heat/gravity of stars etc.), solar power (some stars such as the blue main sequence and the red giant are super luminous, would this solar curve make solar power too easy? whereas the white dwarf would be so non-luminous it would make solar panels almost useless....balancing can be pretty tricky!), as well as a few other things. Balancing all these gave me a headache and I put it all on the backburner for now as i work on a few other things (like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128856\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis prject with Sigma88\u003C/a\u003E, and also a new overhaul pack to showcase the true power of kopernicus \u0026amp; pqs mods which will get a dev thread soon). I\u0027m mainly mentioning this now as I have had stars on my mind after working with Sigma88, and also Tynrael was asking about them too. So anyway let me know how you feel about the idea of them, what you would like to see, or if you don\u0027t mind either way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETerrain glitching out at launch/KCT bugs!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E OK so this is just something else i wanted to clear up as I\u0027m not sure if some people missed the discussion about it all. Anyways the terrain issue appears at the KSC screen when launching directly from the launchpad/runway. This happens rarely in normal circumstances, and has something to do with the game not being able to correctly track Kerbin after it\u0027s original orbit/rotation changes. The game basically miscalculates the rotation of the planet and the surface implodes on launch. This always happens when allowing substantial time to pass in the KSC view and then immediately launching. The fact that a lot of people have assumed it has something to do with KCT in the past is because with KCT you have to launch from the KSC view \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u003C/strong\u003E waiting for the ship to be built, this allows time to pass and triggers the bug. A simple way to avoid is always to switch scenes before launching (like going into the tracking station and back out) this allows the game to fix itself. Please make sure not to discuss it in KCT\u0027s thread or mention it to magico13 as I\u0027m sure he\u0027s sick of hearing about it, instead feel free to whine about it in this thread and I\u0027ll pretend to listen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

Indeed, Lave, Laythe and Serran are the only bodies other than Kerbin to have any reasonable shot at habitability - which I think a lot of players, myself included, find to be a fun and exciting concept. Oxygen atmospheres and hints of bio-activity make for tempting targets, as evidenced by Joolian-Laythe being the preferred colony for basically everyone, despite the travel difficulties involved and Duna being vastly easier in every way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing purple, Lave makes me think of Earth\u0027s archean era, wherein the primary life-form was magnificently purple bacteria.

As it stands, without EVE (which I don\u0027t have the memory space for), it looks like a vacuum body from space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rings, perhaps on the outside of a reduced Eli orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a second moon, possibly co-orbital with Eli, either of similar mass and 180 degrees around, or very small and in a lagrange point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- increased mountain height; again following up on the tidal effects of a closer moon, I\u0027d expect greater continental plate movement and thus some bigger ridges going on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a habit of spawning asteroids (if this is even possible with Kopernicus.
