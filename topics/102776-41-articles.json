I\u0027ve still been around though, keeping an eye on what people have been saying, so lets get down to the topics been discussed...\n\nfirstly eddiew beautiful screens as ever, and also katchau, those shots are stunning, love them! (sorry to hear about your save corrupting ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) )\n\n**SO! lets talk planetary oceans!** So originally Serran had an ocean yes, unfortunately i took it out when switching to Kopernicus as I had a few issues with matching things perfectly together to get it functioning properly. I could easily implement it back in now ofc, however would that be something people actually want? My current thinking is along the lines that Serran\u0027s oceans have dried up, leaving the surface dry, however there still is subterranean water on the planet. It\u0027s just I don\u0027t really want to add something unnecessary to the mod. So let me know what you think about it all. oh and as for liquid on the surface of Lave....I somehow doubt that such a thin atmosphere would sustain surface liquids at all, so it\u0027s something i doubt would come in....but again let me know how you guys feel!\n\n**Serran\u0027s terrain issues!** I am aware of the issues currently with Serran, hopefully its something that i can easily fix when i dig deep into the planet again. Hopefully it just has something to do with the terrain\u0027s offset from when i originally had an ocean and shifted the terrain afterwards! I\u0027ll have a good look into it when i rework Serran soon.(Don\u0027t worry Randazzo, I haven\u0027t forgotten!)\n\n**Stars!** So although recently there hasn\u0027t been much mention of them in the thread lately, but I don\u0027t want you guys to think the idea has been forgotten. It\u0027s something that I have been putting off for quite some time, as although implementing the star itself is relatively simple, there are many other things to consider....such as; orbital allignments (changing all orbits to have a \u0027ksp-realistic\u0027 orbital allignment to take into account for heat/gravity of stars etc.), solar power (some stars such as the blue main sequence and the red giant are super luminous, would this solar curve make solar power too easy? whereas the white dwarf would be so non-luminous it would make solar panels almost useless....balancing can be pretty tricky!), as well as a few other things. Balancing all these gave me a headache and I put it all on the backburner for now as i work on a few other things (like [this prject with Sigma88](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128856), and also a new overhaul pack to showcase the true power of kopernicus \u0026 pqs mods which will get a dev thread soon). I\u0027m mainly mentioning this now as I have had stars on my mind after working with Sigma88, and also Tynrael was asking about them too. So anyway let me know how you feel about the idea of them, what you would like to see, or if you don\u0027t mind either way!\n\n**Terrain glitching out at launch/KCT bugs!** OK so this is just something else i wanted to clear up as I\u0027m not sure if some people missed the discussion about it all. Anyways the terrain issue appears at the KSC screen when launching directly from the launchpad/runway. This happens rarely in normal circumstances, and has something to do with the game not being able to correctly track Kerbin after it\u0027s original orbit/rotation changes. The game basically miscalculates the rotation of the planet and the surface implodes on launch. This always happens when allowing substantial time to pass in the KSC view and then immediately launching. The fact that a lot of people have assumed it has something to do with KCT in the past is because with KCT you have to launch from the KSC view **after** waiting for the ship to be built, this allows time to pass and triggers the bug. A simple way to avoid is always to switch scenes before launching (like going into the tracking station and back out) this allows the game to fix itself. Please make sure not to discuss it in KCT\u0027s thread or mention it to magico13 as I\u0027m sure he\u0027s sick of hearing about it, instead feel free to whine about it in this thread and I\u0027ll pretend to listen ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). I just want to state this is a kopernicus bug, and a fix for this is pretty complicated, although i have nothing but faith in ThomasP to find a way eventually ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nanyways guys thanks!

For Serran, maybe the terrain could be levelled so\u0027s to provide only small, widely spaced salt-lakes? The white could be science deffed as fish bones xD\n\nFor Lave (and I mean this to be constructive rather than critical ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)) my feeling is that there\u0027s not a very good reason to visit it. It\u0027s a medium sized rocky body with a small moon; but Laythe is more or less the same, and is more accessible, having the denser oxygenated atmosphere, and being faster to get to. Which started me wondering what could be changed about Lave that would make it worth the travel time, and why would you go there rather than adding another 200m/s and head for Jool/Duna/Ike/Dres/etc?\n\n(I hoped to make a config patch and post screenshots of the results for illustration, but so far Kopernicus has defeated me with its lack of documentation. Can\u0027t for love nor money get an ocean to appear so I\u0027ll just have to describe it ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif))\n\nWhat Lave has from the outset is an orbit not a gazillion miles away from Kerbin, which we can assume to be in the middle of the goldilocks zone. Indeed, Lave, Laythe and Serran are the only bodies other than Kerbin to have any reasonable shot at habitability - which I think a lot of players, myself included, find to be a fun and exciting concept. Oxygen atmospheres and hints of bio-activity make for tempting targets, as evidenced by Joolian-Laythe being the preferred colony for basically everyone, despite the travel difficulties involved and Duna being vastly easier in every way.\n\nBeing purple, Lave makes me think of Earth\u0027s archean era, wherein the primary life-form was magnificently purple bacteria. The concept of Lave as a primordial soup then led on to;\n\n- the bacteria would need some moisture going on, hence the crater seas suggested previously\n\n- being rather cooler than Kerbin, Lave would benefit from some tidal heating, which suggested that Eli could come inwards to maybe a quarter of it\u0027s current orbit \\*\n\n- alternatively it could have a thicker atmosphere, with some science defs suggesting 10-20% carbon-dioxide and a lot of water vapour, giving it enough of a greenhouse to hold onto the heat it gets from the sun\n\n- in fact, the tidal heating option complements this, since it would make Lave regularly burp volcanic gasses, which would help replenish it\u0027s atmosphere with CO2 \\*\\*\n\nFew other things I thought might help Lave come to the fore a little;\n\n- polar ice caps. Maybe not duna-big, but significant larger than Kerbin\u0027s. As it stands, without EVE (which I don\u0027t have the memory space for), it looks like a vacuum body from space.\n\n- rings, perhaps on the outside of a reduced Eli orbit\n\n- a second moon, possibly co-orbital with Eli, either of similar mass and 180 degrees around, or very small and in a lagrange point\n\n- increased mountain height; again following up on the tidal effects of a closer moon, I\u0027d expect greater continental plate movement and thus some bigger ridges going on\n\n- a habit of spawning asteroids (if this is even possible with Kopernicus. Maybe using Dres as the template?)\n\nObviously all just my 2p ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) If it doesn\u0027t fit your concept that\u0027s totally fine - maybe you see Lave as a dry, cold, desert planet, with hardy purple lichens. I\u0027m just brainfarting ideas on how to make it feel less of a lonely space \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Purple-Potatoes.jpg](http://manistiquefarmersmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Purple-Potatoes.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n ^^;\n\n\\* I tried it around 2200km and it looks badass, actually, having a moon so dominant in the sky. It may also make it very easy to use for gravity slingshots, which is always fun!\n\n\\*\\* I personally wouldn\u0027t feel bad about bending the rules and having the purple archean bacteria as oxygen factories.
