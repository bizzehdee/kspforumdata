I played for the first time for about four hours on Friday, including taking all of the tutorials. During that time I jotted down every significant bug I found (i.e. excluding little stutters, inexplicable crashes, and things I just personally didn\u0027t like). There were way too many for me to make a thread for every one of them, so here\u0027s the whole list. The ones I think are most important to address are in bold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npart selection highlight all over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr

rescaled or repositioned\u003Cbr\u003E\natmospheres too bright near horizon: as used to be the case in KSP1, atmospheres are nearly white near the horizon, much brighter than the terrain at the same
