I didn\u0027t want to sidetrack that thread, so I\u0027m taking my IP bashing here instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I believe IP--patent \u0026amp; copyright in particular--cannot be justified on any basis. They are only micro-monopolies, enforced arbitrarily by government lawyers and bureaucrats. Nor does IP fit the definition of real property. You cannot \u0022steal\u0022 an idea, technique, or a concept. You can\u0027t own such things, and it\u0027s not possible to deprive someone of the use of their knowledge, as it is with stealing for example a car. Copyright is most often used by powerful bully organizations such as the MPAA or RIAA to protect outdated business models - to the detriment of all consumers, and (most) artists as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not justified on a utilitarian basis, that society benefits overall, either. (Utilitarianism isn\u0027t morally defensible in itself anyway.) Entire industries were built in eras with little or no concept of IP - actually this is the case for most inventions and ideas throughout history. People often justify patents by saying that inventors need an \u0022incentive\u0022 to invent. But I can\u0027t imagine how anyone could think this after considering it seriously. People invent and create all the time with no expectation of ANY compensation of any kind (one example might be KSP modders...), and obviously virtually every major invention would have been invented and created by \u003Cem\u003Esomeone\u003C/em\u003E, if only because they wanted it for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system (patent/copyright) is one of the most evil and harmful things the government does, and I truly believe it should be abolished entirely. It\u0027s getting worse as time goes on, too. I feel strong contempt every time I\u0027m forced to dance around and waste my time on this immoral, stupid set of rules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is from a US-law perspective, but I imagine the way this works in other countries is fairly similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this is probably the first time most reading this have even heard such a thing anyway, I guess I\u0027ll stop here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T05:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree wholeheartedly.

I don\u0027t like the idea of restricting free speech in perpetuity, but I also like the idea of allowing innovators to do something exclusive with their work for a while as a reward for extraordinary creativity.

Many inventions simply take far too much money, time and effort to create that simply \u0022being able to use it\u0022 at the end is NOT a strong enough incentive to put yourself under years of financial and, physical and emotional strain. Also, we could end up with a situation where if someone puts years of effort into writing a book, they can ask to get it published, have their rights denied and then have the company publish it themselves and take all the profit, that is until another company also starts publishing it. This would give all the money to those with means of selling things and none to those with means of creating things, which means that creating things can\u0027t be a full time job unless you\u0027re selling paintings on a street corner or performing. These are just a few examples of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that certain types of IP are a problem, but I think what laws currently exist on them are.

Now everyone involved in a project can be long dead and someone can still be getting money from them. And then there\u0027s things like patenting genes so that research into them can be made illegal except by the owning company.

The concern for rewarding innovators and creators is a common one, but there is very little (if any) actual empirical evidence to suggest that this is even necessary. The notion that inventors and artists would simply quit and get a regular day job--because they aren\u0027t guaranteed the right to use force to stop others from doing the same or similar--goes against what I think is human nature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbface\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbface\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t know if I agree entirely.

There\u0027s little hard evidence (not based on what people or politicians \u0022think\u0022) that it provides any \u003Cstrong\u003Enet\u003C/strong\u003E benefit at all, and there\u0027s a massive cost to society which takes no effort to see. Think about all the money which goes into the legal system (lawyers!) and government offices simply to keep the system running. That\u0027s part of the cost--it effectively diverts all those resources from our economy, which could have gone to much more productive uses such as scientific research, farming or manufacturing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe example of an author is a good one! A real life example I like is that during the pre-copyright American era, copyright law was enforced for English authors in England, but not across the Atlantic. Authors did get paid, in both markets, and would often make *more* money from American publishers in exchange for early access. They were paid up front, and the payment would often be greater than what they were paid in royalties over years in England. A major point being that (besides evidence that copyright didn\u0027t help anyone) a different business model evolved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Custard Donut (In Space)\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Custard Donut (In Space)\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI must admit my opinion on this is fairly left of field, i believe the creator of a work has a moral right to two things with regard to his creation, firstly to be identified as the author in perpetuity, secondly for any edited or changed version of his/her work to be clearly stated as such.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat points.
