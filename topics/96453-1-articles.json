The Mun/Minmus missions can be done almost straight away and then you\u0027re stuck doing the procedural missions, which while I\u0027m sure have their place, shouldn\u0027t be the bulk of activity (or at least players should have a choice). I therefore propose that these missions are expanded and developed into three stages of exploration. This will make the missions more realistic, give us reasons to return to the bodies and open up the potential for proper exploratory missions rather than a 1-phase landing and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than being consecutive in the sense of choosing the missions, I think you should only be able to complete stage 2/3 once the prior stage is complete. Therefore it is possible to complete all three phases in a single mission, but would encourage multiple missions to that body if funds are low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also include photography missions instead of EVA report/crew report , I know several people have suggested photography as a form of science in the past and this seems like a natural inclusion. The progression also allows for a unmanned phase 2 mission but requires phase 1\u002B3 to be manned. Admittedly the manned mission to Eve would be difficult to accomplish, but I see the point of the three phase model as making exploring planets nonlinear in the sense that you will be scouting Eeloo probably before you launched a manned mission to Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway here is the proposed format.
