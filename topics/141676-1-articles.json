Unfortunately, whenever I load a plane from the SPH, it seems like it\u0027s glued to the runway. I spool up the engines to max power and the plane just rocks back \u0027n forth. I can get SOME movement if I yaw left and right, but when I stop I usually end up rolling BACKwards! I\u0027ve only got the Tier 1 runway - is that the problem? I\u0027ve also tried cycling the brakes etc. Help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference, my plane is pretty similar to this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u00221LmRENE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022422\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1LmRENE.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T01:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you provide a screenshot of your plane on the runway? Without a picture it\u0027s hard to identify what issue you are experiencing. Sometimes your plane can spawn with your wheels clipped into the runway. If you don\u0027t have enough thrust the slope on the tier 1\u00A0runway might be big enough to cause you to roll backwards. And honestly, I recommend not using the tier 1 runway because with the 1.1 update, the non-retractable wheel are so fragile that the bumps on the runway can cause them to break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T02:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d get the VesselMover mod and move your plane off the runway then try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thalamask","CreatedById":152732,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T15:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a screenie of my plane:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XhWMoRy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XhWMoRy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI upgraded to the Tier 2 runway, and I also tried putting it on the grass.
