I did not realise until it was far too late that 300 of those 400m was a vertical drop. Several seconds of panic followed, cut short abruptly by the impact. Miraculously, although the rover bounced off into a very rapid spin, every one of the five-or-so collisions after that were absorbed by the wheels until it landed upright and settled. The rover had survived with every wheel and every solar panel but one broken, it was quite simply incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, aiming to return a probe to within 20 kilometers of the KSC.

I sent two, they didn\u0027t have near enough fuel to make it to Laythe from LKO, so I came up with a system of undocking the ascent rocket engine and replacing it with an LV-N, which in turn could be decoupled to reveal a replacement rocket. The first one deorbited and flew fine, but the landing site was too bumpy and it ended up crash-landing with minor structural damage and only one out of three engines. I wasn\u0027t particularly hopeful about the second, as it was identical to the first and in the time between launch and reaching Laythe my spaceplane building skills had advanced enough to realise it didn\u0027t really have enough wing area.
