After several smaller versions each having problems getting proper lift on the way to orbit (they did get there, just very slowly) I decided to have a go at a new take on the original design resulting in the V3-SD. It doesn\u0027t have a payload in this shot but it maintained a good flight profile all the way to a 100x100 orbit. I wish I didn\u0027t have to go this route but I just wasn\u0027t getting the performance out of the smaller versions that I expected. Or the performance I got out of them in .24 with SP\u002B for that matter, although I\u0027m not sure why. Still needs some tweaks to get maximum efficiency. If all goes as expected I\u0027ve already eliminated the atmospheric instability of the original design from .23, but that has not been confirmed. It weighs 33.5t unloaded and is capable of lifting about 5t to 100x100km orbit with ~450 DV left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1504-29-48-37.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1504-29-48-37.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth, here\u0027s one of the smaller designs (V3m-SDx to be specific) dropping off a module to deorbit this old ship that\u0027s been floating around for a couple years. This one weights 23t unloaded and can lift around 2ish tons to 100x100 orbit with about 1000 DV left over if I remember correctly. That weight should be higher but the problems with lift and TWR are holding it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1423-28-48-54.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1423-28-48-54.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for good confusing measure here is another variant, the V3m-SD which is no longer in service since the SDx. It weighs 25t unloaded and has about the same payload capabilities as the V3m-SDx (ever so slightly better with ascent). The differences in all these are small but important on my quest for efficiency and reliability. Apparently I can\u0027t have both which is why I went back to the drawing board with the original larger design after these... Sigh. While I\u0027m here, a bit about the name scheme: I\u0027ve been lazy with designators on these but basically anything with this general look in my .25 game is a V(alkyrie)3(rd generation), V3m is a smaller (mini) version, SD is for Satellite Deployment (or any deployable / retrievable payload really), V3m-A(F/P) is for atmospheric only fuel/passenger version, and X usually designates a smaller version with minimal equipment (docking ports, cargo bays, reaction wheels, batteries etc may be reduced or eliminated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1222-58-29-19.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1222-58-29-19.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor good measure here is the questionably designated V3m-X, weighing in at 8.6t unloaded and can carry a .7t payload to 85x85km with enough DV to deorbit and land back at KSC (I don\u0027t know the exact figure on this one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1505-02-01-25.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1505-02-01-25.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a family of these things. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-15T10:43:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2014 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Edetails no one but me cares about :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T09:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECongrats.
