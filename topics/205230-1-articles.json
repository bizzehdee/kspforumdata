For gameplay reasons, those should be as close to instant as possible (maybe exponentially decaying thrust, so it decays FAST to start but it won\u0027t totally stop producing thrust for maybe 10 seconds, which is fine for an engine you\u0027re using to land on a planet or moon).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIon engines and any other electric propulsion method included in KSP 2 should obviously have instant throttle response, as throttling it is as easy as controlling how much electrical power you send to the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLikewise, any engine where the fuel is simply pressure-fed and admission to the engine itself is controlled by solenoid valves (such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E obviously, but also ANY pressure fed hypergolic engine), should be not only as close as the game allows to instant as possible, but it should also not have your typical throttle response!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese kinds of hypergolic and monopropellant engines used in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and small satellite engines are usually NOT able to be throttled at all. They\u0027re either fully on, or fully off, and operation anywhere but those two regimes should be avoided unless transitioning quickly thru them to get to either of the two main operation states (startup and shutdown is fine only because it happens quickly, don\u0027t let these kinds of engines \u0022loiter\u0022 at like half the propellant flow rate or the engine might blow up because of a \u0022hard start\u0022 or more likely just provide unpredictable levels of thrust which will throw off your guidance).\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, there IS a way to use Time to result in a \u0022sort of variable\u0022 thrust engine that has quick response but can\u0027t throttle. You just need to use coarse Pulse Width Modulation on the flow of propellants, and therefore on the solenoid valves which are typically used to control the flow of propellants to hypergolic pressure fed engines. Pulse Width Modulation is a pretty simple concept actually. You decide on a frequency you want to actuate the control devices at (in this case solenoid valves), and then you simply vary the ratio between time on and time off (with the total still adding up to 100% of the time, if you don\u0027t end up with the total being 100% of the time, the only real thing that happens is the operational frequency will change, you\u0027ll still get your \u0022smoothly\u0022 varying control output, but because it makes the math more complex I won\u0027t be analyzing it or using it as an example). So let\u0027s say you want the simplest case, 50% of the maximum thrust out of the engine. That\u0027s easy, just send the solenoid valves a square-wave signal with the on-time 50% and the off-time also 50%. For 25% throttle, the on-time would be 25% and the off time 75%. For 75% throttle you\u0027d have the signal on 75% of the time and off 25% of the time. Full throttle would no longer be a square wave, instead it would just be a steady on signal, but to put it in the terms of the ratio, it would be 100% on and 0% off. Similarly, for zero thrust, you\u0027d have the signal on for 0% of the time and off for 100% of the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you can see, you just need to have the on-time be the same as whatever throttle setting you want.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPulse Width Modulation is also used on the fuel injectors of car engines with electronic fuel injection, with the help of a \u0022fuel air ratio table\u0022 programmed into the ECU from the factory, along with the additional \u0022fine-tuning\u0022 feedback signal of the oxygen sensors both before and after the catalytic converter (this is how the car can tell if the catalytic converter is doing its job, if both the \u0027before converter\u0027 and \u0027after converter\u0027 sensors are reading the same thing at the same time for a given duration under a set of programmed in test criteria (usually highway driving), the car will turn on the check engine light and spit out an OBD2 \u0022P0420\u0022 code, which is universal across all auto manufacturers for \u0022the computer thinks something\u0027s wrong with the catalytic converter\u0022. Now if there\u0027s actually something wrong with the converter is another matter, and that takes an auto mechanic to figure out, but usually the computer\u0027s right given the signals it has available to it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole point of \u0022why does it matter that a hypergolic pressure fed engine has to use pulse width modulation to get variable thrust levels out of it\u0022 is in the sound it puts out.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would only put out a constant \u0022rocket blast\u0022 or \u0022Hiss\u0022 sound at 100% throttle, anywhere from 1% to 99% and it would be putting out a fixed-frequency \u0022buzzing\u0022 sound and it would sound different depending on the throttle level (not different in frequency but different in \u0022texture\u0022 I guess, because your ear can tell the difference between a sound that\u0027s mostly on and a sound that\u0027s mostly off, even if they\u0027re at the same frequency from the same device).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause these are rocket engines and even the fastest responding ones have a \u0022maximum operating frequency\u0022 determined by their (rapid) startup and shutdown times, you\u0027d probably have the engine controller pulsing the fuel supply to them at maybe 40-60 hz. Nice crackly buzz sound too, because it\u0027s supposed to be a square wave. But in reality if you took a frequency analyzer to it you\u0027d find that it\u0027s actually the same rocket blast or hiss sound you\u0027d hear at 100% throttle, but interrupted with periods of silence or just the engine bell resonating.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m trying to say is that throttling an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster or something like the LV-1 Ant would be quite a different sound from your typical rocket engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if they want to simulate the induced vibration of the vehicle from that unsteady source of thrust, they could do that too.
