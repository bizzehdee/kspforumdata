That\u0027s what they call it now. In my misspent youth it was the Marshall Space Flight Center, and is part of the Redstone Arsenal. Anyway, this place has done a lot of the heavy lifting for the US space program, designing and testing everything from rocket engines to capsules. And today it has a very nice museum with all sorts of cool stuff in it, plus is home of \u0022Space Camp\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my vacation last week, I stopped in at this place (hadn\u0027t been there in 40 years).
