I have checked the thread at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75586-Master-Thread-Unresponsive-Kerbals-in-EVA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75586-Master-Thread-Unresponsive-Kerbals-in-EVA\u003C/a\u003E and done the fixes listed there, as well as installed the Stock Bug Fix Modules Add-on. When EVA I can still jump, turn RCS on and off, and turn headlamps on and off, but nothing else. I cannot control the RCS, however if I jump it will wobble back and forth on it\u0027s own. Anybody know what to do here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
