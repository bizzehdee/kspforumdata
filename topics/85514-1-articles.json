The game is playing perfect for me, but I fear this impending update will make my game unplayable until the modders can catch up to the new version. In the past, I rmemeber (I think) being able to go into the properties in steam\u0026gt;KSP and turn off the auto update feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when I go into \u0022steam\u0026gt;KSP\u0026gt;properties\u0026gt;update\u0022, it only gives 3 options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- always keep this game up to date\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- only update the game when launched\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- high priority --- update this game before others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I turn off the auto update? Is it even possible anymore, or am I going to be forced into updating and playing with broken mods... or disconnecting my internet while playing KSP (which would suck because I like listening to Pandora while playing)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?
