Target Heading not set to entered value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the ground, on the runway, I entered in Target Heading 90.00 as a direction. The entered value was immediately replaced with something else, about 90.44. This is not expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do know that the runway is not at 90.00, if this is the reason for the replacement, well as I said that is not what I expected to happen. Surely it is up to me to either enter the correct heading for the runway or exit the runway slightly off to one side?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Trying to use Yaw to help change heading is a bit odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay I initially have all the PID values in the top Yaw controller set to zero. I believe that results in no Yaw being set to assist heading change, that heading change uses Bank only. Accepting that premise I enter PID values in the Bank Controller and the bottom Yaw Controller. After observing craft performance I eventually arrive at values such that the craft performs heading changes with both the Bank Controller and Yaw Controller closely following the target set for them by the Heading Controller. This is expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I enter values in the top Yaw Controller in the belief that what I am asking is for Yaw to be used in addition to Bank in order to change direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I enter a small value for Kp only in the top Yaw Controller, I see a slowly increasing target for the bottom Yaw controller. Since the bottom Yaw controller already has values that previously faithfully tracked the target set for it to meet it continues to do so. The target for the Bank controller to meet is reduced from when not being used in conjunction with Yaw to control direction. This is expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I increase the Kp in the top Yaw controller something unexpected happens. The target for the Bank Controller to meet changes to the other direction. It is as if Pilot Assist is saying to itself, \u0022hey too much Yaw for the desired change in direction being set by the Heading controller, I will compensate by setting an opposing target for the Bank controller to bring the rate back down\u0022. Hmm. Probably correct but for the following.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I increased the Kp in the top Yaw Controller is because after the desired heading had been achieved, the bottom Yaw Controller had a target set for it to meet that was not zero. My belief is that Kp was for proportional and would be therefore zero when the error was zero. That would be when I was going in the direction I had set for the Heading controller to meet. What appeared to happen was this. The error was initially not zero as we were not at the desired heading. Top Yaw controller set a target for the bottom Yaw controller to meet. That target was initially small but slowly increased over time. This increase occurred despite the error in heading decreasing as I was indeed turning towards the desired heading. The target was not zero when the error in heading became zero as I flew in the desired direction. I passed the desired direction. The target for the bottom Yaw Controller to meet was then slowly decreased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe I have observed that even if the error is constant, the set point for the second controller is increased. This would be experienced as watching the target for the bottom Yaw controller increasing whilst the direction remained unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also believe I have seen that the initial set point for the second controller is not the maximum Kp. This would be experienced as watching the target for the bottom Yaw controller start out small and slowly increase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought the following took place. I set a direction for the Heading controller to meet. In order to change heading the Heading controller sets a target for the Bank controller to meet. The Heading controller does this in two steps. First it calculates a response to the error in direction vs heading, based on it own PID values. Second it alters the response to something it can send to the Bank controller as a target for it to meet. The top Yaw controller sets a target for the bottom Yaw controller to meet. Again, first it calculates a response to the error in direction vs heading, based on it own PID values. and second it alters the response to something it can send to the bottom Yaw controller as a target for it to meet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is clear to me that what I thought was happening is not what is really happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone tell me exactly how the four heading controllers behave please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might need to be aware that during the process of arriving at \u0027good\u0027 PID values I take a lot of time. After entering new values I observe performance. I then relaunch. I observe performance again. I make small changes. I relaunch. Lots and lots of launches. I mean a lot, I have spent roughly a week of say six hours a day per craft. Sometimes the performance sends me back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. I make slight changes, which include changes to centers of wet/dry mass, lift and thrust. Rotating wings, viewing static stability analysis. More launches. In other words this is not a new craft, nor is it something I have fiddled with for a couple of hours. Obviously I could be holding strange notions of what I should be aiming for and what to adjust to achieve those aims.
