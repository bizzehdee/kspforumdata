Captain (now admiral or so) Archer will as such wear a pale yellow jacket or something like this. The breastpatches will retain their ENT-era form until probably the late 2180\u0027s, where it will be replaced with the smooth \u0022rucksack-bearer\u0022 style patches. Until around 2200 the ship\u0027s insignia is worn on the shoulder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the 2210\u0027s the uniforms will slowly start to go towards the Kelvin-era ones with a temporary colour switcheroo - the colours would become darker. By 2238-2240 the colours would be brought back to the ones used in the late 22nd century. The uniforms would go into their Pike era and then into the early TOS era.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T06:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ll find that the 2170s were officially the Federation\u0027s \u0022dress down decade\u0022 and most people just wore jeans and a t-shirt.
