I reproduced the bug and here are the steps i took to reproduce it. Before i did this procedure i had a sandox game created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Start the ARM training mission 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Start the burn at full throttle, optionally turn psychics warp to any speed you want, i went for 4x and wait until the nuclear engines start to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.
