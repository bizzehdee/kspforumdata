However, on my most recent design, which is supposed to be able to get to the Mun or Minmus, the nuclear engine that powers it uses liquid hydrogen, and the efficiency drops drastically. I am fairly certain that this is due to Interstellar, and I would like to get rid of it. The problem is, I don\u0027t know what to delete.
