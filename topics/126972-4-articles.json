So they demoted it from \u0027moon\u0027 to \u0027moonoid.\u0027 Nobody likes to say moonoid though, so we just call it a rock. Same thing almost happened with the Orange Moon, people kept mistaking it for Duna.

The look he got from the shopkeep, a look that said \u0027this ain\u0027t a library ya cheap so-n-so,\u0027 almost made him pull it back out and buy it. Yet he was the famously dead Thomlock so he just brushed it off and followed Macfred towards the exit. \u0022What has this got to do with me anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shopkeep moved to intercept them and Thomlock instinctively reached for his wallet.

Though still limited to 32-bit, NT-4 did allow for multitasking by crew members and used the new shell developed way back in 95. And it included double the snacks for double the crew.

So they recruited two, and picked up three \u0022pilots\u0022 to fill out the Astronaut Corp\u0027s bunks.
