I know I need a windows disk for that, and I want a windows 7 disk, the computers are 2 laptops and a desktop. I know one laptop is 7 and I\u0027m pretty sure the other is 7 also, but the desktop is XP. Would I be able to instal windows 7 into a computer that originally had windows XP or would that somehow not be compatible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relin","CreatedById":89684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T22:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo long as the hardware will support W7 (RAM and chipset are typically the deciding factor), all you\u0027d need is the \u0022upgrade\u0022 version of Windows for that.
