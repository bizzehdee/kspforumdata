With a cargo bay capable of holding a wide range of missile types and sizes, as well as the style to match any modern orbital fleet, the Sabretooth is sure to satisfy the needs of any space warfare commander, anywhere. Tailored to precise, surgical attacks on distant targets, the Sabretooth is the stealthy ranger of the battlefield.\n\nOperational Guide\n\n- the Mk I Sabretooth is launched with an orange fuel tank in its cargo bay to ensure at least a 90x90 orbit around Kerbin. This orange fuel tank can and should then be emptied and ejected while in orbit to be replaced by the armament alternatives seen appropriate by the user.\n\n- the Mk I Sabretooth can perform an emergency ascension maneuver at sustained \u002B25-30 degrees to orbit, but additional adjustments may be necessary. (note: experimental pilots only ever conducted this type of ascent, so there may be more optimal flight paths)\n\n- there is currently only one large docking port, so it is advisable to design refueling and armament utilities accordingly.\n\nFuture Versions\n\n- the upcoming Mk II Sabretooth will have more docking ports, including airstream shielded ports outside the cargo bay to ensure rapid and practical refueling capability.\n\n- the engine system will be made partly modular, so that nuclear propulsion can be used instead of the current transatmospheric alternative.\n\nAscension Corporation Production Licences\n\n- commanders may modify, add to and remove from the construction as seen fit and share these modifications freely as seen fit.\n\nLink\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230227-sabretooth-class-missile-cruiser](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230227-sabretooth-class-missile-cruiser)\n\n(Link to project main page)\n\nAlbum\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
