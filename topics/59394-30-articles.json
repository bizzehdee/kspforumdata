Obviously the replacement will have to be under an open source license to prevent this kind of silliness with things being abandoned. Also, I\u0027m mostly interested in Real Solar System, so if anyone has suggestions on who I should contact to get their feature wishlist in a planet-adder-modder-thing, please let me know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to just sort of \u0022appear\u0022 like this; I\u0027ve been on an extended KSP hiatus to study for a medical licensing exam, so I had no idea that this mod was no longer being maintained until I just went to get it today... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, note that I am not expressing an intent to design any planets other than what may be trivially necessary to test the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy email address is \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a58092e7cad5d1cccacb8092e1\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u00221775656e74723964747f65787273726557707a767e7b3974787a\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E if you wish to contact me directly.

Whether or not this is the way you want to do it, it\u0027s already an inbuilt editor, with an ability to clone planets. While this is not Aftokinito\u0027s vision, it would be a great start for replacing planet factory should that ever become necessary.
