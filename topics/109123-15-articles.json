The nosecone and adapter are, IIRC, much lighter than a Mk1-2 capsule.\n\nWell, it depends - the early missions, like [Saturn I SA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_I_SA-2) had upper stages filled with water, so I\u0027ll simply [add a tank.](http://i.imgur.com/PdglLsZ.png)\n\nSome missions like [AS-101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS-101_%28spacecraft%29) had boilerplate command/service module - I\u0027ll add a [simplified csm](http://i.imgur.com/F6ZensC.png) with a probe core hidden behind the LES.\n\nHowever [AS-203](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS-203) (corresponds to the SO-203 album on the page before) simply didn\u0027t have ballast.

But this morning the Sleipnir IB cleared the pad an carried the Odin CSM on a suborbital trajectory into space. \n\nAt the 2 minute, 10 second mark the first stage seperated, retro und ullage engines firing. The improved S-IVB stage carried the craft to a 260km apoapsis. All stages of the rocket worked flawlessly. \n\nOnce in space, the CSM activated its engine an fired it repeatedly to test the engine and its refire-ability. The RCS was also activated and thoroughly tested. This was the first time the CSM relied on its fuel cells during flight. 17 Minutes, 37 seconds into the flight the spacecraft neared the Kerbin atmosphere again, so the service module is seperated and the reentry procedure started. The capsuled entered at a rather steep angle, testing the heat shield for future high speed reentries from transmunar trajectories. \n\nThe parachutes deployed as planned an the capsule splashed down 20 minutes and 48 seconds after launch, south-east of the [Ubacia island](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71685-Most-Detailed-Kerbal-Border-Map-in-History).\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
