In fact, I have heard that exact phrase used to describe both the period between 1947-1950 and the events of 1968 before. Yet looking back, there is a recognition there was quite a bit of drama going around, and things were not nearly as bad as they appeared at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContrary to the image conveyed by the media and officials, I don\u2019t think this world is driven by the decisions of a few people in power, and I don\u2019t think we are \u201Cdoomed\u201D or that the \u201Cend is nigh\u201D. An official can shout and make whatever decisions he wants, but it won\u2019t change the goodness in people\u2019s hearts, nor their basic morals*. And Pompeii might explode and Hiroshima might be obliterated, but people will not give up on living. Even if a group is split, those new divisions will support themselves and continue living- separation is not the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHumans are animals, but animals recognize basic norms and taboos necessary for survival. Even after seeing the most trashy of news feeds and headlines, I don\u2019t see a burning planet. I don\u2019t see savages ripping each other apart, fighting for the title of king of the hill, I see mishaps in what is otherwise a perfectly fine organism. Are there tribulations? Yes, but that\u2019s how Earth works. An apex predator such as a shark can be completely dominant in his environment but will still face problems, some that to a human might seem life threatening or gargantuan, yet the shark overcomes it simply as a matter of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I have heard \u201Crecognization of a lack of control\u201D mentioned in the \u201Cemotional support\u201D genre as being necessary to calm down, I will also say this. History reveals that on a grand scale, most events were preordained to a large extent*. A group of small men did not cause World War II, the attitude of all of humanity did. Of course, the present will soon be part of history too. Therefore as much as blame is thrown around and solutions are proposed with great imperative and spittle, it is likely all of what is happening is already determined and can not be changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut history also shows humanity is resilient. Rome or the Qing might fall, but the peoples of those places are still here. As I said, individuals alone are not responsible for change. Just as it has its \u201Cproblem children\u201D, humanity has its \u201Cgolden boys\u201D doing the work that needs to be done to make sure everyone is safe and sound. You alone will not have a great impact on the course of history, and therefore do not need to be concerned to the extent that it burdens your emotional state**.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*This does not come out of the traditional study of history. It is only when asking \u201Cwhat if?\u201D that I have seen realization that things could not have changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**I mean this in a factual way, not a belittlement or something. Also, if you happen to be the leader of some grand social movement, and are anonymously engaging in discussion in this here spaceflight game forum, such is not the case and you are doomed to stress and the emotional short stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T05:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy kids taught me a new phrase...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Touch Grass\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt apparently means that the recipient of the suggestion has been online way too much lately and is losing touch with reality / things that are really important.\u00A0 IOW - log off, go outside and \u0027touch some grass\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really good advice!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T06:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout getting into specifics that might lead things into political discussions (any conversation about what groups of people should do is, by definition, politics), try to find local groups that you can work with to solve what you see as the issues that need to be dealt with.\u00A0 Spreading effort out amongst a group is going to be a lot easier than trying to do anything yourself, and we are a social species after all.\u00A0 Struggling by yourself against what seems like overwhelming odds is only going to lead to frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart small, local, and slow to build up a community, and don\u0027t worry about trying to change everything all at once.\u00A0 Find allies that will work with you not necessarily to reach your goals, but a goal that everyone can accept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T12:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224210250\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671346534\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232993\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022razark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, razark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart small, local, and slow to build up a community\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould we start here, and now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T18:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224210286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671368199\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022217956\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nazalassa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Nazalassa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould we start here, and now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch issues are effectively political and thus off topic, so no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zozaf Kerman","CreatedById":219910,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T22:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224210443\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671390045\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laikanaut\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Laikanaut said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently I gave away a large amount of savings to people fleeing the conflict in Europe, and made basic social connections with them.

When I say things are bad I mean on a long-term prospects for the species level-yes, climate change, also ecology generally, economics, and a general loss of empathy and community. I also mean this in a very long-term sense. Im in the building industry and its my job to design buildings and spaces that could in principle last hundreds of years. Thats the kind of timescale Im considering most of the time when doing flashing details, planning foundations and sitework, picking materials and systems that perform great now and can be swapped out and upgraded over time.\u00A0 The better I plan, the longer buildings can resist entropy and stay classic and within code the less likely they are to be torn down and replaced and gobble up a whole new pile of energy and resources. I designed houses in the Bahamas to resist Cat 5 hurricanes--wind loads, storm surges, all based around 50 and 100 year storms that now hit every 10-15 years. Hurricane Dorian sat over them for 3 days with winds up to 185mph--tied for the worst storm in Caribbean history. 1/3 of all the houses on the island were flat on the ground and most of the rest had major roof damage and needed to be gutted. Thankfully the houses I\u0027d designed didn\u0027t take water, but one was within 3 feet of my worst-case scenario storm surge. I live in Vermont, listed one of the least vulnerable places to climate change, and even we can see things changing. No one used to need AC. In the 80s and 90s you used to have to put a fan on a couple of nights each summer. Now we have months at a time when it\u0027s over 75F at night. The winters are milder which means more ticks and agricultural pests, the moose are gone, many bird species are gone, we\u0027re losing tree species do to blight and lakes are choked with algae. Im not one of these folks who thinks a wall of water is going swallow up all our cities in 10 years. Im talking about the profound, ecological damage that will set in over the next 100 years. These things are changing slowly over the term of a person\u0027s life, but it\u0027s the blink of an eye ecologically.\u00A0And of course at the same time we\u0027re dealing with economic issues like energy, housing, education, health and end of life care.

I appreciate the optimism. Optimism is not pretending a problem doesn\u0027t exist. I am not an optimist on this front, but yes, thats me. I\u0027ve seen folks talk about climate change and plastic and sprawl and mass transit and green energy all my life and very, very little has been done. The Clean Air act was pretty cool. Appliances and light bulbs are more efficient than they used to be. But still energy consumption has stayed basically level since the early 80\u0027s. Sadly a lot of the reason for that is we\u0027ve simultaneously been exporting heavy industry to Asia. Renewables have only gone from 5% to 10% of generation over that period. I certainly don\u0027t see the world finally all rolling their sleeves up now. Sorry I haven\u0027t gone and read the whole thread (I am interested though). I completely agree things might recover if we stopped what we are doing, I just don\u0027t think we will? EV\u0027s and electrifying industry would help but both would require decarbonizing the grid. Someone mentioned using waste heat from nuclear and I think thats a great idea if it could be organized. The best things would be mass transit and much more sustainable building practices. One of the worst things we\u0027re up against is just good old planned obsolescence--everything is disposable, nothing is designed to last or be maintained or really even properly recycled. Any chance you\u0027ve read Cradle to Cradle? I mean damn that book came out 20 years ago, but its just too lucrative to make people buy the same garbage over and over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-20T23:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224211222\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221671566000\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, this thread is about \u003Cem\u003Eavoiding\u003C/em\u003E doomerism, not wallowing in it.
