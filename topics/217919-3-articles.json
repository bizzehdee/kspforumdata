I get the feeling that Intercept Games is rather new to the business of delivering working software.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn software development there is the \u0022general\u0022 rule that you can implement 80% of the functionality in 20% of the time and for the remaining 20% you need 80% of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I get the feeling that\u00A0 Intercept Games is not aware about that at all. Everytime we hear something like \u0022almost finished\u0022 or \u0022we have something which should work\u0022. That means you have reached the 80% which only need 20% of the time. The 80% of the implementation is the \u0022works for me\u0022 state, but in order to make customers happy you should reach more than that. And that requires a lot more time than the initial feature!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease take into consideration that these \u0022bugfixes\u0022 are not some minor issues which will be \u0022fixed soon\u0022 because you think the main feature is already there. Every feature implemented in the game right now will take a lot of time until it reaches a point where customers are happy. You have done the 20% of time to implement the 80% of the features which are in the game right now. But you will need way more time to come to a point where customers are happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socraticat","CreatedById":176118,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-23T22:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ITji8wequWw?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 DOOM!\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jockel","CreatedById":131418,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-23T23:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224296520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687549106\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226561\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GGG-GoodGuyGreg\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, GGG-GoodGuyGreg said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u2019s give the man a chance to tell us what happened before accusing that this was the idea all along.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly he\u0027ll likely not answer you.

I want KSP 2 to be a success but my relationship with this game is a rollecoaster and with yesterday\u0027s 0.1.3 patch I have more mixed feelings than ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.1.0\u003C/strong\u003E was a catastrophe for me. I have an older machine (when I bought it in 2016 it was crazy, I7 with 2 x 1080 cards in SLI, about one month after they came out, truely obscene for the time back then, only SSDs, 32 GB RAM, full water cooling, still a very respectable system which I use daily for both work and games and I can play most games very very well on it, KSP 1 runs with loads of mods smoothly and as I said I love it) and when I fired up KSP2 for the first time I had a slide show with single digit FPS when I looked around and pointed the camera towards Kerbin. Not many features at all (but I knew that of course and the long time it will take to get everything we were promised). I played for less than 3 hours, was quite sad and started waiting for updates. Did not get a refund because I want you to get my money (although the price for that quality was borderline insane) and see it as an investment into the future of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.1.1 and 0.1.2\u003C/strong\u003E. were steps in the right direction. I was optimistic that we are getting somewhere, performance improved a little bit and (still without meaningful content) I could at least build a few non-complex craft, fly them, crash them and have a bit of fun.

I now have some 30 - 40 FPS and it feels playable and enjoyable (still only built a few \u0022your first rocket\u0022 types of craft to test stuff, done nothing \u0022serious\u0022 yet). I even registered here on the forum and wrote several bug reports and commented on some from other people as I really want to do my part now in helping finding bugs and reporting them so your devs can fix them (I work in IT and am in a role between customers and our devs so receiving and communicating bug reports and their fixes as well as solving problems is my daily business).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this version has also filled me with great doubts. The release day was postponed 2 days because some major bugs needed to be fixed I read somewhere and they had to pass QA.

The camera bug took me exactly 2 key presses before I even launched my first craft. Make a craft, go to launch pad, press M for map, press M again to leave map and your camera is 180 degrees turned around in the middle of the launch tower. This bug is so frustrating that it kills a lot of my enjoyment when after every map switch the camera points into the default direction and the view looks nothing like what it did before entering map mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy very first test craft (the fun craft that everyone builds, a capsule, parachutes, decoupler, one tank, one engine, built in 1 min by everybody) was launched and I flew to orbit, deorbited, decoupled and wanted to slow down and land. That\u0027s when I found out that there is no drag for the command pod in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The pod accelerated till it got grabbed near the surface and blown into orbit again by some magical force (documented in the bugs reports forum and in many videos on Reddit and YT meanwhile). This is the most basic thing you can do in Kerbal Space Program. It does not get any more basic than this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHow is it possible that such a game breaking bug can make it into a release version\u003C/strong\u003E (especially since the patch explicitly states that a lot of aero rework was done and therefore I guess everything was tested and tested again and again....)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s where I stand now. I am happy about the technical improvement (30 - 40 FPS vs. single digt ones) but worried that even the most basic physics bugs do not get caught before a release of a patch more than one month in the making. What shall I expect from more complex topics in the future? Must I assume they are broken on release as well if QA is unable to find even basic bugs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am still loving the game but again I am in the \u0022waiting for things to get better\u0022 mode. No content added yet that will make playing meaningful (science mode.....) and a game state that prevents me from landing the most basic Kerbal space craft. This is a huge blow to my morale. I personally will stick around and wait for everything getting better but I fear many players will not and even more people will lose interest in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlease have a look at your internal QA processes, get things in order in that department and make sure that such game breaking bugs do not find their way into 0.1.4 and beyond.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-23T23:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224296433\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687545900\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nate Simpson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Nate Simpson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome players have also correctly noted that the orbital decay and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E transit trajectory bugs are still present in v0.1.3.0 - while we had high hopes for an eleventh-hour breakthrough, neither fix made it across the finish line in time.

I want KSP 2 to be a success but my relationship with this game is a rollecoaster and with yesterday\u0027s 0.1.3 patch I have more mixed feelings than ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.1.0\u003C/strong\u003E was a catastrophe for me. I have an older machine (when I bought it in 2016 it was crazy, I7 with 2 x 1080 cards in SLI, about one month after they came out, truely obscene for the time back then, only SSDs, 32 GB RAM, full water cooling, still a very respectable system which I use daily for both work and games and I can play most games very very well on it, KSP 1 runs with loads of mods smoothly and as I said I love it) and when I fired up KSP2 for the first time I had a slide show with single digit FPS when I looked around and pointed the camera towards Kerbin. Not many features at all (but I knew that of course and the long time it will take to get everything we were promised). I played for less than 3 hours, was quite sad and started waiting for updates. Did not get a refund because I want you to get my money (although the price for that quality was borderline insane) and see it as an investment into the future of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.1.1 and 0.1.2\u003C/strong\u003E. were steps in the right direction. I was optimistic that we are getting somewhere, performance improved a little bit and (still without meaningful content) I could at least build a few non-complex craft, fly them, crash them and have a bit of fun. Satisfied but quickly bored I waited for this new update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.1.3.\u003C/strong\u003E came out yesterday and I quickly saw that performance was really boosted. I now have some 30 - 40 FPS and it feels playable and enjoyable (still only built a few \u0022your first rocket\u0022 types of craft to test stuff, done nothing \u0022serious\u0022 yet). I even registered here on the forum and wrote several bug reports and commented on some from other people as I really want to do my part now in helping finding bugs and reporting them so your devs can fix them (I work in IT and am in a role between customers and our devs so receiving and communicating bug reports and their fixes as well as solving problems is my daily business).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this version has also filled me with great doubts. The release day was postponed 2 days because some major bugs needed to be fixed I read somewhere and they had to pass QA. And here is my biggest concern\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI have no faith in your QA process anymore.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me explain why: It took me literally \u003Cstrong\u003E3 minutes of playing this latest update yesterday to discover 2 major bugs\u003C/strong\u003E that are reported many times by now in the Bug Report forum. The camera bug took me exactly 2 key presses before I even launched my first craft. Make a craft, go to launch pad, press M for map, press M again to leave map and your camera is 180 degrees turned around in the middle of the launch tower. This bug is so frustrating that it kills a lot of my enjoyment when after every map switch the camera points into the default direction and the view looks nothing like what it did before entering map mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy very first test craft (the fun craft that everyone builds, a capsule, parachutes, decoupler, one tank, one engine, built in 1 min by everybody) was launched and I flew to orbit, deorbited, decoupled and wanted to slow down and land. That\u0027s when I found out that there is no drag for the command pod in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The pod accelerated till it got grabbed near the surface and blown into orbit again by some magical force (documented in the bugs reports forum and in many videos on Reddit and YT meanwhile). This is the most basic thing you can do in Kerbal Space Program. It does not get any more basic than this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHow is it possible that such a game breaking bug can make it into a release version\u003C/strong\u003E (especially since the patch explicitly states that a lot of aero rework was done and therefore I guess everything was tested and tested again and again....)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s where I stand now. I am happy about the technical improvement (30 - 40 FPS vs. single digt ones) but worried that even the most basic physics bugs do not get caught before a release of a patch more than one month in the making. What shall I expect from more complex topics in the future? Must I assume they are broken on release as well if QA is unable to find even basic bugs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am still loving the game but again I am in the \u0022waiting for things to get better\u0022 mode. No content added yet that will make playing meaningful (science mode.....) and a game state that prevents me from landing the most basic Kerbal space craft. This is a huge blow to my morale. I personally will stick around and wait for everything getting better but I fear many players will not and even more people will lose interest in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlease have a look at your internal QA processes, get things in order in that department and make sure that such game breaking bugs do not find their way into 0.1.4 and beyond.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI very much agree with this, I myself also ran into a few gamebreaking bugs literally within minutes of playing, and trust us its not just us 2 many people have had the same experience, you really have to get QA in order\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-24T11:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224296684\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687575631\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149464\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skystorm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Skystorm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/226646-running_bird/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022226646\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/226646-running_bird/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@running_bird\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0This is not the release version.\u00A0 This is Early Access.\u00A0 And that issue *IS* fixed.\u00A0 So yes, it will be fixed by release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy wording was bad.
