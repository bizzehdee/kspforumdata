I was actually surprised it could take the Kerbin Grand Tour on so little fuel. I had originally planned on adding a dozen or so more tanks, but they ended up causing lag (and were completely unnecessary).\n\nThe unwieldiness of the craft actually worked to my advantage--landing, especially on the Mun, had to be absolutely perfect.\n\nI whittled my orbit down such that I was coming in almost perfectly horizontal, so I could retro burn without tipping the plane up past a safe landing angle. Of course, timing was critical; if I burned too late, I\\\u0027d careen of the surface, and if I burned too early, I\\\u0027d come to a stop a hundred meters up and then plummet to the ground. I failed about a dozen times before hitting on exactly the right altitude to fire the engines--exactly 300m above the surface (!). After a furious burn, the tail of the plane stopped just a few meters above the ground, and the RCS kept the nose from falling too fast. With a gentle bump, I was on the Mun.\n\nAnd since the whole burn took all of fifteen seconds, it was an amazingly fuel efficient landing. I\\\u0027d love to see a landing computer in the final KSP, even if it\\\u0027s bulky or expensive; for larger craft, it\\\u0027s the difference between using two tanks of fuel for landing versus six or ten for a conservative hands-on approach.\n\nMinmus was much easier thanks to the lower gravity (and orbit velocities). Don\\\u0027t attempt landing on the Mun until you\\\u0027ve tried it on Minmus a few times. I didn\\\u0027t time the Minmus retro burn quite as perfectly, but I didn\\\u0027t need to; it was easier to eyeball things, and falling 10 meters at the end did no damage.\n\nThe orbit changes themselves took very little fuel. Once you\\\u0027re past a few million meters above Kerbin, a tiny bit of delta-v goes a very long way. On a small craft, you could go from the Mun to Minmus to an escape trajectory on a fraction of a tank as long as you time your burns correctly.\n\nFor as impressive as the Sawfish\\\u0027s tour was, it actually burned less fuel (for its size) than a typical Mun lander. In terms of power/fuel ratio, the Sawfish is roughly equivalent to an engine with five fuel tanks on top. There\\\u0027s no reason you couldn\\\u0027t do the entire trip with a small rocket, as long as you time the burns just right. As Kan? Jigor? would say, \u0027Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort\u0027.\n\nOf course, it won\\\u0027t be as cool as the Sawfish, but that\\\u0027s like saying you\\\u0027re not as cool as the Fonz--it\\\u0027s just a fact of life. 8)"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T22:04:37Z","Content":"By a pinky swear this went round kerbin but I will get a screeny of the orbit before I try to claim minimalist record.

It weighs 24.17 tons, and takes to the sky when it drops off the end of the runway.\n\nThe first prototype used 3 Mk2 Fuselage parts instead of 4 FL-T500s, but it couldn\\\u0027t run the aerospike for long enough to get into space. The Berkut can run the rocket \\*just\\* long enough to get into orbit and de-orbit, and the turbojets for long enough to get to 15,000m, where I deactivate them, then long enough to adjust the course once back in the atmosphere.\n\nI was trying to build a space plane all day long, but couldn\\\u0027t get it to work. This was the Berkut\\\u0027s maiden voyage, and I must say that she preformed splendidly.\n\n\u003E ![01-Takeoff.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/01-Takeoff.png)\n\u003E Accelerating away from the runway.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![02-RocketEngaged.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/02-RocketEngaged.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E A few seconds after I fired the aerospike rocket.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![03-Iminorbitsuckers.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/03-Iminorbitsuckers.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E I was jumping up and down and clapping my hands like a little schoolgirl right about here.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![04-About230kmx250km.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/04-About230kmx250km.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E I wish I could blame my irregular orbit on my rusty skills, but truth is I was never good at KSP. The orbit is roughly 230km x 250km.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![05-MoreSpess.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/05-MoreSpess.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Just chilling out in the final frontier.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![06-Bringingherinatmo.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/06-Bringingherinatmo.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E My rocket engine ran out of fuel, so this would have to do.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![07-TurningtowardsKSC.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/07-TurningtowardsKSC.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here she is back in the atmosphere, turning towards the runway, which is about 60km away.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![08-Tharsheblows.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/08-Tharsheblows.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Aaaaand there\\\u0027s the runway!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![09-Go-juiceofficiallygone.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/09-Go-juiceofficiallygone.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Originally, I wasn\\\u0027t going to bother trying to get anywhere near KSC, but since my re-entry brought me so close I decided \u0027why not?\u0027 This part had me worried, since I ran out of fuel at 5,000m with almost 40km to go.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![10-Iwassoclose.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/10-Iwassoclose.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Fortunately, I made it. Unfortunately, I\\\u0027m not used to gliding. I had already circled the runway twice, and was going in for a third when I dropped to the ground. You can see the runway behind the plane. Might could be I would have had more success if I had been using a joystick instead of my keyboard.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![11-Stats.png](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq254/Wolfguy95/11-Stats.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E And finally, my stats for the mission. \n\nOverall, I\\\u0027m very satisfied with this. I haven\\\u0027t even built a successful White Knight type craft yet, and I have a fully recoverable space plane.\n\nMaybe I\\\u0027ll try to build a Mun worthy space plane next. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
