However,do note that I would really appreciate some feedback -in such an early stage, it can only make the story as a whole better as I become beter through your advise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here is the first episode. Some more timeline and world-developing here, from the Kerbals part this time, followed by an extremely important plot point. Well, enjoy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EChapter 1: Party Crasher\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E{7th of Ager, 500 of Official Kalendar}\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E{Jebadiah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard Co., Refamnon, Auricea Shore, Kerbin}\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crowd had been waiting for at least an hour in front of the large stand that had been placed the previous day in front of the Junkyard. They had been tired of waiting that long, but they did not care. They had been also waiting standing up, but they did not care about it either. All they cared about was that they were waiting for one of the greatest milestones of kerbalkind to arrive in front of them; this was a moment of national pride all over Kerbin, but of all of it, they, citizens of Refamnon, had the chance to witness it first of all of them. And not only that, but they would do so in its very origin, too. Yes, this was a privilege only few had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were not only native citizens, in fact. A good amount of Kerbals had arrived from all over Kerbin to also have this privilege, ranging from the most widely renown historians, to the greatest engineers of their generation, to wealthy and Kerbin-widely famous and wealthy Kerbals of all types of proffessions who could afford doing the trip just for this. For the rest of the world, the event would be recorded by an array of static cameras, and a couple of recording drones flying overhead, and then relayed to all of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, this was an important day for kerbalkind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the waiting paid off. In the distance, they caught the image of an sleek black helicopter flying towards them. They all held their breath as the incredibly noisy but still oh-so elegant vehicle approached them, then, after hovering for a bit, sofly descended to the soft grass around the Junkyard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the inside appeared the President of the United Kerbin Democracy, Rindin Kerman himself, who approached the stand while followed by a giant row of clapping. Taking his position in front of the microphone, he cleared his throat and started speaking to the Kerbals in front of him -or in all of Kerbalkind for that mater, who could listen to him though their TVs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Greeting, fair people of the UKD. As you already know, I am here -and so are you- to celebrate a day of pure national pride for all of us; the 500 years from the discovery of the Technology Essence, right here, on the grounds where, in our days, the succesful Jebadiah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard Co. is established, and on the grounds of which you\u0027re standing on right now. This piece of machinery, left here by our ancestors, is the fragment of ancient technological wisdom and ingenuity that enabled us to thrive; this is the cog that geared us foard sto a better future. This, people of Kerbin, is the reason behind our current state! Let\u0027s welcome it once more, along with the owner of the junkyard, and descendant of the very man who discovered the Essence, Jebadiah Kerman himself!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn even greater row of clapping occured as Jebadiah Kerman exited the helicopter, carrying with him a battered piece of machinery that was known all over Kerbin. It had a cylindrical body, on which were a battered bowl-shaped device with an antenna sticking from the center -which they knew now, thanks to it itself, that it was a radio dish-, a large cylinder and a crippled antenna sticking out -a thermoelectric generator and a magnetometer, as they found out-, as well as a battered and charred heat-shield at the bottom -which they could not figure out yet. No matter how many times they had seen it, and how bad its condition was, the Kerbals were never too prepared or too eager to witness this marvel of technology, this evolution matrix, let alone from up close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Jebadiah carefully placed the device on the stand and took his position, President Rindin continued his speech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This, Kerbalkind, is the Evolution Essence. This piece of hardware, suring all those years of researching and reverse-enginering, has given us -and still continues to do so- new knowledge of sciences and engineering. Thanks to it, we-\u0022 he was interrupted by the Kerbal pilot inside th ehelicopter coming out and approaching the President.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m awully sorry to interrupt your speech, Mr. President, but there is something of grave importance I have to warn you about.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is it, Lanburr?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The helicopter\u0027s sensors caught a heat signature at an altitude of approximately 50 kilometers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002250 kilometers? Noone\u0027s got that far up before!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I aknowledge, Mr. President. However, this is not the important part.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then what is it?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It is descending at Mach 7, Mr. President. And as it seems, it is on a collision course with the Junkyard.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore President Rindin had a chance of responding to this piece of information, everyone looked up suddenly, to see a giant fire trail come from the heavens, approaching them at alarming speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the President was too startled to evacuate the citizens. But even if it wasn\u0027t, it was unlikely that anyone would hear as every single Kerbal present, including everyone watching the event live from their televisions, was standing frozen from awe, being unable to do anything other than follow with their eyes the fiery sphere as it came even closer, to eventually collide with the roof of the Junkyard, which it effortlessly pierced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
