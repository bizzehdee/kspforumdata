Then I hit the same problems other people have been facing. In the upper atmosphere, the \u003Cem\u003EEveris I\u003C/em\u003E was completely unable to pull up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time I was low enough that I had enough control to pull up, the drag on the plane was incredible. It overpowered the planes engines: Jeb could glide it for half a minute or so by putting it into a brief dive to accellerate, but not much more than that. On the bright side, it was rediculously easy to land: I think spaceplane landers are a decent way to go when it comes to landing on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=33545\u0026amp;stc=1\u0026amp;d=1348564071\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=33545\u0026amp;stc=1\u0026amp;d=1348564071\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a *proper* Eve-capable plane will require a very different design to a Kerbin-capable plane: something with minimum drag and maximum thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[b]Leaderboard:[/b]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERedDwarfIV - The Kittyhawk - [i]Touchdown[/i]\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-26T22:37:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2012 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Quasar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T01:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\\o/ Been working on one, just some final tweaks left to try out.
