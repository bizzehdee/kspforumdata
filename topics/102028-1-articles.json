If it\u0027s the former, **KSP/Alpha/Cutoff** will work, but if it\u0027s the latter, **KSP/Diffuse** will suffice.\n\n(A transparent shader for the flag quad is ideal if you expect your part to use the NASA meatball logo, which is intended to be transparent outside the blue circle.)"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T15:30:39Z","Content":"pre-contract agency flags work fine with KSP/Alpha/Cutoff shader; contract agency flags work with KSP/Alpha/Translucent(specular) shaders, but not always with Cutoff shader. \n\nin the part in the image, did you extrude a face on the main mesh and split it off to a flagDecal object? if so, it\u0027s because you left the hole behind it and you are seeing the back face of the other side of the part through the interior.

It seems the shader doesn\u0027t render anything on the same part behind it with transparency. I\u0027ve tried the translucent ones and those don\u0027t render the flag at all.
