After launching and have a fairly small spacecraft after many stages I am controlling my\u00A0spacecraft and it just seems to turn to jello. It starts to wobble and just spontaneously explodes. Small wobble turns to uncontrollable wobble, shut off engine and it just keeps on. No preventing it. It just wiggle/wobbles and explodes. I have never had this happen before breaking ground. Maybe this is just a coincidence, at least I hope. 1500 hours, no mods, and this happens within a few hours of breaking ground. I have been crazy busy with work for quite some time\u00A0so I wouldn\u0027t know\u00A0anyway. I know a company bought the game recently but I hope they didn\u0027t just screw it up.
