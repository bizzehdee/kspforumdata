Are you comparing them in the same position/orientation in the VAB/SPH?

Save copies of them as PNGs, and you now have actual samples to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how to actually get your parts to look stockalike, it depends on on what level of quality you\u0027re aiming for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The quick and dirty method is to copy and paste entire sections of the stock textures, and remap your own UV islands accordingly. For instance, the SDHI SMS Pod Boost Protect Cover\u0027s texture was based on a hacked-up copy of the stock 2.5m nose cone, with additional smudging to represent additional weathering and extra graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You can, of course, use Photoshop\u0027s eyedropper tool to manually sample colors from the original for use in your mod part; shadows can be baked in Blender via Ambient Occlusion, while scratches and dings will need to be painted by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
