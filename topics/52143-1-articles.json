Because signals don\u0027t go on for ever into space what about when you are really far away from Kerban you should be out of range and will get a message when so and this may require you to build satellite system to communicate with the ship and Kerban and the satellites will relay the signal back and forth to kerban. Please post your suggestions about this and if that would be a good idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
