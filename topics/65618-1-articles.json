Near the end he figures out how long it would take to bring the Sun and Alpha Centari to relative rest using this method. Targeting the mass streams is evidently\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 just an engineering problem. Conclusion: it would only take about 1 kyr to bring the two systems to relative rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Invader Myk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Invader Myk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOf course, this assumes that the new Venus hill-sphere allows for a Martian moon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the Hill sphere is an excellent approximation for satellite stability, I think it might not be valid when the \u0022satellite\u0022 is fully 1/3rd the mass of the \u0022primary\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E180 degrees (L3) isnt stable.
