The scoring system is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet into solar orbit of inclination 90 or 270 degrees. One point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularise your orbit. One point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional: Lower periapsis to below 5.2 million km, over either pole. Five points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional: Crash a stage into the Sun (can be done before you initially circularise). Five points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional: Return to Kerbin. Ten points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional: Use a gravitational assist. Twelve points per assist. Fifteen points for every close assist (within half a radius of the body).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your command module is manned, there must be an advanced SAS above or below it, to simulate a life support. This may be jettisoned no more than one hour before returning to Kerbin, should you choose to do so. Part packs may be used, as can Mechjeb, but Ion engine packs may not be used, unless the fuel used is finite .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shouldn\u0027t be too difficult, I managed the first one with my launch stage. In 100,000x, if you go to a high altitude for your plane change, expect a transit time of around half an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaderboard (Not including my attempt)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
