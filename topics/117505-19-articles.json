I confess to only eyeballing the plane match with Duna.. at the time, I was more focused on getting a close-approach at all, than thinking about things I should have considered. The eyeball test indicated I was pretty damn close.. but as seen, by the time Hermes reaches Duna, \u0022pretty damn close\u0022 isn\u0027t good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I dumped all my intermediate and testing quicksaves, and loaded up the quicksave made immediately after exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I told MechJeb to set up a plane-matching node with Duna at the upcoming AN, and PreciseNode told me this was going to involve lots of decimal places. So I set MJ to burn with an accuracy of 0.005, and locked the engine outputs at 6% thrust. That increased the burn time to over 20 seconds, which I felt would give me some precision control, and I was right.. using Flight Engineer to watch the numbers, beginning from an inclination of 0.01937, the burn ended on 0.06000.

(it\u0027s a lot of pictures, the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/P65S0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETylo album\u003C/a\u003E shows the timing trick best, and the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/D6WaS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBop albu\u003C/a\u003Em shows the launching into the flyby plane best.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You might have to wait up to one planetary day (in this case 1 Sol) for the ascent vehicle (DAV) to move (on the planet\u0027s surface) into the plane of the flyby vessel, so start watching for the right launch time at least that far ahead. Plus you will need to be able to orbit the planet at least twice after you reach orbit before the flyby vessel reaches periapsis. Once you see the DAV in the right spot, launch into the flyby plane. You\u0027ll have to figure out the launch azimuth. Put the DAV into a circular-ish orbit that is tangential to the flyby perapsis. (so for instance if the flyby periapsis will be 800 km then put the DAV into an 800x800km orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Observe the first time that the DAV will be at the tangent point to the periapsis of the flyby path. Observe the time that the flyby vehicle will be at that point. If you took off early enough, the flyby vehicle will not arrive there until more than one DAV orbit period later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Now place a maneuver node in the DAV\u0027s flight path that is right at the tangent point to the flyby vessel\u0027s path. Make that maneuver adjust the period of the DAV so that it will do one orbit of the planet and be back at the tangent point at the moment the flyby vessel will be there. It\u0027s nice if this \u0027timing\u0027 orbit requires roughly half the prograde thrust that catching up to the flyby vessel will take, so you can split one big maneuver into two half-sized ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I find a couple of small (~1m/s) tweaks are often needed about a half-orbit and quarter orbit before the rendezvous. Now just accelerate up to the speed of the flyby vessel as it comes screaming at you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is that the timing orbit only has to be entirely within the SOI of the planet, and as long as the rendezvous point is not too high there will be a very large range of possible periods for the timing orbit, so you can compensate for any timing errors that the launch time forced upon you. Note that the lower the flyby will be, the better for the launch vehicle since it will get more benefit from the Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T01:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that, PLAD..

I can relate to that..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter my earlier optimistic post, things started to go wrong.. the nice tight approaches I thought I had set up, once in close to Duna, turned out to be nothing like the numbers I\u0027d gotten earlier. I could re-load one particular quicksave (my \u0022best\u0022 result!), and every time I loaded it, it gave me one of three different Duna periapses.. with a total variation of several hundred kms! I was tearing my hair out, and every new attempt I made to create a new intercept ran into similar problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few hours of this kind of frustration, I decided to scrap all my quicksaves, and start over from scratch at the mid-course correction point. More frustration ensued. No matter what I did, I couldn\u0027t get an intercept I was happy with.. \u0022happy\u0022 being defined as a Duna periapse of 200km or less. Heck.. half the time I couldn\u0027t get a working intercept inside Duna\u0027s SOI! I tried not making any course corrections until about 45 days out from Duna, regardless of the fact that applying corrections so late would be more costly in fuel. Still no joy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuttering lots of bad words, I decided to ignore the recommendations I\u0027d read about course changes.. prograde and retrograde just weren\u0027t making me happy.. I was going to try radial adjustments again. That had worked for me once before, and the dV costs were a lot lower, too. I started fiddling with the numbers, and found I was getting encouraging results, but boy was the damn thing sensitive to tiny alterations! I started working to 3 decimal places, locked the engines down to 6% output, and cranked MechJeb up to a tolerance factor of 0.0001m/s to try and get the fine control I needed. And it was working. Results started to improve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I noticed MJ was still a bit inconsistent around the final few seconds of burn. I decided to shut MJ off with 0.2m/s to go, and finish the burn by hand. Better.. but still not great. And then, two things happened that, combined, gave me a real breakthrough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing was, I began seeing a pattern in the results I was getting. If the map said I had a periapse of 203km behind Duna, when I actually flew the route, I\u0027d get a periapse of 323km. If I was expecting 307km ahead of Duna, I got 187km, and so on. Every single result was a consistent 120km \u0027out\u0027, and the direction of the offset was consistent also.. Ok.. this I could work with! I\u0027ve no idea \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy\u003C/strong\u003E it\u0027s like this, but so long as it\u0027s predictable, I can adapt!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, I made one of those serendipitous discoveries that began, like so many scientific breakthroughs, with the words, \u0022hmm.. that\u0027s strange...\u0022 For some of you guys, this will probably be old hat, but I\u0027ve never seen this specifically explained anywhere.. for me, it was a revelation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I followed ships in, from the course correction point about 400 days before Duna, to the SOI change, to see how well my results stood up, a couple of times I\u0027d double-clicked on Duna to shift the map focus, so I could keep the action centred on screen. And whenever I did, my nice little periapse and SOI markers would vanish, to be replaced with a plain ol\u0027 intercept marker. Most annoying. But then, when I zoomed in some more, I noticed something odd. It wasn\u0027t easy to spot, because the colour was a fair match for the highlighted Duna, but there was a periapse marker on Duna! Zooming WAY in, I could see both SOI markers, with a neat line between them, with a periapse marker on it, alongside Duna! Even though Hermes was still a good two weeks from SOI. Kewl!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it gets better.. It turns out that if you have focus on the target planet, those markers are there right from the moment you set up the manoeuvre node. This gave me an idea.. I could set up the burn, halt MechJeb at 0.2m/s to go, zoom WAAAAYY in on Duna, even though its\u0027 position on screen was still 400 days away from intercept, and watch the course lines and periapse marker in real time, while I carefully worked the throttle on dead slow! And it worked! This was how I discovered that there was one limitation to that 120km offset.. if I tried setting the periapse 70km \u003Cem\u003Einside\u003C/em\u003E Duna, to get a 50km behind position, even though it subsequently \u003Cem\u003Etold\u003C/em\u003E me I had a 50km position, KSP didn\u0027t like that, and would give me a final result of about 180km anyway, when I actually got to SOI.. but other than that, I was golden. A periapse of just 10km behind got me a true result of 130km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I could super-fine-tune my periapsis, I discovered that the difference between 50km ahead of Duna, and 130km behind Duna, was something on the order of 5 \u003Cstrong\u003Emm\u003C/strong\u003E/s of dV. No wonder I\u0027d been having problems with prograde/retrograde earlier. I\u0027d been trying to drive pins in, with a sledgehammer.

You want to arrive at the periapsis point of the Hermes at the same time as the Hermes does. If you are not at exactly the right place on Duna\u0027s surface though, you will still have to coast for part of a circular orbit to the intercept time/place. From the sound of things you\u0027ve probably figured this out already, but here\u0027s what I\u0027d determine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) How long it takes you to get from launch into a circular orbit at the altitude of the flyby periapsis, both in time and angular distance around Duna. (For instance my last launcher took about 4 minutes and traveled about 12 degrees from the launch site to orbit circularization.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How far around the planet you have to coast from circulization to intercept. This will depend on where you are at launch, for instance if you have to launch from the other side of the planet you will then have to coast almost 180 degrees before intercept. From the coasting orbit\u0027s period you can then determine how long the coast will take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Now you have to iterate to find the proper launch time, since the earlier you launch the longer you have to coast, which means you have to launch earlier... since the coasting orbit altitude is set by the flyby periapsis a simple spreadsheet should be sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I want to stress that it would only be possible to go directly from launch to rendezvous in one burn if the Hermes flyby is timed such that you are sitting on Duna\u0027s surface just 12 degrees before the periapsis point exactly 4 minutes before the Hermes gets there (to use the numbers I mention above). Then instead of doing a circularizing burn you just keep burning to catch up with Hermes as it flies past you. If there is some really good reason why this is the only allowed launch profile (for instance does the launcher only get one engine ignition?) then the flyby of the Hermes will have to be adjusted to time it right. Let\u0027s see, Duna rotates once every 18 hours or so so you will have to be able to adjust your flyby time by \u002B/-9 hours and be accurate to within a minute or so... oh boy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s hear from the judges...does direct to intercept mean \u0027less than one orbit from launch to intercept\u0027 or does it mean \u0027one continuous burn from launch to rendezvous\u0027?

You want to arrive at the periapsis point of the Hermes at the same time as the Hermes does. If you are not at exactly the right place on Duna\u0027s surface though, you will still have to coast for part of a circular orbit to the intercept time/place. From the sound of things you\u0027ve probably figured this out already, but here\u0027s what I\u0027d determine:\u003Cp\u003E1) How long it takes you to get from launch into a circular orbit at the altitude of the flyby periapsis, both in time and angular distance around Duna. (For instance my last launcher took about 4 minutes and traveled about 12 degrees from the launch site to orbit circularization.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How far around the planet you have to coast from circulization to intercept. This will depend on where you are at launch, for instance if you have to launch from the other side of the planet you will then have to coast almost 180 degrees before intercept. From the coasting orbit\u0027s period you can then determine how long the coast will take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Now you have to iterate to find the proper launch time, since the earlier you launch the longer you have to coast, which means you have to launch earlier... since the coasting orbit altitude is set by the flyby periapsis a simple spreadsheet should be sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I want to stress that it would only be possible to go directly from launch to rendezvous in one burn if the Hermes flyby is timed such that you are sitting on Duna\u0027s surface just 12 degrees before the periapsis point exactly 4 minutes before the Hermes gets there (to use the numbers I mention above). Then instead of doing a circularizing burn you just keep burning to catch up with Hermes as it flies past you. If there is some really good reason why this is the only allowed launch profile (for instance does the launcher only get one engine ignition?) then the flyby of the Hermes will have to be adjusted to time it right. Let\u0027s see, Duna rotates once every 18 hours or so so you will have to be able to adjust your flyby time by \u002B/-9 hours and be accurate to within a minute or so... oh boy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s hear from the judges...does direct to intercept mean \u0027less than one orbit from launch to intercept\u0027 or does it mean \u0027one continuous burn from launch to rendezvous\u0027? I will note that NASA called the ascent method the LEM used in Apollo 14-17 \u0022direct ascent rendezvous\u0022, and that involved the LEM ascent stage going once around the Moon between launch and rendezvous, coasting most of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany, many thanks for the detailed analysis, PLAD.

Launch takes place a few hours at most before rendezvous. While we\u0027d love to replicate that, it obviously isn\u0027t going to be possible with the current launch site. So far as \u0022adjusting the flyby timing\u0022 goes, I wholeheartedly echo your sentiments.. oh boy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is that this is a scenario where, so far as possible, everything has been pre-set for the player.. a fun challenge for an afternoon\u0027s play, rather than something of brain-bending difficulty. The player\u0027s mission is simply to drive several hundred kilometres to the Ascent Vehicle site, in time to then be able to attempt a rendezvous with Hermes as it comes hurtling by.. in other words, Hermes is on rails.. it\u0027s their job to catch her, if they can. Even though in the story the Hermes crew make some emergency course adjustments to facilitate rendezvous, we\u0027d like to avoid having the player need to adjust the Hermes trajectory as well as fly the Ascent Vehicle. Certainly, after a successful rendezvous, they\u0027re going to have to make some small adjustments to Hermes\u0027 course to intercept Kerbin, but that\u0027s fairly trivial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably only a day or so away from releasing a beta gamesave, the purpose of which is simply to playtest the launch and try to work out the timings and techniques needed, in part so we can create some Kerbal Alarm Clock alarms tailored to the scenario. If you feel inclined, we\u0027d love to have you try it out and see what you think. The same invitation is extended to anyone else who\u0027d like to help playtest the scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T03:24:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 03:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
