Control your descent rate by pitch, level off just above burn-up altitude, and descend as your speed drops to keep it riding the edge of the fire. Stay at about 30,000m until you reach Mach 5, then gradually drop to 5,000m as you slow to Mach 2.

If have a dual tail, you just add the control surfaces not in symmetry and do the same as he suggested with the negative spoiler deflection. With careful placement you can put two control surfaces on one tail an simulate a split surface air brake like the NASA Shuttle had. The tail is the best way to ensure you don\u0027t introduce lift altering effects. I don\u0027t have a good picture but you can kind of see it here. This one has dual tail AND split control surface air brakes, you don\u0027t have to use both methods in one, if you have a dual tail, just two control surfaces in opposite directions will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ayL3np.png\u0022 alt=\u00226ayL3np.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-17T14:08:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2014 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T21:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas usual wonderfound and alshain have all the answers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E so is there ever a scenario where you want to use the surface mounted airbrakes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T21:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall-winged ships where you can\u0027t spare a control surface, lifting body ships that don\u0027t have normal control surfaces; Duna flyers; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if you just want more of \u0027em.
