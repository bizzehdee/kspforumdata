I would like to recommend instead the part gets named \u0022[name of ship] - [Letter indicator]\u0022 or \u0022[name of ship] - Debris [some number], if the part has no control parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo for example if I built an Apollo style Mun mission with a ship named \u0022MunLaunch1\u0022, when I staged the launch engines, they would get labeled \u0022MunLaunch1 - Debris 1\u0022 , \u0022MunLaunch1 - Debris 2\u0022 etc... Then when I undocked the lander module, the part I\u0027m controlling would get labeled \u0022MunLaunch1 - A\u0022, and the drive segment behind me would be labeled \u0022MunLaunch1 - B\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose that naming convention could run out of characters if you have like 27\u002B controlled stages, but even then the convention could be something like\u00A0\u0022MunLaunch1 - A1\u0022,\u00A0\u0022MunLaunch1 - A2\u0022 etc. Also I feel like a mission with more than 26 stages each with their own control part is being intentionally wacky.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case I think this would make it much easier to track missions with multiple components as well as know where various debris came from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T19:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour suggestion has been moved to the Suggestions sub.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"schlosrat","CreatedById":141963,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T23:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll second and third this recommendation!
