I\u0027d make this a Poll but I\u0027m relatively new to both KSP and the forum, so I\u0027m too much of a newbie to figure it out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E So, how did you hear about KSP??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I learned about it in a very roundabout way. I didn\u0027t hear about if from a friend or watch a Scott Manley video. Instead I read an article online. About Minecraft. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Specifically about some crazy idiot trying to walk all the way to the Farlands. I thought this was insane so I checked out a video. After watching my first Kurtjmac episode I thought he was a genius and now I look forward to his episodes. After a while I checked out some other games he covered and stumbled upon, you guessed it, KSP. I watched the first video in his series and thought, \u0022Oh I can do MUCH better than that!\u0022 and downloaded the demo. In fact I did much worse but I was hooked from the start. After making it to the Mun I downloaded then version .23 and have been addicted ever since.
