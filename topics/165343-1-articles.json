The tiny rover was connected with a Jr. docking port. As soon as I undocked the rover, it started spinning uncontrollably. I turned on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and it got worse. The rover spun around like a tornado, breaking its own solar panels and taking out 2 of the 4 on the lander. I finally slowed it down by turning off torque. I looked at the rover to investigate, the front wheels were somehow turned 90 degrees of center. The rover is now impossible to drive because the wheels are borked. I will put a screenshot of the aftermath later, but any ideas of what might have happened?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-10T02:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\none thing that can sometimes cause breakdancing rovers is part clipping and that usually only becomes a problem after undocking. In the past I\u0027ve also seen odd things happening if you have a control mod like mechjeb active and having the rover\u0027s control point facing up/down (as might happen after undocking). but it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve seen that happen so I thought that was cured. The wheels facing the wrong way does sound like it\u0027s being controlled\u00A0from the wrong control point, try right clicking on a forward facing control point (docking port, command pod, probe core, etc) and selecting control from here. Or if the wheels have been \u0022bent\u0022 out of shape by jumping around one way to fix that is to timewarp for a second, when you exit timewarp they should snap back into place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-10T03:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALT\u002BX disables trim - turning on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E also counters trim - you cannot set trim while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is active.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npart clipping has been known in the past to generate mysterious forces and at one point, was the founding principal for the \u0022kraken drive\u0022 which enabled a vessel to have infinite delta-v\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-10T03:58:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2017 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Xyphos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
