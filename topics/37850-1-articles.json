You need that much to get your horizontal velocity to where it needs to be, then to zero, then to the same amount, then back to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you launch at 45 degrees along the desired heading, stop your burn when your apoapsis reaches 20,000 \u002B your reference height (i.e. the altitude of your launch site). Note the time to apoapsis when the burn ends. Point your ship at the retrograde marker when you get to the apoapsis and when the time past apoapsis equals the amount of time before apoapsis at which you started your burn, begin your retroburn for landing. That oughta get you close to a safe landing roughly 40k away. That\u0027d be one hop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, though, the specifics are going to depend on the initial mass of the craft.
