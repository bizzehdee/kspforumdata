One could easily achieve this by having an atmospheric extractor for each planet. If the plugins (dlls) for mods could be written in python OR if cfg files could have simple embedded code in them to see what planet the active craft is on, I could very easily do exactly what you propose above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you didn\u0027t over simplify things at all. The difficulty is in how parts, plugins and the game interact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong those lines, if someone is looking for a dll project, I have some clear ideas on dll modules I\u0027d love to see if anyone is interested\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T18:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t have thought a different part would be needed for each planet, just a different list for the same part.

I definitely don\u0027t want to have a part for each planet. I _think_ the interstellar mod allows for planets with unique atmospheres, but the code to do so is rolled in with all the rest of the mod\u0027s code. I\u0027d love it if such things were offered on their own vs bundled, or at least bundled into a mod that focuses on similar things. For example, if the Kethane mod allowed for \u0022mining\u0022 of gasses, that would make sense to me since Kethane is already about recovering resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T03:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I haven\u0027t looked at the cfgs for Kethane, but from what I know it\u0027s fairly a expandable system. Multiple inputs, multiple outputs on converters. Multiple resources at any location on a planet. One problem would be that it only covers hex locations. I don\u0027t think it allows for \u0027all water\u0027 or any other surface terrain to have a material. Admittedly I haven\u0027t been solidly checking up on the Kethane development thread solidly recently, but I have up till maybe a month ago. It\u0027s certainly possible to say material is minable anywhere on a surface. Plus I\u0027m 99% sure you can also do a simple second check to see if the craft is \u0027in water\u0027 before mining so thus can only mine water based material when dunked. Similarly this should work, for example, when in a certain biome. Mechjeb can determine fairly easily which biome you are in so you can certainly make the check easily enough. Have this super imposed on a conventional kethane based map and you have a fairly complex system that should allow mulitple resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be tricky to get atmospherics via this method though. I think for that you should just simply use a look up table for each planet. From what I know of coding it shouldn\u0027t be that hard. From what I\u0027ve seen in KSP cfgs setting up such maps could easily be done in a cfg itself so it would be customizable. Getting a custom DLL to read such maps will be the hard part, and like I said I don\u0027t have direct experience in C# coding or anything specific to Unity or KSP. I really should knuckle down and learn it *sigh*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an insurmountable problem at least, and I think there are ways around most of the problems connected with this mod that are already available via mods or parts of mods that are already out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
