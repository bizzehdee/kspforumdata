Simply set the \u0022departure\u0022 and \u0022arrival\u0022 orbits to be identical and the automated supply run feature would probably interpret that as a \u0022keep this thing in this orbit\u0022 instruction, in other words it would allow you to \u003Cstrong\u003Eautomate station keeping\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, if you can set conditions for other actions to happen besides just keeping a course, you could set it up so that satellites that are almost out of propellant would execute a pre-planned de-orbit burn or send themselves to a \u0022graveyard orbit\u0022 with new satellites being automatically launched to replace them, or alternatively they could signal to send for a vessel to refuel the existing satellite (assuming you put a compatible docking port on it when you built the thing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would replicate quite well the #1 reason old satellites are decomissioned IRL (lack of fuel) without bothering the player beyond setting it up (unless they want to get involved in it manually, of course).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe #1 reason IRL satellites are decomissioned or go adrift is that they simply run out of propellant to be able to keep their \u0022orbital slot\u0022 in geostationary orbit (like most geostationary communications satellites), or lose the ability to maintain orbital altitude if in LEO (like Starlink satellites are designed to gracefully deorbit themselves if they malfunction, since that large solar panel creates quite a lot of atmospheric drag (which is a thing at those low orbital altitudes)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while your concerns are valid, I think the solution is already in existence (tho it might need some minor modifications).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: And yes, of course, they would have to increase the orbit radius of most/all of the moons of Jool (and any other gas giant with similarly close-orbiting high mass moons).\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever as far as I\u0027m concerned that doesn\u0027t constitute a \u0022change\u0022 to the KSP 1 solar system so much as it constitutes a change to make the physics make sense (because for a game that has a lot of realism in its orbital mechanics, the orbital configuration of Jool and its moons is not long-term stable AT ALL).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 2:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is probably the SINGLE concession to realism that I think should be made in KSP 2, because it is the one that is most impactful to the \u0022fly\u0022 aspect of orbital mechanics. Not life support, not random (or not so random) part failures, not \u0022removing metallic hydrogen from the game because that doesn\u0027t work like that\u0022, none of that matters as much as N-Body physics (and along with that having the solar system have a configuration that is compatible with N-Body physics).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again, Orbiter ALSO solved the orbital drift problem. You see, it had another option for the physics, \u0022orbit stabilization\u0022, which does pretty much what my \u0022automated station keeping\u0022 idea does, but it does it fully automatically. I\u0027m not sure how it works, maybe it just nulls out the influences of the gravity of the other celestial bodies when in a low orbit around a planet or moon (that\u0027s my best guess), but it sure did work to keep the ISS where it belongs around Earth without me having to do anything to it (back when I played Orbiter that is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe the best approach to N-Body for KSP is for it to only have an effect when it really makes a difference, which for my purposes would be \u0022twice the orbital radius of geostationary orbit on a non-tidally locked planet or moon\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause being able to park a satellite or an orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at someplace nice and stable like L4/L5 (or in an orbit around another lagrangian point, such as L1/L2) is just such a nice thing. Yeah the lagrangian points tend to be quite distant from a given planet, but there\u0027s just so many interesting things you can do with them, like the mentioned satellite or station (or colony) parking spots, or using them to create a \u0022grand tour\u0022 trajectory that use a tiny amount of propellant because the assists all basically pass thru lagrangian points of various planetary bodies and moons (there\u0027s plenty more you can do with them, I\u0027m just scratching the surface).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just don\u0027t want a player to find a neat trick that NASA used with regards to orbital mechanics, and be unable to replicate it (or disincentivized from replicating it) because of KSP 2\u0027s simplified orbital physics modelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 3!, Give it up for Edit 3!:\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou know, additionally, without non-spherical gravity sources, you can\u0027t even get a proper Sun-Synchronous Orbit (which is the ideal orbit for practically any kind of mapping satellite). Instead, you\u0027re forced to wait for the planet to turn under you, which if it\u0027s tidally locked will be a very long time indeed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that might only matter if we get ScanSat-like functionality in KSP 2, but I see no reason we shouldn\u0027t get something like that. Using a satellite to map a planet is a thing that takes some amount of time significantly longer than a player would be likely to just wait for, instead they\u0027d be doing something else in the background, it really shouldn\u0027t work like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E orbital resource scanner (the one you put in a polar orbit) works at all, that thing\u0027s far too quick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me counter with this. \u0022Full system n-body gravity is, of course, not planned for KSP2, as it would be overly compute intensive and also require complex station keeping on all vessels in orbit that, we feel, distracts from the fun of the game. However, we look forward to how players will deal with, or take advantage of, some of the interesting properties of the special cases where physics gets far more interesting than we\u2019ve grown accustomed to in the original Kerbal Space Program.\u0022 From\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022210281\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6638933025\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200602-developer-insights-4-%E2%80%93-ksp2-engineering/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3931395\u0026amp;embedComment=3931395\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3931395\u0022 style=\u0022height:320px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-09T22:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the developers said that, but believe it or not, they\u0027re not always right, or they\u0027re not fully explaining themselves, or they\u0027re perhaps not giving us the real reason, instead giving us \u0022a reason they know we\u0027ll accept\u0022 rather than the full honest truth, because they want their game to sell well or don\u0027t want to receive negative press or who knows what real reason they might do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s like I said. The developers could be (and I have already proven are) wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey may have said \u0022full system n-body gravity is ... overly compute intensive\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut have I not proven exactly the opposite of that, with my stated experience with Orbiter Space Flight Simulator, a game that came out LONG before KSP was even a glimmer in someone\u0027s eye?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t trust me, you can still go play Orbiter you know.

No, it\u0027s not Unity. I\u0027m not sure what exactly it is, it might just be a fully custom thing, since it is from a university professor after all (and IIRC the whole thing is mostly a one-man show aside from the mod authors).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s besides the point. The point is, if Orbiter could do it on a crappy school laptop that wasn\u0027t even state-of-the-art 16 years ago, then \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#d35400;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESO CAN KSP 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, with the gigantic advantage of massively more capable CPU\u0027s that even the least capable computer (that wouldn\u0027t even meet the minimum spec for KSP 1, let alone KSP 2) today has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy whole point is that the developers, in that moment, with that specific statement, stated something false.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is (once again) not hardware limitations that dictate that KSP 2 not have N-body physics. As I have proven (twice now) with my statements about what was possible with Orbiter Space Flight Simulator (back in 2006, on what was even then considered a \u0022potato laptop\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it is stationkeeping. But like I said, the \u0022routine supply run automation\u0022 could be adapted to provide automated stationkeeping, with a small amount of setup.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that\u0027s probably out too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my opinion that the main reason they aren\u0027t introducing N-Body into KSP 2 is because they simply don\u0027t want to, for whatever inscrutable reasons they may have in their own minds that they don\u0027t wish to share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the reasons they stated, can be easily either disproven by knowledge of the performance of other games, or worked around trivially using mechanics that are already stated to be implemented into KSP 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t see how they hold any weight, you\u0027ll have to come up with something better or I\u0027m settling on \u0022because I said so\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I might not have mentioned it, but \u0022Because I said so\u0022 is a reason that I hate.

I personally would like to play with n-body, but it don\u2019t think it would be a good idea for the base game. And plus, what does it matter if the devs didn\u2019t feel like implementing n-body? The current system does allow for a pretty reasonable approximation for a lot of common orbital paths, so I think it is fair to leave n-body to a toggle for a future update or mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-10T01:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome more off topic junk has been removed. \u00A0 \u00A0Please pay attention to the thread you\u2019re posting in. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zozaf Kerman","CreatedById":219910,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-10T20:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with the toggle, SciMan.
