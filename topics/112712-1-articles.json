First get co-planar. Then burn in some kind of a transfer orbit to get your ship into the same place at the same time. Then match velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T02:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the SoI size isn\u0027t any sort of limitation. There\u0027s nothing that says you have to do your whole burn while inside the SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Set up your approach trajectory so that it passes near Hale (admittedly, this is very finicky since it\u0027s such a tiny target)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. BEFORE you get to Hale, go to map mode, focus on Hale, and drop a maneuver node at periapsis that will circularize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now you\u0027ve got your maneuver node in place, long before you get to Hale. You can start your burn whenever\u0027s appropriate. If that means you need to start burning before you actually enter the SoI, no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest problem with Hale is that it\u0027s so lumpy (and has a SoI so tiny) that its higher \u0022hills\u0022 poke right up close to the SoI boundary. I find that if I have a ship in circular Hale orbit, and I switch away from it to something elsewhere, very often the ship just vanishes before I come back-- I suspect the game is eating it because it decided there\u0027s a collision (even though, eyeballing the path, it looked safe to me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\u0027re inside Hale\u0027s SoI, proceed with caution, and be wary of switching away while you\u0027re in orbit.
