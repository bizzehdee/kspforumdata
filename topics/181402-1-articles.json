The new parts do look great but as they move to completely overhaul all of the old parts, a new problem is emerging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts, as awesome as they appear, are becoming difficult to tell apart from the parts list. Which part goes with which size and which fuel tank is which, and so on. The old KSP parts, at least had the benefit of being \u003Cem\u003Eunique\u003C/em\u003E and visually distinct from one another. Though that\u0027s one issue players had, that parts never meshed well with each other but that same problem was a benefit. Especially for new players. Having watched many YouTube videos of players trying to build rockets and trying to make sure they have the exact right part, whether to copy a rocket from another video, or to build their own; knowing what precise part you\u0027re using can mean the difference between a successful mission, or a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the best two suggestions are to make parts distinguishable enough in the parts list again; to provide more details on the parts list so that you can tell them apart; or to redesign the parts list UI to make identifying parts easier as a whole without any part changes (certainly the more difficult of the 3 suggestions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI admit I am an old player and I adapt slowly to changes, but I feel that this is an issue that old and new alike could end up experiencing, and am curious if anyone else has thought the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-15T17:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis.
