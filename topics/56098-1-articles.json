This is what I came out with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR is important for lift off. Once in space, this is not important any more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, TWR will define the maximum acceleration of your ship, which means how fast you can change your velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is relatively important if you don\u0027t want to waste minutes to change your orbit (I\u0027ve heard this is also bad).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, TWR is defined as F/mg (F is the thrust and m is the mass of the ship). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in space, with the same force (thrust) you can accelerate a=F/m, which results a=TWR*g\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, dV = a*t, so if you want to be able to change a given delta v in a given time, your TWR is defined as TWR=dV/(g*t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use this to design your ship, as TWR is easily found using mods like mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example, if you want to burn 500 m/s dV in 1 minute, you will need a TWR of 0.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is the question, what do you think is the best TWR (or dV-time relationship) for a spaceship? More TWR will reduce the maximum dV you ship can have so there is a tradeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease also check if my reasoning/math is ok\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T05:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere around 2.0 on the pad (which might be, for example, 1.5 at liftoff rising to 2.5 by the end of the stage, as fuel is burnt). Roughly the same from pad to 35,000m. 35km to orbit is really just enough to keep it going up and gaining speed, roughly a minimum of 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space, it\u0027s no longer important, what matters changes to fuel efficiency. So, for long distance, a single LV-N for small and medium probes, etc. Larger long distance, I\u0027d guess maybe 1 LV-N per 25-50t.

The lower your TWR the more dV you have overall, but the longer it will take to execute the same burn maneuver. For example: I have a ship with a decent TWR (let\u0027s say .5) and we want to execute a dV maneuver of 500m/s. This takes us about 45 sec (rough estimate, I really don\u0027t feel like doing math right now). To execute the same maneuver with a lower TWR (let\u0027s say .1) it will take 5 times longer to execute the same maneuver. Conversely if we have a higher TWR (1.0) it will take half as long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s talk about fuel efficiency for a sec. Fuel efficiency is directly related to the specific impulse of the engine (regardless of weight). So, let\u0027s say I had a really efficient engine, but it\u0027s not very powerful (The LV-N). I plop one of these on a fuel tank and capsule I will have a high dV, but not necessarily a high TWR (they tend to be very heavy). Now, if we take the same ship, but put an engine with a lower specific impulse, but more power (the LV-45) we would get a Higher TWR, but a lower dV. This being said an ideal engine would have an infinitesimally small mass (because mass can\u0027t be zero) and an infinitely high specific impulse. This would result in a massive ammount of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, at this point you might be wondering, why bother with the LV-N at all? It all comes down to fuel efficiency. Because of it\u0027s higher specific impulse it is one of the most fuel efficient engines in the game. The only issue is it\u0027s very heavy with a low maximum power. TWR is nothing more than the ratio of the amount of thrust you have to the amount of mass you are trying to move. The higher the TWR the easier it is to move a given mass. So, at this point \u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe Rocket Equation\u003C/a\u003E comes into play. The rocket equation basically says for a given amount of fuel burned at a specific rate your velocivy will change by a certain amount. The reason we use the LV-N over the LV-45 is because of that equation. Could you get to Jool using just LV-45s? Sure, but you would need a metric butt-ton of fuel to do it because the LV-45s are not very efficient. By increasing the efficiency (at a TWR trade-off) we can go the same distance with much less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETl;Dr: bigger is not always better, and TWR Only affects the length of your burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T10:00:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Taki117, I know that there is a trade-off between ISP and TWR, but what I wonder is what is a good trade-off value, and what experienced people do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T10:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn real rockets and spacecraft, it\u0027s absolutely abysmal.

If your burn takes 10 minutes in orbit around a planet or moon, you are going ti wind up way off course, where as a burn farthest from a paletary body of the same length will have little overall effect on your ships position.
