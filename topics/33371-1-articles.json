The technology available was meagre at best, they knew how to farm, build hovels, and cook. Then, in the year 1302 (Time since writing and the calendar was discovered) a large meteor hit the town of Kerbana, this killed over three hundred Kerbals and injured dozens more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, after close examination of the meteor, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cscientists\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 found writing that detailed numerous technological advances, so the small town of Kerbana using this technology, grew into a huge empire, with an army of ten million Kerbals, far more than the twenty thousand that lived in Kerbana in 1302. This empire was established as an official power and nation in 1314 and ruled the majority of Kerbin until the year 1383, when the current Emperor, Jebediah IX, was murdered by a band of Kerbals from the city state of Kermania.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn retaliation, the armies of the Kerbanian Empire sailed across the great sea, but as the reached the city gates of Kermania, a loud siren started to wail. A huge rocket propelled bomb started to climb out of the depths of the city, arcing through the sky towards Kerbana. Then, as the soldiers watched the missile fly towards their home, they were cut down by dozens of robotic tanks with gatling guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the last Kerbals were killed in a far off land, the missile impacted in the city square of Kerbana, killing forty thousand Kerbals. This started the first Great War, a war that would kill over thirty million kerbals and injure or scar over one billion others. Here is a list of all the great battles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1384: Battle of Contro\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Pass, two hundred thousand killed, fifty thousand wounded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1385: Battle of Kermany, ninety thousand killed, one hundred fifty thousand wounded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1387: Massacre at Kerbana, three million civilians killed, no wounded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1388: No major battles but death total tops 3 million for that year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1390: First Nuclear Warhead test Successful, six are later used to destroy \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E all of Kermania and the surrounding territories. Death toll is estimated ~7 million with over 60 million injured or deformed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1391: First attempt at peace summit ends in bloodshed, killing six hundred thousand Kerbals, civilians and soldiers alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1392: Second peace summit is successful, ends in peace between the tattered Kermanian Alliance and the Bloodied Kerbanian Empire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After the second peace summit the two nations casualties left them with no economical capabilities whatsoever. As the two empires collapsed inwards multiple city-states rose out from the ashes, but most of the Kermanian Alliance was irradiated and uninhabitable. This lead to every modern map detailing it as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Contaminated Zone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 however, the Northern part of the alliance becoming the Northern Frontier, and the Kerbanian Empire becoming the Azion Republic, the Kerbin Conglomerate, the Pene Federation, and the United States of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy 1415 all of these nations had started to rebuild and trade. In 1420, the nations met in conference to discuss how war would be conducted, this ended in the Keniva Convention, and the ban of nuclear warheads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Please leave a reply and any suggestions, I may or may not make a Volume II \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox Arcana","CreatedById":70823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T07:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what about the space ships?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whatshtisthis","CreatedById":42775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T07:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA plan to move out to other planets due to the radiation on Kerbin using the rockets they made back in the war?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robothawk","CreatedById":71123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T15:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA plan to move out to other planets due to the radiation on Kerbin using the rockets they made back in the war?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what I was thinking for Volume II, if I decide to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
