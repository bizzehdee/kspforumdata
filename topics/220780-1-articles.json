I believe this is because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks think they\u0027re still in the bays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to remove this restriction from the game? I don\u0027t see why it\u0027s a thing since most people would open the bays before deploying things anyways, and I would always do that because I don\u0027t want my spacecraft to look bad, but I haven\u0027t yet found a mod or patch that does that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-12T02:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am pretty sure there\u0027s an advanced tweakable in the stock game that lets things deploy while stowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-13T05:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked that, and it doesn\u0027t apply for some things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, a workaround that usually works is quicksaving and quickloading, so this isn\u0027t a super urgent request or anything (although quicksaving and quickloading is banned in KRASH simulations, which complicates some stuff for me since I use KRASH to test things in career mode installs)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
