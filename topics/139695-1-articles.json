As the title suggests I\u0027m having problems with loading my saves / resuming any kind of game (career, sandbox etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the steam version of the game and I had a problem with my SSD. It crashed and recovered all the files afterwards but then the save games in the main menu (the main menu after starting the game and not the loading menu inside of an actual career)\u00A0didn\u0027t show up anymore. Instead the list is simply empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I deleted Ksp (the\u00A0folder entirely) and\u00A0reinstalled Ksp. Didn\u0027t work. Then I reinstalled it on a different Hard Drive. Didn\u0027t work. Now I figured out that even if I create an entirely new game the saves don\u0027t show up anymore. The folders are being created in the Kerbal folder and I can also save and load games but as soon as I leave the game and try to resume it, the saves/career are\u00A0not present.\u00A0The cause for this is beyond my understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you have any ideas what I could do. I don\u0027t really want to reinstall my whole computer!
