The craft was just Mk 16-XL, pod, heat shield. I went from about 80km to about 20km, which used zero ablator. My question is really around when to pop the chutes. I\u0027ve been waiting until the reentry heating effects stop, in the 2-5 km range, and I still see the G-meter spike up into the \u002B15 zone. Do we just expect a brief burst of absurd acceleration when the chute pops into drogue mode?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T18:16:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by saskwach**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:00:30Z","Content":"In 1.0 the new aerodynamics make chutes OP: you can open chutes at 20\u002B km high at 2.5 km/s, you will have a huge G-force spike but your craft should be fine.\n\nI guess the acceleration spike will be there no matter at which altitude you deploy chutes, at least in 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:06:57Z","Content":"Basically the major complain about the chutes was that they would deploy too fast and cause huge G spikes.

Putting the caps lock on for fine adjustments and tapping the pitch controls occasionally is enough, so it\u0027s not too strenuous a vigil. I\u0027m not fighting the pod all the way down but yes, I do need to pay attention.\n\nHaven\u0027t encountered the ferry contracts yet, let alone unlocked the Mk1-2 pod but even once the heatshield bug is fixed, I\u0027m thinking that slinging a hitchhiker module under the pod is going to do funky things to your centre of gravity.
