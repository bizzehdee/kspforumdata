Now I\u0027m wondering: what is the best (most fuel efficient) way to achieve an orbit in this case? Should I do a burn along the prograde vector (chasing it) or should I line up the rocket with Kerbin\u0027s equator (keeping it that way) and then do a burn to achieve orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T01:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no simple answer. There is an optimum, of course, but it depends on a lot of complex math involving drag, the thrust/weight ratio of the ship, etc., and will vary a bit from one design to another. There are some challenges in the challenge section of the forum to try to find the most efficient ascent, but I don\u0027t know their names. Personally, I turn about 30 degrees prograde as I leave the lowest atmosphere zone (light blue on the gauge), to 60 on leaving the second zone, and then rotate to horizontal fairly quickly after that. But that\u0027s just a rule of thumb, and not at all rigorously derived.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T02:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll refer you to the first part of my video.
