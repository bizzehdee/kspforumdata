As a workaround, consider using the Hyperedit mod. That will let you cheat fuel refills as long as the problem is missing fuel and not a completely missing EVA fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, if your Kerbal shows 0.0 of 5.0 maximum fuel on the fuel meter, Hyperedit is likely to work, but it won\u0027t work if there\u0027s no fuel meter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
