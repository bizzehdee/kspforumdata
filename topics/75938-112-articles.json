Or were you just expanding on the stock LookAt?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, well. Vector maths are as familiar to me as deep-sea diving is to a desert-dwelling lizard. I know the name, but that\u0027s about it. Okay, so the analogy doesn\u0027t work too well, considering a desert-dwelling lizard doesn\u0027t know what deep-sea diving is... but you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually had a moment of inspiration... or rather, I\u0027ve started doing what you told me to do earlier when I was looking to grab the tweakScaleCorrector value from the other modules. I figure if you can search the parts for colliders and such, I can probably do that too. So, I began mucking about with some copies of your code in a TestDustFX module to see what I could do. I still don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to make DustFX use a list of colliders instead of just a single one as it\u0027s built to handle now, nor if/how I\u0027ll be able to average the effect between the multiple colliders if the part has more than the single one, assuming I can get it to differentiate between the colliders that are simply a part of the whole \u0022part\u0022 and which of those are actively scraping the ground. At this time I think it\u0027s just emitting the particles at the wheel\u0027s collider when the part, as a whole, is scraping the surface.

It doesn\u0027t actually do anything wheel collider specific, they just count as collisions. What I propose, is to use the list of wheel colliders exposed in KFModuleWheel - or generate another one - and use their groundhit info (as well as slip, speed, ground force etc.) to aggregate an average ground contact point from which to emit the effect. In other words, use wheel collider specific data - not as hard as it sounds. Going to be very cool.

I seem to remember you telling me his license allowed for, at the very least, my DustFX plugin. The thing is, at this point there is not a lot left of his original code. Yes, it looks freakishly similar, but I\u0027ve had to re-write a lot of it in the various iterations since the original. Unfortunately, the only way I found to make it work turned out to be more or less identical to the original. I suppose there\u0027s only one way to really get the right effect sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the grounded hit thing was what I was \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E looking at 10 minutes ago. I started to try and grab this information for use in my test module, but started feeling that headache coming on and decided to take a break. I look forward to seeing how you did it though. As long as you don\u0027t break the color definitions and such, I\u0027m happy. Speaking of which, most of the non-Kerbin definitions in the DustColorDefinitions config are based on the average color of the planet\u0027s appearance from orbit, grabbed from various sources including screenshots from the tracking center. If you end up taking any of your creations to other worlds, I\u0027d welcome any adjustments to those color definitions in the config. The config, which originated from the first time xEvilReaperx helped with the project, (I think he generated it from the game\u0027s internal information, I\u0027m not sure how really) contains all the planetary names and biomes in it already with these placeholders. The alpha channel for those colors is what I\u0027m using to affect how thick the dust particles appear. I\u0027m basing that on what the material appears to be (as in how tough it would likely be. The harder the surface, the more transparent the particle color, thus the lower alpha value.) Otherwise it\u0027s just an RGBA color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Took a look at what you did and I\u0027m impressed. Didn\u0027t take you long, and seems incredibly simple. I re-enabled the OnCollisionEnter section though, as it is used to enable a wheel-impact audio effect that the original mod had which I liked, but never really tested the implementation here. It needs to be enabled, have the user\u0027s volume jacked up, and get some wheels rammed into something. Because it is untested, I don\u0027t have a default sound effect even defined in the code, but if you look at the MM patch, I do define one (which I added to our sound folder, though I might have referenced the path wrong in the patch, I\u0027ll check after I get done writing this) for everything except the repulsors (and the patch which implements the dust on non-KF wheels too, since that also works... actually, I may have removed that now that KF specific values are being called for. I may add that as an extra park of the mod later.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I can cancel my test module now then, since you\u0027ve managed it in record time.

It wasn\u0027t a lot of work. The collision info has a list or array of hits, and Pizza was only using the first entry. We can still streamline it a lot, I think, but it works well in-game as it is. I was thinking, maybe there\u0027s a way to sample the colour of what the parts are colliding with by using a camera. That way you could ditch the biome stuff and have it all calculated realtime. Would be very cool, and we can crib some stuff from the reflective windows plugin for clues how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now quite happy with the LookAt, and I\u0027ve improved the mirror code, so we\u0027re good to go with things like the BV and TT (Thunder Tank) tracks.

I\u0027d settle for at least a monitor with it\u0027s accompanying buttons on the inside surface in front of the kerbal for some basic information. Other than that, it\u0027s not really meant to be a complete pod solution for off-road kerbal transit devices, is it? So, it\u0027s pretty feature complete. In the future, maybe some different color options using a texture switcher would be great. Maybe one with really dark bars to contrast with the brighter surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of sampling like that. I still want some control over the density of the particles however, and currently I don\u0027t see anything to handle that. we have control over the strength and size of the effect, but it\u0027s still just an effect which limits us as far as density of the effect. Using an alpha channel to make it appear less dense by making it semi-transparent is my way of combating that problem, and I\u0027ve been setting that based on what I think the surface would produce when scraping it with something. So, at the very least, we would likely need a list of biomes with their corresponding alpha values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, sampling the color of the surface being collided with would fix another problem I had, where there\u0027s a small patch somewhere between the KSC and the distant hills which is incorrectly flagged as part of either a tundra or pole region. This resulted in snowy-colored dust from green grass. I found it only once, but it\u0027s rather annoying and I really have no way of fixing it unless I can get color values from the field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know TextureReplacer merged in some of that reflection stuff, which I\u0027ll do some digging into later. I\u0027ve already looked at that stuff anyway because there\u0027s a problem with how it handles the reflectivity of the region you want to reflect. Unless you specify a specific object in the part, it simply makes the whole part reflective and the higher the alpha channel, the less reflective it is. It uses the main diffuse of the part to do this, which makes texture replacement a real pain because you have to take into account the bleed-in from the model\u0027s default untextured color, which is a pure white. I wanted to see if there was a way to get it to reference a different texture, or alternatively treat the inverse of the current alpha handling instead. This would be a lot easier to deal with, since the reflective parts wouldn\u0027t need much done to them for texture since they\u0027re being overlayed with a reflection modified by a custom color shade (if specified). I didn\u0027t find any easy way to invert things or redirect them without having to recompile the shader. I don\u0027t speak shader-talk anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Something else to think about with the color sampling.

I agree too, lights are a good idea. i especially appreciate cockpit-lighting for night driving, especially in a dim red hue (to better fit with the eye\u0027s natural night-sight which does not get ruined by red light.) setting up MFDs shouldn\u0027t be \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E messed up. You just need to place the props in the right spots and make sure they\u0027re doing everything they should be doing. You could probably take a stock cockpit patch as a template and just modify the locations to fit the spots in the rollcage. Page setup is only necessary if you want your own custom information displayed (which might be cool... a single page to display the current status of the suspension on the wheels/tracks on the craft, or show the height and power drain of the repulsors... but that can wait for a later update.) I wouldn\u0027t try to do anything like what you get in... say... RetroFuture (wide screen maps with overlayed square screens side by side that can show info while allowing a scansat map to run in the background, complete with controls for all three screens arranged on the outside, and controls dedicated to camera movement next to that, along with complete action group toggles and switches for jsut about everything you can possibly do with a ship.) and I would never recomment trying to do what Alexustas has done (custom readouts for fuel/power levels and drain rates, transparent HUD displays for rover orientation, speed, direction of movement, controls for every action group, plus controls for everything you might ever think to do in stock or any combo of about 50 different mods, plus stopwatch-like devices, time keepers, lights, bells, whistles, you name it.) That stuff can lead you to go completely nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was I talking about again? oh right... the rollcage. Yeah, I\u0027d say either set up a single monitor (or several small monitors with just a few functional buttons each) or just give it the basic IVA controls. I\u0027d also export a version of the part which can just have a control seat attached inside of it, without any form of IVA of it\u0027s own, for the non-JSI users out there who might still want that part. I wouldn\u0027t exactly change the geometry of the part like the others are suggesting. For that, I would make separate and completely new pods. This thing looks fine on it\u0027s own. As for the crazy angles, yeah those are annoying, but you sacrifice a lot of style to get things fitting together perfectly. You just have to decide what\u0027s more important in this case. There are already a good number of mods uot there with flat, boxy surfaces for your perfect attachments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my point is this: put some stuff in there to at least help us navigate, then worry about making it really awesome later after we\u0027ve had a chance to mess with it ourselves.
