RVE asks you to replace the sharedassets9.assets file in the KSP_Data folder with one of their making. After I did this, the game would crash every time it completed loading on start up. After restoring the original .assets file, the problem was gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy game crashes the moment it fully loads. It does this every time, I think it has to do with RSS Visual Enhancements (RVE), when I installed it it asked if I wanted to replace ~6 files which were allready in GameData (but not sure, I installed like 5 mods today).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally I\u0027d simply do a full reinstall of the game and the mods and that would probably fix my problem, but with kerbalstuff being down, and because of that ckan not working, I won\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to install all mods succesfully (I play with RO, RSS, RP-0, visual mods and lots of others).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the crash log\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vthvo6uubto7ucs/AACe4qRXmNdNrmIIwwScysQxa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/vthvo6uubto7ucs/AACe4qRXmNdNrmIIwwScysQxa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to read it, but couldnt make sense of it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone that can offer any help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks alot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-22T10:36:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2016 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CitizenVeen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T10:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to open your crash.dmp but it seems it is corrupted. I\u0027m on a Debian OS and gedit has a lot of difficulties to get it open, many unreadable characters. However, at the beginning of that file you can check whether or not you have enough RAM for your game. Indeed, crashing at the end of the game loading is often due to a lack of available memory. Maybe, try using the 4K texture for RSS if you are using the 8K. Or some RAM reduced consumption mods like this one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128660-1051-64-feb-1-2016-dynamic-texture-loader/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128660-1051-64-feb-1-2016-dynamic-texture-loader/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe play your game in OpenGl might help as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-18T10:19:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2016 10:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Benoit Hage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenVeen","CreatedById":154777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T13:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do i open the crash.dmp?

You\u0027ll see at the 6th or 7th line if there were some RAM left available. Watch out that ksp.exe is a 32bit application. It means it can not use more than 2e31 minus few thing octets.

Having 8GB do not change anything as for now, but as soon as KSP 1.1 is out, it will be a 64bit application, and then you 8GB will matter, as the application will uses 2e63 octets of available memory for its bits adressing. I guess the wait for 1.1 won\u0027t be too long anymore!
