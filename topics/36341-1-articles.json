I have a ship with two command pods, and I need to switch which one is active, and comes with the crew, but I don\u0027t know what to edit in the .Craft file to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, please dont tell me about how in version .20 you can change the command pod and all that, I know, but i can\u0027t delete either of the pods because they are the backbones of large structures.

I\u0027ve not seen, anywhere on the forums, a description of how the craft files are laid out. (If anyone knows where to find this, please tell me.) I\u0027ve tried changing the order of the parts in them, but that doesn\u0027t seem to work. I know that logically, in code, crafts are trees, with a root part and branches for each attached part, so to change which one is root requires reordering the whole tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d install and use the Crew Manifest plugin.

You have the wrong root part and you need to re-piece it together. At the very least you will need to disconnect everything from the lander can and remove it. Then disconnect everything from the pod and remove it. Then add back each in reverse order and connect everything together. The ingame craft editor is the best tool for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to go through the same process to fix a rover I made so I could put it in sub-assembly loader.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
