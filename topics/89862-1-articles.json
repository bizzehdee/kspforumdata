I myself use KP8, KP4, KP5, and KP6 to avoid confusion with the RCS translation keys. Anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TR-2L has far and away more traction than the M1. This is both a blessing and a curse. A rover with TR-2L can climb much steeper hills in rather lower gravity than a rover with M1. Yay. But OTOH, the \u0022grippiness\u0022 of the TR-2L gives too much braking force on the front wheels, resulting in endos unless you remember to remove the front wheels from the Brake action group. Also, when turning, especially at high speed, the outboard TR-2L wheels will dig in and cause the rover to roll towards the outside of the turn, even with SAS on. This can be solved by not turning as sharply, or not at as high a speed, or by disabling the steering for the back wheels. Furthermore, on low-gravity worlds, the TR-2L has a tendency to snag on slight irregularities in the mesh of the ground, which will cause the rover to flip for no apparent reason. Plus, of course, it\u0027s pretty much impossible to drift if you\u0027ve got TR-2Ls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe M1 is pretty much the opposite of the TR-2L when it comes to traction. You don\u0027t need to disable the front wheel brakes. You usually don\u0027t get any tendency to roll during turns. You can drift by using torque to steer instead of or in combination with the rover steering (which are on different keys). You get a smoother ride due to more suspension travel and have higher ground clearance and a wider stance. But you can\u0027t just go straight up a steep hill, or even a moderate one if the gravity is low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TR-2L is called \u0022ruggedized\u0022 for a reason. It can support a MUCH heavier rover than the M1 without popping just under the weight. This makes the TR-2L ideal as a wheel used only temporarily to move massive base modules into position, whether on a crane or the modules themselves. Another good use is for heavy resource/fuel tanker trucks driving between your sources and your consumers. Also, if the TR-2L does pop, because the wheel axis is close to its attachment node, the rover doesn\u0027t jump/flip as much as with the M1 when you fix the flat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in general, I tend to use the M1 for exploration and long-distance travel and the TR-2L for short distances carrying heavy loads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T20:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience the ruggedized wheels are more likely to get ripped off if they pop.
