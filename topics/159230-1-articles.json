In addition to this a few of the guns in the mod lack any textures (not sure if it\u0027s due to improper installation or they just don\u0027t have textures yet). Is it possible that the order in which I install these mods causes this issue? I have the following ones installed: B9 Aerospace and Legacy pack, BDarmory, Community Ammunition Library, North Kerbin Dynamics, CCK, Module Manager, Firespitter, Hullcam VDS, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbal Foundries and tweakscale. I\u0027m uncertain about the exact order in which I installed these mods, however the first time around I added all of the \u0022core\u0022 mods first (Module Manager, Community ammunition library, CCK) and there were no explosions, so after a clean install I installed all of the mods and added the aforementioned core mods later. All files have been placed in the Gamedata folder or combined with the Gamedata folder if the .zip files were inside a Gamedata folder already. I have the 1.2.2 compatible and latest version\u00A0of every single mod and I haven\u0027t found any notes regarding these mods being incompatible with each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-15T09:29:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2017 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Rainbrew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-15T23:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the latest version of BDA then it is likely that the no explosions are due to the NKD not being updated to match the BDA version, (something I\u0027ve done as a user service in the past due to PEW using the nuke FX , however my time with PEW is ending and I\u0027m reluctant to spend anymore time in that direction)\u00A0 NKD is coded in a way that means every BDA update does (in order to remain fully functional)\u00A0 require a recompile of the NKD code and plugin to match the latest version.
