The general procedure was to drive out to the range limit, and then do the sampling work on the way back, so that as their life support diminished, so did the distance.\n\nWith one rover, you are limited, for safety, to a radius of say a 5 hour walk (if you have 8 hours of life support). The furthest the Apollo LRV went from the LM was 7.6km.

Also, remember that humans need to drive back to their base, they need to eat, sleep, rest, which adds more constraints and limits their capacity. They have to monitor their life support equipment, their driving environment, their supplies. Their main mission objective is to stay alive.\n\nA robot has a team of 20 people monitoring the robot itself and every single centimeter of its environment with all sorts of sensors. While a human in a dune buggy, concentrating on his life support and getting back to base before dark, might drive straight by an interesting rock, a rover simply can\u0027t miss it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s only the distance traveled.

It would still cost a fraction of the cost of a manned mission, could cover more total kilometers (since that seems to be important to you) and would work beyond the 500 days of Zubrin\u0027s plan.\n\n\u003E But with that attitude we wont get anywhere.\n\nOne of the things humanity is good at, something that sets us apart from other known species, is that we use tools.

It\u0027s far from cost effective; it takes \u0022ages\u0022 to get anything done, if it or something breaks their only option is to live with it, it\u0027s not equipped for unplanned discovery opportunities and the same spot is never researched again once a rover has been there.\n\nYou\u0027re talking about current rovers, which are fragile and designed to fit on an EELV. They are slow because of power constraints. They are fragile because they have limited redundancy. The number of instruments is limited by the weight of the platform. If you gave a robotic the same weight constraints as a manned mission, it would be capable of carrying more science payload than a manned mission, because it wouldn\u0027t have to carry all the life support and supplies to keep the squishy things alive. \n\nThere\u0027s no inherent reason why a rover couldn\u0027t be designed to revisit a place previously visited. Nor is there an inherent reason why it couldn\u0027t be equipped with redundancies to make it more reliable, with a multi-purpose RMS to fix itself, and more lab analysis equipment, more sample return capability, and so on.\n\nCheap and safe are pretty much of the essence. Once again, who cares if it takes ages. What\u0027s the rush? Mars isn\u0027t going anywhere. Actually doing what we can afford is much more productive than sitting around for decades dreaming about we might be able to do in a hypothetical future. Again, there is no glory in refusing to use the best tools for the job. We send robots to inspect nuclear reactor cores, collapsed buildings or underwater pipelines because they are the best tools for the job. It might be more \u0022glamorous\u0022 to send real people to do those jobs, and their might be a small benefit in capability, but it would be simply stupid considering the risk and the cost.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T10:15:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 10:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T11:18:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Of course the rover would be pressurized, but if it gets stuck in the sand or breaks down at more than walking distance from the base, the rover\u0027s life support won\u0027t help them walk back. Two pressurized rovers is a hard safety requirement if you want to venture beyond a safe walking distance.\n\nYou are assuming that a breakdown or getting stuck would strand the rover. It would be designed get out of such situations. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E A manned Mars mission won\u0027t happen until at least 2030. We already have self-driving cars and autonomous rovers. The \u0022dune buggy\u0022 thing was sarcasm, since you seem to be obsessed by speed, but it\u0027s not much of a stretch to think that in 15 years we can have autonomous off-roaders that can drive around Mars terrain at 20km/h or more (if that speed was useful, which it isn\u0027t). And I don\u0027t see why you couldn\u0027t send an improved Robonaut or some sort of AI-assisted RMS to replace spare parts or perform routine maintenance. You could even at least partially teleoperate them. The latency isn\u0027t much of a problem because you\u0027re in no hurry and the stuff you\u0027re fixing isn\u0027t going to be moving around.\n\nYou should look at the speed part as getting things done now instead of 30 years down the road. Give me one example, besides robotic space exploration, where such an approach is acceptable.\n\nThe reason why we don\u0027t have fast driving robotic rovers on Mars is safety, you don\u0027t want it to tip over, run in a ditch, break something, etc. Time delay is an important factor here as you can\u0027t intervene in something which happened 14 minutes ago.\n\nWhat are you envisioning what a Robonaut would look like? Would it be able to walk? Would it be a halve rover halve robonaut setup? What can a robonaut do what a human can\u0027t? You also have to consider that it would take a lot of extra money to development cost and time to create something with those capabilities.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re talking about current rovers, which are fragile and designed to fit on an EELV. They are slow because of power constraints. They are fragile because they have limited redundancy. The number of instruments is limited by the weight of the platform. If you gave a robotic the same weight constraints as a manned mission, it would be capable of carrying more science payload than a manned mission, because it wouldn\u0027t have to carry all the life support and supplies to keep the squishy things alive.\n\nTheir also slow because they need to assess each cm they travel, one false move and it\u0027s mission failed.\n\nA larger, and thus more complex robotic mission, has a bigger chance of failing without the option to fix it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s no inherent reason why a rover couldn\u0027t be designed to revisit a place previously visited. Nor is there an inherent reason why it couldn\u0027t be equipped with redundancies to make it more reliable, with a multi-purpose RMS to fix itself, and more lab analysis equipment, more sample return capability, and so on.\n\nSure if it could travel faster, throwing caution in the win, then yes it could go back and visit previous sites. It couldn\u0027t do experiments it wasn\u0027t designed for. They also don\u0027t send the next mission to the same place. \n\nMore redundancies is a good point, though it would weigh it down, which would require more power. But the same could be said for a manned rover. \n\nIs a repair robotic rover really feasible? I could see it fixing a wheel. But what if electronic components break down or if it gets stuck in a ditch?\n\nWhat if the sample transfer part breaks? What if the rover position of it hinders the repair rover?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheap and safe are pretty much of the essence. Once again, who cares if it takes ages. What\u0027s the rush?

Al those other things you mentioned don\u0027t require humans on site, but they require a certain amount of speed. You don\u0027t want status on a nuclear reactor core 2 years later. Collapsed building, underwater pipelines, they all require it to be done in time frame of days, maybe weeks, but not years."}]}
