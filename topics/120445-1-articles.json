Question is, what\u0027s the best place to stay? Things to do? Things to watch out for? Just looking for some input from people who have went before and have experienced it first hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T18:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been so long since I\u0027ve been there, I couldn\u0027t tell you about lodging ... but I\u0027m sure a few web searches could help with that - plus you know your own budget. As for things to do?... plenty! You could spend an entire day at the Kennedy Space Center and still not see everything (I\u0027ll suggest two days). There\u0027s plenty to see/do in the Orlando area, such as Sea World and its sister site Discovery Cove (swim with the dolphins). Daytona is also nearby, the beach, raceway, and Embry Riddle ... if you\u0027re bored you could tour the campus, or check out the sports calendar and go watch a game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
