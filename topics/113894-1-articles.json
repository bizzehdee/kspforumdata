If any of your parts are giving the thermal system problems they will flicker rapidly. In certain situations this can cause the part (or other parts by convection) to slowly overheat and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to update this thread if you have more information on the problem, but I know for sure that if your mass is in the 0.00001 range, problems may ensue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, a module manager fix is in work that catches parts that have unrealistic physics numbers. Sarbian\u0027s link is in the thread below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also some parts (like some of the wheels) that are connected symmetrically to parts with high surface areas, like octagonal struts, can cause this run away heating effect also, yet if you use a cubic octagonal strut the surface area is low enough to dampen the runaway heating.
