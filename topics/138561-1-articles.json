I took it out for a test and failed the landing, causing the plane to crash. The Flight Report screen popped up, but the grey box was empty and had no text. Pressing Escape would cause the words \u0022Outcome: Catastrophic Failure!\u0022 to appear.\u00A0I blamed it on the mods, but\u00A0when I played 1.1.1 just today, I encountered this same bug, this time without any mods. The bug also disabled reverting flight, and if I switched ships and returned to the Space Center that way, it would cause a CTD.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/GZ6RM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/GZ6RM\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u0026lt;--- Here\u0027s photos of the bug\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone knows how to fix this, that would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, Blanjipan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
