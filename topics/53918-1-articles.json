Engine efficiency, intakes and compression are all very different because of how tiny Kerbin is vs. Earth. Typical jet airliners cruise at 32-38,000 feet (11.5 km), with one intake per engine. That\u0027s the point at which stock KSP jets just start to get \u0027good\u0027, but then the intake air starts dropping off dramatically for everything but ram scoops. The U-2 spy plane routinely operated at 21 km, which is about what you can squeeze out of the turbojet with a single intake. Anything beyond that, and you\u0027re entering the realm of fiction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, the U-2\u0027s maximum velocity was about 223 m/s, which is a slow walk compared to what a turbojet can do (because we don\u0027t have friction that\u0027ll rip the craft apart if we go 10 knots higher than 223 m/s. Kerbal material science is quite good, despite finding all these parts by the side of the road).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, stock KSP is already going well into the world of fiction.

Heck, when have you ever seen a rocket with batteries stuck to the sides? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn anycase, as for air intakes, I\u0027ll typically do anything from 1 to 4 intakes per engine, depending on the plane and if it \u0027looks\u0027 okay doing so. I won\u0027t just stack them. For instance, I\u0027ll use the stack coupler plates to attach more then 1 intake in front of the engine, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HPdVmW2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HPdVmW2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere it stimulates an extra-wide air intake, or a high-bypass turbo-fan engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T08:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would say that calling them stupid or impractical counts as \u0022bashing\u0022 them.

I may say, \u0022I like the design, but unfortunately it may not work for me.\u0022 Which is me saying, good job on your craft, but not my taste. And to me thats no different than me saying, I am a Ford man not a Holden fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone asks me privately what do I think about a certain craft they have made, I will tell them privately. But I will not come out and bash someones work publicly, I may offer advice on how to improve a faulty design or tweak something to get a bit more performance out of it. But I will not just tell them its junk start over, or here download one of MY craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been building SSTOs for a while now in KSP, both stock and mod. When it comes down to the brass tacks, I couldnt stand the stock KSP lack of aerodynamic code, and actually fell in love with the FAR and DRE mod. Now they are the first two mods I install when ever I have to reinstall KSP. I wanted a harder, closer to real life flight code. Something where I could build a plane that looks like it could exist in the real world, and it behave like a real aircraft, not like some wondermagicalmysterymachine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there are a few of my SSTO space planes that are just down right fugly, but they weren\u0027t designed with looks in mind. Others are quite good looking but perform like shaved bricks. But vast majority of my space plane SSTOs perform quite well and look pretty decent. Even my stock maching bird challenge mach 6 in FAR craft is based on a real life aircraft, the Mig-21. But that is because I like the look of that craft. But being a military history nut, I knew the Mig-21 was designed not with looks in mind but performance and specific speeds in mind, when it came out it was one of the fastest most nimble aircraft in the air. So my craft followed that design theory. And it performed well within specs and exceeded my goals and yet it can do better with a few more fine tuning runs and tweaks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img4/2074/f2wr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f2wr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt runs 2 ram intakes, with a small nose cone in the center, and it topped out at 2170m/s at a low altitude of 24km. But is it the best looking plane I have ever made, no. Is it the fastest in atmosphere jet I have made, no. Is it a airhog, nope.... What is it? It is mine and I am proud of it. And that is all that matters to me. And to be honest that\u0027s all that should matter to anyone who builds their stuff in this game and posts pictures of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T08:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, by \u0022maze\u0022 I was just continuing on with my analogy from the previous post, probably should have been clearer about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
