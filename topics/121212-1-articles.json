Wasn\u0027t sure if you were referring to the movie or actual interstellar exploring in the game. XD Either way, that\u0027s a possibility.\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it wouldn\u0027t really go in here, if overdriving is going to be a thing, I think overclocking could be a mechanic as well. AKA: Overpowering modules like an antenna \\ dish to temporarily send out data as soon as possible in an impending dead-on-impact event, could be overdriving those engines while doing it too! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I might make a thread about that, unless that\u0027s already a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was referring to the Interstellar mod pack, since it\u0027s realistic and it has several parts which can produce a lot of heat, such as nuclear reactors, which need to be vented through such methods as the giant radiators. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m basing this overdriving mechanic on the already existent red portion of the throttle meter. It\u0027s already there, let me have it!! As to the antennas and such, that\u0027s a different request. I just want overdrive-able engines (or afterburners for aircraft engines (yes IK theres a mod for afterburners already, but I\u0027d like to see it incorporated into this one)).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceTiger","CreatedById":133800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T02:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike i said before you can use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116034-1-0-X-KerboKatz-SmallUtilities-V1-2-5-18-09-2015-Now-with-AutoBalancingLandingLeg!#Afterburner\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eafterburner\u003C/a\u003E mod to achieve exactly that.
