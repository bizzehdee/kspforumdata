I managed to build a lander with a FL-T400 tank, send it to Minnumus and come back to Kerbin with a lot of fuel to spare. I usually had the FL-T400 tank with four smaller tanks on its side, having the same result - but needing a bigger rocket to send the lander to Minnimus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, more tanks equal longer range, but the ship gets heavier, spending more fuel. How do I calculate the optimal ratio between tanks, range and efficiency?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-29T02:59:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2014 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by demian_travis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T16:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you can use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EdV equation\u003C/a\u003E and rearrange it to solve for the mass of fuel you will need to get to a certain point.

So if you want to stick with an unmodified KSP, your main option is to do the delta V calculations by hand.

Well, that\u0027s where the delta V map comes into play (also on that wiki page).

Although you can shave off a lot of dV from the 920 (Minmus to Kerbin) because you can aerobrake around Kerbin. If you were to return to Kerbin and reestablish an orbit without aerobraking, it would take the full 920 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a more complex version of the dV map here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like it better, but if you are unfamiliar with using dV maps, the first one is a bit simpler to start off with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-26T17:13:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2014 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T17:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the other responses allude to, delta-V is the measurement you\u0027re looking for.
