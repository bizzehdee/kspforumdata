I know that might sound like a dumb question, but it has happened. Just making sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you look at the contract window, there should be a little \u0022Note\u0022 line. Click on that and it will expand. Usually it will say whether the part has to be tested using the right click (\u0022action\u0022) menu and pressing \u0022Run Test\u0022 or that it has to be activated through the staging sequence. Be sure that you\u0027re doing the right one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you launch your ship with the decoupler on it, before you do anything else, open the contract window in the top right corner, and see if the parameters that you have to meet are checked off (green text \u0026amp; green check mark). If not, those all need to be checked off for the contract to complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of those things are the problem, then like I said, a screenshot would really help. Probably best to include one in the Mission Control building with the contract in question shown, and one on the launch pad with the contract window open.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T11:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to decouple it via staging (the spacebar) for it to count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you used the right click menu to do it, it won\u0027t work for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, everything the guy above me said; make sure it\u0027s the right decoupler model.\u00A0Best of luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
