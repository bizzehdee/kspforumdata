And then I got an idea that it could actually be a good DLC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my proposal is combining\u00A0ideas of several mods (KRE, FMRS, etc) into one DLC and adding some other related stuff not present in mods. The DLC could include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nParts:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBig legs, grid fins (obviously Falcon-style landings)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBigger chutes (e.g. for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E reuse)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParafoil (Electron-style. Well, without chopper)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDeployable wings (Energia flyback boosters)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLanding bags (like in Starliner, but boosters could use them too)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0022Chomper\u0022\u00A0fairing able to open and then close for reentry (Starship, Energia Uragan)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaybe some generic 3.75m or 2.5m conical capsules for face-forward reentry (similar to Russian Klipper, Blue Origin\u0027s Biconic Capsule concept, Starship\u0027s crew compartment)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOcean platform to the east of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Equatorial, with quite big area and far away from shores. At least\u00A0for landing, not sure if launching from it will make sense. Also landing pads at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and on the land far to the east.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMost important thing, stock FMRS mod functionality. Jumping back in time to land the booster, recover it and then continue with the mission. The mod is great but merging it into stock UI and adding improvements to it will be great. Maybe even ability to record return flight, to have automatic recovery (with some probability of failure)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome tweaking of\u00A0recovery costs, including base game. For example, bonuses for land recovery, as there is no corrosive salt.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to me that such ideas fit\u00A0DLC format, reusing spacecraft with will not be obligatory, it is a spin-off gameplay, not base-game changing. Unlike, for example, Life Support\u00A0which will require players to\u00A0completely change their playstyle and will greatly separate players with and without DLC (\u0022their tiny cans vs our mighty live-supporting ships\u0022). And I believe it will be interesting for many players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T13:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t pay for that DLC, and I bought the two that already exist so it\u0027s not because I don\u0027t like DLCs, I just don\u0027t see the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFMRS/Stage Recovery can capture dropped boosters and stages already, building a \u0027reusable\u0027 booster is also possible using pure stock components and some effort (there is even a stock rocket and a scenario you can play to do a sort-of reusable booster return flight), and the other stuff just sounds like parts clutter with limited utility.

Essentially you would create a mission builder like system that would draw out the steps (launch rocket, separate booster, orbit upper stage and payload, jettison payload, go back in time and land booster.) For the craft you would specify the payload mass in the \u0022mission builder\u0022 then, you would use a fairing to specify payload dimensions. You would then complete the mission with a dummy payload in a simulation and you would now have an automatic way to launch payload into orbit. Now that you have this you can do a few things: 1. auto orbit: if you want to orbit something that fits in your rockets payload capacity all you have to do is click a few buttons. 2. new contracts: New career contracts will generate random but reasonable payload weight and dimensions for satellites and if you have a rocket that can orbit them that has been \u0022simulated\u0022 you can accept the contract and it will be completed automatically. Note that all automated missions would have a failure rate, determined by difficulty settings and how close the used payload is to maximum capacity. These features are dlc worthy because they don\u0027t fundamentally change gameplay like life suport, but extend it in a way that some may appreciate, while not changing the core game. However it is not a totally natural or essential edition to the game and this it is not a good choice for a free update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb_Needs_A_Parachute","CreatedById":206461,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-29T08:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this shouldn\u0027t be a dlc.
