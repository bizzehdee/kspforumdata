As Project OCAIAFNAR progressed it became apparent that the Javelin 5 would not be sufficient to the task and development on the Javelin 9 began. After adding more and more \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Esnacks\u003C/span\u003E scientific equipment to TSM even the standard Javelin 9 was not large enough. Though we did save one for emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Javelin 9 heavy was born at over 800 tons it is the largest lifter ever designed. Pure serially staged with no fuel lines it is simply a matter of pushing the throttles to the firewall and letting her go. Gravity turn starts early at 2,500 meters and no need to worry about throttling back. The core center engine stack burns out first to keep Max Q to a minimum and prevent terminal velocity fuel waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/cph0X\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Launched on the backup Javeling 9 standard Explortar was the last fail safe for the TSM crew in the case of a failed ejection burn past the point of no return. It was designed with enough Delta V to attempt a rendezvous outside the Kerbin system. As TSM is good to go it is using that excessive Delta V to beat TSM to Duna by nearly a several days even though it launched 23 hours later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast test launch that KSP ate my crew when physics engaged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ihZrB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
