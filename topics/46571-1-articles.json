I started playing the demo of this game at the beginning of the month and I ended up buying it within the hour! I\u0027m thinking of buying it again for someone just to help support the devs. They really are amazing! I played with orbits in the demo and then started doing Munar landings and space stations when I bought the game. Took a while to get orbital rendezvous and docking, but now it\u0027s easy. I\u0027m still having trouble with the Munar landings, I can\u0027t seem to keep the craft from drifting horizontally across the surface. Guess I\u0027m going to need to practice that a lot more. I\u0027m sticking with stock for now and try to learn as much I can before I play with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really excited about this game, as I\u0027m sure all of you are and the community seems great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ReptilianGameplays","CreatedById":65831,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T03:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EG\u0027day/evenin\u0027/night mate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a good stay at the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake us proud. \u003Cstrong\u003ENo pressure...

I have been using the gimbal in Surface mode, but I have found that if you\u0027re off by even one pixel, that\u0027s enough to leave you with a slight horizontal drift. Even a horizontal velocity of a few m/s is enough to catch a landing strut on the ground and topple the lander over. I wish there was a way to zoom in on the navball for more accurate adjustments. The problem I seem to have with RCS thrusters is that landing is essentially flying backwards, so I keep messing up on the direction! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, other people seem to do it well, so I think I\u0027ll just keep practicing until it becomes routine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thank you everyone for the warm welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-26T17:17:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2013 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by VirtualCLD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mordeth","CreatedById":83157,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T15:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find myself desiging Space Stations on my drive home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
