Probably means Physics Warp, even though it still says Time Warp: #x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when you use a spaceship (not plane), it says Time Warp and it\u0027s the normal 1x, 5x, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a true difference in how the game operates between Physics Warp and Time Warp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocomoe1002","CreatedById":42519,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T11:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes physical time warp is a warp which you can time in the atmoshpere while also doing physical stuff but it should give you a warning before u try to use it it may effect how your ship or plane is put together. the Game has not fixed this yet but i think they are in 0.18\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T11:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe when youre in atmosphere you can only do 4x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T11:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesnt\u0027 matter if you use a space plane or rocket, if you are in the atmosphere you will only have up to 4x warp. If you hold \u0022Alt\u0022 and use the comma key, you can use physical warp anywhere.
