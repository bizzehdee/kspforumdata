I don\u0027t think having to restart the tech tree would add much gameplay value other than frustration. Also, I think the ability to totally lose the game implies that you can win the game, rather than being an open ended adventure where you can do what you want in late game.\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a hardcore mode could be available to satisfy players who demand more challenge. Serious consequences for loss of life and equipment (budget?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace is hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not sad anything about reseting a tech tree. I only sad it fits well with the tech tree. A new player will ahve basic contracts, sub orbital, lko missions etc requiring basic parts. A player that have progressed further and are doing more advanced mission will also have done more science and unlocked more advanced parts making those harder contracts possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd whats wrong with sandbox mode to actually learn to play the game? OpenTTD is based of a game almost 20 years old and its still being developed and played adn you can fail and have to start over but you can also play on for ever and apparently people just love that concept. I doubt KSP will be developed 15\u002B years from now still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boomerdog2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boomerdog2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat if you could only accept a certain amount of missions? This would encourage you to go do those missions as quickly as possible to go start more.\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like the idea of a time limit because that doesn\u0027t seem to take into account interplanetary transfer windows. It\u0027s not your fault you couldn\u0027t do the mission if Jool was in the wrong place the whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow hard do you think it would be for squad to write some code that takes planets position in to account so it wont offer you impossible missions and timeframes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso time is realy a none issue. To do a specific mission the time for transfer windows are more or less known already so they wont change much. If you do a stupid burn well thats part of the failing at the game part and if your lucky you only loose some cache by completing the missions a few days late but still make a profit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I sad not every one can be a winer all the time thats just plain boring but I suppose thats what there teaching kids and what gamers want this days. No challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the way the game works now, if you abort a mission it will go back to the time when you launched it so not time is lost. So if we assume you can abort time dont realy mater much. Time spent building is more ore less irrelevant because as fare as I know it do not count now so probably wont then either. No reason why it would because you could just import a ship you made before to save time... exploit any one? So theres no reason for time to count in VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo time limit wont be a factor unless you miss your transfer window due to pilot error or badly designed craft, even then you could just abort and try again. Time building wont mater either because it wont count. So in the end time realy only mater if you take more then one contract, you complete one contract while you have not done anything on the other contract during that time period then you have lost time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a game perspective the only good reason to take more then one contract is if it allows more then one contract to be completed with the same lunch craft like satellites or probes and that would save you money and be a good strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, for those beginners that dont like to learn from there mistakes the hard way they can just \u0022abort\u0022 and try it all over again and thats fine with me I do it to if I dont feel like trying again. For more hardcore player that like to except there mistakes that might cost them a perfect score or make a mission go in to the red they can still play on and try to make up for it in the next mission by making a bigger profit there and from my experience people will do both approaches from time to time. Its not like where talking super mario bros where you cant save and will hit game over in 15 minutes or less if you never played the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the \u0022I dont like this idea because this and this will happen\u0022 is just ridiculous because its based on assumptions that are not even realistic. Why would squad write a program that gives you contracts you cant possibly do? Why do you assume contracts will be awarded with a time limit thats not doable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts more likely contracts will come and go as \u0022transfer windows\u0022 are available. Some missions dont realy have windows others do and those that have are harder missions so fits with the added difficulty of harder missions any way with better payout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all this assumes squad wants a system where you are paid in advance to fulfil a contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything can be done. Some times I think people forget this is a computer program, you can write ANYTHING with the right skill set.
