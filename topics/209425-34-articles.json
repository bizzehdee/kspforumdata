I just built a computer for the first time in years as an upgrade from my old laptop I had in undergrad. I\u0027m having what looks like some driver issues with KSP and the embedded graphics on my APU (AMD A10-6800K, GPU chipset is a HD 8670D). I know the APU isn\u0027t nearly the same as a discrete card, but I feel like I should be getting more than the 2 FPS I\u0027m currently getting. Even my old Toshiba Satellite A305 got better than that. \u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t build this machine for gaming, but I\u0027ve heard of people playing graphic-intensive games with just this APU at 30 FPS at 1080p resolution. Seems like KSP shouldn\u0027t be an issue.

Most of your noise will come from the GPU and case fans.

The P180 was even designed together with the lads from Silent PC Review.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built my system to be as quiet as possible, as I became a bit allergic to sound after having a very noisy Pentium 4 machine and my workload is primarily workstation oriented - so no game noises to hide the sound of the computer. The first time I turned it on I thought I messed it up, because I heard nothing, but it just is that quiet. The key is to choose parts without too much energy output (easy with CPU\u0027s nowadays, as even high-end chips are frugal, you have to be a bit more careful when it comes to the GPU) combined with LARGE heatsinks. I use a royal fancontrolled sprinkling of Nexus Real Silent fans to top it off. Most are turned off (but nice to have on a hot summer day), a few spin at low speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside is that buying something new like a GPU will always carry an extra penalty in the shape of an after market cooler, as even the cards with fancy coolers are way, way too noisy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022everyzig\u0022 data-cite=\u0022everyzig\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd honestly, i\u0027m not finding a lot of data either way, this guy with his GT630 is the ONLY account i have of anyone playing with a card like this, here or on reddit, and whatever benchmarks i can find suggest the geforces are at least 5 times faster then my current GPU.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend getting a card that you know will do what you want.

I just built a computer for the first time in years as an upgrade from my old laptop I had in undergrad. I\u0027m having what looks like some driver issues with KSP and the embedded graphics on my APU (AMD A10-6800K, GPU chipset is a HD 8670D). I know the APU isn\u0027t nearly the same as a discrete card, but I feel like I should be getting more than the 2 FPS I\u0027m currently getting. Even my old Toshiba Satellite A305 got better than that. \u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t build this machine for gaming, but I\u0027ve heard of people playing graphic-intensive games with just this APU at 30 FPS at 1080p resolution.
