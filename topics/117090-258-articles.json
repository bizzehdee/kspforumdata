Mostly spent time trying to figure out why the shaders don\u0027t work in OpenGL on windows (but apparently works fine on OSX?  anyone using SSTU on a linux variant that could confirm if they work there?).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Honestly I\u0027m stumped on the shaders.  They don\u0027t throw out any errors during compilation in Unity, or assignment in KSP.  They work fine in the Unity editor (when it is force-loaded in OpenGL mode).  However all three of my custom shaders fail to one degree or another when used in KSP in OpenGL mode -- the solar and recoloring/masked shader both render as black/no-lighting, while the icon shader renders some light-blue texture on everything.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But...at least that gives me a place to continue my investigations -- the icon shader renders -something-, so I can likely work back from there to see why/where things stop working correctly.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly, the testing process is going to be long and painful as I cannot use the Unity editor for testing (which is where rapid-development testing stuff should logically be done); apparently there is some difference between the editor in OpenGL mode and KSP running in OpenGL mode.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And all this... is to fix some icon problems on OSX; which supposedly uses OpenGL, though strangely the OpenGL specific code I put in doesn\u0027t effect it (though does seem to effect OpenGL on windows?).  Ahh, such fun dealing with shaders and platform specific hackery when you don\u0027t have any platforms at hand to do testing on.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On to the actual progress -- made up the glow textures for the LM engines:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![WaP9faH.png](http://i.imgur.com/WaP9faH.png)](http://i.imgur.com/WaP9faH.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Figured out some a nice procedural system for making the glow textures, including the noise and banding.... so will be applying that system to new glow textures in the future.

And if they ever release their LDC Titan (3.125m kerbal scale.)   I will have a TRI, QUAD or QUINT bell for Saturn-NOVA type missions.\n\nBut... [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)  I am curious about Gemini.  Most \u0022in update\u0022 mods that have Gemini have the Capsule being 0.625 to 1.5m, with the SM maxing out at 1.875m  Are you setting the capsule to max diameter of 1.875 to limit your sizes?  Titan RW to Kerbal Scale is just under 2 meters I think... (I am going by memory..)  others (FASA) that are in a maintenance mode only seem to be 2.5m   The reason I ask is because it matters if you want to later make a BIG-Gemini version (Big-G for short.)  Big-G would fit perfectly on the Apollo SM without any adapters (meaning in KSP scale it would be 2.5m base.)  \n\nI have a LARGE collection of data on Titan/Gemini if needed and am willing to share.  Most of it is data I have just collected across the web to support other mods.   But I did find a link to diagrams of the BIG-G Paraglider setup....   \n\nAs Tater stated MOST of the LR-87 variants and MOST of the LR-91 variants were Hypergolic (either UDMH or AZ-50 with NTO.)   The -3 variants of both engines where RP-1/LOX.  And as Jimbodiah has alluded there WAS a Hydrolox Engine tested BEFORE The J-2....  \n\nFor Intents and purposes the LR-91 is just a single bell LR-87 with smaller pumps and a larger bell (those were the bulk of the changes between the two engine types.)  \n\nUnrelated I have to say YES! a quality VA capsule!

I hate adapters.  I hate adapters even more when they add part-count for no reason.   That is really the main reason for the sizing I have currently setup; maintain compatibility with other parts and allow for generic use of the parts/pods (a 1.5m pod would be useless to me without the much-hated adapters, or forcing the use of the SM).  The final reason being Kerbals and their giant heads (though this really doesn\u0027t matter without IVAs).\n\nSadly it means you still need a 2.5m rocket to launch the pod\u002BSM, and at that point you would likely have already unlocked the 2.5m stock capsule.  Haven\u0027t quite figured out the balance aspect of it yet, need to take a good look at the tech tree.  Or not... mostly impossible to balance things on the stock tech tree anyway.\n\n(these are all the reasons that I have previously **not** made Gemini parts -- they just don\u0027t fit into the game very well, either physically, or balance)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T18:46:39Z","Content":"So, as I\u0027m working on more pods... which are generally conical with windows/etc cutout.... I\u0027m back to figuring out how to fix shading caused by non-uniform meshes.  Anyone who has ever done a boolean cut into an object knows what I\u0027m talking about.\n\nTime to break out the python-fu (which is admittedly weak), and fix the silly normal problems once and for all.  Introducing ShadowNrm -- a vertex normal manipulation plugin for Blender (clone of YAVNE with much customization).  Probably won\u0027t ever be actually released...but at least I\u0027ll have the tool that I need ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\n![NI7vY3i.png](http://i.imgur.com/NI7vY3i.png)\n\nA few other tools now exist that allow for manual editing of vertex normals.  The problem with most of them is that it is purely manual; you have to either already have a vert with a proper norm to copy from, or manually calculate what the normal would be for that vert (complex as all hell).\n\nMy new tool allows for simple specification of the normal \u0027slope\u0027 and will apply cylindrical/conical normals to selected vertices based on that input slope.  It fixes shading for cylinders and cones with a single button press.  What took me 4 hours yesterday to do by hand (calculating normals in a giant spreadsheet, applying each one manually to the vertex), is now just a single button click away.   It is very basic, with only one real input parameter -- the slope of the sidewall to simulate for the cylinder/cone.  The slope determines the Z contribution to the normal, while the vertex position determines the X/Y contribution to the normal.\n\nWhy write a vertex-normal manipulation tool that only works on cones and cylinders?  Because that is what I find I need the most in KSP modeling.  The existing tools work well enough for the cases of manipulating just a couple of verts, but fail when you need to do an entire mesh (blend4web, YAVNE)."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T18:53:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Words, words, words.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![NI7vY3i.png](http://i.imgur.com/NI7vY3i.png)](http://i.imgur.com/NI7vY3i.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E More words.\n\u003E \n\nI know what some of those words mean. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)\n\n*Oooh*, pretty colors!"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Kadet","CreatedById":166557,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T19:20:44Z","Content":"Would it be possible to copy over the tacls configs from the capsules to the landers and shuttle?
