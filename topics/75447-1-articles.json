The latter of which has me wondering about how to plan the burns given the significant plane change involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna was pretty straightforward, partly because of Duna\u0027s very small orbital inclination and partly because I happened to luck out timing-wise and launched just a few days prior to passing a node line -- so it happened that an in-ecliptic transfer orbit was \u0027good enough\u0027 to get me into Duna\u0027s SOI (which of course will be sitting right near the opposite node line when I arrive in a couple hundred more days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not going to cut it for Dres. It seems I\u0027m going to have to set up the Hohman transfer \u0022blind\u0022, with the apoapsis far above or below Dres SOI (due to the difference in orbital planes) and thus no feedback regarding Dres\u0027 position when I reach apoapsis...until after I\u0027ve done a plane change well into the voyage. And at that point, fixing a badly-planned (or -executed) burn will be terribly terribly dV-costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there seems to be substantial risk to my default plan of \u0022burn out of Kerbin orbit into Hohmann transfer, then plane change at node line, then fine-tune as necessary\u0022. Even though I plan to practice with a couple Mun-to-Minmus runs in the run-up to my Dres launch window, Dres will be much much trickier (tiny SOI, ever so far away, by comparison).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd hence, I\u0027m wondering: how do other people plan the burn sequence for trips to planets with highly-inclined orbits? (Manual only, please; eventually I may make life easier with Mechjeb and/or other automation mods, but for now I\u0027m doing everything manually just to prove that I *can*. Clever ways to extract more usable info from the guts of KSP, that\u0027s fine; anything that does the work FOR me is right out.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T01:39:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T02:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T03:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re willing to drop the requirement of launching during a window of minimum transfer time, things get a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust launch when Duna is passing through the ascending/descending node of Dres, and get your intercept on the other side.
