My problem is my parachutes (mk16) auto deploy during re-entry and then burn up. I can go straight up to 100km and come straight down or I can do a sub orbit across the ocean planning to land in the sea to the East.

I just set minimum deploy pressure to .65 and never have any issues. That pressure is about 3 km above sea level, so you should never be supersonic there anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin tallest peak is 6767 m so mountains could be a threat to parachute landings. I think the range to the West of KSC is strictly less than 5 km. A pressure of .45 would be more safe for mountains, but keeping supersonic speeds at 5 km isn\u0027t unheard of. Better use airbrakes out stay structures for such craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have never seen this in stock, so under the presumption that it\u0027s a bug related to mods, the thread has been moved to modded support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SeeGreen","CreatedById":148961,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T20:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have never seen this in stock, so under the presumption that it\u0027s a bug related to mods, the thread has been moved to modded support.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.
