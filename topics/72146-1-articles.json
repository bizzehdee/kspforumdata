What he saw there he realized were moons, totally remaking Kerbal science forever. He named them Laythe, Vall, and Tylo after the children of Jool in Eastern mythology. He went on to confirm the phases of Minimus and Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe: the oldest daughter of Jool was a goddess of winds and consort of Eve. She and her sister Vall were worshiped by ancient sailors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall: the goddess of the oceans, modern information has lead many to suggest that it\u0027s name should be switched with Laythe due to Jebileo\u0027s inability to see the true nature of these moons with his primitive telescopes, however many oppose this as to not degrade the memory of Jebileo and the names are so deeply ingrained to almost be impossible now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo: the youngest son of Jool, god of crafts.
