I think we need to learn from MKS and forge something new. \u00A0I\u0027d like to take a crack at it, but before I do, I\u0027d like to share what I\u0027m thinking to see if others have better ideas or can show me how this has been done in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, let me list out the key things I\u0027ve struggled with as a player using late-game KSP and MKS. \u00A0Admittedly, some of these are going to be subjective, but I think you have to take a look at the fact that although some of the let\u0027s-play presenters have \u003Cem\u003Etried\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0creating playthroughs with MKS \u0026amp; friends, none of those few attempts did anything but peter out due to a combination of lack of viewer interest and some rather obvious struggles on the part of the content creators to actually get things working. \u00A0I take that as evidence that I\u0027m not just blowing smoke here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAll the math to figure out production rates is no fun. \u00A0I shouldn\u0027t have to use a spreadsheet to play KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll the math to figure out if Kerbals are going to get homesick or not is no fun either. \u00A0It\u0027s especially annoying if a kerbal becomes homesick just because he came into the sphere of influence of another ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe science grind in stock KSP is really not much fun after you\u0027ve played a while. \u00A0You can unlock the whole tree just by bouncing to Mun and back or by plopping down a research lab and doing the whole thing over and over and over. \u00A0It\u0027s a good model for early-game, but for late game, not so much.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAgroponics (in MKS) is just better than farming in every way and that makes farming pointless. \u00A0I don\u0027t know why that grates on me as hard as it does... \u00A0But it does.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMining is unrealistic, frustrating, math-intensive and generally no fun. \u00A0MKS\u0027 Resource Lodes seem aimed at addressing this, but the mechanics of the mod system don\u0027t really give me a reason to do it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFully self-sufficient MKS colonies are generally easier to build in one shot than it is to build up to them over time. \u00A0It\u0027s trivial to get a colony that keeps itself in supplies, but both machinery and colony supplies require a vast diversity of stuff to make happen. \u00A0If you can make one, you can generally make the other, so you go right from an initial exploratory base to the full thing. \u00A0No stopping in the middle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s no encouragement to build spiffy orbital bases.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking of a number of changes to attack that list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDramatically reduce the number of resource types and simplify the calculations of how they\u0027re produced and consumed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere should be an activity performed by kerbals, akin to research, that unlocks more advantageous life support and off-world fabrication abilities. \u00A0This will need to be performed by Kerbals at the body they are researching and will usually only affect future activities at that body.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u0022research\u0022 described above unlocks \u0022tiers\u0022 of equipment. \u00A0Ships need to be built with that unlocked tier of equipment in order to see its advantages. \u00A0(And perhaps: Ships can\u0027t be built with that new tier until a kerbal actually returns to kerban from the planetary body.) \u00A0The supplies and such produced by early-tier equipment are immediately useful, but less effective than what you can get from Kerban.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExcept for fuel, there is no more mining. \u00A0Instead, when manufacturing is undertaken at a body, there will be occasional requests from the kerbals to gather raw materials. \u00A0To accomplish these missions, you need to send a ship with storage and a special gathering module (which might be skinned to look a whole lot like a drill). \u00A0You\u0027ll need to get the prospector ship reasonably close to the target coordinates to be able to gather the stuff. \u00A0Once a vessel has proven its ability to carry out a prospecting mission, future missions can be automated ala Routine Mission Manager.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop the MKS notion of \u0022Habitation\u0022 and \u0022Colony Supplies\u0022. \u00A0In their stead, there\u0027ll be \u0022Goodies\u0022, which are consumed by Kerbals like supplies. \u00A0\u0022Goodies\u0022 require substantially less mass-per-day than \u0022Supplies\u0022 and Kerbals don\u0027t start requiring them until they\u0027ve been off Kerban more than 6 months.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key mechanic that enforces graduated progression is the idea of tiered equipment and tiered qualities of materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo explain what I\u0027m thinking, let\u0027s just look at one consumable and its supply chain and then work on applying the same mechanic to other stuff. \u00A0Let\u0027s start with snacks - the basic food \u0026amp; air idea that I\u0027m happy to camp on. \u00A0If you fill a container with snacks on Kerban, it\u0027s \u0022Kerban Snacks\u0022. \u00A0A kerban will eat one \u0022Kerban Snacks\u0022 every day. \u00A0Let\u0027s say you have a \u0022Tier 1\u0022 Agroponics module on this ship. \u00A0Given a little fertilizer, it can produce \u0022Tier 1\u0022 \u0022Agroponics Snacks\u0022. \u00A0Tier 1 snacks are far from haute cuisine, but nevertheless Jeb is willing to take one for the team. \u00A0But he\u0027s got limits; Jeb will be willing to consume only up to 20% of his daily snack quota on Tier-1 quality snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tier 2 Agroponic Snacks\u0022 are tastier, and Jeb would be willing to take that as 40% of his diet - similarly \u0022tier 3\u0022 would be up to 60%, \u0022Tier 4\u0022 80% and finally \u0022tier 5\u0022 might be just as good as kerban snacks... \u00A0Or maybe they should peak at 90% or so - you can\u0027t, as far as I know, make agroponic bacon. \u00A0But to be able to get out of the tier 1 kit, Jeb\u0027s going to have to choke down quite a few of those tier 1 snacks and Bill\u0027s going to have to spend some time trying to make them better. \u00A0Tier-2 is unlocked by kerbals consuming Tier-1 snacks and lab research on ships equipped with Tier-1 kit. \u00A0Once Tier-2 is unlocked, nothing changes on board Jeb\u0027s vessel - it still has the \u0022Tier 1\u0022 equipment. \u00A0A new vessel has to be designed that includes the new \u0022Tier 2\u0022 agroponics module. \u00A0(Well, it could be exactly the same vessel design, with a tweakable (only settable in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) set to \u0022Tier 2\u0022 rather than \u0022Tier 1\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Agriculture\u0022 works along similar lines only it\u0027s a whole lot more effective out of the gate - Tier 1 Duna farmed snacks might start at, say, 80% of a kerban snack. \u00A0The practical upshot of that is that if you\u0027ve managed to unlock tier-3 agroponics at your Mun base and want to plan a first mission to Duna with tier-1 agriculture, you\u0027d have to plan for your kerbals eating .6 units of agroponic snacks and .4 units of kerbal snacks per day on the way over, .8 units of farmed snacks per day and .2 kerbal snacks per day while there, and then .6 agroponic snacks, .2 farmed snacks and .2 kerbal snacks on the way back. \u00A0(Assuming you\u0027ve farmed up enough snacks while at Duna to fill your ship\u0027s stores).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth Agriculture and Agroponics rely on fertilizer. \u00A0But the fertilizer has to be at least the same tier as the agroponics/agriculture part. \u00A0So you\u0027d need a module like the MKS \u0022Agriculture Support Module\u0022 to make that fertilizer. \u00A0There too you\u0027ll need a kerbal working on making the fertilizer and researching how to make it better. \u00A0At Tier-1 you can make do with a raw material collector attached right to the base and you\u0027ll need storage for \u0022Tier 1 Raw Materials\u0022 and your finished resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTier 2\u002B raw materials show up like \u0022Resource Lodes\u0022 from MKS do - your planetary scanners spot them and vector you to them. \u00A0The better your scanning network is (and the lower your tier is), the more likely the lodes will turn up close to your base. \u00A0You can either move your whole base (equipped with a resource collector of the appropriate tier) to the resource lode or you can move a rover or something to it. \u00A0At first, you\u0027d have to actually move the craft to the resource lode, activate the resource collector on the forager craft, and rumble back to the base. \u00A0After a few successful gathering missions with that craft, you\u0027d be able to mark it as the dedicated craft for doing these missions. \u00A0When future requirements come up, and the ship is near the base, the requirement will just be automatically fulfilled without requiring anything from the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same \u0022Tier\u0022 thing applies to the mining ship and the scanners used to find the lodes. \u00A0A planet where the scanning satellites are Tier-1 won\u0027t be able to find Tier-2 resources and a Tier-1 miner won\u0027t be able to gather tier-2 raw materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe concepts of \u0022habitation\u0022 and \u0022colony supplies\u0022 will be amalgamated into \u0022goodies\u0022. \u00A0When a Kerbal leaves Kerban, they\u0027re good for snacks for 14 days and can go without goodies for 6 months. \u00A0They\u0027ll consume both snacks and goodies every day because who can resist ice cream? \u00A0If a Kerbal has been off kerban for more than 14 days and they haven\u0027t had a (full) snack in 7, they\u0027ll be tough to be around and turn into Tourists. \u00A0Similarly, if they\u0027ve been off Kerban for more than 6 months and haven\u0027t had their quota of goodies in 7 days, they go tourist. \u00A0Kerbans find it hard to hold a grudge, so they\u0027ll come back to their duties once they get their needs met again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully, it\u0027ll be possible to not have a recycling concept for \u0022goodies\u0022 like agroponics is for \u0022snacks\u0022 in order to take one more complexity away from long-duration mission planning. \u00A0But there\u0027s a good chance that it will cause really long duration trips to require unpleasantly large ships to tote all the goodies. \u00A0If it comes to that, perhaps a way to fix it would be to make a holodeck part that generates tiered goodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like to have an excuse to send ships home to sell off things from the colony. \u00A0Honestly, I don\u0027t think this really has any kind of real-life analog, but I think it\u0027d make the game fun. \u00A0So we\u0027ll do it anyway and call these things \u0022shinies\u0022. \u00A0Kerbals don\u0027t consume them, they just have monetary and prestige value back on Kerban.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHoped-for playthrough\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s review what we\u0027ve got so far with a description of how the game will play with this system. \u00A0After that, we\u0027ll return to game mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe opening game would be unchanged - we keep the same 14-day grace period as is in MKS because it\u0027s great. \u00A0The player unlocks the lower tiers of the tech-tree in the usual way with voyages to Mun. \u00A0Technologies that unlock things like hydroponics and off-world agriculture are easy to get, but without having done any long-duration flights, they are fantastically inefficient -- a trip to Eve or Duna would require a vast ship. \u00A0So the player creates a station around Kerban or Mun so they can start the research necessary to start improving resource utilization and hydroponic efficiency. \u00A0Those first off-world bases will require several resupply missions before any of those breakthroughs are hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnmanned missions are possible, of course, and the wise player will send unmanned probes and satellites to worlds they\u0027re looking to create outposts on. \u00A0So we\u0027ll create a couple probes for Duna - one with a scanner on it in a nice polar orbit and a lander. \u00A0Once the player has a scanner in orbit, they can set the boys at the Mun base the task of figuring out scanners for Duna. \u00A0Once the landers have visited three biomes on Duna, they can research Tier-1 fertilizer, Tier-1 farming, Tier-1 goodies and Tier-1 shinies production. \u00A0But that\u0027s as much as the Mun base can contribute to the future Duna base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun base and another base in Low Kerban Orbit have also been busy researching hydroponics.\u00A0 They\u0027ve\u00A0pushed that up to Tier-3, which is as far as you can go with hydroponic research within the kerban system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, the player will be in a position where they can launch a medium-sized ship with a few Kerbals to Duna. \u00A0It will need to pack a substantial (but no-longer overwhelming) quantity of stowed snacks and goodies. \u00A0Upon arrival, the Kerbals will be able to do research that will improve their ability to exploit local resources and extend their ability to survive at that body... \u00A0But the effect will not improve the current mission - the research will unlock upgraded versions of the modules, but their ship is still equipped with the old stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile they\u0027re at Duna, they\u0027ll need to farm snacks. \u00A0While they were en-route, they sustained themselves partly on agroponically grown stuff, and partly from supplies form Kerban. \u00A0On Duna, they can farm a wider variety of foods that are both tastier and more nutritious than what they can get out of the agroponics dome on the ship. \u00A0They\u0027ll need their farm to not only keep them from chewing through too many of the original kerban stores while on kerban, but also to resupply the ship for the return home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe glorious return of the Kerbals from their adventures on Duna triggers the ability to create ships that take advantage of what was learned. \u00A0The combined effect of having been able to deploy Tier-2 devices for all the Duna abilities and unlocking Tier-4 hydroponics because of all that time spent studying the kerbals mixed reactions to the Tier-3 stuff in interplanetary space means that the next mission to Duna can be quite a bit grander. \u00A0On this trip, you can afford specialists, like miners to collect the more advanced raw materials, geologists to speed research on the next tier of scanning, quartermasters to reduce the frequency of supply missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the first mission was able to scrounge up enough raw materials for their needs with just a materials gathering pod attached to the base, on this next mission with its more advanced processing technology, we\u0027re going to need a supply rover. \u00A0It will be asked to voyage away from the main settlement to collect needed supplies from points identified by the scanners on the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn this mission, more research can be done and some of the kerbals will be able to stay on at Duna while the rest will return to lead the construction of the next phase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the course of the third and fourth missions, a self-sustaining colony can be built up. \u00A0The player will need to upgrade the scanning network to keep up with the growing sophistication of the base\u0027s requirements and create bigger resource collecting rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn orbital station in Duna\u0027s Sphere of Influence is helpful - research conducted there contributes to increasing the efficiency of scanners around Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA trip to Jool is now feasible - but a large ship with just a handful of kerbals will be required, and a probe with a resource scanner is almost a necessity if any local resources are to be used at Jool. \u00A0The lessons learned from Duna are not useless on the Joolean moons, but the player is again in a position where they\u0027ll need to have a short stay, return to Kerban, and set forth again with vastly improved hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan

one 5* engineer and have it be slamming good. \u00A0I want to steal all the kerbal professions that have been developed for MKS because that\u0027s a fun idea. \u00A0My thought is that each converter part will need to be staffed by a specialist in order to get it to work at all. \u00A0Engineers and Scientists can fill the seat too, but only if they have as many stars as the part\u0027s tier. \u00A0Specialists don\u0027t have any experience requirement to operate the gear. \u00A0My feeling is that alone will encourage players to have colonies that are populated with a bunch of kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaintenance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of charm to the MKS idea that machines break down and need replacement parts.\u00A0 However, the \u0022Machinery\u0022 resource is awfully fiddly in MKS; I don\u0027t like them enough to want to reproduce something like it. \u00A0We\u0027ll see how we get on down the road, but I don\u0027t think we need them. \u00A0Under the \u0022tiered\u0022 approach, you\u0027d probably want to just plain abandon and replace your colony until you reach tier 5, and once you reach tier 5 on a planet, you\u0027re really pretty much done with it and the player will want to focus elsewhere anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love Extraplanetary Launchpads. \u00A0I also really like MKS\u0027 integration with EPL, with the Material Kits representing the low-tech bits of stamped aluminum, rivets and such that make up most of the rocket and the Specialized Parts representing the higher-tech stuff. \u00A0The only thing I don\u0027t like is that one engineer can plop down on Gilly, deploy a few drills and pop out with Romulan Battlecruiser in a couple months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the tiered parts system that we\u0027ve got here, there\u0027s no need to have two different production chains - the fancy parts and simple parts thing is effectively represented by the idea of \u0022Tier-1 Local Rocket Parts\u0022 taking up at most, say, 60% of the mass of the final ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMKS Logistics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMKS\u0027 planetary logistics is an idea that\u0027s pretty much necessary for that mod to work, but for what I\u0027m thinking of here, it isn\u0027t. \u00A0That\u0027s good, because planetary logistics are (in my estimation) an obvious plot

resources but not others - but to adapt to that you generally just need to sprinkle mining bases in different parts of the planet or maybe just re-adjust the drill heads. \u00A0Generally, you meet the

there should be a few different parts that all produce the same kind of things. \u00A0These parts should sorta look like they\u0027d be better suited for one kind of planetary body or another and they\u0027d have different masses and form-factors, and indeed they would be more applicable to one kind of world than another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m imagining that the part might have some property, e.g. \u0022Gravity Suitability\u0022 - if you hauled a low-grav farming module to Eve, it wouldn\u0027t work. \u00A0You could make this idea tweakable by having a massive resource \u0022Gravity Compensation\u0022 that you could load onto the part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E - kind of like ablators on heat shields. \u00A0You might, say, have to use some amount of this \u0022Gravity Suitability\u0022 material in order to make the low-grav farming module work on a body like Gilly - which maybe is below the bound of what the low-grav module can do without help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtmosphere density could be done this way too. \u00A0Maybe there could be one for solar radiation. \u00A0Who

Manually transferring things between bases, shuttles, miners, etc really contribute to the one-shot-base approach, because many small missions end up being repetitive. I\u0027d honestly abstract the resources completely: drop a factory, it produces N per day when all is said and done, no need to deal with the actual resource bins.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nColony building shouldn\u0027t feel like building rockets and ships, it seems like ships (to me) are micro and colonies are macro. If you think of it in RTS terms, playing MKS is so very micro that the higher level meta shrivels and dies. Not a bad thing if you like that, just... not what I would want.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere should definitely be no out-of-game math required to play.
