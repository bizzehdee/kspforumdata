It makes a 100km extremely quickly and efficiently and the command and service modules look great when they deploy.\n\nIf you guys want the rocket enough, I will compile a zip archive available for .craft download.\n\nHere is the actual rocket.\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13103.0;attach=21063;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13103.0;attach=21063;image)\n\nSecond stage just after completing the cirularization burn.\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13103.0;attach=21065;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13103.0;attach=21065;image)\n\nLast but not least, the CSM in orbit.\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13103.0;attach=21067;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13103.0;attach=21067;image)\n\n*Because some people might have a huge urge to complain about everything, I will make this statement in bold with a high fontsize.***I DID NOT MODEL THESE PARTS. I AM SIMPLY PUTTING THEM IN TO THE SAME DOWNLOAD AS THE CRAFT PACK TO MAKE THINGS EASIER TO THOSE WHO WANT THIS ROCKET.**\n\n**DOWNLOAD THIS CRAFT**\n\nThis dropbox link includes all of the parts used, the Mechjeb plug in (I had two identical and wasn\\\u0027t sure which one it was. Just use them both), and the .craft file.\n\nYou should be able to just load the .craft at the launch pad and not have to build this at all.\n\n[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76061308/Ares%20IX%20Rocket%20DOWNLOAD.zip](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76061308/Ares%20IX%20Rocket%20DOWNLOAD.zip)\n\n*Parts came from IFE intrepid series, Down Under Parts Pack, Stock Parts, NukaKorp Korion Command Pod series... All links will be provided at my soonest ability. These can also be found through a simple search on the forums.*"},{"CreatedByName":"GOOMH","CreatedById":8729,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T20:18:38Z","Content":"Nice recreation Vincent!
