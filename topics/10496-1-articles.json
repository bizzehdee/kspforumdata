Contains the plugin and an engine based on the General Electric GE90 turbofan engine.\n\nThe included engine will have the following attributes:\n\n- [li]Fuel consumption decreases as altitude increases. At an altitude of 6,000 m, the fuel consumption will roughly be half of the listed value.[/li]  \n[li]Fuel consumption increases as speed increases. At 200 m/s, the fuel consumption will be roughly 10% higher.[/li]  \n[li]Thrust decreases as altitude increases.[/li]  \n[li]Thrust increases slightly as speed increases. Technically this isn\\\u0027t realistic but is added for balance reasons.[/li]\n\nNASA has an engine simulator [here](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/ngnsim.html) for those interested.\n\n* * *\n\nPlugin uses an edited version of r4mon\\\u0027s Variable Engine plugin. r4mon has released his code under GPL, so this plugin is also released under GPL."},{"CreatedByName":"requimrar","CreatedById":8069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T11:42:57Z","Content":"Knowing that 0.15 is coming out in a week (max) and that there will be working atmospheric engines made my C7Studios?\n\nBut the model looks good, you could adapt it for the new Atmospheric Engine module once 0.15 comes out."},{"CreatedByName":"tadeass","CreatedById":16874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T11:47:03Z","Content":"Great job, downloading now.
