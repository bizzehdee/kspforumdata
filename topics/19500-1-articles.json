This has unfortunate results if your rocket crashes and you\u0027re not using modern fuel rod designs (they actually tested this: they put an early prototype in a train car after modifying it to go critical so they could see what would happen. Environmental laws really weren\u0027t so strong back then.), and still isn\u0027t so nice even WITH modern rods... but it\u0027s a wonderfully efficient system.
