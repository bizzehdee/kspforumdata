After a year or so of playing with KSP and several addons, I decided to play around with the specifications of the stock parts to push the limits. I\u0027ve stepped up the Poodle engine to 22000 and it\u0027s breaking force to 20000 to compensate. Also, the MK1-2 Command Pod has been altered to a crash tolerance of 4500. I\u0027ve also modified the max temperatures of the parts. This makes for a ridiculously fast little rocket, but it has MAJOR control issues. Without SAS activated, it drifts, and any control attempts make it spin wildly out of control and break the ship apart. With SAS switched on, I can only engage the engines to maybe 5% power before it gets a major case of the shakes and wobbles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made an attempt to increase the torque on the large SAS ring to 3000, but upon activating it, the ship flies apart from the torque. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if anyone\u0027s had any success with a similar situation, modifying a ship to ludicrous speed and maintaining control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.
