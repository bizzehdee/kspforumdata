On this players version of KSP (linux), the VesselChanged event is firing multiple times during the vessel loading process, but not in any pattern I can figure out. It seems to load half the vessel, fire VesselChanged, load a couple parts and fire VesselChanged again, then load a bunch of parts and fire VesselChanged, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it does so, the following line of code:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Eforeach (Part p in EditorLogic.SortedShipList)\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E throws a NullRef error. I can not replicate the error on my installation but the log is clear it is this exact line of code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can EditorLogic.SortedShipList be null while a vessel is loading if .SortedShipList is a list of parts in the editor when I know for sure several parts have been processed already?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) KSPAddon Flight Start running late?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one really puzzles me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a class AGXFlight which runs in the Flight Scene via the KSPAddon.Flight method. I have a static List in that class so that code on a vessel partModule can easily find it. On my dev installation (and presumably other players installations as no one else has reported wierdness), the KSPAddon.Flight Start() method runs and finished before KSP loads the vessel that will be flown and everything is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the log file this one player has sent me, the KSPAddon.Flight Start() method is running \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the vessel has loaded. This is causing me problems that I don\u0027t understand as I reference AGXFlight.StaticList from the OnSave method of the partModule. (When you load the flight scene, KSP loads and them immediately saves.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if my StaticList wasn\u0027t static, this would be straight forward, with the Flight Start() method running late, the StaticList does not exist for the code in the partModule OnSave to reference. However, AGXFlight.StaticList is static, shouldn\u0027t the list still exist in memory for me to reference? Or does the fact that the AGXFlight class is not static, so without an initialized AGXFlight class in existence, the static StaticList does not exist even though it is static?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really out of my depth on this one and hope someone has some ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
