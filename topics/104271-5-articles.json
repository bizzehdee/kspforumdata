I\u0027m not a marketing person, but it seems to me that many marketing campaigns begin with small cryptic teasers of some sort.\n\u003E A medium like Twooter is well suited for dropping a small, potentially cryptic, remark which gets people thinking, wondering, guessing.\n\u003E \n\u003E A medium like the forum, which is essentially dialogue based, may not be well suited for such an objective.\n\u003E \n\u003E We may not like it, but they have no obligation to announce things the way that we would find most enjoyable.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s probably going to be a better ride for us if we accept that SQUAD is really who\u0027s in the pilot\u0027s seat and try to enjoy the ride, rather than being back-seat drivers pilots.\n\u003E \n\u003E I know I don\u0027t want to spend the next ten days being angry and frustrated.\n\u003E \n\u003E Happy landings!\n\nHere\u0027s the catch, though. They are obligated to make us happy, because we pay the bills. I don\u0027t think Squad are yet to the point where they\u0027re to big to fail. Creating a poor reputation with fans can have a negative impact on your profits.\n\nSadly, I feel like we\u0027ve become a society that has become willing to settle for the bare minimum from the companies we support. No matter how much we complain, we never actually vote with our dollar. We still see the new Transformers movie. We buy this years Madden, despite the minimal change. My money is worth more than that.\n\nSo, here\u0027s the rub. I\u0027ve already payed Squad. So, essentially, they\u0027re betting that any negative press I build will be less than negligible.\n\nThis was more of a rambling post.
