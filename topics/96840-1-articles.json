Also if you cannot pay your debt then one of your buildings can be downgraded. If you have no money and no building to downgrade then you\u0027re a bankrupt and your career ends in humiliating defeat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-16T12:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrected version number for justice\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T12:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.9 is not the same as 0.90. 0.9 added struts and usable staging, 0.90 added upgradeable buildings, Mk3 parts, etc, and put the game in Beta.

Even on hard, the advances on several contracts types (space science, satellites) will typically be more than enough to cover the costs of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also take on further contracts and use the advance from them to cover any deficit in a different contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think loans would only really be used to rush upgrade buildings, and nothing else.
