The \u0022Live From Mission Control!\u0022 subforum is used almost exclusively for posting videos. If you want to showcase your craft (this often includes sharing craft files), the Spacecraft Exchange may be a better place to go. The \u0022Fan Works\u0022 section is generally used for artwork, writing, music, and heavily edited or not-in-game videos, as well as other, more \u0022creative,\u0022 things done by forum members. There are two other subforums where your work would be more appropriate. Either of them would be more suited to your videos. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say this because your posts are responsible for \u003Cem\u003Eabout half of the content marked as \u0022Special\u0022 in this subforum\u003C/em\u003E. The \u0022Special\u0022 designation is given to things that don\u0027t fit into the other designations given for prefixes. Sometimes \u0022Special\u0022 tags are needed (there\u0027s no tag for \u0022Music,\u0022 for example) but much of the time, things marked \u0022Special\u0022 would go better in a different subforum. This is a shame, because some of the things marked \u0022Special\u0022 are \u003Cem\u003Ereally special\u003C/em\u003E, but others are just mismatched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what would I do if I was in your shoes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would move my future activity into the \u0022Live from Mission Control!\u0022 subforum, or maybe the Spacecraft Exchange. If you are posting regular content, I would also consolidate your videos into a single thread; after all, there\u0027s really no reason to make over a dozen completely separate threads with very similar content, and putting all videos in a single thread helps you grow your subscriber base and viewership without cluttering the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like your videos, but I don\u0027t like that you\u0027re posting them in this subforum, and that you\u0027re making a completely separate thread for each one. I would really appreciate it if you could take this into consideration. I\u0027m sorry for any inconvenience, and I don\u0027t mean to offend. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
