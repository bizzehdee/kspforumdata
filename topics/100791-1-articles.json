Other parts aren\u0027t showing up because stock RESOURCE definitions are missing, which crashes the part loader. Looks like you do have all four mods correctly installed, but you overwrote the entire KSP/GameData folder when you installed the first one. For future reference, Mac OS X will only offer to merge folders if you copy and paste, not move. In general, it\u0027s better to merge by hand even on Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
