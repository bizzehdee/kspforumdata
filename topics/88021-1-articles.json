There are too many parameters to search on. I might be able to write a custom program that does a search by trying a whole bunch of possible start dates. I assume we can chose arbitrary starting time in the KSP world? And the challenge is to visit SOI of each planet, right? The Eve - Duna - Jool series of fly-bys should be fairly straight forward. The challenge would be in including Moho, Dres, and Eeloo in the search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoSlash, I\u0027m not sure if this is a traveling salesman. There are a couple of permutations possible along the way, but your starting options are greatly limited. The delta-V reduction dictates that your first fly-by should be Kerbin. That will only give you enough boost to reach Duna or Eve. And going to Duna first makes visiting Moho and Eve very complicated. So Kerbin - Eve - Moho - Duna pretty much have to be visited in this order. And you\u0027ll need Jool fly-by to reach Eeloo. So your options are visiting Dres before or after Jool, which might not even be an option depending on where Eeloo is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does pick up the NP complexity here is where to budget your burns between fly-bys. But I don\u0027t think that is even solvable. I would go with \u0022zero\u0022 delta-V plan. That is, assume that any delta-V change required to reach your next planet is due to fly-by. The only fuel usage is then due to corrections you have to make to hit the right part of your next target\u0027s SOI. Fuel requirement for the mission should then be the Kerbin escape budget. Perhaps, even just Trans-Munar if you want to include one more fly-by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith \u0022zero\u0022 delta-V plan, the algorithm would simply chose the next good Eve fly-by date, and see if it can make the necessary fly-bys. Then pick the next date, try again, etc. If it finds a solution, it will consist simply of series of periapsides you need to hit on each fly-by.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T02:26:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T13:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a semi-relevant video demonstration that covers some of the questions you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lIORB7svhaA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T14:12:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T15:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been trying to build a Matlab simulation which models the motion of the planets (on rails) and has the capability to predict the motion of a spacecraft using the n-body problem.
