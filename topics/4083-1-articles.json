Its usaly in house and proven. I am the only mod on a busy forum for a webcomic and thats just because I fit two things. I have been a fan from the start, mod after three years, its been 10 years and I havnt burned the forum down. I would like more mods.....however I would ban anyone that became mod from choice of people in the forums because I would not give one of them power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you fit the needs of the forum and when the forum needs, You could be the a Mod...but they have to want you, not the other way round.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
