It starts randomly, sometimes after some seconds once the asteroid is grabbed, sometimes a bit longer. After some seconds of overheating the rocket explodes. I have tried to deactivate everything, nothing works except releasing the asteroid (free pivot does not works).\n\nFortunately I have a savegame some seconds before. I can provide it if required. I could also make a screenshot.\n\nThree pieces are starting overheating together: seismic sensor, RCS tank and a structural element:\n\n![b9DXpGn.png](http://i.imgur.com/b9DXpGn.png)\n\nPlease tell me if there is any way to solve this issue, editing the savegame if required. Right now my mission is lost and I don\u0027t want to start it again. Thanks.\n\nEDIT: I have done a second check and actually no structural element is overheating. The 3 parts which are overheating are the seismic sensor, the barometer and the thermometer, all of them stuck to the RCS tank. However once I saw the core in the service bay overheating as well, so I am not sure the problem come from the sensors. The problem is immediately solved when I release the asteroid.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T18:08:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:55:44Z","Content":"It is not a good screenshot of the problem parts, (also it shows clearly that you should not be posting in Unmodded installs)\n\nIf the structural element is an Octagonal or Cubic Octagonal Strut, then there is a [known bug](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5174)"},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T21:24:40Z","Content":"I could not make a better screenshot, when I grab the asteroid the view is centered on the asteroid.

It exists to lure you into using it, whereupon it latches onto your save file and destroys all of your hard work.

I am also using a pair of other mods, like Kerbal Engineer, but nothing that seem even remotely related to what is happening. I will try to remove all mods, though. Once I will have done that and check my savegame still works and the bug still occurs, I will send the savegame to you.\n\n1) It is a 1.0 career but a fresh mission / spaceship.\n\n2) I did not know there were such thing as a thermal debug info. I will try that.\n\nThanks for your help."},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T07:11:57Z","Content":"OK, I have removed all mods and the bug disappeared. I have then tried to add them one by one and it appears that FAR was causing the overheating. I upgraded it to the very last version and it solved the problem.\n\nSorry for that, this thread shoud actually not have been in this section. Thanks to all."}]}
