Just for reference where I am now, I\u0027ve got 4 levels of science unlocked, just unlocked heavy rocketry and fueling systems on the 5th tier. However using the best engines, best fuel tanks my ship comes out extremely tall and extremely heavy, so staging wise I only have enough power to crash into the moon. I don\u0027t have enough tech to make a stage to retro softly into it, and don\u0027t have the landing tech yet. So I desperately need at least 300 science right now to unlock 2 upper levels of techs. However my current science is exactly 0.6, and I have absolutely no idea how to get more. I exhausted the goo, the thermometer, the barometer, the evas, the sci jr, now they all yield zero now. So what do I do? I noticed a few of my contracts yeild miniscule science but it\u0027s nowhere near enough for me.

If part limits were not a thing, you could land on the Mun and return with only 10 science points spent, to get the LV-T45, liquid fuel tanks, and inline decouplers. That\u0027s all you actually need, strictly speaking (though it\u0027s not a comfortable way to fly, by any stretch of the imagination). It is true that the 2.5m engines are strictly better than the 1.25m ones, but we\u0027re talking about something like 10% better (or less). They mostly just keep the part count down, and make it easier to get away with design mistakes (because you can oversize your launch stages). Bigger fuel tanks have exactly the same stats and contents as stacks of smaller fuel tanks - they merely reduce the part count. This goes for almost any technology: it offers additional options, but it very rarely ever unlocks additional capabilities. There\u0027s probably only like 20 parts in the entire tech tree that qualify for that, and about half of them are for planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, getting more science is not necessarily going to solve your problem. You\u0027ll get slightly improved margins from using 2.5m engines, but that\u0027ll mean you may be able to land on the Mun without crashing... and then find yourself without the fuel to go home. And then you\u0027ll ask yourself: do I need \u003Cem\u003Eeven more science\u003C/em\u003E?! No, you don\u0027t.
