I just recently got into orbit and back, and here\\\u0027s what I found:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Make sure your spaceplane has all the horzontal and vertical control surfaces a normal plane would have, and that it actually flies through aerodynamics rather than thrust. There are other threads on how to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Keep your plane pointed prograde until you\\\u0027ve made it below 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Rather than doing a heavy reentry burn and vertically dropping, do a light burn that brings your spaceplane in slowly; don\\\u0027t entirely kill your orbit, just bring the periapsis down to about 5km or so and atmospheric drag will do the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Don\\\u0027t turn your atmospheric engines back on until you\\\u0027re below 12.5km, then use them to stabilize into normal plane flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Don\\\u0027t expext your ASAS to fly the plane for you. This late in the mission, your plane will naturally want to tilt up due to where the remaining fuel is localized. Do not allow your plane to get tilted more than 40 degrees above the horizon, or you will start to tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
