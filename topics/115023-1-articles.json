I love the idea...\n\nSo, what about a laser measuring tool in the science section, that actually measures direct distances to where its sciency measuring beam thingie hits something?\n\nIt could work like the \u0022Surface Scanning Module\u0022, where you just get the option to open a window with the measuring results displayed. It could assist in many situations and keep the GUI free from information flood.\n\nPlease discuss or add your opinion below.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T10:36:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frank\\_G**"},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:02:20Z","Content":"Switch to cockpit view, and find the \u0027Radar Altimeter\u0027, it\u0027s usually near the altimeter. It measures distance to the ground up to 1500 meters. I do agree that there should be an option to conjure up this meter in the outside view though ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) It is also annoyingly absent from probes. I\u0027d just like this to be available in the normal view."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:03:06Z","Content":"A laser rangefinder is a good idea. Ideally it would both give you a readout of the distance and include a very narrow light source so that you can see where exactly it is pointed."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:24:40Z","Content":"A laser rangefinder would be a good new science part. Handy to know how far to that crater rim etc.\n\nYes it could be used as a above ground level altimeter, if mounted correctly and pointing straight down, but I think that should be standard function. If a parachute knows exactly how far above ground level it is so that it opens at the right time how come the crew in the object the parachutes are attached to don\u0027t?"}]}
