To answer some of your questions and to give so reassurance, I have compiled a Q\u0026A:**\n\n* * *\n\n**Q:** How will the fuel generation systems as described in the Mars Direct plan work?\n\n**A:** I do not currently have plans for this system however it WILL be implemented.

I most likely will develop my own plugin for generating fuel on the surface of Duna\n\n**Q:** What Diameter is the HAB going to be?\n\n**A:** At the moment it is 3.5m It will most likely be made larger in the future.

This is because in order to make a texture, you need to know how to make a UV map determining which part of the texture map corresponds with which part of the model, and it takes a keen understanding of the model itself in order to figure out the best way to unwrap it for texturing.\n\nWhen I made my stockalike SDHI Service Module System, once I have the geometry mostly done, I would figure out how to unwrap the model and lay it out on a flat canvas, and then use the UV maps as a template to draw on. To get the stockalike art style, I would extract the stock command pod and fuel tank models, save copies of their textures, and then experiment in Photoshop / Fireworks CS6 to figure out brush and stamp techniques used to recreate the desired smudged and dinged look. I would end up spending more time on these experiments than actually making my final textures, but that\u0027s part of the process of understanding an art style you\u0027re trying to emulate.\n\nAlso, texturing is always going to be an iterative process. You\u0027re going to have to go back and forth painting your model a little, exporting it to the game for testing and comparing it with other stock parts. Nobody is able to provide step-by-step instructions teaching you how to get to stockalike in one or two passes."},{"CreatedByName":"UTK Aerospace Ind.","CreatedById":133266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T15:46:27Z","Content":"I have been working on that, and I have my UV\u0027s but its just trying to get the textures captured from the stock parts and apply them to my model. I dont want anyone to do it for me because I need to learn... I just need some help is all:\n\nSo I can use the stamp tool in Photoshop to get the texture from the stock parts to my parts? I will try to just experiment a bit in PS and let you guys know what progress I make. I am however struggling with creating UVs for advanced models with LOTS of geometry... So tips on that are much needed, otherwise I just plan on restarting the model and texturing it before I make it too advanced.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T15:58:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UTK Aerospace Ind.**"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T03:58:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At the moment it is 3.5m It will most likely be made larger in the future.
