This is not a problem if you just move around a struct, however I tend to build stuff that I want in symmetry mod, in single mod first, then pick the part of again and use symmetry, as it tends to make things easier. However every now and again when I pick the part up, it forces me to try and join the wrong end of the construction to the main body, and since I haven\u0027t found a way to switch to the other end, I often have to rebuild stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using Editor Extension, and sometimes when I try and use symmetry to build, it tend to try and mirror instead.

The construction interface seems to forget which end is which and, if you move it later, tries to attach the wrong end of the strut to the mother part, so that the piece you added to it is inside the mother part. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to undo it once it happens.

Symmetry works around the construction room\u0027s default axis. Place that strut sticking straight up on the top of your construction, use symmetry to place solar panels on each side, then move the whole assembly to the side. But be careful: if you then use symmetry to double the doubled sub-assembly, the interface can get stuck in a weird 3X symmetry which consists of 1) the part you place, 2) its mirrored piece, and 3) a phantom second duplicate which you can\u0027t see because it lies precisely in the same space as one of the others, but it adds mass to your ship on that side, draws power, burns fuel, etc. Very frustrating, and the first time it happened, it took me forever to figure out why my ship kept lolling over to one side. The thing to watch for when that happens is that the VAB button switches to 3X symmetry while you\u0027re trying to double the doubled part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T17:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have 3x \u0022rocket\u0022 symmetry. it is by default set to the root part(in this case, probably the pod). Its symmetry \u0022line\u0022(I\u0027ve forgotten the proper word, it seems...) is vertical, so the panels are placed symmetrical around a vertical line of symmetry. You can either pick up the girder, place it on top of your craft so it is in line with the pod, place panels on it and move the girder back, or use a SelectRoot addon(very useful when used with subassembly manager) to make the girder the core part, place panels and select the pod to be the core part again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I am too late...
