So my first question is: Can someone put a name to this problem? I feel kinda stupid forgetting it, but I might as well find out. And second of all, what is the greatest distance that two ships can clip relative to each other? I think I heard it was somewhere around five meters\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T05:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not entirely sure what you mean, but when you go into a time warp past 2x, all ships go on rails and collisions are no longer simulated, meaning that the ships can drift apart. This may explain what you are seeing. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Divaglio3578","CreatedById":29719,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T05:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, so if one ship is nestled inside another in orbit, and I go to \u002B2x warp, the ships will phase through each other if all relative movement isn\\\u0027t cancelled out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T05:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know that is true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Divaglio3578","CreatedById":29719,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T05:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thanks so much. Planning on building an orbital spaceship carrier that allows for ships to fly into its hanger, and use a Damned Robotics hinge to close hanger doors.
