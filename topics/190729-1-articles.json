But in one of my recue mission, after I manage to get close to the rescuee, I got a message saying that the rescuee has been accessible and I can EVA them to the rescue ship immediately but I wasn\u0027t able to do that again. My suspicion is that I got close enough with the rescuee but I\u0027m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T02:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou gain control of foreign vessels when your own ships (or kerbal) are close, 2 km or less. If you can\u0027t EVA my best bet is that the stranded vessel is a mk1 doble seat thingy. You have to manually open the hatch of that one, right clicking in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, some mods have parts with no hatches \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Did you install any?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
