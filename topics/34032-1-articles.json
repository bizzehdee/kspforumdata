Could this be a result of my S.A.S. trying to correct at the frequency of my tug?

Quicksaving and loading didn\u0027t seem to have much of an impact and there were no clipped parts, and only contained one ASAS module. Quantum I struts sounds good though. I might look into doing some file editing, but it would be nice if there was some sort of slider to determine the sensitivity of the ASAS, like tuning it up high for fast corrections and low for something like the avionics package.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
