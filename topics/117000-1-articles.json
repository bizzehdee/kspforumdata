Let\u0027s suppose you had an interplanetary spacecraft with a powerful, high thrust, high ISP engine that only works in vacuum. Examples : a high efficiency NERVA engine. Reason it would only work in vacuum is that the propellant flow isn\u0027t enough to shed the waste heat from the nuclear reactor, so the engine would need a massive heat radiator. If the heat radiator were a droplet radiator or a lightweight conventional radiator, even the slightest impingement of atmosphere would destroy it. Or an open exhaust fusion engine would presumably be the same way - the tiniest bit of cold atmospheric gas would contaminate the fusion reaction and halt it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027ve got your interplanetary mother ship in a circular orbit. Explorers are down on the planet and want to get back to the mother ship. You have balls of steel and perfect engineering skillz so you are confident your equipment will not fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you undock the engine from the rest of the mother ship, leaving the main propellant tanks, habitation and laboratory modules, etc in orbit. The engine module is just the heat radiator and enough propellant tankage for this maneuver, and the power take-off module that extracts power from the nuclear engine. (with a fusion engine, you\u0027d collect power from the electrically charged particles from aneutronic fusion, you\u0027d have a sterling engine if it were a NERVA fission engine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent vehicle has enough delta V to reach apogee above the atmosphere, but will swiftly fall back down. Your engine module does a big braking burn and essentially intersects the ascent vehicle at the top of it\u0027s ballistic arc. You dock instantly (the ascent vehicle is computer controlled and aligned the right way) and then the engine module does a high ISP burn to get back into orbit. With the engine module \u002B ascent vehicle mass, in vacuum you develop enough thrust to be greater than the gravity of the planet in question. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason to do this is to be a propellant miser - a heavy vacuum-only nuclear engine is going to be more efficient than anything an ascent vehicle could have on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReasons not to do this - on many possible approach trajectories, the nuclear engine will pass right by the crew compartment of the ascent vehicle. A NERVA engine or a fusion engine at full burn would be just as dangerous as standing next to the live reactor core after the Chernobyl reactor exploded - lethal dose in seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the maneuver fails, the ascent vehicle would fall back down. On somewhere like Mars, it would mean death for the crew as it wouldn\u0027t have enough propellant to stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I thought of a few tweaks to make it more practical.

You\u0027d \u0022catch\u0022 it and transfer propellant to the tankage of the engine module, then drop it. This would be a way to refuel the mothership.

You launch another ship to orbit, rendezvous with the returning ship at the closest approach, dock with it, and use the new ship to capture the interplanetary ship to a nice low orbit. You have to know how to rendezvous and dock quickly and reliably, but otherwise it\u0027s surprisingly easy even with the stock interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T21:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDas Valdez did this in one of his streams on Duna.
