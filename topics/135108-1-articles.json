I\u0027ve built two and four engine Laythe landers, but they\u0027re so heavy, they need a big, expensive transfer stage.\u00A0As just a check to make sure it can do it, I create one that can SSTO on Kerbin, then I launch a transfer stage later, and a refueler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first designed this in Sandbox, and made sure it worked, and it did. Then I transferred it over to my career mode, made a few minor changes, and tried to launch it. But while I could get it into orbit in Sandbox, I just couldn\u0027t manage it in Career, despite several tries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I thought it must be that Jed was a 5-star pilot in Sandbox, but only a 2-star in my career, so the better piloting must have been modeled somehow in fuel usage, but no, it doesn\u0027t seem that it is. When I transferred this (slightly modified!) craft back to Sandbox, it no longer could make it there either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn frustration, I checked the two versions, and found that the new one was a mere .3 tons heavier than the old one. That\u0027s how close this was, for a 9.5 ton vehicle. I got rid of a couple of intakes, and a reaction wheel, and a bit of fuel, getting rid of .2 tons, and launched again, and lo and behold, it made it into orbit - barely. 14 m/s of fuel left. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all it finally took... two tenths of a ton.
