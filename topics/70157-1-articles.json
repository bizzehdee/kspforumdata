The goal is to have it initially focused on aircraft and basic instrumentation, with space capabilities and material studies coming a bit later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one stumbling block I\u0027m having is science yield and data size in Mits of experiments. I\u0027d like to make the atmospheric scanner a relatively early-game part, but the 200 Mit datasize makes that not really feasible. Is the variable for that user-exposed? If so, how can I change it nondestructively? Digging through the config files hasn\u0027t helped me yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould folks here being interested in playing a tree that primarily relies on aircraft and transmission with sample return coming a bit later? I\u0027m thinking of significant integration with SCANsat and Kethane (later-tree), weighted so solids are earlier than liquids, and the LV-N and heavy lifting are relatively expensive in terms of science --- the goal is to make light one-way probe missions feasable midgame, but require interplanetary levels of science before getting the top-end unlocks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T17:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you\u0027re looking for the \u0027dataScale\u0027 value in the ScienceDefs.cfg file.
