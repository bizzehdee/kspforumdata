For how much less we can use the Kerbin chart here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you consider the type of transfer where you have a low periapsis over Kerbin to exploit the Oberth effect then whatever our destination we have to go through the Kerbin-Mun Transfer and/or Kerbin-Minmus Transfer nodes as appropriate. The saving is then the difference in delta-V needed to reach that node. That\u0027s 760 m/s for refuelling at Minmus orbit and 590 m/s at Mun orbit. A good saving on a typical interplanetary departure of 1000-2000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course that delta-V has to be made up for and more to get to Mun or Minmus orbit to begin with, but by requiring less delta-V on the spacecraft at once you require less fuel storage which makes the ship lighter, and then you can potentially reduce the number of engines and keep the same TWR making it lighter still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drawback to refuelling at the Mun or Minmus is you need to time your departure burn from their correctly to put your Kerbin periapsis in the right place for your interplanetary transfer burn. This can then constrain your departure burn date to be away from the optimum date in the transfer window. The effect is worse for a Minmus refuel than a Munar one, and either way it\u0027s generally bad for Moho which has short transfer windows but tolerable for other destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for refuelling in Low Kerbin Orbit, well while it\u0027s a reasonable place to refuel I don\u0027t much see the point of a fuel \u003Cem\u003Estation\u003C/em\u003E. Ships small enough that the station could top up many of them are probably small enough to launch fully fuelled, while ships large enough that you can\u0027t launch them fully fuelled are probably large enough to drink all the station\u0027s fuel in one go and therefore you\u0027re just better off sending up a simple refueller to fill just that ship than running a station with all its extra complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T12:38:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T12:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can sum it up in one word: OPTIONS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T12:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHelps even more when you build the ship offworld \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs people have said, only lifting fuel for one direction of a return trip is a total gamechanger.
