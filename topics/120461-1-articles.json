It\u0027s called magneto-hydrodynamic aerobraking. In layman\u0027s terms, you stick a really strong electro-magnet in front of your craft. We all know that anything screaming through atmosphere at a few kilometers a second has a very pretty fiery inferno around it: that is a plasma of air particles that are heated up by the friction with your ship. Now because it\u0027s in a plasma state, \u003Cem\u003Eit contains a percentage of charged particles\u003C/em\u003E, which means it can be affected by a magnetic field. This does several helpful things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The charged particles conform to the magnetic field and even channel most of the non-charged elements of the plasma along the magnetic field. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Now air is bouncing off the magnetic field a ways away from your actual ship, so the heat transfer to your hull is reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The aerodynamics of the magnetic field\u0027s shape are inferred onto the vessel for as long as air friction is creating plasma. That could drastically affect how deep into the atmosphere you can safely aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Drag forces are applied directly to the magnet, not whatever happens to be facing in the direction of travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can \u003Ca href=\u0022http://selenianboondocks.com/2010/02/mhd-aerobraking-and-thermal-protection-part-i-introduction/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eread the long version here\u003C/a\u003E from someone who actually knows what they\u0027re talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I admit to knowing next to nothing about mods, but here at least is an idea; you tell me if it\u0027s possible. Could some sort of invisible collision mesh with a high heat tolerance roughly simulate something like mentioned above? If so, maybe it could be made to be deployed from an electromagnet part when conditions are met? Conditions would be based on velocity and air pressure, same variables the game bases reentry affects on - because the magnet wouldn\u0027t do anything if there wasn\u0027t any plasma being generated by air friction. And of course, because it\u0027s an electromagnet, it stands to reason the electromagnet part would demand a considerable amount of electric charge. Possibly best coupled with a reactor from Interstellar Extended or Near Future Technologies, or at least a literal ton of batteries capable of sustaining the magnet for the duration of its use. Also, pretty useless / just showy if you\u0027re not playing with Deadly Reentry or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts? Is this even possible to pull off in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
