(When you built in in the VAB, it\u0027s the part you clicked on first not the one you clicked on second).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I have seen slightly buggy behavior out of this sometimes where the strut nubs become individual bits of debris (each nub tracked separately in the tracking center) and float away.
