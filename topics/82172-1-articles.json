Well, depending on who you talk to, we\u0027re either 7 or 70 years away from sending people. Let\u0027s break it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first difference is public vs. private. SpaceX (I.e., Musk) says he\u0027ll do it by 2025 or so, come hell or high water, even if government funding is as scarce as a donkey\u0027s shaved ass in an Amish strip club. You be the judge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the serious among you, there\u0027s a lot of work to be done. The really sad part is, in my opinion, how little of it has really been done since the termination of the Apollo program. Nominally, ISS should be nothing but a big getting-technology-ready--for-Mars facility. In reality, it\u0027s turned into a big (though still useful, if only marginally so) session of Kumbaya-in-space. There are seriously big and real problems we still need to solve, like life-level radiation shielding and multi-year multi-person isolated self-sustaining space environments, that we could have solved if we had seriously started tackling them 30 years ago. I put this research, of fully-funded and properly managed, at 8-10 years. Since we are being realistic, though, that is more likely multiplied by a factor of 2 or 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the issue of space hardware--there and back again, if you will. This problem is the usual scapegoat, but a minor investment in orbital assembly technologies would have fixed this in as little as 3 years using existing launch vehicles. A sustained evolved shuttle pyrenean would have completely circumvented the issue of manned rating, and you could have skipped the process and used existing HLVs for every other component at a near-zero NRE, and you could start right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescent/Ascent is another problem entirely. Fellow KSP players, you are more familiar with the details of the problem than most. We can\u0027t even use the Magic Bouncy Ball approach past 800 kg or so, and Sky Crane approach will never be approved for manned missions (far too risky, far too many likely and catastrophic failure modes). If you really want to enable there-and-back Mars missions, this is where your efforts will be focused, and why the recent LDSD test was one of the first indicators that NASA is actually getting serious about at least half of this problem. Ascent and return, at least, can be solved by automated and pre-placed transit of fuel repositories. I\u0027d put these technologies at 8-10 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem that remains, then, is the question of what to do while we\u0027re spending months and months waiting for a fuel-efficient return. Should we drill? Rove via buggy? Focus on the poles? Strangely, few people seem to have seriously thought about this issue, aside from the seed appeal of putting people there is the first place. It will probably be left up to the geologists, like Apollo, and the astrobiologists, which isn\u0027t entirely a bad thing. Still, I think some inputs from us engineers wouldn\u0027t be inappropriate. Another round of golf-off-Earth, anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
