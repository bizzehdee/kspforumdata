I turned up the speed on the treadmill for a brief sprint. These past six months have given me a renewed sense of purpose, but how much longer can I stay here? This past week of waiting for the decision had been stressful, not enough direction in my days and too much downtime. The physical and health tests were no problem, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve passed those. Maths and science were never my strong subjects, but I still should be good enough for the corps. I\u0027m fairly old to be re-accepted as a kerbonaut, yeah, but there are older kerbals in active service.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Psych test. That was it really. Bill\u0027s death had hit me harder than the others, I don\u0027t know why. The question was, had I convinced the agency doctors that I\u0027d recovered from it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the wall-length mirror in front of me I saw Bill enter the gym. Bob, not Bill. Of course it was Bob. I shuddered and shook it off. I guess Bill\u0027s spectre still haunts me occasionally. Bob spotted me running and began to walk over. Bob had been amazing after the accident, representing kerbonaut interests during the investigation. It was hardly a surprise he was appointed to the directorship to replace the ousted Gene Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had changed us all of course, the accident. I\u0027d lost it, overwhelmed with anxiety I\u0027d quit the corps. I wasn\u0027t the only one of course, but perhaps mine was the most dramatic exit. Bob instead had become more focussed, determined to see the culture which allowed the accident crushed. He had sullened too, no longer the jovial kerbal the corps had loved so much. His face now permanently wore the grief from the loss of his friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob stopped beside me and smiled. He was looked pleased, sure, but it was a calculated happiness, no longer the spontaneous warmth of his younger self back when we were training together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Congratulations Milzer, there\u0027s no point keeping you in suspense any longer. You\u0027ve been cleared for active duty.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA wave of relief washed over me. I guess I hadn\u0027t realized just how much weight I\u0027d been carrying for that decision. It felt as if the last two years were being lifted off my shoulders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks Bob... I... it\u0027s an honour to be serving in the corps again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s not all, we want you to be commander of our next great project.\u0022 Bob leaned forward. \u0022We\u0027ve finally restored funding to send a crewed mission to Duna.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI slowed the treadmill to a walk. \u0022Are you serious? That\u0027s... I don\u0027t know what to say...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve done excellently these past few months, Milzer. I know Bill\u0027s death shook you more than most, but you\u0027ve shown us all how committed you are to the program. You\u0027ve the experience we want, and the level-headedness needed in a commander. I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a better choice for this mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to absorb what Bob was telling me. A command position? It was what I had always dreamed of before the accident, but afterwards I hadn\u0027t considered that it might be an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s one more thing...\u0022 Bob fidgeted uncomfortably. \u0022We\u0027ve recommissioned the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E for this program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled and nearly fell over. Stopping the treadmill I stepped off and tried to compose myself next to Bob. I tried to slow my breathing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The truth is the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E is still one of the most advanced craft we\u0027ve ever built,\u0022 he continued. \u0022It\u0027s far cheaper and more versatile than a traditional stack; it built most of Magellan Station after all. And our engineers have gone over and refined the design countless times, we\u0027ve learned from the mistakes of Project Ocean.\u0022 Bob leaned forward, looked me in the eyes and intoned \u0022I made sure of that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sat down on a workout bench and rubbed my forehead. He was right of course, from an technically standpoint Project Ocean was brilliant. But we\u0027d all been squeezed by the bureaucracy, the engineers especially. Mission turnarounds were too quick and kerbonaut feedback went unheeded as the engineers scrambled to refit the ships in time. All so the program would remain in the public limelight and funding would keep rolling in. All of us had at some level known that an accident was just around the corner, but with seeming success after success no one was brave enough to speak up. Still, if I were to trust anyone to make the right changes, it would be Bill\u0027s closest friend. Besides, it wasn\u0027t the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E which crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stood up. \u0022...I\u0027m not sure if I could command another orbiter... I mean, I know it wasn\u0027t an \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E model at fault, but...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I understand,\u0022 Bob replied. \u0022After what happened I don\u0027t think I could face another trip to space either. That\u0027s why I accepted the directorship. But you were always more at home up there than me.\u0022 He paused for a while. \u0022If you turn down the command and the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E, you\u0027re still part of the corps. But the truth is I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be sending up another stack for quite a while, certainly not manned. We\u0027ll respect your decision if you don\u0027t want to fly in an orbiter, but if that\u0027s the case I really don\u0027t think you\u0027ll get another flight. I mean this as a friend Milzer, I\u0027m not trying to pressure you into anything, I just want you to know the facts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, I get that. Thanks Bob.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Think it over. Talk about it with Trudy over the weekend, I know how much she\u0027s encouraged you through the re-enlistment. I\u0027ve arranged a meeting with you at 1000 on Monday, you can let me know your decision then.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe smiled as he shook my hand, and I caught a glimpse of the old Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, and Milzer? It\u0027s great to have you back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he turned and walked out of the gym I thought of how excited the kids would be to hear that their father was a kerbonaut again, and later how happy Trudy would be to share in my news. Even with my anxieties over the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E, I had already begun to realise that there was really only one decision I could make. I swallowed and began to collect my things as I headed back to the changing rooms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027m going to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dodrian","CreatedById":12564,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T23:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChapter 2: The \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EAegean\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2WQTwcOl.png\u0022 alt=\u00222WQTwcOl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had been a busy month since I\u0027d accepted Bob\u0027s offer. I\u0027d been launched straight into training for the first mission, ostensibly a resupply mission to Magellan station in LKO, but really a chance to shakedown the newly recomissioned \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s also an opportunity to get to know some of the planned Duna crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESitting on the runway waiting for the launch had brought back my nerves. Sure, I\u0027d been nervous at launch before, but underneath that had always been an excitement. Today that excitement was gone, an anxiety lurking in its place. Still, it\u0027s an easy mission brief, or as easy as any spaceflight could be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Preflight checks complete, all systems go\u0022 said Jesnik, obviously jittery at her first launch. Jesnik is a by-the-book kerbal, she comes across as uptight, but really she\u0027s green and hiding her inexperience by being almost militaristic in following procedure. I guess we were kerbonauts all like that at some point. She\u0027ll loosen up after a few flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E~:Copy that, three minutes until launch window.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidberry at CAPCOM. He\u0027s a good kerbonaut, but for some reason we don\u0027t get on. There\u0027s no ill will between us and we respect eachother enough, there\u0027s just... coldness. I can\u0027t really explain why, but there you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJesnik secured the checklists in a pocket beside her. I can tell she doesn\u0027t like not having them in front of her. Hopefully procedure and training will soon be replaced by experience and intuition. She\u0027s exceptionally bright though, a perfect science officer for the Duna mission, and this flight will make her the youngest kerbonaut in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked over to Caldrin on my right. Easily the best flier in the corps, I was glad when Bob told me he\u0027d be our pilot and my second in command for the Duna missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E~:Two minutes until launch window.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin leaned over and grinned at Jesnik. \u0022You all right there Jess?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe looked through the forward windows to the runway ahead of us. \u0022Yeah, nervous I guess,\u0022 she replied. \u0022But excited to finally be here\u0022 she quickly added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin smiled at me. \u0022It\u0027s the drop at the end of the runway she\u0027s worried about. But that\u0027s nothing compared to what us old navy pilots had to face on the carrier launches, eh Milzer?\u0022 Caldrin always knew how to lighten the mood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Heh, yeah\u0022 I said, trying to force a laugh. It was hard to keep the fake calm with my stomach in knots. \u0022That was always a white-knuckle experience, I never quite got used to how the catapult would hurl us over the water. An orbiter launch is a cakewalk compared to some of the stunts we had to pull in the navy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E~:One minute until launch window. The Aegean is all yours Caldrin, safe flying.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Copy that\u0022 replied Caldrin into his headset, running his hand across an instrument panel. He took a moment to collect himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn orbiter ascent is much slower than those old stack rockets. It\u0027s harder to engineer a rendezvous in an orbiter, and requires more concentration on the part of the pilot. There was no real point to a countdown, so Mission Control lets the pilot call the shots until after liftoff. It\u0027s a pretty intense responsibility. As commander I held ultimate responsibility for the missions, but those were slow decisions with time to think, I could handle that. Caldrin would have a split second before we passed over the abort line a third of the way down the runway to decide if the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E could take off or if we needed to cut power and hit the chutes. And landing... I shuddered. I\u0027m really glad I wouldn\u0027t be at the controls for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, lets do this\u0022 said Caldrin, wiggling the fake keys he had somehow smuggled on the ship and attached next to his yoke. Always the joker. \u0022Engine start,\u0022 he winked at Jesnik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJesnik flipped up the control panel and tapped in the ignition procedure. The engines began to whirr, then roared into life behind us. Five of the lights on the panel in front of us one by one turned yellow, then green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Engines go!\u0022 yelled Jesnik above the shuddering of the cabin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin nodded and pushed his throttles forward. The engine roar became deafening and we were pressed back into our seats as the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E accelerated forward. Within moments the scenery was blurring past us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Abort line\u0022 Jesnik shouted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022She\u0027s good\u0022 Caldrin screamed back as mission control shot past us on the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end of the runway bore down on us and I saw the speed indicator pass liftoff safe. Caldrin eased the yoke back. The nose of the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E lifted and I grimaced as we shot over the edge. Caldrin was right, it wasn\u0027t as bad as my carrier days, but still, it was pretty bad. We were pressed further down into the seats as the vertical speed indicator shot up and the sea dropped beneath us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gah!\u0022 exclaimed Jesnik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, the training never really prepares you for that\u0022 I shouted back. \u0022But don\u0027t worry, that was the worst of it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7BZXVL3l.png\u0022 alt=\u00227BZXVL3l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was right. It was a smooth ascent, except for the engine switchover at 24000 meters which sent unsettling jolts through the ship. But in a few minutes we had reached orbit, and Caldrin throttled back the engines. I felt my inerds lurch as the acceleration stopped and we were suddenly weightless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Bleurgh* I heard to my left as Jesnik leaned over and threw up into a space-sickness bag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hah!\u0022 I said. \u0022One of the less well publicized and less glamorous aspects of life in the kerbalnaut corps. Don\u0027t worry, it happens to most of us on our first flight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar sound errupted to my right as Caldrin leaned over. \u0022And even to some of us veterans\u0022 I was forced to admit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well Jesnik, welcome to orbit.\u0022 For the first time since climbing into the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E early this morning I began to smile.

I quickly slipped back into communal life on the station - the structured shifts, freeze dried food, the tiny movements needed to get around in microgravity. The routine is really comforting, the only thing I don\u0027t like is the constant changing of the sun. Every fifteen minutes Kerbol either rises or sets - flooding the areas with portholes with an excess of light or plunging them back into darkness. The station was operational 24/7 too, meaning artificial light is always on except in the sleeping area. It makes establishing a natural work-rest rhythm difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t change it for the world though. Just looking out through the cupola made all the difficulties worthwhile, ten times over. There\u0027s nothing that can compare to seeing your home planet from space, it\u0027s just as wondrous the 20th time as the first. Kenkin attested to that. Two months ago he surpassed the record for longest consecutive time in orbit, yet Kenkin, with all his experience, still spent much of his downtime in the cupola staring out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fDD0tKh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fDD0tKh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter we\u0027d been reorientated to station life Caldrin found an opportunity to take me aside. On the pretence of running some tests on the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E we managed to find privacy in the cramped cabin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look Milzner, I\u0027m really worried about the restart of the orbiter program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI nodded slowly. \u0022I\u0027m not too keen on it either Cal, but Bob gave me his assurances...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin looked uncomfortable. \u0022I trust Bob, after all he went through and all he did for us,\u0022 Caldrin paused and slowly spun around until he was upside-down from my perspective. \u0022It\u0027s just, they\u0027ve supposedly made the ship better and safer, but I really didn\u0027t feel it during our ascent. What\u0027s different about the ship? What changes have they made? I can\u0027t see any.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tapped the wall with my feet and drifted over to study the fuel control panel. \u0022You didn\u0027t touch the reserve tank during ascent, that\u0027s better than any of the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E flights from Project Ocean. Bob told me that the engines had been overhauled for efficiency.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, they told me that too. But honestly, pilot to pilot? She flew the same. I\u0027ve had more training, more experience with the craft, I\u0027m a better pilot than in the early days of the program. I think I\u0027m the reason for the better flight, I\u0027m not trying to brag, I\u0027m just saying that I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve actually made the changes we\u0027h asked for.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shuddered. This was exactly what happened with Bill...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s more,\u0022 Caldrin continued, \u0022the auto-assist pilot was fighting me the whole way up. I ended up flying her on manual the whole way.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis made me smile at least. \u0022Caldrin, you never trusted any machine to fly better than you. Besides all pilots are trained for flying without the autopilot. Is that really a problem?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No... no, it\u0027s not. But these problems shouldn\u0027t be happening. Not after how Project Ocean finished. Not with the promises we were given.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe floated in silence for a while. The sun set through the cockpit windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I spoke. \u0022Should I call off the mission then? Use the escape capsules to get home like what happened last time? Or we could call up a stack, one\u0027s on standby for a rescue if needed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, I can bring us down safely in the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E, getting home isn\u0027t the issue. We don\u0027t need another embarrassment for the program either. But I wanted to let you know first, this stuff needs to get bought up at mission debrief.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a pause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay. If you\u0027re confident she\u0027s safe, we\u0027ll finish the mission as planned, but I agree, this needs to flagged up with Bob during debrief.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks Milzer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin swung open the hatch and pushed off back into Magellan station. I followed him up and turned off into the exercise room. It was my turn on the bungee treadmill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/azcsg8m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022azcsg8m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning in space is a completely different experience to running on Kerbin. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no gravity, so you have to be strapped to treadmill with bungee cords. It makes running tricky, because the harder you push off, the harder you get pulled back down. And microgravity makes it feel like you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re falling the whole time, which makes balancing tricky. But it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a good feeling as a change from weightlessness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also important to keep in good health. Without regular strain, muscles and bone begin to degrade. Kerbonauts always take a few weeks to recover after a long flight. Part of Kenkin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s long mission was to see how an extra long flight would affect his recovery time. It would be important for our plans to go to Duna to know how we would be able to cope landing on another planet---returning to gravity with no KSC doctors to support our recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end, the engineers had launched a new piece of technology to test out on Magellan Station ahead of the long voyage. A centrifuge, a spinning donut, to give an area of the ship to exercise and rest in. This would help slow skeletal and muscular decay. The centrifuge, too big for an orbiter was stack launched shortly after we arrived, and automatically docked to Magellan station on the spare docking port by the escape pods. After connecting it to the station\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s power system, all the Magellan crew waited with interest for it to inflate fully and slowly spin up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a pretty weird experience, all of us crammed into the corridor, one by one entering down into the centrifuge. The rotating centrifuge entryway had handles all the way down, but the forces pushed us back and down, a bit like a slide. Walking the curved surface was tricky too, we were being pulled down towards the floor, but the floor was constantly turning. It was disorientating and took some getting used to. But all of us appreciated the change from weightlessness. Plus, it gave me a distraction from thinking about the impending return flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TnrU526.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TnrU526.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TFGJUL5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TFGJUL5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dodrian","CreatedById":12564,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T16:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChapter 4: Re-entry\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WhN4Xb5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WhN4Xb5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nVuPhJC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nVuPhJC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moment I had been dreading had arrived. Jesnik, Caldrin and I were strapped back in the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E going through re-entry preparations. I had been all-right going through preparations back at Magellan Station, but since we had closed the hatch and were now over half a km and drifting further away my nerves were beginning to show.

Turning to Caldrin I added \u0022What do you think?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin rubbed his chin. \u0022After what we discussed of the ascent, I\u0027m not sure I agree with KSC. I\u0027ll bring her down safe of course, but I think we should stick to the old procedure.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI nodded. \u0022Jesnik, pump the reserve fuel to the forward tanks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s wrong?\u0022 She asked, obviously nervous as she began the fuel routing procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sighed. \u0022The old \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E was aerodynamically unstable when she was empty and travelling at high speeds. Putting as much weight forward helped stop it from fish tailing. Supposedly the aerodynamic problems were fixed with the revisions made before our flight, but Caldrin... Caldrin and I aren\u0027t convinced.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy voice had begun to wavier. Could I still call off the landing? We probably had enough manoeuvring fuel to return to Magellan Station, or we could wait in the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E for a rescue capsule. I glanced at the oxygen levels. No, I was being irrational. The \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E had always made it safely, even with the aerodynamic problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E~:Burn window is open Aegean, you are go for reentry.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I could change my mind I nodded at Caldrin. He tightened his grip on the controls and I heard the rumble of the engines coming to life. A seven second slow burn. I closed my eyes and counted it off. Three... two... one... silence again. Well that was it. No turning back now. Having no more decisions for the flight should have made me calmer, but instead my stomach was tying itself in knots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Reentry profile looks good\u0022 piped up Jesnik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldrin nodded and slowly brought the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E facing forward.

We\u0027d have too much speed coming down to the runway, just like Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ll spiral over the grasslands and bleed off speed\u0022 said Caldrin, gently tilting the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E over. We were pushed down into our seats as the craft swung round. I felt her begin to fishtail, but Caldrin fought hard and kept her under control. My heart was pounding and felt as if it would jump out of my flight suit. First an airbrake failure, then this manoeuvre. It would be safe enough if the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E had the changes the pilots had always asked for, but... for more than once I was glad Caldrin was our pilot this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yi0HCXE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Yi0HCXE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mlb4x3z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mlb4x3z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe slowly swung around and lined up with the runway. My breathing was rapid and shallow. 1000 meters. I felt the rumbling of the undercarriage coming down, though I hadn\u0027t heard Caldrin give the order. 500 meters. I had a vision of Bill\u0027s plane, a fireball on the runway. My arms were shaking, unable even to grip the rest of my chair. The ship flared gently as it shot over the end of the runway. Still too fast, but not enough momentum to come round, or enough time to restart an engine. This was it! We wavered above the centerline, drop, flare, drop. Past mission control, time running out, but then a thud and rumble as the gear touched down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B2SpX5F.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B2SpX5F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Bm4vvO.png\u0022 alt=\u00220Bm4vvO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe were thrown forward in our seats as the craft slowed down. Safe! We had landed. My head was spinning. The end of the runway was coming up, but we stopped just short. It was over, but I felt trapped in my seat, the cabin walls closing in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pop the hatch!\u0022 I yelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But the post flight checks?\u0022 Jesnik asked?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022EMERGENCY EVACUATION!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hatch blew and Jesnik fumbled with her harness before slipping out. I was already out of my seat scrambling to the hatch. I gasped for air, tumbling onto the runway. Ground! Safety! I lay down on the tarmac. In the distance I saw the rescue vehicles scrambling, obviously alerted by the hatch blowing to the emergency I\u0027d falsely called for.

Instead Caldrin and I shared what had happened with the other astronauts, rounded up as many as we could and descended on Bob\u0027s office to demand change and safety assurances. It was reminiscent of how Bob had ousted Gene a few years back. A few engineers joined us, but otherwise we kept it as private as we could. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was shaking the entire meeting. I hoped it came across as anger, that\u0027s probably what Jesnik and some of the younger Kerbonauts thought. Caldrin certainly knew better, having been with me most of the time on Magellan Station and seen me aboard the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E. Truthfully I wasn\u0027t entirely sure what I was feeling. Fear? Certainly. Anxiety over the future of the program and my career? Definitely. Shame for betraying Bob, my friend? Maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob just sat there during most of the confrontation, not saying anything. Alone, eyes cast towards the desk which partitioned him from the astronaut corps all crowded into his office. What was he feeling? Uneasy, I hoped. I hoped he was realizing he had gone against his kerbonaut past to follow his predecessors in appeasing the political puppetmasters of the agency. Maybe I was being unfair to him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally after we had finished he spoke. He agreed to delay the Dunan program if necesary. Three months for the refit and testing of the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E. Three months without a cargo-capable orbiter. Still, the constellation of high resolution mapping satellites to pinpoint the landing site were already planned to be stack-launched next month. Magellan crew operations were slated to be handed over to the newly built \u003Cem\u003EMinnow\u003C/em\u003E. Most agency activities weren\u0027t affected, It was only the orbital assembly of our Dunan ship which needed the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E. All and all though, if we worked hard and there were no problem launches after the refit we could still make the planned departure window just under a year from now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we slowly filed out off the room Bob caught my eye, just for a moment. The look on his face... betrayal? Had he been the one pushing behind the scenes to get me back into the program? Or had he realized how terrified I had been in the \u003Cem\u003EAegean\u003C/em\u003E. There\u0027s no place in the corps for an Kerbonaut scared of flying. Still, he couldn\u0027t call me out now, not without it seeming like he was trying to discredit his main detractor. But one thing I could tell, our friendship was over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the weeks after our meeting I busied myself in program life. I toured the \u003Cem\u003EMinnow\u003C/em\u003E, six-Kerbal and small payload orbital transport. I was apprehensive, it had the same mission brief as the \u003Cem\u003EWahoo\u003C/em\u003E which killed Bill, but immediately it was clear that it was a completely different design. Stubby Wings attached to a more pronounced lifting body. Smaller, more efficient mixed mode engines. A turbojet for extra power and greater efficiency in the lower atmosphere, not to mention more controlled landings. All the astronauts involved in testing had been thrilled by its performance, none, not even those who had known Bill well felt at all concerned of its safety. I felt a twang of guilt looking at it, Bob had certainly lived up to his reform promises with this craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a lot of time running in the training center. Passed a few shifts as CAPCOM. Caldrin, Jesnik and I began our long term ground-based training for the Duna mission, as well as overseeing some of the candidate selection for the three remaining crew slots. Sidberry was one of the finalists, I hoped it wouldn\u0027t be him chosen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FQgKqIo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FQgKqIo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched the first launch of the \u003Cem\u003EMinnow\u003C/em\u003E from atop the Vehicle Assembly building. She lifted easily off the runway, tearing a hole straight through the stratosphere and into orbit. The windless weather from the summer heatwave meant the contrails she left behind stayed above KSC for hours, like an arrow pointing to heaven. Jesnik was aboard, co-pilot, racking up as many hours in space as she could, training before our scheduled departure window. Not to mention lab time aboard the Magellan, a zero-g lab almost identical to the one we were taking to Duna. After a week Jesnik and the \u003Cem\u003EMinnow\u003C/em\u003E returned with the relieved crew of Magellan Station. Kenkin was among them, and took a while regaining his land legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ML4UVvU.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ML4UVvU.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on the ground we spent some time critiquing the design of our Dunan ship, but in the end all agreed it was a solid designed. Caldrin proposed she be named the \u003Cem\u003ECoral\u003C/em\u003E. Bob and I stifled a laugh, a moment of amiability after weeks of coldness and avoiding each other. Most of the younger engineers went along with it, not knowing Caldrin\u0027s wife, a similarly jocular kerbal named Carol. It was a good name though, and was voted in unanimously, Bob and I grinning at each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite that shared joke, we continued sticking apart. We were polite enough with each other at meetings and in Mission Control, but made as many excuses as possible to keep separate. More than once I found myself going through the side entrance of the Astronaut training center to avoid passing the Director\u0027s office when I knew he\u0027d be in. We sat at opposite sides of the stands for the night-time launch of the Dunan satellites, Trudy with me, but his wife notably absent. Rumor had it that they were separated, I wished I could say something to help him, or a word of consolation, but things were too cold between us. Sometimes it takes more courage to end a fight than it does to start one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qPjxnOQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qPjxnOQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E223 days to departure window.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T21:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally nice work!
