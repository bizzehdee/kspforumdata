There are many times, waiting for transfer windows for example,\u00A0when you \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to time warp. If rewards decay linearly players\u00A0pay for every moment of that. It \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E still a penalty, and its one the player has no ability to avoid. If instead you use deadlines the player has a broad grace period in which to operate before bad things happen. It may not appear so, but this is actually a softer consequence, and one thats much easier for players to predict and negotiate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have and its true windows in general open up all the time, but\u00A0ideal windows for specific planets\u00A0can take quite a while. Like say a player has just started doing interplanetary missions. They may have the tech development for probes but can\u0027t really afford to mount a full manned Eve or Laythe mission. So they send 3 probes to Moho, three probes to Eve, Jool, etc, do an asteroid mission, but that stupid Duna window, the one they really want to do, is still more than a year away. I still feel like maybe the most important thing in all this is to give payers choice over where to go and how to go there, and if a player just wants to do a damned Duna mission but instead is being required by the penalties and incentives of the game to do lots and lots of other things while they wait we might end up back where we started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Okay, a grace-period. How about this: tickdown starts at basic intervall (1 day for Kerbin-program, 1 month for Jool-program, f.e.) times tier of mission. As in: Tier 5 kerbin missions only have their rewards start to decay 5 days after you have initiated the program (numbers, of course, as always, subject to balancing). The point of the tickdown is to have time matter in a granular fashion. That time-warp costs something, is exactly the point. But if it\u00B4s spelled out the right way, this doesnt have to come off as a penalty, but as a bonus, for quick completion - it\u00B4s a matter of phrasing it, to a high degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard limits\u00B4 consequences are not softer - they are all or nothing. They are either completely inconsequential (if you succeed) or punishing (if you dont).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayers would, btw, also pay for the duration of the transfer. There are various instances where the player is paying for time elapsing. This is, again, exactly the point and facilitates time being meaningfull \u003Cem\u003Eall the time\u003C/em\u003E. The player should always have a reason to advance the game as quickly (in gametime) and efficient as possible, the moreso, the higher the difficulty, while at the same time being forced to utilize time and make it elapse (hence R\u0026amp;D-times).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor completion of a mission you\u00B4d get:\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 x \u002B x\u00A0 * (tickdown-modifier ; between 0 and 1)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a hard cap you\u00B4d get:\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 y,\u00A0 or nothing at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd no matter where you set this timelimit for getting y, it\u00B4s either too forgiving (like now), or restricting (\u0022slingshot-problem\u0022, expecting the player to solve the problem in one particular way), or even outright frustrating (if you experience a minor f-up during a mission with a very tight limit, causing you to not make the limit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) You simply do not initiate the Duna-Program before the window comes up, silly. ;P Or maybe, you dont even want to wait for that window, cause, yeah, it\u00B4s the most energy-effecient, but it\u00B4s not the fastest. Use your advanced engeeniering skills as a player to get some extra cash, cause you are capable of building a Duna-vessel, that does not rely on a Hohmann-transfer to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T14:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T14:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that I think a total overhaul is not going to happen, I\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E to agree\u00A0with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/38540-mr-scruffy/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002238540\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/38540-mr-scruffy/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Mr. Scruffy\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0above regarding soft time limits...\u00A0I do agree with the bulk of the rest of the posts, however. I wonder if the game could have a more intelligent way to set time horizons. As has been said before, attaching them to transfer windows is an option if the players are actually given that information. My concern is that such time limits just might not work as planned given that KSP doesn\u0027t have the real reason a \u0022time limit\u0022 mattered in RL---we have no explicit space race (only the implicit one due to rescue contracts and milestones).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would probably go with making time meaningful via R\u0026amp;D taking time, and time-release \u0022budgets\u0022 instead of 25% before, and 75% upon completion for missions (or whatever it is).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your Duna program, instead of a hard 10 year limit doses out the budget (the total reward) over some other time period, say 3 years given Duna mission timelines. You\u0027d intentionally warp at times to pile up some budget (which might include points to spend on R\u0026amp;D). You apply the soft-limit idea such that after a certain point the reward (rep?) declines over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would require adding a new thing to the game, but what if in addition to assigning a craft a type (probe, capsule, station, etc), you could assign a craft to a \u0022contract/mission?\u0022 Then the game could use that hook to mark progress after a fashion. Once assigned to a mission, the craft doesn\u0027t earn points for other missions. So you can launch a test of your Duna craft so that the soft limit sees progress, but when you send it to the Mun on a test, the science/whatever it does doesn\u0027t apply to your Munar program that is also live, because it\u0027s a Duna test mission.

As a new player, you\u00B4d probably want to initiate one of the two and get at it seperately from the other. As a more experienced player, you might see the benefits of (and have the confidence to) initiating both at once and have launches that first complete one or more minmus mission, first, and then head off to the mun to do some stuff there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: OR you might, as an experienced player, use the mun for slingshoting to minmus, only do a the fly-by for mun, but get to minmus a day or two faster, getting some additional rewards for that.

It doesn\u0027t much matter if you miss a single deadline or the reward dwindled away to zero because you did a gravity assist. The penalty is either relevant to a direct mission and precludes a longer one or\u00A0allows for a longer mission and doesn\u0027t put pressure on a shorter one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T17:45:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T17:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222607955\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138448\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464616530\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002238540\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Mr. Scruffy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) You simply do not initiate the Duna-Program before the window comes up, silly. ;P Or maybe, you dont even want to wait for that window, cause, yeah, it\u00B4s the most energy-effecient, but it\u00B4s not the fastest.

You need time to research new equipment and need to run mission to get the data in order to do so, all the while, if you want to progress in the game, you want to do it with the least time possible, as you can not infinitely suspend and re-activate programs. My guess is, in practice, you\u00B4d break up the programs, according to your skill, going for streaks between activation and suspension. Like try to hit tier x within the first launch-window, possibly suspend after that and reactivate to hit tier x\u002By within the next one, or just suspend and take a break from one program, because you want to focus on another for now and dont really feel like building a big LKO base, say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u00B4penalties\u00B4 involved in any of this needn\u00B4t be big. They should be just enough to matter (on default difficulty). The Kerbin program could get away with just one measily point of REP-cost for suspension (so as to allow suspension and focusing on mun and/or minmus, in the example i gave, yesterday, i believe?). Duna and Eve become avaiable at, say, 50 REP (if each of the 3 programs avaiable before would just have one branch each - which they should not - they would yield a combined 165 REP when completed - [10\u002B9\u002B8\u002B7\u002B6\u002B5\u002B.... ]*3). So i\u00B4d say suspending mun or minmus costs 10 REP - as would a dead kerbal, say. One branch from t1 to t10 is 55 REP. Since each program would branch out to various branches, Duna and Eve would open up way before you get to complete mun and minmus, as long as you dont screw up royally. In fact, you could skip mun and minmus entirely if you are not losing any kerbals on kerbin and advance far enough on that progam\u00B4s tree. But of course, this is all subject to balancing. Yet, i\u00B4d like a lax regime on this, on default difficulty - the objective is just that you do not suspend and reactivate willy-nilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you have all the programs completed - which would be sort of epic in and of itself - you can choose to end the game officially, and get scored along the lines of: REP \u002B cash / 100,000 (maybe with a modifier from date).\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Other thresholds maybe: Dres - 100, Moho 150, Jool 200, Eeloo 250, Laythe (extra-tree with extra challanges for this special moon) 300.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T22:38:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T22:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222608345\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138448\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464632787\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) What would discourage players from just time-warping through research upgrades?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want them to time warp through research upgrades.

This statement is not meant to \u00B4dizz\u00B4 anything that Felipe has done - i\u00B4d still be more at awe getting to meet him, than i would be meeting the pope or some Hollywood-celeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB) They are not going to announce for patch 1.2 \u00B4implement the ideas from this one thread in the suggestions-sub-forum\u00B4, nor can they be expected to actually do so, 1:1*. But it means, that the probability of this thread being relevant for 1.2 to \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Eextent is \u0026gt;0. We, who are just typing out of our a****, pretty much, instead of coding or even modding, can not really hope for more. And we should be aware, that hoping is all we can, ligitely, in the first place - let\u00B4s not be dismissive or feel entitled. I certainly got my 17(?) bucks worth many times over, already.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*This may sound like braging, and maybe it\u00B4s not even true, but i\u00B4d like to believe, for those who know these games (both paradox interactive), that devs took my suggestions on (at least) two occasions so far: The newspapers in Victoria II and the little colored triangles on the counters in Hearts of Iron III. The former was just a waste of dev-time, at least to me, as i realized, later - i ended up always ignoring them after playing the game the 2nd time, once they were actually implemented. The later \u003Cem\u003Ewas \u003C/em\u003Ea good idea. I *think*, Tater,\u00A0 you are a compulsive suggestion-forumite, too, arent you (unless someone else used that name on that subsim-forum)? And look at what they ended up doing to the SH franchise! Bah! We were on the same page back then, also. ;P\u00A0 Anyways, point of all this ramble is: We are not the devs, we dont get to decide, we can only ask kindly, hope and stay in good faith, that what we suggest gets considered and actually ends up being good, in practice if does get implemented. We cant gurantee that, i cant at least, all of what i said here may turn out rubbish if it does get implemented - i dont have to take the risk for it, though. Despite walls of text and hours spent on them, my -our- commitment is minimal, just one increment above 0 - and so are the chances of what we ask for getting done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, now back OT, please. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: That\u00B4s how it\u00B4s phrased in the devnote: \u0022[...]planetary weighting of contracts, an overhaul of the exploration contracts [...]\u0022. From my experience, devs saying that they see the merit of your ideas, doesnt get much better than this. As said: No dev would say \u00B4implentation of programs as suggested in this thread [link]\u00B4 - even just to use the term \u00B4program\u00B4 in this brief, naturally vague, first dev-note for 1.2 would be confusing. This is pretty much bullseye, in my interpretaion, as far as programs are concerned. Now, R\u0026amp;D-times and wages...? Well, baby-steps... one thing at a time... (they dont seem to go for a cross-program launch on this one ;P )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: Cause when you look at it closely: We have pretty much worked out in this thread, that \u00B4planetary weighting of contracts\u00B4 seems to be the pre-requisite for the implementation of mechanics that make time relevant. They are tackling the problem from the right direction, laying a foundation for making relevant time vaiable - or so one may hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-31T22:43:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2016 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T22:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I\u0027m that tater. I also was a campaign modder, and worked with lurker on RSRDC (and Real Fleet Boat, and a small contribution to TMO) as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSH4 had decent bones, but the campaign game (career, here) was abysmal. So I fixed\u00A0it up to the limits of what was possible. I had a pseudo-realistic campaign (rough numbers of the rough types of ships in the right sorts of places, without scripting the RL movement of every IJN ship and convoy). Lurker and I worked together on making zig-zagging work as well, and I modded a large number of small warships to get the proper balance of escorts. Lurker took the \u0022real\u0022 route, and used the Tabular Records of Movement for the IJN (and a convoy doc we found) and made every real group of ships leave the right port at the right time. Both systems work, but in the fantasy world where the player is the skipper, I liked the replay value of it being random, vs knowing that on a certain date the Tokyo Express will be barreling down the Slot. That\u0027s a gameplay choice, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
