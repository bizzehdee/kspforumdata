I can sometimes resolve it if I make sure the fuel pulls from the lowest part of the rocket first by manually transfering fuel between the three tanks that make up the first stage, but I don\u0027t really want to do that.

All I\u0027ve been doing with the CSM so far is with the parts that I have available which means I built it myself.

The Atlas-Agena setup will fly (just) but the Atlas-Centaur doesn\u0027t have enough TWR at sea level to get off the ground with a 1t payload. So FASA has the ability to recreate the Centaur upper stage but there isn\u0027t a rocket (other then Saturn which was never actually used with the Centaur) that it can be used with. Supposedly, IRL, the LV-3A and LV-3C both used the same sustainer engine (LR-105-5) and basically the same boosters (LR-89-5, though the 3C really had about 8% more thrust and 3% better ISP), but the current engines just don\u0027t have the thrust. Considering the real LR-89 engine (between it\u0027s two thrust chambers) produced nearly four times as much thrust as the LR-105, I have to guess the issue main I\u0027m having is with the Atlas Booster Engine which (between it\u0027s two \u0022thrust chambers\u0022) only produces the same thrust as the sustainer. But I don\u0027t think simply uprating the boosters is the answer. More likely, the sustainer needs to be reduced as well. I know FASA isn\u0027t trying for 100% realism, which is fine by me. I\u0027d just like to be able to fly the Atlas-Centaur and the current engines just don\u0027t seem to be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWolf83","CreatedById":141199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, guys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m a recent purchaser of KSP and have been playing for a about 2 months I think and have just come across this MOD and am having issues with getting the pre-assembled ships to load with it saying along the lines of \u0022this contains locked items\u0022 or something like that.

I\u0027m not sure how much fuel they used for Centaur but I\u0027m guessing it was a bit less than what it was for Agena since for Centaur the second stage was what got them the rest of the way into orbit instead of relying on the main Atlas engines for the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhedd","CreatedById":112088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the information about the landing gear. Glad it\u0027s an easily fixable problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we\u0027re discussing realism and FASA rocket launches, I thought I\u0027d share my experiences with launching the Apollo-loaded Saturn V in the new KSP aerodynamic model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the Saturn V, and spent a lot of time in 0.25 getting it to fly a realistic flight profile, so I was anxious to see how it flew after 1.0. As a quick test, I loaded up the SV from the FASA sandbox game and gave it a whirl. Using my old MechJeb flight profile, it would always tumble and die at around 13km (about the time the air got thin and the pressure got high). I assumed this was because of pushing against max Q, so I set up the engines to do what they do in real life, and had the center F-1 shut down at about 12km. This fixed the problem perfectly and it went into orbit every time. The only problem was that a launch TWR of 2 is way higher than reality, so my next step was to reduce that and see what happened...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a dirty job, I reduced thrust on the S1 engines until the launch TWR was about 1.2 (the real Apollo 11 SV was about 1.18). I didn\u0027t adjust the fuel amounts or anything, so as I said, this was a very dirty job just to see how the aerodynamics worked. The result was that soon after clearing the tower, the rocket would lean in some random direction (usually North or SW, for some reason) and fail. I tried over and over again with different MechJeb settings, but the lean happened too soon in the flight and could never really be compensated for. Finally, frustrated, I started taking the ship apart. That\u0027s when I noticed that the SV in the FASA sandbox save has tons of added vernier thrusters and struts to compensate for problems in flight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I built a new one, 100% clean. Just the parts you\u0027d expect to be on the actual vehicle. No extra struts, no extra RCS, nothing but a pure SV with Apollo payload. It flew perfectly from then on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is the MJ setup I used, which will probably be surprising to folks that think you should head straight up through the atmosphere before turning, but it\u0027s quite realistic: Gravity turn start @ 0.2km, turn end at 69km, shape 75%. Limit AoA to 5deg (still experimenting with that), corrective steering off. Have the center S1 engine shut off at 12km, and the center S2 shut off at 40km (still experimenting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing those settings a clean Apollo SV will make it into a 200km orbit with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext comes trying to get it into orbit without having to shut off engines and coast at any point, and without having fuel still left in the S2. I think this is a MechJeb problem, though. It likes to outrun the Apoapsis and then have to coast to catch up before circularizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps anyone having problems launching a moon mission!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
