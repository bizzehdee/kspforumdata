This is quite annoying for me that KSP does this. I\u0027d much rather it be based just on the name in the cfg. Also, the part titles are not final. I may find some more descriptive names or go the Structural Part route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to using the same method as before (for the structural parts) and the one you suggest; however, both completely disable the Infernal Robotics functionality. The part rotates, but both the fixed and moveable mesh move, rather than just the moveable one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E . \u0022Mesh\u0022 is the only method that I found to work for these, meaning I\u0027ll probably end up making separate textures for each part.
