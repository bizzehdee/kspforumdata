Then you should be able to save it as a subassembly."},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T04:46:31Z","Content":"No free attachment points is a problem.

I\u0027ve had a lot going on. Yes you can! just do as I explained and then put a radial attachement point on both your craft and your drone. Make sure to map a shortcut to it too!"}]}
