The editor tool is useful for rotating stack mounted things or making things the perfect angle since it\u0027s capable of fine-tuning. The rotator keys are better for if you need a specific angle, say 90 degrees or 45 degrees, and for quick editing they are faster if you\u0027re already used to them. Also if you\u0027re making long wings or other structures that need multiple parts at the same angle, your editor tool rotations will be a bit off. Of course, this is with angle snap off since it glitches a lot with snap on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using the translation tool a lot now for times I\u0027ve had to offset something without needing to use cubic struts.
