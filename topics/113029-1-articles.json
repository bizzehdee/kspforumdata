(why kinda says something bad about the underlying implementation, ie they are separately coded and not inherited from a common class)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, a confirmation about maneuver node deletion would be a nice touch.\n\nThat could also get annoying though. I\u0027d rather have an edit-undo type functionality that could restore the last deleted node if I wanted, rather than being asked each time if I\u0027m sure I want to delete it. I often just create a quick very rough node to get a general idea of a heading and then delete it right away and I also delete nodes during burns (so I can switch to seeing the live closest-sep-markers, rather than the node projected ones) and having an \u0022are you sure\u0022 dialog whenever I delete one would annoy me.\n\nIn addition to what OP wants I\u0027d also like keyboard control of nodes. When a node is open for editing the WASD (or IJKL) keys should map to normal/anti-normal, radial/anti-radial and shift/ctrl to pro/retro and caps should toggle a fine adjustment mode from the keyboard input. I know, you can use the mousewheel to make fine adjustments on node controls, but that is still pretty fiddly."}]}
