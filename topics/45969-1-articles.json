Now, I am a big fan of the B\u0026amp;W games, as horrible at them as I am, but I am not a fan of the hype that hits me as being quite dishonest at times. I might take a look at the game once it\u0027s a full release, and I am perfectly willing to judge the game on it\u0027s merits and disregard the man behind it, but I find myself incapable of trusting anything said about what the game will be, any promised features that it doesn\u0027t already have and so on. The worst part is, I don\u0027t think Peter is a dishonest person, I think he has a lot of incredible ideas and a massive amount of passion for making games, and he gets ahead of himself and promises the light of the sun when all he can deliver is a full moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it truly turns out to be a B\u0026amp;W 3 in spirit, I will certainly be interested down the line.
