You could rig something with two control surfaces that point inward and block the thrust of the engine and have the thrust go back and around the engine. (Would likely require flap/spoiler settings)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust already imparts forces on objects. Think \u0022Mass Relay\u0022. All that (according to logic without looking at thrust coding) would need to be done is to recalculate the direction of thrust, and how it affects an object, instead of having no thrust if the vector is occluded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder this system, if you had a jet engine (or a rocket, but it would probably break the part) and a structural plate mounted at a 45 degree angle to the engine, both attached to the same craft, thrust would be deflected downward (90 degrees to the engine) and you would be pushed upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T18:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would this accomplish?
