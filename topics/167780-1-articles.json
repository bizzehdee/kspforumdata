A beep began to sound as the light flickering became more intense. The little sensor\u00A0was calling for someone, beckoning for someone -- anyone -- to acknowledge its existence and the danger it posed -- not the danger of the light, but the danger that the light signaled. However, the halls of the laboratory were utterly deserted, not a soul in sight, the entire facility devoid of any signs of life, each and every single door under lock and key. The red light now became constant, not just a flicker, and the beeping was now a constant, ear-piercing drone. Other lights on the console -- green, yellow, and orange -- began to flash, more alarms joining in with the screech that the red light was now constantly emitting -- beeps, whines, clangs, and whirs. A loud and deafening klaxon began to blare over the PA system, alerting everyone to prepare for something -- something big.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(...as the two bubbles touched for the first time -- boom.)\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe klaxon and other alarms now merged into one long, continuous, high-pitched blare, as a huge boom shook the building, dust and plaster falling from the ceiling, the walls shaking violently, the entire facility subject to what felt like an earthquake. And a crack began to run down the side of the wall of the control room. It was a tiny crack, no bigger than one foot long, but it had the potential to have devastating effects. A blinding red light emanated from the crack, and a thick, viscous, green goo began to ooze from it, plastering the walls surrounding it. Tiny plant tendrils -- vines -- began to reach out from the crack, rooting themselves in the wall. A tear in space-time that led to\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe Upside Down\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehad been opened once again. The constant blaring of the alarms stopped -- the sheer noise had overloaded the PA system -- but the lights still flashed, lighting up and flickering like a Christmas tree with bad wiring. And there was not a soul in sight to notice the potentially fatal and deadly event which was now occurring at the Hawkins National Laboratory.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTC0BRjH_kb4Uf5U7LQyLhsNK_1JGeVZ1GwEvdST8y0_6FyX9K06TKB52GDC6baEvCYE8EphOynF5-y/pub\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERead the Prologue\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR8KS_jAUNdfqkBQu9BneOIEw-l-hZhRRltJA2ze9eXTge-5ScHC1HBtulLZ4WasKKrEmtsf4Waxinq/pub\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERead Chapter 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENote:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe full story was removed from the forums due to the references to blood and violence it contained.

I was planning to stick to a weekly upload schedule, but Real Life gets top priority. And I recently started development on a substantial new mod in my suite, so I have to also slice up my time for that. I haven\u0027t found time to finish Chapter 2 yet, as my time is too caught up with RL and modding.
