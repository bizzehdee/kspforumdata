The basic idea would be to modulate the core/bypass areas in order to simulate bypass doors opening and closing, which is simple enough. The trouble is how to control it. You might want to close bypass doors in order to create more thrust for takeoff or at high altitudes to allow supercruise. On the other hand, you might want more bypass at very high speeds in order to create a turboramjet effect (since this is basically how the J58 operates). The only way I can think of to give the right amount of control is via action groups, but it might still be difficult to operate in practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T04:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenius Evil, those are so pretty you\u0027re tempting me to redo all my planes!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T10:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies, they were very helpful! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why I am curious about buffing them, their initial TWR in air breathing mode is around 4 per engine with a thrust of ~425kN and an Isp of 4000s, coming down from 20000 at engine start (the engine\u002Bprecooler\u002Bintake assembly weighs about 10 tons without any propellant).
