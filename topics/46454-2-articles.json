That is based on a project of mine (which was based a project of his), so I should know how to implement a UI using that system, but the whole point of it was to let mod writers get on with writing the mod itself, and not working out how to hook into KSPs UI and settings and such, so you should be able to work it out...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T18:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kitoban\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kitoban\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThink I follow what you are asking here, but would it not be simpler to mount a probe body orientated in the direction you want to see on the navball and use \u0022control from here\u0022?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesn\u0027t work if you fly from the cockpit.
