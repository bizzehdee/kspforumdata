Is there a particular reason the turbojets are restricted to 50% thrust? [edit]Turns out a singular TurboJet has 130 kN of thrust, and the singular F-16 engine has 131.2 kN of thrust. Forcing half throttle here is hardly a good way to display a 5th Gen fighter when its engines can\u0027t compete with a 4th Gen. Thoughts? [/edit]\u003Cp\u003EEdit: More questions. Edit: More data to back up the questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a particular reason droptanks are requested for bonus points? Is it simply because it\u0027s easier to dump fuel for a fight that way? My current plane iteration has an internal capacity of 1610 (8050kg) units of fuel on board, but it\u0027s unreasonable to load it with more than 630 (3150kg) for \u0022local\u0022 work. [edit] In contrast, an F16 carries 2685kg of fuel internally. [/edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a reason you ask for an operational time versus an operational range?

I noticed that if I tried to have the AI take off, it would scrape your engines off. I fixed this by altering the AI\u0027s take-off speed from 70 to 120, which allows it to barely get by without scraping those things off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to dogfight it with my plane, but I\u0027ve been having issues with the AI kind of mucking around and not firing missiles, or just being a very bad shot with the vulcans. I was impressed, however, when I shot the left engine off one of the two hornets I pitted against, and it continued to perform admirably, all things considered. I\u0027m looking forward to testing your updated version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I get what you\u0027re saying about the way engines perform. They\u0027re incredibly undervalued at low speeds, and cascade to ridiculous power at high speeds. They\u0027re also incredibly inefficient...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, since you commented that you\u0027re going by FAR standards on the estimated flight time, you may wish to amend the OP to reflect such. Even if the FAR readout comments I have 4\u002B hours of flight time, I rarely get more than 20 or 30 actual minutes, which makes me wonder if it\u0027s calculating on Kerbin time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am somewhat curious, though... You want a supercruise with fully-loaded drop tanks; however, that fuel is going to be used getting to supercruise altitude and speed. As an alternative to the exclusive drop-tank bonus fuel rule, might I suggest an alternative option of excess fuel over a set amount, or even a maximum lift mass beyond its dry weight? \u003Csub\u003EAn F-16, for example, has a dry weight of 9.207t, and a maximum lift of 21.772t.\u003C/sub\u003E I mean, if I wanted to really exploit the drop-tank rule, I would have almost 0 fuel in the main craft, and just load up on drop-tanks. That would net me a bonus 1000L\u002B of fuel in drop tank score...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I may rework my the Adder a bit to allow for used mods to help conform to what most of you are using (basically getting rid of KAX on the craft, because I only use it for the landing gear), and also exploit Tweakscale a little more to fit more fuel in those drop tanks by shrinking down fuel fuselages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T02:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes the hornet\u0027s engines are truly redundant as on the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWere you facing off against the old version? my advice is that speeds should be kept up so give the AI a 270m/s maximum speed for low altitude (up to 5000m) and crank it up to 320m/s for high altitude dogfighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will break itself if you allow the AI to operate it in high dynamic pressure modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_______________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have no way of doing much in terms of changing the endurance rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the drop tanks being partially empty by the time you reach altitude is ok, the primary reason for the test is to determine how tolerant the aircraft is of having that extra skin friction and wave drag associated with the drop tanks.
