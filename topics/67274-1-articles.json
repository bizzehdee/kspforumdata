I didn\u0027t really want to go back to Jool right now. Using the same launcher as my Jool mission, using NovaPunch boosters, I decided to go to Gilly. My ship had a Yawmaster and a mk1 capsule both containing 1 kerbal each, It was pretty smooth until my SRBs died. When I decoupled them and went onto my liquid boosters, there was an explosion. I noticed nothing gone so I continued using my liquid boosters. When I got into space, I noticed that my rocket was painfully unstable and hard to control. This made the maneuvers a lot harder and less perfect. It\u0027s a wonder how I even got an encounter with Gilly with such an unstable rocket. In fact, I didn\u0027t get a quick encounter with Gilly. Once I got into Eve\u0027s SOI, I was messing around with maneuvers, which was hard considering my orbit was practically 90\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E of Gilly\u0027s orbit. Because of that, I got into a stable orbit first than continued messing with maneuvers until I finally found one. I didn\u0027t get it right away though. In fact, I only got myself close to an encounter. I waited until I got closer to Gilly, then I set up another node to have an encounter. It was a really close call, but I managed to get an encounter despite my wobbly, spinny rocket. I established an \u0022orbit\u0022, which ended up being a crash onto Gilly. It was time to land. I got rid of my orbital velocity and tried landing. My rocket was unusually more wobbly than it was before. In fact, I almost came down head first. I would have if I didn\u0027t notice that I was on 4x physics warp. I was still obnoxiously wobbly, but a lot less bad for landing. As I was landing, I accidentally overdid the soft landing and went up a bit. It was a rough landing, and I was at a weird angle. The low gravity kept me from tipping over. I quicksaved and did science, crew reports, EVA reports, Surface samples, and realized that 1/4 of all my science equipment that I brought didn\u0027t even work here. Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to return, so I transmitted my data. While doing so, my ship fell over, and it practically flew into orbit as solar panels smashed and the ship bounced up. I had to reload my quicksave and I redid all my science experiments, as well as stabilized my ship to prevent falling again. Even though I never had a chance to get back and get 100% science, I got a good 300 science to unlock another node of the tech tree with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELEAVING GILLY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a feeling that I would not have enough fuel to get back. Because of this, I equipped a Docking Port Jr on the capsule instead of parachute. With this, I will be able to send another ship down to dock on this one. The ship will pull the craft into orbit, and I will be able to send an evacuation ship to pick up the crew and take them home. But... this will be for another mission... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe End:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
