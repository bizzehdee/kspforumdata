This does two things. It allows a KSP install to run multiple different tech trees, selected when the new Squad is created. To do this, it specifies the link between a Part and a Tech Tree node in the TechTree.cfg rather than in the Part.cfg.\n\nAnd you can still run a game with the Stock Tech Tree.\n\nThe release thread is here [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125338-1-0-3-YongeTech-Tech-Trees-Plugin-%28v1-2-1%29?highlight=Yongetech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125338-1-0-3-YongeTech-Tech-Trees-Plugin-%28v1-2-1%29?highlight=Yongetech)\n\nWhile there is a demo tech tree, just having one is a bit pointless, and a day or two ago I started looking at things to see if a YT version was possible. That needed a bit of work to actually get a list of what stock parts were linked to which stock node.\n\nI decided to make a YT version of the stock Tech Tree, which is maybe a little pointless, but provides a base for other Tech Trees. It actually lists the relationship between stock parts and tech nodes.\n\nI then turned this into a YT version of the CTT.\n\nThese seem to work, and I figure they would be useful for Mod creators. At this stage, it needs other eyes than mine to check things. Are any parts missing? Are all the nodes in the right place? That sort of question. Also, importantly, how is a new part, node not specified in the Tech Tree, located?\n\nIncidentally, there are a few extra bits in the Stock Tech Tree entries which don\u0027t seem to be used.\n\n        RDNode    {        id = start        title = Start        description = The technology we started out with.        cost = 0        hideEmpty = False        nodeName = node0_start               //What does this do?        anyToUnlock = False        icon = RDicon_start        pos = -2568,1199,-1                     // A few nodes have numbers after the decimal point which seems over-precise        scale = 0.6        Unlocks                   // This is the YongeTech method of linking parts \u0026 nodes        {                        part = basicFin                        part = mk1pod                        part = solidBooster_sm                        part = GooExperiment                        part = trussPiece1x                        part = parachuteSingle        }    }\n\nI still want to make one or two tests before I make the trees available. Does anyone have a suggestion for how to label them in a way that Module Manager can recognise and act on? I don\u0027t want to mess up how a parts mod might set tech node links."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T10:10:32Z","Content":"I\u0027ve hit a brick wall.
