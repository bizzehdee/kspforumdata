I\u0027m a layman in thermodynamics so I\u0027ve no idea what most of them represent. Also there\u0027s the language barrier which doesn\u0027t make things easier.\n\nWhat variables do I have to care about when heat balancing a part? What do all of them mean and how do they influence each other?\n\nI understood that a part has an external (skin) and an internal temperature. They pass heat to each other. Also skin\u0027s heat energy is transfered to the skins of attached parts and internal heat energy is transfered to the \u0022internal\u0022 of attached parts.\n\nSo here\u0027s the variables list:\n\nemissiveConstant\n\nheatConvectiveConstant\n\nmaxTemp - maximum temperature the part can have before it explodes due to overheating\n\nradiativeArea - part surface area in m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2? for calculating how much heat energy can be radiated during a fixed update\n\nradiatorHeadroom\n\nradiatorMax\n\nresourceThermalMass\n\nskinExposedArea\n\nskinExposedAreaFrac\n\nskinExposedMassMult\n\nskinInternalConductionMult\n\nskinMassPerArea - what it says\n\nskinMaxTemp - maximum temperature of the part\u0027s skin\n\nskinSkinConductionMult\n\nskinTemperature - current temperature of the part\u0027s skin\n\nskinThermalMass\n\nskinThermalMassModifier\n\nskinThermalMassRecip\n\nskinToInternalFlux - heat energy in J? passed from skin to internal during a fixed update\n\nskinUnexposedExternalTemp\n\nskinUnexposedMassMult\n\ntemperature - current temperature of a part; is this the same as the current skin temperature?\n\nthermalConductionFlux\n\nthermalConvectionFlux\n\nthermalInternalFlux\n\nthermalInternalFluxPrevious\n\nthermalMass\n\nthermalMassModifier\n\nthermalMassReciprocal\n\nthermalRadiationFlux - heat energy in J? radiated away during a fixed update, works in space \u0026 atmosphere\n\nAs you can see I have no idea what\u0027s going on there. My last physics classes were ~15 years ago and I forgot everything about temperatures.\n\nI would be nice if someone adds the missing descriptions."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:56:04Z","Content":"Many of those are internal fields that setting in the config will have no effect.
