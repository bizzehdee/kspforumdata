Call your local council and get a list of local troops, and give some of the scoutmasters a call.  Treat this like a job interview (you\u0027re the interviewer!) and find the troop that fits you best.  It\u0027ll be a bit difficult moving into a troop you don\u0027t know, but having been around the council for a bit, you probably know more of the guys in the troop you choose than you would expect."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-26T19:37:11Z","Content":"I have been an eagle scout for quite the time now.
