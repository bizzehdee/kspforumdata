However, the station keeps disappearing by the arrival of the next part, and any kerbals onboard show up in the Astronaut Complex as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E. This has happened 3 times in a row already after reverting back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and even after a game restart, and all other satellites in orbit around Duna remain untouched. I have put the station in an orbit of 1,000km, between Ike and Duna, and fast forwarded time extensively to make sure that the orbit is stable. Does anyone know what is going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T11:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Deribus, it\u0027s hard to know what\u0027s going on just from your post, can you please upload the save with the station to a file share site such as dropbox.com and we\u0027ll take a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gianni1122","CreatedById":170752,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T16:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222863704\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152571\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480048291\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171891\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deribus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/24/2016 at 11:31 PM, Deribus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has happened 3 times in a row already after reverting back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EI have to ask because you said\u00A0\u0022after reverting\u0022.\u00A0\u003C/i\u003EAfter you get your first part in orbit, are you actually clicking \u0022revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022?
