All other ships are shown moving normally in the map view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when I try to escape by switching to the mothership (in ike orbit) in map view, it explodes, and all the parts fly off on crazy courses, except for the part that is focused, which is frozen like before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom then on, when I quickload and try again, the lander freezes and the mothership explodes if it is still nearby when timewarp is activated, if attempting to leave Ike orbit, the mothership explodes when entering time warp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known kraken and is there a way to escape it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T04:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes exiting the game completely (to desktop) and restarting help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t experienced exactly the symptoms you describe, but I\u0027ve had similar bugs (0.0 m/s orbital velocity / spinning altimeter) which do go away after a full restart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are you using any mods at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T04:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn additions to the mods question, it would be helpful if you could post pictures of the craft in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do your ships include a claw?

I\u0027m not sure if the exact cause has been narrowed down yet. Unfortunately, once it infects a ship it doesn\u0027t seem to leave that ship.

Unfortunately that means 4 kerbals will have be trapped there forever, it\u0027s a decent sized ship so they will have enough space, I just hope one of them doesn\u0027t go completely insane and start going all Event Horizon on the rest of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T17:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh.
