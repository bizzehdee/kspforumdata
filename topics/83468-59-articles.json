I would counter however with several things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, with the exception of the KIS container shape difference, that rover is perfectly buildable with KIS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only parts that worked with KAS prior to KIS were items that were specifically designed to be KAS-able. Part of this made things stupidly OP in terms of their ability to be carried on a kerbal\u0027s back. With KIS, everything is able to be manipulated, with the caveat that it\u0027s size and mass are more realistic. That being said it is very easy to create a config file override. So if you wanted to override some parts to make them carriable on a kerbals back without collision issues or override the weight issue you can. It\u0027s a catch-22. With old KAS you had to explicitly define parts that could be manipulated via KAS. With KIS you have to explicitly make overrides for parts that you might want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general I have found KIS to be far easier to work with. As an example I had a fuel tug that traveled between Minmus and LKO for refueling purposes. Stupidly I put solar panels that could not be retracted when aerobraking at kerbin. So I sent up some new panels to attach on EVA. With KIS I couldn\u0027t put the panels on the kerbals back. I was able to carry ALL FOUR in the kerbals inventory. This allowed me to replace all 4 panels in one trip rather than a lot more flying back and forth to grab each one individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo each his own. Once getting used to it I have found KIS to be acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I see the harpoon I think of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/60BjkUtqxPE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guerra","CreatedById":128708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wintersdark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wintersdark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYup; I actually ran into this today.

I\u0027d like to use KAS/KIS to reinforce some stations and interplanetary craft with struts, but that\u0027s it. I\u0027m curious though, once I attach the struts and link \u0027em up, what am I safe to remove? I think I can delete the entire KIS folder, all KAS parts except the strut, and the sounds folder, but I figure I need to keep the textures and the KAS.dll - is that a safe assessment?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T18:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will need to keep the KIS dll too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T01:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat about a crew tube for connecting bases and moving kerbals arround with CLS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T02:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EdusacconBR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EdusacconBR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat about a crew tube for connecting bases and moving kerbals arround with CLS?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe Roverdude\u0027s USI Kolonization Systems mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/MKS-Kerbitrail%28tm%29-FlexOTube\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehas one\u003C/a\u003E, though I haven\u0027t tested it out myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T02:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EdusacconBR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EdusacconBR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat about a crew tube for connecting bases and moving kerbals arround with CLS?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPathfinder has the Mineshaft that does exactly that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
