I plan to have them both produce all three of their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox options (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E, and Ox) simultaneously for maximum fuel production. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx uses .50 ore/sec, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E uses .45 ore/sec, and the Ox uses .55 ore/sec. I add that up to equal that the ISRU uses 1.5 units of ore per second for those three options\u00A0to run in parallel, x2 for the other, for a total usage of 3 units of ore/sec for both of the ISRUs. \u00A0The large drill says it has a max ore output of 1 unit of ore/sec, but I red on the parts description page that I should expect .5 ore/sec as a more dependable figure. So my refinery has 6 of the larger drills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that when I launch it and use it on my test asteroid, \u00A0a class C asteriod with an ore concentration of 90%, once my equipment reaches optimal operating temperatures, I have a net draw on my ore holding tanks of 1.5 units of ore/sec when I should be breaking around even. \u00A0It seems to me that if the issue is the ore percentage being around 90%, I should have a net draw of around 10% of total expected output, .3 units of ore/sec instead of the 1.5 units of ore/sec. I\u0027ve rechecked my system settings, but I can\u0027t seem to find where the issue is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T21:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat level engineer do you have on your mining vessel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GwynJHawke","CreatedById":162547,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-23T00:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, sorry for posting in the wrong place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, it\u0027s a probe ship.
