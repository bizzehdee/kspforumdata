However when I approached in the recovery craft it sank into the ground as I got near to it. I tried reloading an earlier save (several times) and each time it sank. \n\nI wonder if this was because I had already landed near to it, but that really shouldn\u0027t be a problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Asda12348","CreatedById":146213,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T15:53:19Z","Content":"I fixed it by going into the save file and editing the altitude, \u0022sit=FLYING\u0022 and \u0022landed=FALSE\u0022.
