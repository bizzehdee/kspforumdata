After the launch of the space bus, which was never documented, I decided to give my two lonely Kerbals some friends to ride on their bus. I sent three Kerbals to Duna to ride on the Space Bus, and I plan to have a base there eventually. Right now I will focus on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we launched the rocket. One of my designs I usually use for Duna, Jool, Eve... Just about anywhere I need a 3-Kerb capsule. So Sonfrey, Dudfrod and Billy-Bobbal were sent in the Duna Dillydallyer. Below you can see the ship, just after leaving the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/Duna%20Dillydallyer%20mission%201/image.jpg9_zpsbvq6d4hr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.jpg9_zpsbvq6d4hr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter separation of booster set one, the gravity turn. You can see that the discarded boosters have actually collided, and their nosecones were knocked off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/Duna%20Dillydallyer%20mission%201/image.jpg10_zpsjcbkey0m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.jpg10_zpsjcbkey0m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting into orbit, I fiddled a bit with my trajectory until I got a suitable and rather efficient Duna encounter. Here is the ship just after the start of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkip ahead a couple years, and we are at Duna! A short aerobrake and apoapsis burn later, here we are in a (roughly) circular orbit. From here, we will wait until we can get a landing spot suitably close to the Space Bus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter retro-burn and separation of transfer stage, we are coming down about ~10km from the Space Bus. Not my best targeting, but it could be a lot worse. Coming in through the atmosphere at a gentle trajectory, there were no entry effects, making for quite a boring entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrogue chute deployed, coming in over landing zone and killing horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain chutes deployed, going down now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe landing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, here comes the Space Bus!
