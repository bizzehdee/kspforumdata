Right now I\u0027m working on changing up Dres to make it brown and white instead of gray. But I\u0027m having some trouble integrating it with parallax. I\u0027m using both Kopernicus and Texture Replacer to swap out its colors. When I\u0027m in deep space or map view, Dres looks brown. But when I zoom in and Parallax terrain loads in,\u00A0 it turns gray again. Does anyone know how to change planet textures in a way that Parallax understands?\u00A0 Is there a line of code I could add to a config file or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
