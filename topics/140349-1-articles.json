Of course, that is a buff with no trade-off... what you will have done there is essentially the same as taking the Skipper and buffing its Isp to NTR-levels. So in order to remain \u0022balanced\u0022 with the rest of the stock engines, a NERV buffed to ten times its thrust would have to drop its Isp down to something like 350. And then you might as well just use a Skipper in the first place \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe straightforward way to get shorter burns with NTRs, by the way, is to mount more of them. You mount about twelve to fourteen of them, and end up with roughly ten times the TWR (depends on your ship\u0027s mass). Of course, all that extra dry mass will ruin your vessel\u0027s dV... it will probably not be much greater than if you had just... you guessed it... used a Skipper in the first place \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E This is not an accident, but rather illustrates the balanced tradeoff between thrust, dry mass and Isp between different engine types.
