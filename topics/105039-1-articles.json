In retrospect, the ore system isn\u0027t actually all that bad of an idea, but the new scanning system is absolute garbage.\n\nMany of those parts were made for 0.19, and would have worked quite differently than what they do now. For example, the high-gain sensor was designed to make broad and generalized scans of a planet from far away, eg. a flyby situation. The narrow band scanner would have been used in a low-attitude polar orbit scanning satellite, where it would make narrow and more accurate scans in the manner of mapsats (requiring multiple passes). I like this system, but apparently it\u0027s too complicated for SQUAD, so they give us a POS system instead. ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T16:46:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The scanning mechanic is pretty surprising.

It still requires the time, you just don\u0027t have to leave the satellite focused. You still have to find something else to do while the scanning takes place, and that is the issue. The stock system has the same basic requirements (you need to get into a mostly-polar orbit, a flyby or equatorial orbit won\u0027t work) and doesn\u0027t have the \u0022find something else to do\u0022 requirement. Sure, it glosses over avoiding resonances between the body\u0027s rotational period and the satellite\u0027s orbital period, making sure your satellite has enough power to continue functioning while in the planet\u0027s shadow, etc, but as a simplified mechanic it works fine.\n\nI can see where the simplification bothers people and they prefer to mod in something more realistic, but that\u0027s fine and the same can be said for every other simplification in the game.\n\nI\u0027ll probably still be installing ScanSat myself, in fact, but not because I like the way it scans better."},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:59:34Z","Content":"Not a fan of the concept, either. But that\u0027s how karbonite worked anyway (back when I last used it): add scanner, and hey presto... insta-scanned! So I\u0027m at least happy that it does actually have some piloting requirement associated with it.\n\nI can totally see the logic behind it, in that most scanning orbits will need to be roughly polar and that you don\u0027t want to wait for multiple orbits for it to complete, so why not just make it a condition that scanning has to happen in a polar orbit and have it instantly scan?\n\nWell, I guess I\u0027d kinda hoped that it would reward accurate piloting proportionately. Stuff up your insertion? Well, guess you\u0027re not gonna get great coverage. Missing a patch? See if you can alter your inclination to hit it. Not happy with your orbit? Try figuring out the optimal inclination and altitude (remember the ISA MapSat orbital parameter thread, back in the day?). These are all golden bits of gameplay mechanics - the stuff of player and skill-led randomness that adds depth, detail and reward - which feel like they\u0027re being intentionally tossed away.\n\nI suspect that stock KSP won\u0027t have the depth a lot of us expected it to have two or three years ago. I\u0027ve kinda come to terms with that! Devs have come and gone, other concerns have shot up the priority list and (I suspect) there are other pressures that exert influence over the development process. It\u0027s probably to be expected that some stock features will be heavily abstracted in order to expedite development.\n\nWhat\u0027s more important is whether KSP as a platform remains open enough for these choices to be altered by the modding community. Personally, chances are, I\u0027ll repurpose the stock parts for ScanSat, then take a look at alternative resource mods."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T19:17:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I suspect that stock KSP won\u0027t have the depth a lot of us expected it to have two or three years ago.

There\u0027s a lot of stuff folks care about more than me... real life planet scale, maximum re-usability, whatever else. And here\u0027s something that\u0027s important to me - putting satellites in intelligent orbits for science and now that it\u0027s been simplified it sucks.\n\nI guess it makes mods all the more awesome - that thanks to modders\u0027 creativity and hard work I\u0027ll be able to restore this little bit of \u0022realism\u0022 that I care about.
