It will also show you their experience levels. Definitely the easiest way to tell what kind of Kerbals you\u0027ve got on a specific ship.\n\nThe Astronaut Complex will show the specific log of each Kerbal - handy information if you want to know which activities they\u0027ve been credited for (and for planning what you may want them to do to level up further). The Astronaut Complex will also show you what kind of Kerbal you will be picking up if you accept their rescue contract."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:10:28Z","Content":"There\u0027s a mod called Portrait Stats that adds little icons to their IVA pictures to tell you what they do, and adds stars to show their level.\n\nThis link has several mods, scroll down and find portrait stats [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731-1-0-x-DMagic-s-Modlets-Latest-Update-Celestial-Body-Science-Editor-v5-0-7-11-2015](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731-1-0-x-DMagic-s-Modlets-Latest-Update-Celestial-Body-Science-Editor-v5-0-7-11-2015)\n\nBy using it, you don\u0027t need to switch away to anything to check."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:34:48Z","Content":"^^ THIS.
