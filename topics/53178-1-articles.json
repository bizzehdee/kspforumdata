A common thought went through my mind about Data Storage, Computer Cores, and Drop Canisters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData Storage \u003C/strong\u003E-- You can use this like a flashdrive, storing data up to a certain point depending on the data storage device itself. I have reason to believe that Squad is planning to do this anyway because they have a Data Size value on the science menu. However, as time goes on, the data is slowly lost, on top of the fact that you can only store certain data (not surface samples or the like).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDrop Canisters\u003C/strong\u003E -- This is a more tolerant yet less capable version of the Data Storage device above. For long term missions, you can put a little bit of data inside a drop canister, launch it towards Kerbin, and hopefully it will save the Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2. I say hopefully because the reentry can cause the canister to overheat and lose the data contained within it (The data will still be on the parent craft, however it will be a lot less valuable if the canister succeeds). Like a probe core, these canisters run on electricity and require more electricity the more data is held (the same with the Data Storage devices above).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T07:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of drop cannisters but I don\u0027t think they need to be a new part. If data is treated like a resource then you could transfer it to a spare probe body. Add some thrust and a parachute and you have made your own drop cannister.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andersenman","CreatedById":61273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T12:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBring multiple probe pods like this chap:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe first pod is released and after lining up with it\u0027s intended drop zone, using a maneuver node keyed to 114m/s, its one time solid boosters are fired.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wroKYik.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wroKYik.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aBrg90Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aBrg90Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LWNmL90.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LWNmL90.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossibly in conjunction with these mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/radial-experiment-storage-container/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/radial-experiment-storage-container/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55710-0-22-Science-Parts-from-Tarsier-Space-Technology\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55710-0-22-Science-Parts-from-Tarsier-Space-Technology\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-19T13:08:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2013 01:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Andersenman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
