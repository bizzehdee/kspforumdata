That is why\u00A0I have made this suggestion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear the Astronaut Complex there would be 15 small glass displays on pedestals;\u00A0one display for every planet \u0026amp; moon with a surface. When you first start a save all the displays are empty, but every time a rock from a planet/moon is recovered on Kerbin, a small piece of the recovered\u00A0rock is put in the case. For example,\u00A0say\u00A0you just came back from a Moho mission and you brought back a Moho rock. A small piece of the Moho rock is now on display in the \u0022Moho\u0022 display case.\u00A0(I figured that only a small portion of the\u00A0rock should be displayed, as scientists would need access to the rest of the rock for studying.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cases would be around the height of a kerbal, and they\u00A0would look something like this: (although they\u0027d have a more \u0022KSP\u0022 look\u00A0to them, as well as a plaque stating which planet/moon the rock is from)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YP01YzZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YP01YzZ.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022374\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocks would be mounted to the case similarly\u00A0to how this Moon rock is mounted, on two poles:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002282270main_s81-33955.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/images/content/82270main_s81-33955.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022477\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI kinda feel like there should be a reward for collecting all 15 rocks, but I\u0027m not sure what it would be or if it\u0027s even necessary.
