They had a metallic grey base and an orange colored tank in the middle, with a warning label on all of them about causing death. \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pug6quod6jwgh2n/rne-ex.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pug6quod6jwgh2n/rne-ex.png?dl=0) this a rough drawing of the smaller ones from memory.\n\nThe two smaller ones had their flames coming from that slit, while the big one had a nozzle and all three seem to have unique models. I can\u0027t seem to find them any more, if anyone knows were I can find on old copy of these i\u0027d really love to know. I want to try and update their cfg\u0027s to work in 1.0.4 for my game. They just fit my ship designs so much better."}]}
