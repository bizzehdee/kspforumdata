Four satellites should give you a reasonable system in one launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, you need two satellites in stationary Kerbin orbit. Position the first one so that it can barely still get a link back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E over the horizon; make sure that any error in orbital period you\u0027re unable to avoid causes a drift towards \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, not away from it, to avoid losing comms a mere month later. Position the second as far \u003Cabbr\u003Earound the planet\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible, but so that it can still talk to the first. This should result in a setup where any spacecraft above a certain altitude always sees at least one satellite or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E itself. And even in a low orbit, the dark zone should only be maybe a dozen degrees or so - and then, perhaps you can bounce the signal across one of the other two:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne satellite each in orbit of Mun and Minmus. Position them in a medium polar orbit (~500 km Mun, ~300km Minmus). Their job will be to alleviate the signal shadow of the moons themselves. As the moons travel around Kerbin, the orbits stay fixed, so you get differing performance depending on the position. In the worst possible case, the polar orbit is edge-on with respect to Kerbin, and the satellite is useless while it passes in front and behind the moon, only able to properly do its job over the poles... but hey, it\u0027s better than having no comms at all on the far side. In the best possible case, the polar orbit is perpendicular with respect to Kerbin, and the satellite will be able to reach large parts of the far side at all times. On Minmus, it helps tilting your polar orbit in accordance with the inclination to Kerbin, but it\u0027s not strictly necessary since the inclination is small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA prerequisite is, of course, having relay antennas that can talk between \u003Cem\u003Eeach other\u003C/em\u003E (not just with the much more powerful ground station) all the way from stationary Kerbin orbit to the edge of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Right now I have 6 Sats in 1800km orbit. 3 with 0\u00B0 inclination and 3 with 90\u00B0. The next mission will put 5 sats at the edge of kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E (80000km) and that should 100% cover the whole kerbin system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut is need t oget more science to get the right dishes first...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd by the way I started with a octo sat and a hg-5 antenna strapped to every ship that went to orbit. In orbit I dumped the octo and continued my mission.
