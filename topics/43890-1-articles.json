So I decided to use \u0022wing connectors\u0022 And I think i\u0027m getting some really weird aerodynamics off of them.. but I\u0027m not really sure.. Can I do this? is it stupid? will it work? which end on the connectors are lift? the smaller ends?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eheres a pic of what I have so far (pretty damn crappy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg430/BettyofDewm/c130_zpsba1d7103.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c130_zpsba1d7103.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(don\u0027t laugh to hard)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WillHop","CreatedById":67486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T00:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering you are using stock, that\u0027s a great effort! I don\u0027t know what your opinion is on using mods but there are some great mods that come with hollow fuselages like B9 Aerospace which come with an opening and closing cargo bay door etc.. If you are intent on using stock, maybe try something with the square panels instead? I think they react a lot less to aerodynamics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but that does look fantastic at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T00:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat plane looks hilarious.
