It shouldn\u0027t do it to kerbin, but who knows.\n\nIf not, then I suspect this might be a problem with the visual enhancement you use. Likely that the dark side texture, which shows cities lights and stuff, didn\u0027t work for some reason."},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T10:04:29Z","Content":"Hmmm no I don\u0027t use WIP and I haven\u0027t changed anything either. Ill maybe reinstall all mods and take it from there!\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T23:19:51Z","Content":"It\u0027s EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements causing the problem. In order to fix it I would change all the *.tga* flies to *.png* files. All the texture files are found in the BoulderCo folder in your GameData folder.\n\nIf you need more information, I found this post that deals with your current problem."},{"CreatedByName":"yithpistol","CreatedById":61110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T03:08:00Z","Content":"I had the same issue and getting rid of Planet Shine seemed to fix it. Unload Planet shine and see if that does the trick. Space Explorer may have a better solution. A more permanent and acceptable solution."}]}
