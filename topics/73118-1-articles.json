You can watch here as you separate the probe and do the science/crash and see if any errors pop up. You can also post your ksp_log.txt or any other crash logs to a site like pastebin, then post the link here for people to look through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daffs","CreatedById":109699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T21:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply Claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a bit of reading on the wiki and this sounds like the Hell Kraken bug as after restarting KSP the main ship was gone as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried repeating the events and no issue today.
