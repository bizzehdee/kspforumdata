And actually, you\u0027re not getting the biomes from the orbital scanner. You are getting resource concentrations. Which leads me to believe that you\u0027re actually asking about the narrow band scanner, which provides a small GUI popup with a map overlay and does display biome names. In which case, you can use the narrow band scanner pretty much anywhere from landed up to orbit to get a bit of a zoomed in map. It also provides better accuracy for the resource concentration of any scanned areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fistfullofnails\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fistfullofnails\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E is there a zoom mode?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, just the zoom that you can do with the normal controls (zooming into the planet in map mode), assuming you\u0027re talking about the orbital scanner.
