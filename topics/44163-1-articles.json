Design depends on the job, of course. So different needs create different types of lifters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to build a space station at an orbit of 400km height. It should serve as a refueling base for further space missions, haven for a tugboat, escape pod and a debris removing vessel. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe goal was to put 100t into 400km orbit\u003C/strong\u003E. During space station assembly with a standard design lifter I came across two annoying problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Space station parts tend to be massive (not that problem) and either long in size or rather wobbly. Or worst: Both. I got serius trouble with center of mass or structural integrity. The solution was not to put the payload on top of the lifter but to build the lifter around the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Each further part I assembled put me in trouble of how to disconnect the payload from the lifter without giving the half build space station a strong push from the decoupler. The result was often a spinning station or worse, it broke apart. The solution was not to eject the payload from the lifter but to eject the lifter from the payload. The lifter docks with the payload onto the station. Then, the weakest decoupler available comes into action along with a bunch of retro rockets to leave the station smoothly without interfering with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the final design looked like this (uses asparagus, but not all stages are needed if the payload is lighter than 100t). For display reasons the lifter is showd without payload. Payload would be mounted in the center of the cage. Design is nearly finished (needs only some additional batteries and thrusters). Only stock parts where used (except MechJab).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7sHohsD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227sHohsD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NYXPwG5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NYXPwG5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kLn3y74.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kLn3y74.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QYNJlx6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QYNJlx6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw!sted","CreatedById":80602,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T04:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Guys for the help just one more thing.

I would have to consider it my best heavy lifter, though I usually use far smaller rockets. I operate under the premise that miniaturization is key to good spacecraft engineering. If I have to build a behemoth rocket to lift my payload, then I consider that a failure in payload design.

Most payloads are lifted with a stack of 7 1 high jombo64s with either skipper or mainsial depending on weight. the next step up increases teh center tank by 2 and adds another stage ontop of that (for heavier payloads). For really heavy lifting its 7 mainsails, and 14 J64 tanks 2 each atop 1 engine, staged so that it dumps 2 tanks at a time. Then if i really need to lift mass, i switch to 3.5ms, which are generally for 100T minimum payloads. And ofc i follow a very similar procedure, except i alsmot always add a smaller stage between that and the payload. My biggest rocket ive ever actually needed (due to limiting myself to a 300 part ship MAX) is 14 of those 14400 tanks, and 7 of the 3200kn thrust quads. Ive never actually needed any more then this sofar, and anything bigger becomes overly complex staging, laggy, and just hard to strut properly. Only time i build bigger rockets then this is when i rarely use B9 for those capital ship parts, there i need those OP engines they come with to get em orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other type of rocket i use alot is a vertically staged puller. I dont know what the term is, but sometimes i need the launcher to be ABOVE the payload (any ship with alot of wings needs such a lifter to not flip over). This becomes alot harder to achieve, and sofar the heaviest capital ship that uses wings for armor plate ive managed is 100t, but with the quad super heavy engines, you can usually pull it off. These are also much more annoying to make, as each lifter needs to be 100% custom made for every capital ship, some even as complex and having a lower stage as well as fuel tanks above the ship, those really look and work odd. Anyways, my most recent friggate i sent into orbit used one of these dual rockets, i had a small booster system underneath, which blasted me above 3K, then that dropped off, and i continued on the upper engines that also were running full power the whole time. And that one took probably 100 strusts to keep it from breaking apart or tearing the payload (frigate ship) apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is 1 final type ive actually began to mess with, for extremely heavy payloads, is top fuel tank dumping. As in i decouple a fuel tank atop a stack of 2-3 and then separatron it away. this lets me essentially lets me dump fuel tanks 2 by 2, instead of having to wait for a full stack to drain out. Its rather tough to pull off, as the separatrons dont exactly work that well with heavy stuff being pushed up by the main craft, but when it works i can get much better efficiency without resorting to pancake rockets (which i avoid as they are both unrealistic, annoying to stage, and with the upcoming aerodynamics, it looks like taller will be far more effective).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut anyways, one main tip ive learned is to not go too much on thrust, and also not go too little either. Your rocket should more or less fly around 120 or so near the ground, if its much faster you have too much thrust, if its much lower you need more, and anything in between isnt horribly inefficient. You should also be using from 100-90% throttle the whole way up as well, as when your throttle is lower, it means you arent using the max engine power, and perhaps a smaller lighter engine would suit the rocket better. Basically a hard rule i have, if im throttling down below 2/3, i need to cut down either on the number of engines, or swap them for weaker ones. But i still try to keep throttle around 1005 without going too slow or too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T20:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting to see how rocket design has evolved in KSP. Back in the old bad days, anything bigger than an orange tank was a heavy payload, because the joints were so weak, and we didn\u0027t even have 3.75 m parts. Now you can lift hundreds of tonnes to orbit with minimal strutting, and even simple rockets have similar payload fractions as the old asparagus monsters had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese days my favorite heavy lifter is a slight variation of the rocket I used to launch my Jool-5 ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/0.90/heavy_lifter.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022heavy_lifter.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can deliver around 200 tonnes to a low Tylo orbit, and probably around 600 tonnes to LKO (in FAR). The SRBs are attached directly to the boosters, because the original rocket was built in tier-2 VAB, and I couldn\u0027t afford spending 36 parts (12 decouplers, struts, and sepratrons) to make them separable.
