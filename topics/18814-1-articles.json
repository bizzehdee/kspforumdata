For instance, the RCS tanks diameter is much smaller than the command module, decoupler and fuel tanks. Now I know you can add more parts to the game and I have, but I\u0027m having a hard time finding everything I need. Is there a site that has all the modded parts available in one place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I need a RCS tank that matches the fuel tanks diameter(I prefer my rocket components to be somewhat uniform in size). I had the same problem with the asas module but found an add-on part that was the right size.

That being said, there are a few part packs that have larger SAS and RCS as well as a few mods that just increase the size of the current ones. These can be found in the mods section of the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Werwolf","CreatedById":38001,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-08T05:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESschofie, go into the mod forum and do a search for Novapunch Remixed.
