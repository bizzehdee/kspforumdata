My memory says that it always transmitted and removed 100% of the experiments stored on the craft, even those with 0 transmission value. Admittedly, I rarely used it after discovering that behaviour in the earliest days of science, so it\u0027s possible that it did something different at some point between 0.23 and 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does need to change, and we actually need some serious polishing of the stored science UI. With the new lab mechanic, I\u0027ve ended up with 50\u002B experiments stored in a lab, and it\u0027s an extremely tedious click-fest to wade through them. It\u0027s also extremely difficult to actually see what you have stored, as it is an exercise in remembering stuff as you tediously click through a stream of highly similar screens. We need a much better UI with a scrollable list of stored experiments, and the ability to transfer subsets of them to docked pods, and the like. The improved UI for craft-stored science could then be triggered by \u0022Transmit Data\u0022 on antennas, and should include a \u0022Transmit All\u0022 button on that UI which behaves as the antenna does now, but also buttons to transmit only things with transmission value, or individual experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother bug that I\u0027ve recently discovered, but I think may have been around for a good while, is that data is lost if you run low on power during transmission. It claims that it\u0027s sending the remainder as power becomes available, but it seems that most or all data is lost after the first point where it stops due to no battery power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keith_Bones","CreatedById":143851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe improved UI is a good idea, and I think most of the functionality is already in place in the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Caelib\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Caelib\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPrior to 1.0, the \u0022Transmit Data\u0022 function on antennae would transmit any \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Epending\u003C/span\u003E data.

I think we could use a (more comprehensive) science gui. One that lists (and scrolls) all the experiments on the ship (maybe with the blue/green return/transmit bars in small format next to the name) and maybe a checkbox or something so you can, at a glance, see all the experiments and select which ones to transmit. Side benefit is you could deploy this in other situations such as remove/store experiments on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Keith_Bones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Keith_Bones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess the workaround is to manually go through your stored data and ask it to transmit from the sample itself : /\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis. Especially if you\u0027re looking to transmit only one specific piece of data, such as a crew report or something. Just right-click on the part that contains the data you\u0027re looking for, and review it so you can get the transmit button. When you press it, the antenna should (to my knowledge) transmit that data and that data only.
