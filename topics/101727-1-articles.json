Wanted to remove Autolevel and Yaw Stability assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 suggestions I thought of when flying planes. Both minor, and easily explained, which is why I put them in one thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one is Indicated Air Speed (IAS). Its basicly the air pressure coming from 12 o\u0027clock. Currently, speed is only shown as TAS (True Air Speed). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAS is ofcourse helpfull, but when flying planes, IAS is what shows you how your plane will handle, as a lower air density will also reduce IAS. IAS shows you how effective your control surfaces will be, how much lift your wings produce, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2. thing is a Mach One Indicator. Mach one (speed of sound) is importand because as you reach mach one drag increases massively (I realy hope that\u0027s modelled, havent checked yet). However, mach one changes depending on air density, so you cant just memorize one number and try to stay slower than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if we\u0027d have an indicator showing mach one at our current position.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T14:38:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FourGreenFields\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"McPoisoned","CreatedById":138265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T14:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the Idea of adding those features to the stock gaming.
