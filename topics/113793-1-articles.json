I decided to make my first trip to! But I have a problem! I noticed that my ladder was put on the wrong side of the lander, and that is not good. I don\u0027t want to have to return, because I am on\u0027s surface! Is it possible to use RCS from the EVA pack to get back up on? I hope so. Thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T02:17:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T02:00:17Z","Content":"YES!

The RCS was enough, I was able to do an EVA although a bad one because I had massive frame rate drop when I landed on another planet.
