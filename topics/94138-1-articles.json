No serious complaints to squad, they are making a hell good job, from nothing we have good game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to my suggestion, as been said here. Same for (my ship, but also for everyone) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-separating somewhere where is debris falling down, can we have something like simple impact calculator? By that i mean - If its falling, lets have crash it to projected XY surface, if it has parachute lets have it land as a \u0022landed\u0022 debris for all that things we do have disappearing now. Possible in game as it is now? Really, why to lose time and money (in game) with stage parachutes for smooth drop, and not just bomb KSC with falling boosters straight down..which are never land/impact to ground\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T14:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an idea for the solution: Targeted ships could be set to stay in physics range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anthlon","CreatedById":58074,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T16:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s an idea for the solution: Targeted ships could be set to stay in physics range.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis probably concludes all possible situations in best way. \u002B1 for this..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
