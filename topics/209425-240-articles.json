its dimensions for fitment, there is even space left over for the power connector so no needing to get a separate u-adapter. i also am not a fan of nvidia\u0027s new power connector, i dispise the

more power to the gpu. in retrospect im glad i did this. the case allows this psu to suck clean air from the intate at the side vent and blow it out the top, bypassing the rest of the system, essentially giving me 3 different cooling zones in the case.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nram was corsair lpx ddr4 2x16 3600. i needed short ram and this was what i went

anything from nvidia wouldnt fit. i ended up using its usb-c port for my vr headset, because its the fastest on the system.\u00A0incidentally despite having 5 and 10 gig ports, i still cant get more than 2.5\u00A0 gig out of any of them, except the gpu port does 2.7ish. either i got a counterfeit link cable or the hardware is lying to me about its performance, or there is a setting i haven\u0027t
