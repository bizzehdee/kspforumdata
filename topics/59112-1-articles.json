I just got KSP a few days ago and have 30 hours logged already, so first off: thanks for ruining my sleep schedule. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve nudged a bunch of friends to get it and realized while playing that I would really love for there to be multiplayer. Of course, given that we accelerate/decelerate time often, synchronous/same-server gameplay would be problematic, so my request is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Allow for asynchronous gameplay by letting friends/players share structures and orbit data so one friend could, as an example, build a space station, then share it with his/her friends, who would download the structure as well as its orbital information (body its orbiting, distance, location at save, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that way, one of us could be working on a space station while the other is working on an interplanetary rocket, or a moon base, or whatever we feel like doing as a group. Large projects could become community-driven and very fun, even if we had to manually send each other some file every time we change it. For the short term, I think most of us would be perfectly fine with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, great game.
