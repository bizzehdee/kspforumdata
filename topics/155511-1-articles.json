I\u0027m still pretty garbage at the game though. I find career mode to be infuriating, so I play sandbox. My current goal is to make a colony on the Mun and Minmus. As of writing this post I am setting up comm. satellites around the Mun. You will probably see me around sometime in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ohm is Futile","CreatedById":172721,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-24T21:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo shame in struggling with the game. This *is* rocket science after all. Also, the learning cliff is rather sheer, as some have pointed out. In case you are looking for specific information, you can hit the gameplay question section or look up tutorials like Scott Manley\u0027s to name one. I\u0027m also trying to create an up-to-date instructional set of videos of my own, so if you have any particular requests or if you want to look at what I\u0027ve done so far, you can look here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154509-122-ohms-guide-to-everything-ksp-with-videos-wip/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck on your outposts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
