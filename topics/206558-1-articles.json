I remember some years ago I saw an episode of Ben 10 where they went to a planet called Mikd\u0027lty which exactly matches the description of the two-sided planet (Wiki link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://ben10.fandom.com/wiki/Mikd%27lty_(Classic)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMikd\u0027lty | Ben 10 Wiki | Fandom\u003C/a\u003E ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever something is wrong, in the video you can clearly see the icy face being exposed to the light of a star, is it possible that this planet is subjected to the light of two stars at the same time (a Binary star sistem)? maybe one close enough to allow the desertification of one side, and the other not so close to not allow\u00A0de-icing the face, but still\u00A0lighting it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe the desert side is exposed to tidal forces like Rask and Rusk? In this case the two-face planet needs another planet or moon. Or maybe the ligth on the icy face is only for asset review (like the video of Ovin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNERVASman","CreatedById":211629,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T11:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think they just lit it up for demonstration purposes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T13:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty sure the video shows multiple bodies there. Hot side looks like Duna, cold side looks like any icy world you can find out there, even Eeloo, or, idk, Kerbin poles.
