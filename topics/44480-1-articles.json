I hope you guys enjoy this design. It has less than 160 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a very reliable and stable launcher, thanks to the hundreds of struts, winglets and sepatrons I always put on my rockets. If you have a manned capsule, you don\u0027t even need RCS, if you\u0027re note planning on doing some docking action. As always, feel free to point out things that i could have designed/built/... better, although for this particular design I think there\u0027s not a lot that could be done to make it even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like writing very detailed ascent profiles: after all, it\u0027s here for YOU to fly it, and everyone in the community has its own style of flying and crashing things. But here are some useful tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - don\u0027t start immediately with your gravity turn. The rocket is relatively fast and sensible to your commands, but it still takes some time to move it around. Start turning when you are already at a high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - the rocket is very heavy and so it is also very, very slow. You\u0027ll get to 100m/s after 1m30s from liftoff, and not before two minutes after you\u0027ll get to 200m/s. After that, things should speed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - throttle to 98-99%. Don\u0027t go 100%, cause after a couple of minutes the main mainsail engine (the only engine with gimbal-control) will slightly overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rocket features two stages. The first stage is a Mainsail engine, with 4 liquid booster (each with 4 LV-T309) to which are attached other 8 solid rocket boosters. I\u0027ve gone for an asparagus staging: I know it is not very popular at the moment, but I still figured out it would be the most fuel-efficient solution. The second stage features a nuclear engine. This will get you all the way to Eeloo, although the transfer burn might take up to half an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the lander design, you can copy mine. Don\u0027t add too much extra mass though, or else you might need a refueling mission to get all the way to Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry again for my English, I\u0027m from Italy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a nice day everybody! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft download: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/izfrxijei8ctn3g/New_Giacobbo.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/izfrxijei8ctn3g/New_Giacobbo.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
