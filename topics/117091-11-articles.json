This means the engine usually is the first to go when being hit by rounds or shells. We could mod the engines so they have a higher rating and thus last longer. Usually radials could withstand more battle damage, where liquid cooled engines like the Daimler-Benz and Rolls-Royce could be taken out with one shot. For the sake of gameplay, we could consider the idea of armor plating around the engine, just by increasing it\u0027s impact rating to 10."},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T07:49:35Z","Content":"@Azimech: Yes I could make armor plated versions of some parts and add them to the pack on the future.\n\nOr even have dedicated amor parts.\n\nAnd oh, by the way, this weapons pack will become a full mod with custom models and everything!\n\nThere will be also bombs and maybe some turret or rocket pod, but for now at least the internal weapons are confirmed.\n\n@TUKE: sorry for changing the colors I just made them look cool because they were too bright, etc.\n\nPlease pm me telling the tracer color of each weapon.\n\nI may also remove/nerf the tracing of some weapons just because."},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T08:24:15Z","Content":"Here\u0027s the original color taken straight from the .cfg.\n\n projectileColor = 255, 247, 0, 255\n\nAnd as for the sound, if you don\u0027t still have my pack installed --\u003E[here\u0027s](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/233392-ww2-air-weapons-for-bda)\u003C--- the link again.\n\nAlso i would recommend setting the heating for the other weapons similar to mine.
