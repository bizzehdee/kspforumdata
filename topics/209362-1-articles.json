However, the administration building is not being updated with this change, and is still limiting the active strategies to the stock limits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReproduction Steps:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI reproduced the issue on a new save to verify it wasn\u0027t just a mod conflict. I removed everything from GameData, then restored only the bare minimum for Strategia to function:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nContractConfigurator (v2.1.3)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCustomBarnKit (v1.1.22)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSquad\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSquadExpansion\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStrategia (v1.8.0)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nModule Manager (v4.2.2)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then started the game and created a new save with all default settings. The level 1 Administration Building only allowed a maximum of 1 active strategy (should be 2 at level 1). To verify it wasn\u0027t simply a display error, I used the debug menu to add funds and reputation necessary to activate multiple strategies. Though I met the requirements for 3 different strategies, I was only able to activate 1. The remaining strategies remained unavailable, with the listed reason being a max active strategies limit of 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/duaBHLc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/duaBHLc\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ENotes\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAs far as I can tell, I have the most up-to-date versions of all of these mods, as well as KSP.

It seems this behavior results from Strategia getting the max active strategies from CustomBarnKit, then subtracting 1. Why\u00A0 it does this kinda mystifies me... I guess maybe the mod author decided to revert to stock limits, but did it through code instead of their CustomBarnKit config? I feel like I might be missing something cause this seems like such a weird behavior, but at least I know why it\u0027s doing this from a technical perspective...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
