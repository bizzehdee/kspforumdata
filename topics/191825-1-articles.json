As I have suffered some kraken attacks recently and also in a matter of building horizontal launchpads, I have come across your various posts. You seem to be quite involved in finding a stable solution to surface attached bases. Discovering tons of mods recently, I came across one called Airpark, and so I was wondering if deploying a base frame a few meters above ground would not be a good solution to getting rid of the problem once and for all. Maybe the clamp part could be modified through the config file as to be purely visual so that it may look like the base is standing on pillars, while in reality being fixed in mid air.

Clamp extends its pillar to the ground, but not too much, pillar by no means collide with ground. Footing does - but it\u0027s not physical, it\u0027s decorative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn 1.12.2 and with latest KSPCommunityFixes(that has LoadSceneKraken fix, pre-release) i have no problems with clamps. Also i cracked the staging problem, the wobbling problem and so on, it\u0027s all fixable in part configs. AlphaMensae created a specific part for that(thank you AlphaMensae!), and also RSB\u0027s launch clamps are pretty good for that.
