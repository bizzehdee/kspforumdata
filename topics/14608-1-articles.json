It\\\u0027s been quite a design challenge but yesterday I finally got it into orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidently, the actual designation for this plane is the I-10E. There have been over 50 iterations of this design so far, several hundred Kerbals have died to get Jednard, Richfred and Rodald into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch didn\\\u0027t go perfectly and Icarus 1 ended up in a highly inclined 100 x 400 km orbit. Since I didn\\\u0027t know if I could repeat the launch and I wanted a target to rendezvous with I also launched Icarus 2. If Icarus 2 failed I could try to circularise the orbit of Icarus 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIcarus 2 launched into a perfect circular equatorial orbit. I decided to de-orbit Icarus 1, but too my horror I discovered that it was uncontrollable in the lower atmosphere. Billy-Bobson and his crew smashed backwards into the ground at over 100 m/s \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter mourning their loss I launched a simpler, earlier spaceplane - the Daedalus. Daedalus completed a rendezvous with Icarus 2 and the crews waved at each other through the windows.
