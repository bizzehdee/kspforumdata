My first lander, while it did encounter a few hickups, but far surpassed my expectations. I visited every single biome with suborbital hops. And just managed to get back in orbit with the excess use of monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have rover parts, as well and mining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd The Mun, based on some testing, seems like it will be far far more fuel intensive to land on. I was wondering how usable are rovers? I cannot imagine getting a decent land speed, is it unpractical to imagine driving around to all the biomes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, what about setting up a small ore mining facility, to fuel exportation of The Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T05:15:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 05:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T01:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just leave this here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QdoTyF2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QdoTyF2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s nothing else coming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay fine there\u0027s a bunch more coming. The Mun is in a odd but convenient butter zone where its low gravity enough to support semi-efficient mining operations, while high gravity enough to support rovers with reasonable effectiveness. The heavy tanker above can get going well over 20m/s if I let it. The thing does 80kph on kerbin. The problem with that rover is a narrow wheel base. I\u0027m evaluating different solutions to the problem, however simply widening the wheel base is NOT a fix-all because I have to launch it as a vertical stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice to you for rovers is to make sure its stable. Including RCS systems for emergency braking is also not a bad idea. If you find yourself on a slight downgrade, your brakes will probably not bite at all and slowing down becomes an issue. You\u0027ll need to make sure it can turn without rolling over in the low grav as well as make sure you can stop (that latter one can become difficult) but ultimately KSP is pretty doable with rovers because a) you can go WAY faster than IRL and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E planets are much smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, quicksave early, quicksave often.

For example, if you just want to squeeze the Mun dry in as little play time as possible, just put an orbiting base with 32 tons of fuel in orbit around it, along with a small/light lander that just carries around 2 tons of fuel. Quick to design, can send them together from Kerbin in a single launch. Then the lander just hops down to each biome. Can sometimes even get two biomes in one sortie, if you\u0027re careful to choose landing sites near biome boundaries. Descend, science; short hop to adjacent biome, science; ascend, dock, refuel, repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T08:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zephram Kerman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zephram Kerman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIMO, pick a spot within easy reach of \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Ebiomes.
