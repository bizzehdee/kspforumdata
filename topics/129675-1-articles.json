After talking to his flight controllers the Flight Director Chris Kraft decided that it was most likely an instrumentation problem and reentry can go ahead as normal. But he was overruled by his bosses who wanted to keep the retrorocket attached to the heat shield while the spacecraft reentered so that the force of reentry will push the retro pack which will then push the heat shield against the spacecraft until it hits denser air.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that\u0027s what they had John Glenn do without telling him why he shouldn\u0027t jettison the retrorockets.

It was known there was a foam strike. Indeed some of the people watching the tapes brought up to the head controllers that there had been a rather large foam strike. From here it gets a little complicated. I remember after the launch it made a FEW news casts that something had happened but after the first day or so the news stopped reporting on it (a few years before that on Glenn\u0027s shuttle flight a piece of the tail fell off and hit one of the engines, they sort of played it up all through the launch and then again during the landing but nothing came of it so I suspect they were kind of trying to go for that this time around too). Foam strikes were actually pretty common, and indeed many shuttles returned with damage to their thermal protection systems. At the time it was considered a maintenance issue that could be dealt with once the shuttle returned. As others have stated there wasn\u0027t much they could have done if it actually turned out to be a problem, which combined with the fact that previous foam strikes weren\u0027t a problem led to the decision not to do anything about it. In reality had they known for 100% certainty that there was a hole in the wing they probably would not have had them reenter when they did, however any plan that they would have come up with would have been slim to none in the chances of getting the crew back. It was for this reason the shuttle program finally canceled: the shuttle was simply not as safe as it needed to be, and thirty years of NASA culture was based on the shuttle being as safe as it needed to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-11T04:10:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2016 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Frybert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alias72","CreatedById":111778,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T05:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

So two of the seven seats would have to be taken up by another crew.

Added difficulty: no space suits. Additional difficulty: putting on a spacesuit, unlike what is shown in the movies, is apparently not a DIY operation. So getting that last person out of the airlock is another challenge. And doing EVA\u0027s that are not practiced is also a big uncertainty.

At any rate\u00A0 you\u0027d have to jerry-rig an extra seat in the rescue shuttle.

There were a lot of things that could go wrong and likely would go wrong, but for the mission to save everyone everything had to be executed perfectly. The odds were definitely \u003Cem\u003Eagainst\u003C/em\u003E a rescue mission, and that was assuming there was something wrong with Columbia in the first place (which at that point was at best a suspicion, nothing more). From a practical point of view, a rescue mission wasn\u0027t a realistic option at the time; and without the option of a rescue mission, inspecting the wing for damage became a pointless exercise as there was nothing that could be done about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould the crew have been better off with the chance of saying their goodbyes to family and loved ones before descent?
