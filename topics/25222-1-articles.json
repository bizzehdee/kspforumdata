That\u0027s generally pretty revealing. But if you\u0027d rather not, here\u0027s a quick primer on the Rocket Equation, in layman\u0027s terms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Rockets need thrust to lift off. How much thrust depends on the weight they are lifting. How much weight they are lifting depends on gravity. Ergo your thrust-to-weight ratio depends on what gravity looks like from where you\u0027re at when you fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How long your rockets can fire before they run out of fuel is expressed in specific impulse, or I(sp)/ISP. The higher your ISP, the more bang for your buck you get. The trade-off is generally that high ISP comes at the cost of low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When not on the surface of a planet or moon, unless you plan to land, its gravity level is not important for the thrust-to-weight ratio. You can have a TWR of 0.01 and still technically be able to increase your velocity. It will just take MUCH longer if TWR is very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The summation of all this is: you don\u0027t need big heavy engines once you get off the surface. In fact, you\u0027re better off with more efficient engines like the LV-909 or LV-N. Only when you\u0027re planning to do a powered landing (or ascent) and are dealing with high gravity (Kerbin, Eve, Tylo, Laythe, and to a lesser extent, Moho) do you really need to worry about your TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skendzie","CreatedById":58299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T06:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry, I had no idea it existed till a few days ago.
