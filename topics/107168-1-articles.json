What has happened? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was worried that given some people\u0027s reactions to 1.0 we would have a knee-jerk reaction from the devs, and reading this forum that seems to be the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally loved 1.0 and was really happy with it, having found it quite simple to build anything from planes to SSTO\u0027s without having the feeling off it being too easy, and I was really looking forward to continuing my career mode when I got back... So another question I guess is how will it affect that? Will my craft be broken? Will planes fly as silky smooth as they seemed to in 1.0? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t get why squad would make this addition, they had experimentals and QA for a reason and imo that showed in a well balanced game in 1.0... Bug fixes I expected but not this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s. I know I could reset the physics to 1.0 if I edited the cfg file, but It\u0027s besides the point really, I run stock, never really enjoyed mods or editing files, just my personal choice\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESo another question I guess is how will it affect that?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain changes are that you actually need to use heat shields for re-entry now since parachutes are no longer invincible instant deceleration force-feilds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important engine in the game, LV-N actually works now without blowing up after a couple minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource mining actually works now without overheating instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a little harder to get into orbit than it was in 1.0, but still much easier than .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all you built was planes maybe you never noticed the problems, but if you play it as a spaceprogram and not an airforce 1.0 was ridiculous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI don\u0027t get why squad would make this addition, they had experimentals and QA for a reason and imo that showed in a well balanced game in 1.0...
