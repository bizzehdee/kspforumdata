What has happened? \n\nI was worried that given some people\u0027s reactions to 1.0 we would have a knee-jerk reaction from the devs, and reading this forum that seems to be the way. \n\nI personally loved 1.0 and was really happy with it, having found it quite simple to build anything from planes to SSTO\u0027s without having the feeling off it being too easy, and I was really looking forward to continuing my career mode when I got back... So another question I guess is how will it affect that? Will my craft be broken? Will planes fly as silky smooth as they seemed to in 1.0? \n\nI don\u0027t get why squad would make this addition, they had experimentals and QA for a reason and imo that showed in a well balanced game in 1.0... Bug fixes I expected but not this. \n\nP.s. I know I could reset the physics to 1.0 if I edited the cfg file, but It\u0027s besides the point really, I run stock, never really enjoyed mods or editing files, just my personal choice"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:25:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So another question I guess is how will it affect that?\n\nMain changes are that you actually need to use heat shields for re-entry now since parachutes are no longer invincible instant deceleration force-feilds. \n\nThe most important engine in the game, LV-N actually works now without blowing up after a couple minutes.\n\nResource mining actually works now without overheating instantly. \n\nIts a little harder to get into orbit than it was in 1.0, but still much easier than .90\n\nIf all you built was planes maybe you never noticed the problems, but if you play it as a spaceprogram and not an airforce 1.0 was ridiculous. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t get why squad would make this addition, they had experimentals and QA for a reason and imo that showed in a well balanced game in 1.0... Bug fixes I expected but not this.\n\nIf they had them for a reason I don\u0027t know what that was. Maybe they spent all their time on bugs and forgot to actually play the game and see that basic gameplay was broken? In any case, the rapid course correction was exactly what they needed. I was \\*this\\* close to giving up on KSP when 1.02 came out but my first re-entry brought back all the good feelings I used to have."},{"CreatedByName":"Siltuz","CreatedById":141308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:50:55Z","Content":"To be fair, i didn\u0027t really use chutes for reentry before but I hadn\u0027t been of past minmus yet. I found a shallow entry angle and a bit of wobbling around did the trick (my rockets had surfaces for this purpose as I could never find a use for heat shields unless I was willing to discard most of my ship), Is this approach still viable? \n\nI\u0027m glad to hear about mining as I am about to move into that in career (excited!) and the lv-n does sound like an improvement.\n\nI didn\u0027t only build planes but planes were like my little toys that I would use to explore. Rockets were more for when I had hours to kill on a well thought out but very rewarding mission. So in regards to planes specifically, how is the handling on say quick turns etc? I loved that in 1.0 \n\nAlso how do rockets handle now as I did struggle with balance a bit before when turning (I had not gotten Used to it yet since 0.9), which can be a real pain when on no reverts."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:01:54Z","Content":"I have to say I\u0027m pretty happy with 1.0.2.
