Firstly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Many Americans fear Chinese power. Yes, the ol\u0027 \u0022Red Scare\u0022 and stuff is over, but many people still hate and despise the Chinese government, especially over issues such as Tibet and their internet firewall. Trust me, China is like a capatilist dictactorship rotting inside from corruption and pollution. Is this the model of a country you want as the top power?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0022The Chinese stole our jobs!\u0022 - Random obnoxious American on the streets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Chinese are seen as a competitor for military power by the United States. This is also why DARPA is building dropships, railguns, exoskeletons, invisibility cloaks, stealth ships, and hypersonic orbital spaceplanes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Many politicans are already starting to feed off this \u0022red scare\u0022 of China. NASA is already using this \u0022China card\u0022 to convience politicans to fund it\u0027s SLS/Orion progammes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need another space race. It\u0027s the only way to get more funding for NASA. In the \u0022post space race\u0022 years, NASA has recieved 0.5% of the Federal Budget and has laquished in LEO. At the climax of the space race, NASA got 4.5%, and managed to land on the moon in 10 years, when ten years ago to 1969, no such space travel technology existed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf NASA was once again to get a mere \u003Cem\u003Eone percent\u003C/em\u003E of the Federal budget, many people believe that we could be walking on Mars by \u003Cstrong\u003E2020\u003C/strong\u003E. Theres even several scientists who believe, that with Apollo-era funding, men could be on Mars in \u003Cem\u003E5 years\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve heard, the space agency is retaining the Constellation vision for Mars, in which a base is established no later than 2040.
