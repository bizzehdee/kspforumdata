E.g. are all variants visible at once when Firespitter is not installed?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E OK, not for right now, but here is a crazy part idea.\n\u003E People have asked in here someplace for a full-size hub. a \u002B where each arm is the size/shape of an undeployed base part. That\u0027d be cool. Another part, strictly roleplaying, really, would be a large hub, perhaps with a greenhouse roof.\n\u003E \n\u003E Make a 3.75m (5m?) part that is basically a dome (glass can be flat panes with a lot of structure to fit the glass/frame ratio of your greenhouse). Like a giant Cupola part. 2X the height (or more) than your current parts. When you hit deploy, full-sized gangways pop out (ready to accept your normal, inline parts/docking sections, etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here ya go:\n\u003E \n\u003E Using a 3.75m part:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/3.75%20Base%20Hub.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/3.75%20Base%20Hub.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Using a 5m fuel tank dome:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/5m%20Base%20Hub.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/5m%20Base%20Hub.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The command pod parts are the ones touching the 3.75/5m tank parts in both images. In this idea those would be hallways/whatever, and would be entirely inside the 3.75/5m part until deployed. They would need integral docking stuff.\n\u003E \n\u003E If it was the 2d image, there is actually room (in IVA) for a balcony high up in the space. Imagine the blue part is window, there might be a ladder to a \u0022view lounge\u0022 with seats looking out (a grate for a floor, just below the blue to let the view into the large, common area below. Hotel-lobby like IVA (potted plants, mixture of comfy chairs and dining tables), perhaps with a small kitchen area on one wall. Would make for some stunning screenshots ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYou are coming up with a very interesting idea! The \u002B shaped base profile part is already in process. A hub like in the pictures you showed sounds really cool.\n\nThe only thing that would need some additional coding would be the multiple docking ports. Each docking port adds buttons with the same text to the part which is somewhat anoying and confusing. Thats what i always didn\u0027t like about the Habitat Pack.

The trick of course is that they were not retracted, ever. With deployable parts, you\u0027d want to land it, THEN deploy, probably. I suppose you could just have the central \u0022lobby\u0022 hub, with 4 base-profile flat spots JUST sticking out that the player can attach whatever to. This would allow Meerkats for landing.
