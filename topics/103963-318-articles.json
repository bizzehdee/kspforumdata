The moment i hit the lights, i see the graphics flicker twice, my sunflare dissapears and i get 2 error messages in console. It needs to be noted that switching to tracking station and then loading the ship again does seem to reset the problem and my flare is back.  It happens with all the command modules, it also happens when i decouple a command pod from its service bay and when extending some (not all) solar panels.  Granted my main save is 149 mod save, so i tried recreating it in a clean 1.6.1 install with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, RSSVE and the usual visuals and it happened there too.

Even those way off in the distance are being rendered as if they were directly next to you.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m on a GTX 1080 and running at 4k with no anti aliasing, and get lag with Scatterer and scatter objects in dense places. If LOD of objects decreased with distance, or if scatterer didn\u0027t shade objects far away / at all, performance would be a lot better.\n\u003E \n\nYes, you are right on this, since I moved away from using the depth buffer (it has ugly aliasing around objects), the approach used is basically rendering opaque objects twice. I made sure to disable it on the cutout-style trees, if you make a detailed report as above I can disable it on the rest. Typically I would expect the bulk of the performance hit to be coming not from additional strain on the GPU but mostly from a lot more draw calls.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/11/2019 at 7:21 PM, Kerenatus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E i use a newly bought RTX2070,i7 9750,32G ram\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E everything is perfectly smooth until i load scatterer lol\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E the fps lag is real![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/12/2019 at 8:46 PM, Majorjim! said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Agreed currently scatterer causes far too much lag even on high end systems.\n\u003E \n\nThese comments are completely unusable for me, if you\u0027re not willing to play around with settings and narrow it down I can\u0027t help you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/13/2019 at 5:22 AM, davidy12 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Isn\u0027t working in 1.7.1\n\u003E \n\nSame as above.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/18/2019 at 5:03 PM, Wackenhut said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Running ksp 1.6.1, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E and rssve.
