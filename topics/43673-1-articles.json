Additionally, all previous threads are locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen docking, with a target port selected and a \u0027control from here\u0027 selected on your ship\u0027s port, it is impossible to determine target ship orientation from the navball. I realize that it\u0027s possible with the camera, but you can\u0027t get it perfect, and if you\u0027re playing from IVA, it\u0027s usually impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture this situation. You\u0027re approaching a simple craft from the rear - you\u0027re heading straight for it\u0027s engine, and the target docking port is on the other side of the engine. The navball would give you your prograde marker lined up on your pink target marker. It would give no indication of the target craft\u0027s orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ereorient the navball when in target mode\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. When I target a docking port, the navball would change so that the north pole pointed out from the target docking port. Then, if I align the pink marker AND the prograde marker over the north pole, I know that I\u0027m aligned and on target. If instead I see the pink marker and prograde aligned together over the south pole (brown), then I\u0027m approaching from the rear of the port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I think this would be useful is because that once I\u0027m in target mode (with a docking port targeted), I don\u0027t care at all what my orientation is to the body I\u0027m orbiting, only to my target. So, keep normal navball orientation until a docking port is selected, then automatically transition. Again, this would allow a full \u0022instrument approach\u0022 - align the north pole, prograde marker, and pink target marker and you\u0027re guaranteed to dock as long as there are no other ships in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dewinslow","CreatedById":60845,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T11:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody?
