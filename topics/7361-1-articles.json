It is the most precious of all things in the universe, and seemingly the only thing that gives the universe purpose. What good is a painting if no one is to see it?

In many, many years, life will be impossible to sustain, at least in the way we are familiar with. When it is gone, no one will be there to experience the beauty of this vast cosmos. There will, one day, be a last life form. Some magnificent stars may still burn, but the last true testament to the artistic talent of our Universe will be gone. We have no way of knowing who or what this will be, because life has a hard time finding each other, at least in our experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, after an unbelievably long time, the final bit of matter will be gone.

In the words of Carl Sagan: \u0027We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.\u0027 We will be gone one day, and so will the rest of the life in the universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe must make it our goal to become worthy of being placed on that cosmic timeline, to be something wondrous before it is too late.
