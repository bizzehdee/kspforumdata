(You may not have much Ox, but I can\u0027t tell from the pic.) So, first suggestion is: during reentry when you are still really high in the atmosphere, turn around retrograde and burn all of your Ox, and however much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E is necessary -- or until your speed is down to 1500 m/s, whichever comes first. The fuel is heavy, and makes your reentry that much harder if you come in at full speed. But if you burn it instead, your reentry will probably be a cakewalk. The other benefit is that you will have a much shorter reentry, which means you can pinpoint it much better. Try to do the burn about 200km west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to land at the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond suggestion is: if you are coming in faster than 1500 m/s, then go for a 90 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of 30, until you are down to maybe 45km (or maybe lower, if your spaceplane can hold\u00A0that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E). A 90 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E distributes the heat better -- as said above, that MK1 cockpit is not very good at handling heat.
