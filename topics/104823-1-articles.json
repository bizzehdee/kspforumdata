(google it). I fear that many noobs are about to hit these forums, noobs that might have avoided KSP when it was an early-access game. They will demand much higher standards of both KSP and mods. They probably won\u0027t distinguish the two. No mod creator wants to listen to people complain about problems they cannot address. Those who aren\u0027t modders, myself included, will surely step up to answer the easy questions, but that can only go so far.\n\nIs the community ready?

That is really going to eat into the windows ram limit. Granted some are probably replacements, but I doubt 1.0 will take textures down in size. Then we have to add in all the totally new resources stuff which I assume will be deployed as a new texture layer atop planets. I don\u0027t mean to speculate about features, just that I see a sort of near-perfect storm on the horizon.\n\n(1) New release that will surely break the majority of mods. \n\n(2) Pile of new parts that will push the ram limits even tighter for windows users.\n\n(3) Host of new players, probably without our patience as this is now a finished product.\n\n(4) Possible partial withdrawal by some modders if, as this is 1.0, they feel that longstanding api bugs/issues will simply never be addressed. \n\n(5) Large number of new features with minimal testing = large risk of game-killing bugs for some segment of the community (a la linux mousewheel).\n\nI hope it arrives relatively bug free and that modders do not loose heart. A ray of hope for me are the horrible view numbers for the teaser vids. Less than 100k after four days is probably a record low for a pre-release KSP vid. So perhaps there aren\u0027t legions of new/noob customers waiting in the wings. I doubt Squad would be happy, but a softer sales peak is probably best for the community."},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T06:31:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E /steels self for a flood of \u0022HALP! why u no mudpack guyz?\u0022 posts\n\n/steels self for flood of aspiring \u0022project leaders\u0022 who have no idea how to make mods themselves pitching their ideas in the development and release forums. \n\nbut really despite how it could all go wrong I\u0027m gonna stay positive until hell actually breaks loose... its not like I can actually do anything to prepare for when it does...\n\nSo who\u0027s looking forward to getting fresh blood to guide down the path of coding modeling and texturing? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (guiding may or may not involve large whacking implements like sticks, large spoons, and spare eva flags)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T06:42:46Z","Content":"Hey I\u0027m an ideas man.

So I don\u0027t worry too much.\n\nA huge amount of RAM could be saved with the cleaning up of a few old stock parts, the IVA spaces don\u0027t need 2048x2048 sheets surely? \n\nAlso some the NasaMission parts use the same texture, but don\u0027t share it, just keep separate copies ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)(Why....

I got guidance on Reddit when my creations failed and I did not know why. I got help here when I jumped head-first into mods and things inevitably broke. Of course we had our times of trouble and drama, for instance when the 64 bit \u0022hack\u0022 pressured modders into trying to fix problems that weren\u0027t theirs and so on. But in my opinion this has not changed our community.\n\nThis is not our \u0022Eternal September\u0022. It is the fabulous opportunity to welcome new people and help them enjoy the hell out of the game we love. Let us not cling to our respective memories about version XX.x and the good old times instead."}]}
