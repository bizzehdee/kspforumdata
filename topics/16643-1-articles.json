And the engines stopped halfway to Minmus! How am I supposed to fly a rocket that doesn\u0027t work? *Low*They could atleast\u0027ve blown up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Uhh... We were out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Scientist 2: Intriguing. Maybe parachutes need air to work? Hmmm....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(A little later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Scientist 1: We have solved all your problems, just look! *Pulls a blanket away from an object* AHA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: It\u0027s a parachute? Does this one work without air?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal scientist 2: Niet. It Is a Starchute! It will slow your rocket even without air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Scientist 1: It might not be as effective as a parachute, but you dont fall as fast in space or on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Ehm... What is that other err... -chute?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Scientist 1: Yes, that is a Starsail. We do not know how it worked, but we made it from the same material as the special parachute that flew away when Bob opened it in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Scientist 2: It is supposed to work like a engine, but not so powerful. It will however work without fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Scientist 1: You want to test these two, ehh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Sure, when is blastoff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Can I stay on ground this time? Nedfel can take my place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dl and non-story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two ideas that (I think) would be really useful and cool:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStar Chute: Like a parachute, but it works with NO or LITTLE atmosphere. Beware: For some reason these cannot be made very big, so you need multiple smaller ones to slow anything bigger than a CPod. They are also not as effective as their air counterpart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarsail: Just like a solar sail (Check wikipedia if ya want: \u003Ca href=\u0022here\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail\u003C/a\u003E ) gives very little trust, but consumes no fuel. These should also take a little while to open. Because of those reasons they would be best for long distance trips(AT LEAST to Mun, prolly Minmus\u002B(new planets?)) or you could get creative and install one on your lander incase you dont have enough fuel to break Mun/kerbin orbit,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is Nedfel exercising during an EVA: (I was thinking of making a 10h version...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV2tPe9F_4E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV2tPe9F_4E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Millst0ne MK II","CreatedById":13384,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T21:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDat vid.
