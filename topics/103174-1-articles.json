Im sure it exists. \n\nI would like to create an object that reflects like a view port, it doesn\u0027t need to be back lit, its going to be an observation deck for a factory and so it needs basically to appear like one way glass. \n\nIm thinking this has to represent added texture layers on top of the UV mapped textures."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T20:56:10Z","Content":"If you just want a simple shiny metal-like polished surface, the stock KSP/Specular or KSP/Bumped Specular shaders in Unity\u0027s KSP PartTools will suffice.\n\nHowever, if you\u0027re looking for a true mirror-like reflection, you will need to use the TRreflection PartModule from the TextureReplacer plugin to specify the meshes you want to be reflective."}]}
