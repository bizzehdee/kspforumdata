I want proper hose/cable/rope simulations and it is taking more time to work out than I was hoping it would. I think it would be interesting to be able to get your rocket tangled in your own harpoon line and silly stuff like that. Also fuel flow between tanks will get some more tweaks as well, I am not sure I am satisfied with the current logic. Currently fuel flows \u0022down\u0022 the connected tanks. For instance you place a center tank and place two side tanks on it, and the side tanks have engines. The fuel will flow from the center tank to the sides, but if you have an engine on the center tank it will only draw fuel from the center and not from the sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short tanks suck fuel from the tank they are attached to, but do not suck fuel from a tank that was attached to them.
