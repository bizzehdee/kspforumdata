While realism is nice, unless you\u0027re specifically trying to gear this mod towards being an RO specific mod I\u0027d stay away from the super detailed reaction chains to gain usability over realism. Making TAC complicated to use and close the loops is one thing, to get to realism levels for reaction chains is something else entirely.\n\nOh sorry, i should have been more precise to explain what i meant ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t want to add multiple other resources to make this all more complicated. \n\nI wanted to say that TAC uses these two reactions to produce Oxygen from CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E (and Water) but the real reactions use CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and another resource to produce Water.\n\nAlso there are four recyclers to produce Oxygen (WaterSpiltter, Sabatier, CarbonExtractor and Air-Filter) and only one for Water(Water Purifier)\n\nSo my suggenstion for this would be:\n\n**Elektron (Water-Splitter):**\n\nWater \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Oxygen \u002B Waste\n\n**Carbon-Extractor:**\n\nCO\n\u003Csub\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\n2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Waste \u002B Oxygen\n\n**Greenhouse:**\n\nWater \u002B CO2 \u002B Waste \u002B [?] \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Oxygen \u002B Food\n\n**Sabatier:**\n\n**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9**\n\nCO2 \u002B [Liquid Fuel?] \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Waste \u002B Water\n\n**Air Filter:**\n\nIntake Air \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Oxygen\n\n**WaterPurifier:**\n\nWasteWater \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Waste \u002B Water\n\nSo the greenhouse would somewhat replace the original TAC sabatier to produce oxygen from CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and water.

I see where you going with this now and and getting the recycling action more accurate is a good idea. The only thing I could see causing any issue is balancing it all against each other. It needs to be able to make the Elektron/Carbon Extractor balance properly against the CO2 needs of the Greenhouse and the same applies for the Purifier/Sabatier for Water. Then, once you get that balance done is there going to be a need to have two processes to obtain Oxygen and Water? Don\u0027t get me wrong, I like the flexibility to decide how to setup the system (like being someplace water is readily available and using Elektron over the Extractor). But, it would be easier on you if you developed a streamlined process so you only have to balance the needs of input/output against each other. In other words, a single process each to get Oxygen/Water/Food is far simpler to setup no matter how you do it.\n\n...But it would be neat to have that flexibility ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) INDECISION!"},{"CreatedByName":"mark7","CreatedById":143108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T19:56:15Z","Content":"great mod\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00C5\u2019ever think about some inflatable parts\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00C5\u00B8\n\nI think that would be great,just need some oxygen when inflating\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00C5\u2019and saving tons of fuel to get to the destination~"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T20:03:12Z","Content":"every other base mod is almost 100% inflatables ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"mark7","CreatedById":143108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T20:04:19Z","Content":"oh,and also could u please make this mod compatible with rpm?\n\nJEB: I want television\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00C2"},{"CreatedByName":"Reiver","CreatedById":148134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T02:39:18Z","Content":"nooo not inflatables, I much prefer the campervan designs!\n\n(We should totally have the habitat parts produced by a campervan company.
