For instance, try pitching up to 60 degrees as soon as you\u0027ve cleared the runway, then slowly pitch down as you ascend, aiming to be at 45 degrees at 15km altitude. Turn on your rockets at ~12 km, turn off your jets at about 15 km. After that, just keep pitching down, aiming for 30 degrees at 30 km, and level at 45 km, then keep accelerating until your apoapsis as where you want it, coast and circularize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t try those super tiny designs at first. I find a reasonable one-kerbal design to reach orbit without too much difficulty usually has about 5 standard tanks of fuel (2000L), to give you an idea of what ballpark you should be in. Once you\u0027ve figured out how to get that into orbit, start optimizing your ascent, and shaving off fuel until you\u0027ve worked it down to super-tiny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T14:49:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, atmospheric engines are typically good up to around 20,000m. From there on, ideally you\u0027d want to be flying East (090) on the ascent, most probably with about a 30-45 degree inclination as you reach the 20km mark. As you pass 20km, I\u0027d advise you switch off all your atmospheric engines and enable rocket engines to provide the requisite thrust. Depending on how you want to do it, you can then use thrust-vectoring rocket engines to pitch up again to about 60 degrees inclination and then burn to an orbit, or try to go vertical and gain a fair amount of altitude before stabilising your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T16:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on the spaceplane you have.

Think of them as longer burning SRBs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI asked a very similar question a week or two ago and didn\u0027t get much in the way of answers, I think everyone must still be experimenting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experiments I\u0027ve concluded the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Wings are essentially wind deflectors and only produce any effect when at an angle to the airstream. You\u0027ll never take off with wings parallel to the runway - you either need to rotate the entire machine back or place the wings at an angle so they generate lift when flying horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Wings seem to have some sort of thrust multiplier effect. I\u0027ve built machines with a sub-1 TWR that can lift just over 100 tons on a single 100 thrust jet engine. Unfortunately of the machines I\u0027ve built so far the aerodynamics have always interfered with the ability of such a weak engine to rotate the machine into a correct angle for rocket and/or cause unstable upper atmosphere flight after the rockets were lit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The number of wings required for takeoff seems to scale roughly linearly with speed and weight. Doubling the number of wings will halve the speed needed for takeoff, while doubling the weight will double the number of wings required for the same takeoff speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Around about 25-35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 seems to be the optimum wing angle to generate lift and it drops off sharply over 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-31T11:57:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2012 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by EndlessWaves\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T21:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E#4 isn\u0027t entirely correct.
