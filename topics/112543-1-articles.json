Intakeair is a global resource provided to the craft as a whole, and consumed from that whole by the engines.

Use rapier engine and place a shock cone at the back of the rapier. Now this will normally block the rapier engine thrust. What you need to do is to clip the shock cone untill you can\u0027t see the white part at the side of shockcone. Do not clip more, there is a really small window of error. Now what this will do is to reduce your tail drag and at the same time give you a bit more air while increasing the stability of your plane. Now i know what you are thinking. You are adding more mass how can it increase performance. Try it with the 2 rocket launch test if you like to and you will see the huge diffrence even with the added mass the rapierspike engine one will go alot faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you know if you are planning on efficieny use rapiers.

There is like more than %100 fuel consumption change between going at 25k against going at 27k altitude for rapier. On top of this you don\u0027t even loose much speed going from 25k to 27k.

Sure you are going to tell me that you get more drag as you go faster on top of more air but i just feel like drag and air gained from intakes are not changing accordingly to each other at different altitudes. It doesn\u0027t feel scaled. Maybe its how the rapier reacts to pressure.
