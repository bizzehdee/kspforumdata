However, my chemistry is not nearly as good as my physics, so I\u0027m a touch uncertain as to what fuel\u002Boxidizer combinations would be best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can get finely powdered potassium nitrate easily enough for the oxidizer. Mixing it with confectioner\u0027s sugar would make classic R-candy. But what about making a paste out of the potassium nitrate and something like mineral oil? Would it not produce a good burn surface? What about a mixture of sugar, mineral oil, and the K nitrate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterested in specific impulse, probable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ratios, general safety, and ease of handling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T09:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket candy must never ever be made without dissolving the sugar, and I don\u0027t mean melting it (extremely high probability of ignition and the mixture isn\u0027t homogeneous because the salt won\u0027t dissolve in molten sucrose)\u00A0but dissolving in a solvent that dissolves both it and potassium nitrate. The cheapest solvent that does it is distilled water (avoid tap water because of limescale).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsual mixture is sucrose:KNO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E=40:60 with a pinch of iron(III) oxide. It simply has to be dissolved in warm water and then evaporated and stirred constantly on a hot plate. When enough water evaporates, the procedure gets dangerous because hotspots can occur. Also, the mixing must not be such that it introduces air bubbles because those will quite possibly\u00A0cause the engine to explode when the reaction front reaches them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end result has to be a hot plasticine-like mass that still has some water in it and needs to be either immediately ram-packed into the engine or made into little cylinders and sealed in plastic baggies because it\u0027s deliquescent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes a lot of practice and the consequences can be disastrous if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing.
