So unlike with spaceships, you don\u0027t have 6 DoF, so you are still stuck with stupid notions of up and down which make no sense in space. Sometimes you have your spaceship just over you and you can\u0027t face it, that\u0027s so annoying. I think it kills half the fun of space EVAs.\n\nThis is very frustrating considering I just want EVA controls to behave exactly like spaceship docking mode spaceship controls. No more no less. That does not look so difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T12:35:04Z","Content":"You can hold the right mouse button on a kerbal to drag them around to face stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"haltux","CreatedById":29407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:23:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can hold the right mouse button on a kerbal to drag them around to face stuff.\n\nNo you can\u0027t. If you look upward and press space, you won\u0027t face upward. If your spaceship is \u0022over\u0022 you (whatever that means), you cannot face it. \n\nAgain, this is not by itself the main issue, the main issue is the lack of freedom in your moves, the fact that you are stuck with arbitrary notion of up and down."}]}
