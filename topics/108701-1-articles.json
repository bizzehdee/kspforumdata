So unlike with spaceships, you don\u0027t have 6 DoF, so you are still stuck with stupid notions of up and down which make no sense in space. Sometimes you have your spaceship just over you and you can\u0027t face it, that\u0027s so annoying. I think it kills half the fun of space EVAs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very frustrating considering I just want EVA controls to behave exactly like spaceship docking mode spaceship controls.
