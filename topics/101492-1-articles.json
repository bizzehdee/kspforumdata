Usually there is little chance replacing that.\n\nFor a laptop those look like pretty decent specs. Though gaming on mobile devices is always a compromise, you should be able to play most, if not all games at reasonable settings."},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:20:59Z","Content":"It\u0027s a decent laptop, i don\u0027t think it will run any graphically demanding games too well, but KSP should run fine. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:23:37Z","Content":"12GB i7?

It\u0027s not an OMGBeastPowerhouse but I expect it will handle most games quite well.
