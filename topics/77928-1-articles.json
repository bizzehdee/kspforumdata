Seats four kerbals, has about 130 parts, and weighs roughly 4 tons. It also features extendable landing legs for taking the weight off a particular wheel when repairing it, as it will break immediately otherwise. The four kerbals are not included, but it can drive itself since it has a probe core as well. I had to use quite a lot of part clipping to make it, so if you don\u0027t like that, then maybe the Jeeb is not your cup of tea. 100% stock parts, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file (Mk3): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24407836/Jeeb%204x4%20Mk3.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24407836/Jeeb%204x4%20Mk3.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/krv9L\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
