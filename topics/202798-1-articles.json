of fairly interesting observations and a few issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest issue, of course, is how Michael got onto the ship. No part of that makes sense. Obviously he had to somehow be trapped in their launch vehicle, not in the cycler. But he was located in the \u201Cfunctional module\u201D which means...what? Is that supposed to be a reference to a habitable service module for the launch capsule? The launch capsule/vehicle\u00A0is shown docked perpendicular to the cycler body (which means rather significant transverse forces on that docking ring, but whatever), so is it a biconic capsule? Does their capsule provide 100% of the life support for the cycler? That seems like a very bad idea. Why wouldn\u2019t the cycler have a backup closed-loop ECLSS?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd how, for the love of all that is good and holy, does he \u201Cfall\u201D from where the second-stage pins are INTO the \u201Cfunctional module\u201D of the capsule? How??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u2019s think this through logically. He was obviously located inside of the pressure hull of what we must assume is a habitable service module. To have fallen into there, there are only two options. The first option is that the second stage separation pins can only be accessed through a crawlspace located inside the pressure hull of the service module but outside the main habitable region, and he had entered there and installed the pins and was climbing out when he slipped and fell and was knocked unconscious...and somehow no one noticed. The second option is that he was installing the pins prior to the capsule being affixed to the pressure hull of the service module, installed the pins, climbed back up, and then fell from the scaffolding into a space between the outer pressure hull and inner habitable compartment of the service module. Neither of those make even the slightest sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this would lead the viewer\u00A0to consider the possibility that Michael stowed away on purpose. However, if we would be able to conclude that, how much more would the people at Hyperion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few other minor quibbles along the way. For example, they have a call out for \u201Csolar panel separation\u201D when they clearly mean \u201Csolar panel deploy\u201D. Also, in any real cycler mission, you would never launch for a fast rendezvous; you would ALWAYS launch at least a day\u00A0in advance into a parking orbit. Otherwise any launch hold would mean an entire missed mission. Another thing:\u00A0the Kingfisher upper stage which is (cleverly) used as a counterweight appears to have four landing legs, which makes no sense because it has exposed engines and is stated to have no meaningful propellant residuals anyway. And for heaven\u2019s\u00A0sake, how the heck are they not double clipped to the tether during the climb!??! ALL YOU NEED IS A SIMPLE CARABINER!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, there are a few interesting Easter eggs as well. It seems very much that the company Hyperion is a non-government agency and is responsible for a Mars colony, which suggests they have a particular company in mind. The landing legs on the Kingfisher match that particular company\u2019s design, and the name \u201CKingfisher\u201D is the name of a bird which also has...implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is clear that Scott did a lot for the film. The rate at which the Earth shrinks in the distance seems perfect. The Kingfisher has a lower LOX tank which is autogenously\u00A0pressurized and has a residual GOX pressure of around 5 bar which is well within possible levels. Of course, I would expect a common bulkhead on the Kingfisher rather than an interstate between tanks, but that is minor.\u00A0The gravity climb across the tether is represented extremely well despite the egregious lack of safety harness clips. The growing voice delay during communications seems accurate. The timing of the coronal mass ejection is of course a huge coincidence. Only having a 20-minute warning for the CME is a little suspect but I suppose if they were using Earth-based detectors it\u2019s not completely out of the question.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-31T19:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I\u2019m not entirely sure about the plan to vent CO2 and replenish with oxygen.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-31T20:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s not a human.
