For the Mun, the cycler tends to be a direct-launch vehicle - it just picks the crew up from the lander, dumps some fuel, and then does the full return to Kerbin surface.  For Minmus, the cycler tends to be reusable, either meeting a crew-launch vehicle in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, or dropping them off at a station in Kerbin orbit.  (And of course over time the landers start rendezvousing with stations in Minmus or Munar orbit.)\n\nIt\u0027s a bit more expensive to set up - but the rovers mean I can maximize my science output, and the costs are nearly all setup costs - sending a second crew to Minmus to explore costs about the same as sending them to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E: They\u0027ll have vehicles, experiments, and resources waiting for them at the other end."},{"CreatedByName":"LordCorwin","CreatedById":114256,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-15T10:42:25Z","Content":"Thanks for your all replies, I\u0027ll have them in mind.\n\nI don\u0027t have much spare budget to deal with, so several-part mission will be difficult, but I\u0027ll check it anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-15T12:25:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, LordCorwin said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for your all replies, I\u0027ll have them in mind.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t have much spare budget to deal with, so several-part mission will be difficult, but I\u0027ll check it anyway.\n\u003E \n\nDepending on your contracts, the first part can pay for the later parts, usually.

The other responses have covered this nicely, and there are many more.
