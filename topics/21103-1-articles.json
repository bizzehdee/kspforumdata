I ran into this issue a few times in the previous version of the game building munar rockets, but it never truly impeded my progress. What it is... well, it seems that either the \u0027large\u0027 size parts are too weak, or I\u0027m strapping too much thrust under the thing - or a combination of both. Basically, after about 30-40 seconds, once I\u0027ve reached around 200m/s, the rocket breaks in the middle or so, and falls apart. Data shows a structural linkage failure between one of the fuel tanks and a decoupler - or any two of the \u0027core\u0027 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore meaning, the \u0027center fuselage\u0027 of my rocket. I can take a picture if necessary, I just haven\u0027t bothered. Basically, I tend to build my rockets along a central fuselage with large parts (using the 3-man pod), and have extra engines branching off for each stage (currently sets of 4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... yeah. This is a bit of an issue. This first stage, when I get enough power into it to launch me into orbit, is to get me high enough to make orbit height so I can adjust and make the extra-planetary burn with the second stage. However, that will never happen if the damn thing keeps breaking halfway through. It doesn\u0027t make sense to me either - this is probably the lightest lander and 2nd stage I\u0027ve strapped to a series of rockets... and it breaks every time. So do some of my older rockets loaded into this one too - no amount of struts seems to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... are there any fixes or solutions to this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, perhaps, a suggested \u0027working\u0027 design to get a 3-man pod to another planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, yes, this is my first post (or one of)... lurked for a while, never had a reason to post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T08:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, for working designs, there are several in the Spacecraft Exchange.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fridgecake","CreatedById":18149,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T08:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture would help a ton as people could see any glaring inconsistancies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing other struts from different mod packs as I know they have different strengths etc so this could help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t overload your decouplers, sometimes you can do things on 2-3 decouplers rather than 1 so there\u0027s less stress at that point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry and strut as much as possible and linking the outermost parts to the innermost ones if you can.

It results in smaller part counts and consequently larger rockets. Horizontal and diagonal struts to stop wobble seem essential on large rockets though, I haven\u0027t yet come across a configuration that lets you get rid of them entirely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large parts seem to be able to take similar weights to the small ones, if your stack is more than ~5 3200L fuel tanks high it will have trouble. 4 will often work but 3 seems to be more a generally reliable number when attached to a heavy load.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
