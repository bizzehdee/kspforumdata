It\u0027s a lot to swallow in one shot with no prior familiarity of the listed mods, and what they do. Hence leads to your confusion of seeing things that didn\u0027t make sense to you.

A small set lunar manned flyby/orbit/landing and a rover mission would be nice but i know these things take time. Once we have Kerbin (earth) and the mun (moon) rounded out with a 6 to 10 realistic missions each we will have \u0022lots to do\u0022 while we await further out missions to Mars and Venus to be thought up.
