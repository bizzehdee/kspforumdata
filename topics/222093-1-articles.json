Once you\u0027ve made your first timid steps toward the Mun, you\u0027re basically immediately presented with the reveal of the giant exposed arch. And once you\u0027re there, the game leads you right to the monument on Minmus, then to Duna without delay. I hope that in the future these signals require more effort to locate, uncover, and decipher.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, the site on Minmus looks ripe to actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erequire\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0excavation. Imagine if that crater was filled in with dirt and the signal was detectable just below by rovers. The Mun arch could be something that requires uncovering at first too. And I hope that the deciphering of the \u0022Welcome, younger sibling\u0022 message can require some actual effort by the player someday as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, I hope that it\u0027s possible to play the game for a longer time without knowing if there are other advanced civilizations in space, then without knowing for sure the source of the mystery signals. In real life, we\u0027ve spent a long time exploring space without knowing whether we\u0027ll find life there. We go out of hope, and wonder of what we DO find. Pushing the reveal too early like this might take away from players discovering\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ethose\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0reasons to travel to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T04:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Mystery Signal\u0027 Arc is how they keep you moving further out into the System.
