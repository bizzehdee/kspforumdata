So, I\u0027ve got a contract that asks me to set an unmanned probe into a predetermined orbit. I can see the orbit, however I can\u0027t set target, which makes matching inclination rather.. tricky. Is there a special trick to marking that orbit as a target? Or is there a way to see what my inclination will be when setting a maneuver more efficiently than \u0022eyeballing it\u0022? I have a fair amount of fuel on my ship, but I\u0027ve a pilot being used for SAS until I detach the probe, so I don\u0027t want to Leave them lost in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve seen, eyeballing it is more than sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you\u0027re orbiting the same body as the target orbit, then the ascending node and descending node should automatically appear on the target orbit just like the periapsis and apoapsis. If you hover over either node, it\u0027ll list the relative inclination of the orbits. However, the orbits are lenient enough that you can just eyeball it and it\u0027ll work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keramane","CreatedById":65995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, eyeballing seems to be the best way. I do like that the ascending/descending adjust as you do so, very helpful. Also glad that the deviation range is nice. I lined it up perfectly and the mission completed when I still had a 12 second burn left. ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the needed inclination is listed in the contract (as you probably know) and in and of itself that is not very helpful. But if you use something like KER or MechJeb to display your current inclination it can be quite helpful, of course that is only necessary if you are so perfectionist about all that stuff as me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
