Its not as if the creative minds behind these mods are getting paid and have a deadline. I know when i created the models i did do some testing of the parts lining up at the nodes with stock parts and some others from other mods...but i surely didn\u0027t have time to go through EVERY part in the game....as such we depend on the community to point these things out as they come across them.The same can be said for it\u0027s functionality. It is always more helpful to simply describe the problem you are having with the parts so that they can be fixed.

Yes I understand the mod evolution and that mods don\u0027t work right away. However from both the spaceport and the thread info it sounded like the mod was functioning and had everything functioning. It\u0027s the fact that I feel the description is miss leading that I have a problem with. My other issue is the mod dev stated that he only did limited testing on the mod. My understanding is he just made sure it loaded and the part was there. What good is a part if its function as stated by the description isn\u0027t there or wasn\u0027t tested at all? That\u0027s my core problem with it. To put it harshly the fact features were claimed by the mod and come to find out they either weren\u0027t in at all or not tested to see if they work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T17:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWant to share this little thing, somebody may find useful.
