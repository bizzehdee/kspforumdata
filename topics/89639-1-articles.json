Once, I had a communications satellite that ran down in power on the night side after I transmitted home a picture and when it hit the sun, its panels were only oriented enough to provide enough juice for one of the dishes - the one that happened to be pointing towards an interplanetary craft about 3 light minutes from Kerbin. Luckily that craft was relayed through another comm satellite to mission control so I had a connection... but it was like a 5min signal delay while I was 75km over Kerbin, LOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T21:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me throw in my interest in this sort of thing as well.
