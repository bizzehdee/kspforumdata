To ensure flight stability, do NOT set Control From Here to the MechJeb box.\n\nWith the new aero the drag and mass of the MechJeb box can affect your flight so you want it close to centerline as possible or place it tucked in behind some other part that will shield it from the airflow.\n\nAlternatively, you can use ModuleManager with a script to patch it into all command pod parts so you don\u0027t need the box."}]}
