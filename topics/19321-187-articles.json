Is there any good rule of thumb? Like the CoM ball resting fully on the forward axis indicator of the CoL? Currently where it is you can see the axis sticking out, and I\u0027m thinking of moving the CoM forward just enough to cover it up\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CoL can have definite gap between it and the CoM. You want it closer for supersonic flight since the CoL moves backwards when you\u0027re moving faster than the speed of sound. (By how \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E I do not know.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027ve got in your images I would consider super close. Your pitch control will be incredibly sensitive. The last time I built a plane like that, it was nearly unflyable until I got way up in the atmosphere and was flying around mach 2 or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: For example, here\u0027s a craft that flies great at subsonic speeds, and pretty well when supersonic, although it loses pitch control in the neighborhood of 23km (in RSS/RO, not sure what the ceiling would be in stock KSP) at Mach 3 due to the CoL position. It would be capable of pitch control at those altitudes if I moved the CoL closer to the CoM, but I would also get more unstable flight when subsonic as a result:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/M6oDb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Looking for some final advice. Please keep in mind this is under a career game with financing, so I haven\u0027t researched a lot of parts to use and haven\u0027t put much science towards aerodynamics in the tech tree. So I have limitations and this is the best I think I can do with what I have to get a hybrid aircraft. The idea is for it to power climb on the jet engines and glide down slowly with the electric propellers, doing this a few times until fuel runs low and it needs to return. Honestly don\u0027t know if the concept is viable but I\u0027m trying to find out and learn a bit more about plane building in the process.\u003Cp\u003EI just flew a test flight that had my nose lift and my rear end hit the ground and blew up a few seconds into my takeoff roll no doubt because my gear was too close to the CoM. I noticed when I 2x physical warp the plane almost tips over backwards. Would it be a good guide to be able to 3x or 4x physical warp without the aircraft tipping back on its rear as a good indication of where to place the gear relative to the CoM? I also think the propeller thrust being under the CoM helped the nose come up and I should instead takeoff on jet power alone at first rather than move the gear too far back to make it harder to lift off. I could also angle the canard wings down a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test was flown with only the main fuselage/nose cone and engine fuselage/nose cones filled with fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/yS1rT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/yS1rT\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow... Your plane is grossly overweight for its size. 17 tons at a TWR of 0.3? It\u0027s no wonder you can\u0027t get that thing off the ground. It\u0027s a brick. Consider the A-10 Thunderbolt II weighs in the same range \u003Cem\u003EWITH COMBAT PAYLOAD.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at your AoA sweep images, your L/D (Green Line) is terrible. And with a TWR less than half the vehicle\u0027s weight, you could up-end that thing and it wouldn\u0027t fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your control surface settings show another problem. When you pull back on the stick, your L/D drops. Looking at the image, I see that this corresponds to aft stick input for pulling back on the nose. Your aft-wing control surfaces fan up and behave more like spoilers instead of elevators. This makes your already terrible lift problem even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead that green line on your AoA sweep, your L/D ratio doesn\u0027t even hit 1 until you\u0027re pulled back to 15 in no-control-surface-input flight, and it doesn\u0027t even hit 1 when you\u0027re pulling aft on the stick. L/D is the efficiency of your plane\u0027s ability to fly. Technically, anything can fly if you attach enough engine to it, but we call those things \u0027rockets\u0027. If your L/D isn\u0027t even hitting 1, that means you\u0027re not breaking even with your lift ability vs your vehicle drag. Which means, if you\u0027re flying, it\u0027s ALLLLL engine. Which you don\u0027t have... because... Well TWR is 0.3. You couldn\u0027t launch a bottle rocket with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a nutshell:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Lose weight... a LOT of it. Go with the props, or the jets and design around one or the other. You\u0027ll either lose the fuel weight if you go electric, or the electric engine weight if you keep the jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: You need to get your elevators away from your wings so they don\u0027t behave like spoilers when you pull back on the stick. Try making your V-stabs shallower and enable elevator control on them. If you\u0027re CoM is close enough to your CoL and your gear are in the right place, that shouldn\u0027t require very much elevator response for rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Convert the control surfaces on the main wing closest to the inside into flaps. That should give you a little extra play for takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Pay attention to that CoL line. You want a sharp climb above 1 well ahead of ten degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: BONUS: Keep an eye on that yellow line. When it goes positive, you tend to die.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkstar80","CreatedById":113917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T02:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice, I\u0027ll give it a try!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nubeees","CreatedById":28735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T03:52:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I removed the Dangit mod, and my ship seemed to have loaded fine.
