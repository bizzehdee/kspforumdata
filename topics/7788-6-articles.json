I love your mod, one of my favorites. Mostly for the Ion engine, battery, and solar panel. Now I\\\u0027m not sure if you are aware of this rather important bug. Sometimes, not all the time, while the Ion Engine is running, the battery will NEVER work again. Now its odd because it stays attached to the ship, but the icon for the battery on the staging disappears and the Ion Engine stops working because of no power. I know its attached to the ship still because it does not appear as debris in the world map and will not detach from the ship. I find this bug to be annoying whenever im in VERY deep space. as in out to the mars solar orbital ring IRL. Suddenly the enignes stops and all the batterys bug out.
