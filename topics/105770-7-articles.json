The entire craft is ~30 tons (ive managed to get 35 in orbit on one rapier but its so painful its not worth it and the extra dV is negligible at that point). As for the bay, it has a massive stack of FLT-100s that have been swapped to pure LF capacity (using a mod that lets me pick fuel types and how much of what is in a tank). I know there are many that would consider this cheating, but i couldnt care less when i design mostly sci-fi inspired craft (notice how everything i make has rear cockpits, ive yet to see anything but prototypes in real life use rear cockpits), so i just dont care anymore. The toughest engineering feat right now is making good looking craft that ALSO fly well. I seem to be a fan of compact designs (this one is kinda inspired by my older M-Fighter line, just that i added a bomb bay and shortened the nose (used to be a mk1-2 short and mk1-2 long adapter \u002B same cockpit/engine layout, with new aero no more external missiles ofc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually now that i think about it, the primary reason i used so many small fuel tanks inside is because i absolutely refused to fly a craft that was unable to carry some weapons internally (even if the laythe version had weapons stripped off). The FLT-100 is the largest tank that will still let me drag 2 0.6m torpedoes to the sides of the MK2 bomb bay. Id replace those stacked fuel tanks with the 400 LF tanks, but i cant do that and have weapons inside as well. I might make a minimalistic design with edited fuel tanks in the future though, since i really like to have room in the cargo bay for more weapons (3-4 missiles in there would be so nice), but that is cheating even for me since you essentially get free fuel for no dry mass. The only part that would make me change my designs would be a MK1 bomb bay, that would be amazing even if it only carried 1 missile, i could actually make a super small fighter with internal weapons capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm defenetely going to try to think of a new idea though for the HK-201S, ive already redone the wing layout (and swapped more wings for wet wings due to the free fuel in them for no added dry mass), and make it more maneuverable for less part count and still able to land on Duna albeit with difficulty due to the terrain being so bumpy. Sadly engines will stay the same as i see no viable alternatives that get you similar dV (ions will get you more but i refuse to fly anything that has less then 2Kn thrust per ton at a bare minimum (that is what, 30 bloody ion engines right there not counting any of the massive part count batteries and fuel tanks too). I may make a cheaty craft for use in fleet operations though by editing fuel tanks to have capacity based on volume i see (so the MK1-MK2 adapter would have in excess of twice it current capacity). Thats my usual solution to dealing with part counts, but it does give me more dV then normally since less dry mass by removing fuel tank weights, although wish there was a way to say edit the fuel tank weight without mods like you can fuel capacity in the craft file so i could have say twice the dray mass, twice the fuel in a single part (already i have a mod that lets me swap fuel amounts in game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any tips to improve my design id be glad to hear them, right now its more or less reached its maximum potential (i have managed at a absolute max ~6600dV using a ridiculous 35 ton build i miraculously managed to get into LKO no idea how though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for flight itself, the biggest problem for me are those grav assists, does anyone have a good guide or something for it? Like for example the last thing i wanted to do is to go from bop/pol and direct shot to kerbin. I actually managed to get to Bop surface and land near kraken (i accidentally smashed into it 1st time as i didnt realize it had a hitbox), and i had ~800 dV left after getting back into Bop orbit, more then enough to get to Tylo, but nomatter how many times i tried i couldnt get it to actually line up in a useful way to actually eject me to kerbin (always either wrong direction, or made my orbit smaller then larger).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve always been very good at getting to jool system, but returning is hard, VERY hard unless you have the fuel for a hohman burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done PLAD\u0027s route once before but that was relatively easy as its a matter of reverting alot of quicksaves and just leaving for eve at a very particular date/time, and then following the right procedure, but setting up a useful grav assist without timetables is tough. How do you do grav assists on the fly, (and can they be used to get a inclination close to a planet of interest?). I feel that i could easily pull a Bop and Pol trip alongside the usual laythe expedition, but i need some help with how to actually take advantage of grav assists as i dont have that much raw dV to hohman everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T15:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ask me, the whole concept of a fighter with range to go to Jool/Laythe doesn\u0027t make sense to me.

It thus has only 3 fuselages vs. 5 to further reduce drag and uses all winglets and canards to steer. I used the small hardpoint to center-attach the fuselages, mounted the rear wheels lower and further in, and added two pairs of struts front and back to increase the rigidity of the airframe. The resulting plane flies much better than the previous version. It weighs 41.4t on the runway, 13.4t empty, and as you can see from the pictures, it reached orbit on my first successful try with almost 5.9km/s deltaV left, a number I think I can still improve slightly upon. I believe this is close to the best one can do without resorting to cargo bay or part clipping abuse, but I haven\u0027t really scoured the forum for better performance.

The plane also lands quite well back on Kerbin, even mostly full. I could probably push this just above 6km/s if I replaced some the oxidizer with LF, but I want to keep that in case I need more power than the nuke can give. With that amount of dV on LKO, I think a Laythe-Duna-Kerbin return tour is feasible.

Most of my SSTLs have room for ~500 oxy (so i can have a boost from mid gravity worlds without an atmo that would let wings do the work), i normally use ~100-200 for ascent, and if i know ill be landing on a tough planet i dont bring as much LF and bring extra OX to help near the ground (this has saved my arse multiple times from badly timed suicide burns). Heck, even for interplanetary burns a thrust much less then 2 kN per ton of ship drags out your transfer burns so much that you loose alot of benefits from the whole planet gravity at a low PE. I think that the lowest one can go within reason and not be severely limited (or wasteful with dV) is ~1-1.5kN/ton. That means that you need at a bare minimum 1 ion engine per 2 tons of mass, or 1 nuke for 40 tons. Myself, i like to have 1 nuke for ~20-25 tons (although i have gone with less TWR then that for long range designs), since it lets me get decent range, and at the same time it lets me land/takeoff from the majority of planets/moons aside from Tylo, Eve, kerbin (unless jets ofc since single stage from teh launchpad), Jool, Kerbol, and possibly Moho (although ive yet to actually get there in a single stage aircraft style build).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm now working on a new ship, a SSTE (single stage to eeloo) which will HOPEFULLY be able to get to eeloo, land, and get back in orbit without any refueling (although the dV requirements to even get there arer so high there is no way to make a roundtrip without grav assists since you need to burn both ways, no aerobraking availeable). Im gonna try to use my 7K dV version to build off of (and i need to reduce dry mass since 7K isnt gonna cut it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i know that this isnt really as great an accomplisment as your designs (since its super heavy on clipping), but hey, how is 7329m/s dV not incredible from a NUKE ONLY vessel? All that with reasonableish TWR considering how heavy the craft itself is. That and its actually my style (it took forever to balance it right so its stableish and all, rear cockpits are just so hard to work with since you have nothing to really offset engine weight with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ohmQmZF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ohmQmZF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Puzj6N.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Puzj6N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless my math is crap, it has 7329dV in a ~80km orbit.
