It\u0027s the LV-N. I use it for literally everything outside the atmospheres of Kerbin, Eve, and Laythe. It\u0027s totally necessary, and I would by no means nerf the ISP because it makes the game playable, but it needs both bigger drawbacks and closer competitors so there is some decision making required besides \u0022how many LV-Ns do I strap to this thing?\u0022. I think it should cost more and overheat nearly instantly after coming into contact with the thinnest atmosphere. I also would love a 2.5m variant that has slightly better ISP, but lower TWR and weighs close to 10t, making it great for big payload transfers but terrible for landers.
