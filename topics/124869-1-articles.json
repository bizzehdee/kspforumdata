I can understand the three turbojets causing the parts they hit to quickly heat up though. But the lack of jet wash on the two turbofans really makes me sad... They don\u0027t need to produce any heat, but the pressure exerted by the exhaust is kind of important for several designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping to make a big airboat using the goliath, and use sets of standard canards to act as the air rudders. But without the jet wash to push against the rudders, the design is completely useless. No jet wash, no real stearing... Cause the exhaust from the goliath, if it produced a force on the canard surfaces, would of been able to push the back end of the airboat around. Now if I want to try doing it, I\u0027ll have to \u0022cheat\u0022 the controls into working using lots of SAS modules... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T18:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah this is by design.\u003Cp\u003EThe reverser is actually quite clever, it is two thrust transforms together, each is rotated by the Unity animation engine by 180 degrees but in opposite directions, so thrust drops off smoothly to zero then climbs again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut because of this the damage was disabled, so they don\u0027t toast everything to each side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the explanation.
