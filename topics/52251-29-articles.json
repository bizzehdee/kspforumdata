My time is valuable, so I use MechJeb to control the burns, which can be longer than *one hour* because my computer has problems with the part count. I also used MechJeb to control warps because again, my time is valuable. All ascents, landings, and flight planning is my own work (though I occasionally use MechJeb to fix maneuver nodes perfectly to periapis/apoapsis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- How many launches was needed to start your mission from Kerbal?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etwo, one for the tanks, one for everything else. I could have done it in one, but my computer couldn\u0027t handle the part counts, and either the game would crash or the ship would experience Spontaneous Unintentional Disassembly. There are lots of docking ports on the ship which belie a two launch set up, but the reason for the ports is to shrink the ship as I use up fuel and parts of the ship to make the craft more fuel efficient and the part count lower (ship processing faster).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- How many refueling did you do during the mission, how much and where?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft is designed to complete the mission without refueling (fingers crossed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Did you bring a Living Quarter (Hitch-hiker\u0027s Storage) for the guys during the long journey?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, Bill and Bob will live and work in the lab, and Jeb will move between lander cans.
