Solar panels are a high priority to unlock, of course. It used to be that fuel lines for asparagus staging -\u0026gt; not a priority anymore. LV-Ns are also often a high priority. Turboramjets used to be a high priority for me, but then they got moved back in the tech tree, and panthers, though earlier, aren\u0027t nearly as useful for SSTOs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew science experiments are often a priority: invest science to get science. I dislike having to go back to a destination and biome hop all over again to get seismic/gravity scans...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking ports should also be a priority, especially for biome hoppers that refuel from orbital depots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to which order for contracts? I think most contracts are not tied to tech. Many are though: You don\u0027t get ore mining contracts until you unlock drills. You dont get part recovery contracts until you unlock the claw... You don\u0027t get asteroid redirect contracts until you unlock lvl3 of the tracking station\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost are tied to your career progression: You don\u0027t get rescue contracts until you\u0027ve done a rendevous (can be done for a \u0022worlds first\u0022 contracts) - at least this is my experience).
