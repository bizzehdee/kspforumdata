Not everyone has a joystick(or wants to spend it for only one game) and the 6DOF option for 3d ice is nearly unplayable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought it would be nice to have the option to use a controller(pc or console) for flying and especially landing and having all needed hotkeys on that pad(except for the action groups but they could be switched through). The rumble feature would also be nice during launches,wobbling ships, landing and crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, you could have separate controls over main engines and rcs thrust, easier controlling in EVA or just the plain standard layout if desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince ps4 controllers can be easily linked to the pc, owners of those could also use the touchpad(mouse movement/gestures for actiongroups or something else) , the built in speakers for chatterer , the sensors for IVA viewing(or maybe something totally different) etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would make an awesome mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if something similar already exists, does it support those features i mentioned above?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T15:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all I\u0027d suggest using the OS joystick integration first - if that is able to handle the controller, it would be usable in game. But ATM there\u0027s not even proper, fully-fledged joystick support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Saitek Cyborg 3D standing right here, configured for flying everything possible in the Star Wars Battlefront series and controlling everything in the MechWarrior series. It\u0027s the best I\u0027ve tried so far. Yet KSP refuses to work with it properly, it\u0027s not even recognizing the joysticks X axis. Y, Z and throttle would work, even the cam control axis work, but not the main X - that\u0027s more than weird.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T19:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to General Add-on Affairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rabid Bat","CreatedById":114865,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T21:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts not a mod (not free either but cheap enough) I use Pinnacle Game Profiler to set up controllers for all my games.

Works just fine. Any existing control can be mapped to a key, and axis controls can be mapped to the sticks. The only difficulty is each trigger is treated as a separate axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing is rumble, which I don\u0027t think KSP even begins to support on its own. You\u0027d need a plugin of some sort to send a \u0022rumble\u0022 signal when certain conditions are met (G force \u0026gt; 5, AoA \u0026gt; 20, etc...). That\u0027s assuming you can even get KSP to talk to the controller like that. I wouldn\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
