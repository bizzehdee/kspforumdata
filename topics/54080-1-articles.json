Forgive me if this is a silly question, but I\u0027m rather new to KSP after using Orbiter for many years. Anyway, my question is, how to I predict my inbound inclination when arriving at my destination body \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E I enter its SOI? Let\u0027s say I want to arrive at Duna in a 20 degree inclined orbit without having to do a major plane change burn. It seems that Mechjeb and Engineer have no way of doing this, unless I\u0027m missing something. The only way I can see to do it now is to guess based on the trajectory in map view, which is about as precise as not knowing at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T04:20:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you set CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0 (Mech jeb can do this in the maneuver node editor) it will draw your path relative bodies.

That\u0027s helpful, but it didn\u0027t quite answer my question. What I want to know is, for example, when I\u0027m in LKO planning my ejection burn to the Mun, I want to know what burn parameters will result in X inclination upon Munar orbital insertion, and if I were to perform a mid-course correction, what burn I would need to perform to establish a Munar orbit with X inclination\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T10:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re wiling to eyeball your arrival inclination, as Taki17 mentions, setting CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0 in the settings.cfg will let you do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you do this, instead of getting weird squiggly lines of dubious value when your future path passes through a world\u0027s SOI, the patch will be drawn in the frame of reference of the object (So it looks like a normal hyperbola) and at the current position of the object (So you can hit Tab a few times and center on it for a really close view.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.18/Screenshots/screenshot259.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot259.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result being that, weeks or months before you reach your destination, you can pop a maneuver node a few hours ahead of your ship, run your time accel up to 5x so things stop jumping around, center the map screen on your destination, and spend a few minutes finessing the maneuver node that will move your periapse and arrival trajectory close to where you want them, and spend maybe a 10-15 m/s of delta-V doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, it\u0027s a matter of just sighting along the plane of your in-SOI patch to get a good idea of your arrival inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to know your /exact/ inclination on arrival before you enter the SOI, Protractor will show you that, but last I checked, it only checks patches on the path your spacecraft is currently on, not paths generated by maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"voneiden","CreatedById":38803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T13:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as a tip: tweaking the conic patcher on the fly while playing makes life a lot more easier, perhaps give \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-22t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/a\u003E a try.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T13:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48342-How-to-warp-into-Eve-Gravity-Influence-in-the-correct-angle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48342-How-to-warp-into-Eve-Gravity-Influence-in-the-correct-angle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the way...the raw way.
