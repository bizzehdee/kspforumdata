It\u0027s also the reason I switched to using .png files instead of .mbm\u0027s in the original pack That being said, I am always trying to learn and improved. I appreciate this and any other tips you may have\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E What about a compromise? Have a single shared texture for each resource type? Otherwise, if a custom texture is desired, can\u0027t the person making it just change the texture path in the configs? Potentially, you could go another step and use multiple model nodes to construct the tanks. Have four separate models that get re-used to build all the tanks: A half-sphere, a band, a cap, and a stripe. Then, you just position and re-scale them as needed to make the desired tank. All the caps can share a single smaller texture, the bands can share a texture, the tanks can share a texture, and have a texture for each color of stripe. Doing it this way, custom textures can be very small. If they only want to change the color of the band, then all that is required is a new band texture which could be as small as 2x2 pixels if it\u0027s a solid color. If you want stripes on your stripes could be a 2x16 or 32 or whatever, depending on how many stripes are desired. Maybe even less, depending on how Unity handles UV coordinates outside 0-1. If it tiles the image for out-of-bounds UVs you could get away with 2x2 and just paint one side a different color. Other combinations such as spherical tanks with only one cap become trivial to create with negligible memory impact. This could be applied to the toroidal tanks as well, have a few different thicknesses of torus, a rod model, and a plate model. Making specialized toroidal tanks becomes as simple as choosing an appropriately proportional torus, setting it\u0027s scale, and putting the plate/rods on it in the config. The toroids could probably share the same textures as the tanks, and the plate model could even just be the center band model. All I know is unfortunately this pack is now too large for me to use. I\u0027m running right up against the limits of how much RAM KSP can use and 100 mb would push it right back into crash territory. If you break it apart and re-use texture that could easily drop down to about 10 mb. Break the models up and push texture re-use to it\u0027s limit and who knows, maybe it could fit in less than 5 mb.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-03T00:33:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2013 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Rybec\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T13:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Talisar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Talisar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added tanks containing Metal, Ore, and RocketParts for EPL Mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I can remove the configs from EL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T14:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022taniwha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022taniwha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess I can remove the configs from EL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also should point out that I ripped the resource amounts and configurations directly from your EL config for the old set.
