Your best bet is to grab a mod like Kerbal Engineer Redux that shows you range (DeltaV) and load up the weight on top until it\u0027s the minimum figure that\u0027ll do the job in hand (around 4600/4700m/s DeltaV to get to a low orbit from KSC).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T22:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a fundamental problem with rockets: they need to lift their own fuel.

But, the propellant weighs something as well, so you need more propellant to lift that propellant. Then, that additional propellant weighs something, so you need more...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, you\u0027re saved from an infinite loop in that the rocket gets lighter as you burn fuel and shed stages, and air resistance decreases as the atmosphere gets thinner.

A result greater than one means you can lift it; less than one means you\u0027re not going anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you\u0027re asking \u0022can this rocket get my payload into Kerbin orbit\u0022, that\u0027s a tricky question; it\u0027s dependent on a lot of different factors, including the specific impulse values of your engines, the amount of delta-v you want your rocket to have in aggregate, the amount of thrust you want to be able to generate, and the mass of everything. The best way to test it is to take the delta-v you want, divide it by the specific impulse of your engine, divide that by 9.81 and take the inverse natural logarithm of that result; you wind up with the ratio of wet mass to dry mass. For example, if you\u0027re using Toroidal aerospikes (388 Isp) to acheive Kerbin orbit (4500 m/s delta-V), the mass ratio you want is 3.26 (4500/388 = 11.579/9.81 = e^1.82 = 3.26). As long as you can keep the ratio above that amount, you should have sufficient delta-V to reach orbit (but be sure you still have a TWR over 1!!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
