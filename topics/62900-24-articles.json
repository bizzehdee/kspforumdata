It could also be considered Release Candidate 1 (RC1). This version is released for bug testing, and assuming that goes well, the next release will be the official version 1.0! Little to nothing should change between this and 1.0, so now would be a great time to start work on mod spotlights or similar things if you were planning on doing that (basically, record footage now but you can wait until release day to release it, kind of like what YouTubers on the experimental team do for new updates of KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew feature: Launchpad reconditioning. Enabled by default and can be disabled per savegame. When launching a rocket from the Launch Pad (but not the runway) you cannot launch another one until reconditioning is complete. By default, with totally default settings, it takes 24 hours per 25 tons of rocket (at a total VAB build rate of 1 BP/s). The rate is also affected by the Overall Multiplier in the Time Settings and the time per ton can be modified in the Time Settings. As you upgrade the VAB, the amount of time that reconditioning takes decreases. Instead of relying on only one build rate, however, all the build rates are combined to determine the total build rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 1: You have one VAB rate at 1.5 BP/s. The rate that reconditioning occurs is then 1.5 BP/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 2: You have two VAB rates, one at 1.5 BP/s and the other at 0.5 BP/s.

After removing the old folder and replacing it, and loading my career game, suddenly i was having non-stop camera issues (lock-up, unable to click buildings at the Space Center). Also once in the VAB, instead of a view of the launchpad, I got a view of the top of a series of buildings, creeping into the VAB itself, Inception-style. Also, a few times after simulations or flights, the camera would get stuck somewhere inside Kerbin. Now I run many mods but these problems appeared only after updating, and I had to roll back to the previous version, and they all went away. I know this is not very helpful and I have a feeling it\u0027s interacting with some other mod, but so far I have been running 30\u002B mods together with no issues besides an occassional camera lock up that can be fixed by switching views (camera locks at space center).
