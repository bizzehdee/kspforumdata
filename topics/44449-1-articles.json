So a couple minutes later I arrive at Duna, I land, plant a flag, and plan my return mission. Using phase angles I get an almost instant encounter with Kerbin and the whole burn is not using to much delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I do the burn, and now I\u0027m on my way to Kerbin. I change my orbit a bit so I am around 37,000 meters above Kerbin, that way the planet\u0027s atmosphere will catch a hold of me and hopefully help me have a smooth landing. I enter the atmosphere at around 5000 M/S, and from there is when it all goes wrong. I was going to fast for how high I was up, so instead of Kerbin\u0027s gravity pulling me in, I just skimmed across the surface like a pebble skimming across water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately do to my own stupidity I saved at the wrong location, I had no boosters it was just the Pod. I think for a while and that\u0027s when it hits me. Whack a Kerbal! I open up Whack A Kerbal and begin experimenting, a minute or two later I found a good setting that didn\u0027t cause spontaneous explosions. I turned my ship back side up and fired right at the middle. When I checked my map it said I was instead of 37 Meters up I was 23 meters up. Whack A Kerbal saved me! I then proceeded to land safetly and recover the poor traumatized Kerbins from the ocean. And Jeb was smiling the entire way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T07:00:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by irichey25\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T04:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds crazy.

My Duna returns usually have me going about 3500 when I start hitting the atmosphere. Also, if you skim through the atmosphere and come out that usually doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re doomed - it just means you have to do another orbit before you come back and re-enter again. Unless you were *still* going fast enough to be on an escape trajectory, which sounds REALLY unlikely if you got as low as 27 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T06:57:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T06:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no way you passed within 37 meters without deorbiting LONG before you got that low.
