I\u0027m not a .net dev so if I\u0027m making a total noob mistake please inform me.\n\nI use LinuxTrack for head tracking in other games on Linux. This usually works via piping linuxtrack to a virtual joystick device (usually /dev/uinput) which I can then select as the head tracking input in most games.\n\nI was looking at various .net libraries to pick up on joystick input and the only universal one that works on all OSes is OpenTK which I\u0027ve downloaded and compiled. I\u0027ve added a class to use the OpenTK framework but getting this error when trying to switch kerbtrack to it : \n\n    KerbTrack: Using OpenTKTrack(Filename: /home/builduser/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/LinuxStandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)TypeLoadException: Could not load type \u0027OpenTK.Platform.Factory\u0027 from assembly \u0027OpenTK, Version=1.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=bad199fe84eb3df4\u0027.Rethrow as TypeInitializationException: An exception was thrown by the type initializer for OpenTK.Input.Joystick  at OpenTKTrack..ctor () [0x00000] in :0   at KerbTrack.ChangeTracker (Trackers t) [0x00000] in :0 (Filename:  Line: 4294967295)\n\nI\u0027ve compiled both OpenTK and KerbTrack in x86 and .net 3.5\n\nMy forked KerbTrack\u0027s last commit is [here](https://github.com/aidygus/KerbTrack/commit/97f4aded14b54ddd9a0d32fec65fcdc4de4313cf)\n\nAlternatively if there\u0027s an easier way of doing this then I\u0027d be happy to look into that. Currently I have a work around going by assigning the Linuxtrack device to the Camera Horizontal and Vertical primary in settings -\u003E Input -\u003E Game but the input is relative so is there a way of altering this into an absolute value? That would allow proper head tracking."},{"CreatedByName":"xman1","CreatedById":119778,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-11T21:42:49Z","Content":"How do you use Linuxtrack as a virtual joystick?"},{"CreatedByName":"xman1","CreatedById":119778,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-11T22:03:25Z","Content":"Figured it out:\n\n    ltr_pipe --output-file=/dev/uinput --format-uinput-abs"}]}
