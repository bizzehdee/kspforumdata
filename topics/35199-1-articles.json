Getting into a proper orbit, and then especially the Munar injection, are much harder without the map view. I had to do those parts a couple times normally, and write down the exact steps: At 10km, pitch to 40. At staging, pitch to 20. Cut throttle at 2030m/s. Coast to apoapsis. Burn to 2260m/s. Wait for Mun target marker to be at 30 below horizon. Burn prograde to 3090m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is easy though. Just build your lander with a really wide stance so it won\u0027t tip over if you happen to land on a slope, and watch the radar altimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T00:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley practiced and timed everything.

I tried a landing approach that I\u0027ve never practiced before, which got messed up within 30 seconds of the burn, but oh well lol.
