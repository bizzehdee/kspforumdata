The original Alien is amazingly scary. It\u0027s not in your face scary, it\u0027s this slow buildup that gives your mind time to settle in on the horrible things that are about to happen. The fear the movie creates goes past the current trend of \u0027make a sudden loud noise, flash the creature on the screen for half a second, and then cut the camera away\u0027 trick. Of course, they use that trick in Alien too, but it\u0027s not every scene. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also go with Event Horizon as a good choice. Great story, great characters and great effects all add to the scary story part. Pandorum, honestly, sucked. It had a great story with a ton of potential and then they just killed it with too much of the \u0027loud noise, camera shift\u0027 crap. It does provide a few memorable moments though. \u0027Is this guy going to help them, or kill them and eat them.\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to add the 1982 version of The Thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the original movie was creepy, the remake turned the creature into something that can imitate anyone or anything. Suddenly you don\u0027t know who is a good guy, and who is a shape shifting alien that wants to kill everyone. The scene where the one guy\u0027s head just grows some spider legs and walks off out of the room creeped me the hell out for a long time. There is also the isolation factor, which is probably why I also think Alien and Event Horizon are good too. I like when the characters are cut off and you know they either have to figure it out or die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Ju-on is pretty good too.
