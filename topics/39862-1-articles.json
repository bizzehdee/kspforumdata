Weight wise, they are roughly even. The mainsail clocks in at 6t while the 4 engines plus quad coupler weighs approx 5.5t. This was using the LT-30 engines, the non-thrust-vectoring types. They are lighter, yet more powerful. However, 4 of them still don\u0027t equal the power of a single mainsail. If you reconfigure this ship to put a 4-cluster opposite of a single Mainsail, the Mainsail will out power the cluster, causing the rocket to cartwheel and crash. Very simple to test yourself, if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel savings using a 4-cluster is significant.
