Sometimes when going on EVA, a Kerbal is automatically oriented in such a way as to be perpendicular to ladders/hatches, and it can be very difficult to try to orient it correctly in order to grab said ladders/hatches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence, as discussed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93503-Rotate-a-kerbal-Pitch-Rotation-on-EVA/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, it would be nice to have a \u0022free\u0022 EVA mode, where a Kerbal does not have a preferred frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are at least 2 approaches:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Use the camera view as the preferred frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, when pressing \u0026lt;space\u0026gt; or maneuvering, the Kerbal is oriented to face \u0022forward\u0022 and \u0022up\u0022 as per the current camera view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No preferred frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a mode similar to ship controls during staging where it\u0027s possible to rotate a ship any which way, as well as use RCS (if fitted) to translate. In this mode, pressing \u0026lt;space\u0026gt; would do nothing as there is no preferred orientation for the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption (1) is probably the most natural for people used to the way EVA works currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption (2) is possibly more natural for people used to docking craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T10:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two major modes in which you need to navigate Kerbals - floating in space, and walking on planet surface.
