Namely, it needs to refuel after the first launch and every trip in LKO by two rockets. Then, refuel in Duna surface for launch all the way to LKO (although some refueling might be needed in LDO). The duna refueling station will have all propellant already made and two Duna SSTO tankers\u00A0by the time the Transporter arrives, so it\u0027s a pit stop really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I need help with the trajectory. How do I set up a trajectory that enables me to make a short stop and continue to meet Kerbin? I was thinking about launching it with an apoapsis a little over Duna\u0027s orbit, in order to intercept on the way up (from Kerbol), land refuel, launch, and return. But I\u0027m having trouble with the return window. I don\u0027t want to have the Transporter waiting on Duna surface, as there will be a station there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have ideas? I will post a photo of all the transporter and\u00A0infrastructure as soon as everything is ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T20:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort version, there is no such thing.

Might be what you are looking for. Orbit swings outside Duna about 20 percent, and you have to boost ships up to meet it. Not efficient for fuel, but good for life support.
