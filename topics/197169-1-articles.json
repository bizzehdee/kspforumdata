I also like to set up comms arrays in a similar manner. Doing this always requires me to build multiple craft and merge them and in KSP 1 this is handled in a very sloppy manner. You can only attach the craft via their root parts for example which often leads me to frustration, especially when the part im selecting for some reason cant become a root.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in short this is a feature I really can\u0027t wait to use.

Not from a usability standpoint, but from a structural/computer code POV. One of the reasons KSP craft at times felt so strict was they\u0027re stored as tree structures, which while limiting in some ways is one of the faster data structures out there. And it has another advantage as well, since the \u0022Tree\u0022 contains all the information needed to lookup and \u0022Rebuild\u0022 the craft in any other KSP install it makes sharing them easy and storage requirements for the files relatively light (Some forms of data compression rely heavily on trees).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf i remember from previous discussion, there\u0027s ways to keep the tree structure and allow multiple \u0022Parents\u0022 for lack of a better word.

So i heavily doubt any of the delay was to expand the scope of the game or implement \u0022Suggestions\u0022, and personally it doesn\u0027t resemble anything good looking back at other development cycles. And mind you; star.theory did try to bargain. And when they did; 2K laughed them out of the room and pulled out of their arrangement while also sending offers to the existing staff to join the new \u0022Intercept games\u0022.

And 2K used their position to force them back on the rails rather than let the work done and money spent go to waste.
