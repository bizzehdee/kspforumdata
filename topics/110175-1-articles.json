Nuclear tug with a refinery and drills, you could probably accomplish it and still get a nice payout.

Messenger used such a strategy, it made several Venus and Mercury flybys to lose orbital energy before it was inserted to orbit. I think that it saved more than 10 kilometers per second.

The visual size won\u0027t change, nor will the class for the contract.\n\nMine it down to a nice small mass, like 10 tonnes or so. Then you can easily take it wherever you want.
