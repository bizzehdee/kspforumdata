Along similar lines, if the parent part is over-occluded (1.25m root part with a 2.5m nosecone), will the root part\u0027s occlusion remain 100% up to the 2.5m area?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if the parent part is a wing, my understanding is that wings don\u0027t use drag boxes (InternalDragModel = True).

Occlusion is probably calculated by the drag area in the part database file rather than that value combined with semi-physics parts.
