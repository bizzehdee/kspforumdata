Landing still takes me multiple tries on occasion, so any hints could be very valuable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cnwWsNN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cnwWsNN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I have yet to figure out how to use these numbers effectively. (Thanks to BetterBurnTime, I now have numbers I \u003Cstrong\u003Edo\u003C/strong\u003E understand, so the below is less pressing, but I might still learn something.) Just in case my problem is conceptual: My understanding\u00A0of a suicide burn is that you get into a trajectory that intersects the surface of a body with no atmosphere, and then you wait as long as possible to start burning, with the goal that at the exact moment\u00A0you finish, you have 0 velocity and 0 terrain altitude. It\u0027s supposed to be difficult but also the most efficient way to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think the thing we\u0027re trying to determine is, \u0022When should I start my suicide burn?\u0022 Or at least, \u0022How long should that burn be?\u0022\u00A0But I can\u0027t figure how to decide\u00A0that based on these numbers. For starters, they \u003Cem\u003Echange\u003C/em\u003E; above is early in a suborbital hop on Minmus, below is later at apoapsis:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DVOvyDO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DVOvyDO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo thrust was applied in between these screenshots; it\u0027s the same trajectory, just with the lander at a different point along it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think the (Alt.) value would tell me at which altitude I should start my suicide burn. But it increased by about 300 meters while I was just coasting, so it must mean something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Dist.) sounds like it might be how far the craft currently is from the point where the burn should start, but that can\u0027t be right, because we should be \u003Cem\u003Ecloser\u003C/em\u003E to that point in the second screenshot, not farther away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(dV) I would expect to be the magnitude of the needed burn. But again, this increased while the burn needed to stop should have remained constant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve attempted to use these interpretations to land\u00A0and crashed every time.\u00A0I also looked for wiki pages or previous discussions about this and didn\u0027t find any.\u00A0Can anyone please explain what these values mean and how to use them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T21:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I see I would say that to land you start your burn at \u0022Suicide Burn (Alt.)\u0022 and you will travel for \u0022Suicide Burn (Dist)\u0022 while you lower your vertical and lateral speed.
