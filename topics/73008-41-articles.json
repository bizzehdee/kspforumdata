A typical landing descent for an aircraft to an airport is a 3 degree glide slope. In flight in KSP, a descent looks deceptively shallow in the external camera views. I\u0027d suggest navball hud and setting it so you have horizontal lines every ten degrees. (See previously linked video.) Also install the PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) mod so you have a visual indication of your glide slope position. (I think it defaults to 6 degrees, so you might have to tweak its config.) There\u0027s an HSI mod floating around too that gives you aircraft ILS markers for approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(As a parting shot: Typical flight for an SR-71 airframe\u003C/strong\u003E: Takeoff 170 KEAS; Low Level Flight with safe turning 250 to 300 KEAS; At Altitude Supersonic Cruise with long, slow [5 minutes \u002B] high mach turns, 300 to 365 KEAS; Landing ~200 KEAS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you missed the part where we\u0027re talking about an unpowered glider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwenty degree dive?
