This thing is super fun, and Ive spent 2 hours today just burning around on the Mun and jumping over the little hills and getting huge air! So far it hasnt exploded, its extremely durable! The fastest I\u0027ve gotten with it is 65 m/s, and that was when I just burned down the slope of a massive crater. (the biggest one on the moon I believe) It was so scary, it was wobbling and shaking like mad! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s of my own design, and I\u0027d like to know how I can improve it, so I\u0027d love if you guys would post your own designs in here, and the landers for them (thats the hardest part to me) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I need some help when landing, how do I control where I land? I want to land on my Mun base, but I\u0027ve somehow managed to land on the opposite side of the mun base, so the pilot of my rover is most likely never going to see another soul again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPic of the front of my rover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/kaha2c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kaha2c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T07:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting good at landings is mostly a matter of practice, really.
