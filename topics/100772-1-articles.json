The staging controller is old and deprecated and they really need to burn it down because there\u0027s no salvaging it.

(RealChutes may mod this.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve am aware that you can deploy parachutes using Action Groups and activate them after repacking as many times as you repack them but, in career mode action groups are limited to none, basic, and full for each of the three VAB upgrade levels, respectively. Yet parachutes are a 0 level technology and require level 1 engineers to repack. So maybe this is a broken feature that was intended but (AFAIK) has never worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is further complicated by the fact that the icons for parachutes gets reset after a repack and reload of a vessel. The icons are (IIRC):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhite - packed ready for staging\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyan - staged but not deployed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYellow - semi-deployed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreen - deployed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed - unpacked\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you repack a unpacked parachute, red icon, it turns into a green icon, deployed, but it is in fact packed ready for staging. However if you\u0027ve returned to the KSC and go back to the vessel you\u0027ll find that you have a white icon (which is correct) but if you move it to a new or un-staged stage you cannot deploy it using staging. (@Devs fix this pretty please.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had another thought on this after reading the previous posts: When you accept a contract to test an engine under specific conditions if you miss the conditions can\u0027t re-stage the engine activation after manual deactivation (or action group shutdown) and then perform the staging test -- you either have to revert the flight to launch and try again or launch another attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in summary staging need a overhaul SQUAD \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
