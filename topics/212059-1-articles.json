Before starting however, I would like to apologize in advance for all the negativity that is about to follow. I am going to explain why I think KSP 2 might not be as good as a lot of us would want it to be, but I\u0027m doing that hoping that one of you or perhaps even someone from the dev team will reply and address all of my concerns and reassure me about how great the game is actually going to be. I am not doing this with the hope that I can expose this game as a fraud, get the dev studio closed and all the personnel executed. I wish KSP 2 will be successful even if the game disappoints me personally, I know the devs are passionate and I know that none of us, no matter how fond of KSP 1 we might be, are actually entitled to a good second game. This is not a KSP 2 hate thread, please refrain from using bad words.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, let\u0027s get into it. I have been following the dev diaries and all things related to KSP 2 development very closely basically since it was announced in back 2020.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack then, the game was being developed by an indie studio called Star Theory (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Theory_Games\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWikipedia\u003C/a\u003E). A certain Nate Simpson made the announcement and everyone got very excited. The game was going to allow for huge futuristic ships that could be built in orbit, and would travel to distant worlds, even as far as other stars, to establish new colonies for kerbalkind and visit those that your friends already built in multiplayer mode. And as a cherry on top, modding support would be even better than in KSP 1.\u00A0 Hearing that, it\u0027s not hard to see why everyone jumped aboard the hype train. And the studio showed great engagement with the community by inviting the main KSP 1 content creators to take a look at the new game, and I remember the first impressions of these content creators being very positive. There was one thing though, that seemed a bit baffling to many, including myself : the release date of \u0022late 2020\u0022. End of year, really? A game that big, that complex? Surely it had to be well on its way by then, right? Well, we don\u0027t know. The first trailer was not actual gameplay footage and there was none to show at the time, so that seemed a bit ambitious... But who cares, it\u0027ll probably get delayed and then what, that\u0027s not the end of the world, so fans of KSP 1 had basically no reason not to get aboard that hype train. And apparently even the game publisher, Private Division (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Division\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWikipedia\u003C/a\u003E) got on board big time. This is a bit of a hot topic and I don\u0027t want to discuss moral issues here, you can read more about what happened elsewhere on the internet. But from a purely technical perspective, let\u0027s just say that there was a studio and partial team change, from Star Theory to Intercept Games, with some of the initial devs transferring along with the project. And in the middle of all that, suddenly Covid decided that there was too much fun and happiness in this world, so that certainly didn\u0027t help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest is basically conjecture and educated guesses because we don\u0027t really know what happens behind closed doors. Basically there are two things that I\u0027m concerned about : the game has been delayed multiple times and we\u0027ve seen very little actual gameplay footage even one week away from early access.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know many of you will disagree with that second statement because the devs have been doing a fair amount of communication, giving us exciting dev diaries and other videos on YouTube. But very little of that content has shown actual progress being made on the game (I\u0027m not saying none, just very little considering it\u0027s been 3 years).\u00A0 It\u0027s mostly just what I\u0027d call wishfull thinking, devs saying we\u0027re going to have this and that and we want interstellar travel to feel long and dark and we want tutorials to be easy and intuitive and we want planets to be realistic and so on and so on... Very little \u0022We have that, look, it\u0027s cool\u0022. There is \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Eof that, we heard the cool sounds of rocket engines, saw some of the engine plumes and explosions being worked on, a couple colony parts and futuristic engines, but that\u0027s it. And when you think about it, these are just assets. Just bits and bobs that make the game look and sound cool but we have seen no gameplay mechanic. The only clue on what actual gameplay might be like is a glance at the new UI which admittedly does look good and functional. I\u0027ll say a little more about the gameplay footage later but first let\u0027s talk about the delays, because that ties into it. If I recall correctly the game was very rapidly delayed from \u0022late 2020\u0022 to fiscal year 2020. Basically as a studio you can delay the game and the publisher is still happy if it\u0027s in the same fiscal year because they can still put it in their results for that year and that makes investors happy (that\u0027s of course a very crude sum up).\u00A0 But then it wasn\u0027t ready, no project in the entire world at that time was on schedule mainly thanks to Covid. So it got delayed again. And again. Untill it was delayed to 2022 and then finally to February 2023. Why that looks bad to me is because this is a month before the end of fiscal year 2023 for Private Division (which is based in New York State) and therefore maybe a deadline set by the publisher. Basically they had to say \u0027hey guys we need to release your game before then even if it\u0027s not finished because the company needs to be profitable otherwise it will die and there will be no game at all\u0027. Not blaming anyone here this is just the harsh reality of capitalism. Again, this is conjecture, I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E that. And of course I\u0027m dramatizing, they have other games and the company probably wouldn\u0027t die. So maybe this is all a coincidence, but I\u0027m just saying, it sure looks like a profitable coincidence for Private Division.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s indulge in even more conjecture and try to imagine what happened when that hypothetical deadline was announced to the dev team. Remember that in game footage that we\u0027ve seen? Well it had one very important characteristic that I haven\u0027t talked about yet. It looked a lot like it ran at a very low framerate and with copious amounts of stuttering. Not really something you can ship to customers. Well then, what do you do if you\u0027re a dev? You strip the game bare for early access : remove all the extra planets and star systems you were working on, remove the large scale colony and interstellar parts, scrap the actual gameplay mechanics like orbital construction and colonization, tone down post processing to a minimum and don\u0027t even think about multiplayer for now, it\u0027ll be easy to add on top of all the rest later (haha).\u00A0 Reassure the player base, tell them not to worry, all the gameplay footage they\u0027ve seen so far is months old and the game is in a much better state now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if that is truly the case, why don\u0027t they release more recent footage? We\u0027re a week away from launch, are they going to tell us that the game is not ready to be shown right now but it\u0027ll be playable in 8 days?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah that sounds kinda sus to me. But you might say hey, they never said that the game will be good or even playable in a week, it\u0027s just an early access. The devs have already addressed all of our concerns regarding what will be in the game by releasing a magnificently illustrated roadmap with happy little Kerbals on it. But no dates.\u003Cem\u003E How\u003C/em\u003E is that more than just wishful thinking intermingled with marketing bull c***? No dates, no comittment. We\u0027ve gone from \u003Cem\u003Efull game\u003C/em\u003E release in late 2020 to early access in 2023 with \u003Cem\u003Enone \u003C/em\u003Eof\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ethe features that were promised in 2020 \u003Cspan\u003E: No interstellar travel or even big interstellar capable ships, no colonies, no resource gathering, no orbital construction, no multiplayer, and they even removed science and progression that game one had. But don\u0027t worry, the devs said on their roadmap that we will be adding all of that back into the game at one point eventually in the future probably. Except for modding support, I don\u0027t think the devs have mentioned\u00A0that since 2020. Most players seem to think that this is such an obvious part of KSP\u0027s identity that they don\u0027t need to mention it but I think that if the game did have extensive modding support they would at least try to use it as a marketing point. And also, I know, they did apparently deliver on one promise: better tutorials (but I\u0027m worried people might not properly revere He Who Knows aka Scott Manley which would be bad for humanity as a whole).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 Seriously though, I think it\u0027s a very good thing if good, engaging tutorials are present, and something that was severely lacking in KSP 1. But it\u0027s mostly pre-recorded animations and nothing to do with actual gameplay so not really an encouraging sign regarding the technical state of the game.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBasically if the dev team took 3 years to bring us none of the promised features, how long will it take them to bring us all or any of these promised features?\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnyways, I hope I\u0027m wrong and delirious and that I just wasted an hour writing all that for nothing. I really wish KSP 2 will be better than I think it\u0027ll be and that it\u0027ll eventually have all the features we expected it to have. And regardless of whether\u00A0or not it is good I hope that it will be a commercial success and that the devs get rewarded for their efforts.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-16T17:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224232981\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212059\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676567179\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022170038\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lBoBl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, lBoBl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I hope I\u0027m wrong and delirious and that I just wasted an hour writing all that for nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s such thing as wishful thinking, yeah, but there\u0027s still such thing as unwishful thinking, fixating on any weird thing and drawing out-of-proportion conclusions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly, KSP 1 aged like milk. The parts list, one of my biggest peeves with the game outside broken gameplay, functions exactly the same as it did a decade ago. No mods fix it (Janitor\u0027s Closet\u0027s hacky solution of removing parts doesn\u0027t count), no-one at Squad has ever thought \u0022hey, do you think jumbling all the parts in a category into one big pile and sorting them by whatever random digits are in their names might contribute to low player retention?\u0022. Intercept is evidently taking their time to go through the mess Squad made of KSP 1 and make sure everything is built to standards, and even without the roadmap features, it\u0027s still going to be an experience lightyears beyond what mods do to hack KSP into a bigger game. I drawn the parts list as one example to show the improvements UX is seeing in KSP 2, but you can expect it to show in the rest of the game, especially when the roadmap sees progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Even without the roadmap features, UX is still worth the game\u0027s price. Expect to see the dev\u0027s care for the UX to also reflect everywhere else, like how fleshed out the parts list is and how physics handles edge cases like orbital-speed collisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-16T17:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine that.

Or you can rethink how the game works, and see how some of these things can be integrated. And as you\u0027re improving more and more, the parts that \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E improve start to stand out, so you need to rethink those over as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your project doesn\u0027t have precise defined milestones set out in the beginning, your timeline is never going to be met. And it looks to me that Intercept had the wisdom and courage to say, one year into the project: \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ewe\u0027re not so sure about the project goals, let\u0027s rehash them.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 That\u0027s going to cost a lot of time, and surely risk shutting down the entire project prematurely.
