At the base level, what we are talking about is not so much gravity or acceleration, but curvature. Each star within a galaxy or galaxy within a cluster is in free-fall. From perspective of differential geometry, it moves along the closest thing to a straight line in curved space-time - the geodesic. By watching these objects move we can plot out the geodesics and deduce the curvature. This is not how we actually compute these things, but it\u0027s easier to picture this way. So in effect, we are measuring curvature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where General Relativity comes in. We know how curvature corresponds to stress-energy density. The relation is given by Einstein Field Equation. We plug in our observations and obtain some sort of stress-energy distribution. It\u0027s a rank two tensor at every point. However, due to certain properties of GR, we can select a coordinate system, at least locally, that puts that tensor in diagonal form. Woot! So what do we get? We get two quantities. One that scales like energy and one that scales like pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts of energy and pressure density that we observe we can account for with luminous matter, which has both energy and pressure. However, majority of these, by far, is unaccounted for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is where things turn for the confusing, for you see, the Dark Energy is the unaccounted for portion of the pressure term. And Dark Matter is unaccounted for portion of the energy term, because this is the E = mc\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETyson is absolutely correct in pointing out that we don\u0027t really know that Dark Matter is some sort of a particle. And really, the \u0022Matter\u0022 here is just to indicate that it corresponds to the same part of stress-energy as normal matter does. Whereas Dark Energy corresponds to the part that you don\u0027t usually associate with matter. Not in these sort of quantities. Is the naming confusing? Yeah. I suppose, Dark Stress-Energy would have been better, but it\u0027s a mouthful. But I also don\u0027t like the idea of calling Dark Matter portion the Dark Gravity. It really doesn\u0027t reduce the confusion, since both attraction and repulsion are part of gravity here. Even though repulsion is not something we usually associate with classical gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, people who work in relevant fields are used to this, and people who don\u0027t will probably be confused regardless.

Agree 100% with the matter equivilant aspect. However what you said about the pressure tensor does not jive with the paper i presented yesteday. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are either two things happening, Dark Energy is very weak acting between particles in our galaxy, or Einstien was correct in his assessment of a pressure constant, but the pressure only applies to mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving thought about this a bit, if there is a pressure constant that is independent of local energy density (mass if you are stuck on a planet), and it would appear that dark energy is more powerful than Einstiens constant, Then there is a local problem. The vector is supposed to be in th meV range, which means it has a field intensity that we can measure. If that is true, and I start assembling lead balls in space the attraction to those balls And i carefully measure th mass going into the balls then when I start measuring attractions, the calculated G should be smaller for small objects but quickly plateau at the observed constant as ball size increased, because DEF would be proportionally smaller compared to mu, if the constant was space-time dependent. The problem is that the latest gravity experiments show a fluctuation in G, but its in the 10-6/-7 range, much smaller than it should be to explain Dark energy. The latest experiment shows no deviation in acceleration down to the um/sec2 range with an attractive differential. So dark energy is spreading things apart only in a mass dependent manner, with no dependency on space at all, a mass-time dependency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that the cosmological constant cannot be constant across space-time because mass is not consistent across space-time. Therefore it would appear that the press release (key word being appear) that dark energy is either not acting between particles in our galaxy, but between galaxies or inserting my alternative, interacting only with mass-time but in fact appears to be inflating space time, lol. The other possibilty is that dark energy preferentially interacts with dark energy tensor, and matter is reflected in its gravitation interaction with the energy tensor. This creates another set of problems in galactic shape distortions and in particular favors dark energy tensor accelerating away from mass to the edge of the inflaton. The only way that doesnt happen is if the tensor is a field that travels at Close to C, dumping small bits of momentum to small particles it passes until it returns to the rest state. Also not supportable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus it would appear that dark energy remains elusive, but I don\u0027t see how we can assess the pressure tensor in our galaxy and distinguish it from G if dark energy is acting on mass-time dependency, it would be the same as saying 5 billion years ago G was much higher and suddenly fell, which entirely changes what a type 1a supernova is. So I have to bias that it is not acting between matter in our galaxy, it can only spread vacuum space, its inflation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T00:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue of threads was brought up here.

Dark matter must either be uniformly distributed as a yet undetected field, or be predominantly found far from stars. (Hence the whole WIMP or MACHO thing.) Anything else would be reasonably easy to detect. Even if Sol was somehow unique, we would have seen clumps of dark matter near other stars during our exoplanet search efforts. Although, this does remind me of that \u0022Alien Megastructures\u0022 thread. If MACHO hypothesis is valid, we might simply be looking at an exception to the rule, where the huge amount of non-luminous matter is located close to the host star rather than far from it. A close pass of another star could have caused this if there was enough debris orbiting the star to begin with at great distance. For all we know, that\u0027s all there is to it. Of course, it\u0027s still puzzling that we are having trouble detecting it. Could Sol be \u0022special\u0022 anyways? Could something have stripped majority of our halo mass, making us make such incorrect predictions about other star systems?

We can\u0027t build and launch a mirror of sufficiently large diameter to make a dramatic difference against Hubble, and for an interferometer, even with a solid frame and microgravity, you\u0027ll need optical tracking and adjustment that can work just as well in LEO. The only thing Saturn\u0027s distance gives you is reduction of sunlight, but you can get that in L2 just as easily and for way less. L2 interferometers have been proposed and even briefly planned. Then budget got cut. Go thank your senator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s kind of a moot point. An interferometer would allow us to take an actual look at exoplanets. Perhaps even do spectrography to detect atmospheric gases. Finding a more Earth-like exoplanet would be interesting. Finding one with gaseous oxygen lines in its spectrum, that would be the biggest discovery mankind has ever made bar none.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking for Oort cloud objects, though? Not that helpful. If MACHO holds, the dominant objects in the cloud would be large enough for Hubble to find. You just have to point it at one. And having a bigger telescope with better sensitivity and resolution won\u0027t make it easier. Just the opposite. A 1ly sphere around the Sun has surface area of well over 10ly\u00B2. Our Sun is about 5 light seconds across. Plastered across that 1ly sphere, you could fit approximately 550,000,000,000,000 Suns.

Spotting these objects by direct observation is statistically impossible. What we can do, and what we are looking for, are indirect indications of these objects there. If there is that much junk out there, and if there are just a few massive enough bodies floating about, they are going to knock things loose. And we should be seeing these things come visit. And we do. But we aren\u0027t seeing quantities or sizes we expect. Of course, our expectations are based on a lot of assumptions. There might not be any large objects out there. Just a ton of little ones. That would be very strange and indicate very serious flaw in our understanding of Sol\u0027s formation. Or there could be one really big object, which managed to clear out a chunk of the cloud already and get rid of any competition. That\u0027s completely plausible, but that\u0027s the sort of thing we should be able to find from periods of comets, etc. People are trying with no success so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are looking. We are finding zilch. We can\u0027t really be looking any harder with tech we have, and probably won\u0027t be able to even with tech we can invision. Though, an interferometer might help us detect such a heavy cloud around other stars. These things are easier to see from without than from within.
