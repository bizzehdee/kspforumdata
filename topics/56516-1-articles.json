KerbalKon has come and gone, and with it the announcements that set the KSP forums ablaze. I have absolutely no desire to reignite the flames and cause people to start arguing again, so if you\u0027re here to shout about why resource gathering does or does not deserve to be in the game please turn your attention elsewhere. For anybody who wants to throw the \u0022do not suggest\u0022 list in my face, let me make abundantly clear that \u003Cem\u003Ethis is not a suggestion to add resources into the game\u003C/em\u003E. What I am hoping to do here is to bring the community together, to see if we as a group can hammer out some of the issues plaguing resource gathering as it has been discussed so far. I want this to be a constructive space, so again if you\u0027re just going to start conflict about whether or not resource mining is good or bad, please go elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay... Now that that lengthy disclaimer is out of the way let\u0027s talk some shop. Feel free to expand on what I have to say, and provide constructive input as necessary. I am one man and probably will not be able to hit every talking point that I intend to, so back me up. Anyway, I think we can all agree that the main reason resource mining has been tabled for now is because, to date, the devs do not feel they have been able to shape the mechanic in a way that is organic and fun. To me, I think the real problem is that in order for the mechanic to feel worthwhile it must be integrated well with existing mechanics and should not exist to serve itself (i.e. mining things for the sake of mining things). That said, if the mechanic becomes a rube-goldberg-esque network of relations with multiple pieces of equipment required to work to accomplish simple tasks... Well that\u0027s no good either!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was brainstorming ways in which resource mining could be implemented with some others in the [Official] KerbalKon Announcements thread in General Discussion, and with input with Regex came up with my own example / vision for how \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E would implement resources, if I were given the opportunity. This is not to say that my vision is perfect, and I honestly never attempted to make it perfect, but it does address some key flaws with the way in which it was outlined initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou pretty much start with Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil which you get directly from the drill. You have a second unit which breaks it down into constituent parts - Water, Liquid Fuel, and more Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil, in differing ratios depending on where you\u0027re mining it from. For example, if you\u0027re mining on an ice cap you get a higher ratio of Water to other stuff. If you\u0027re mining on Eve, you get a higher ratio of Liquid Fuel. If you\u0027re mining on the Munar Equator, you get a higher ratio of Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil. And hey, you know what? We don\u0027t really even need two separate units for this do we? So let\u0027s just get rid of the separator as its own unit and couple it with the drill, so instead of getting out soil from the ground it automatically splits it into these three things that you get in different ratios no matter where you are in the solar system!\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so after that you then have a second unit which can use electricity to compress/convert the base resource into other more useful resources. So for this example, you could put in Water, and for a certain amount of electricity get out Oxygen. Put in twice that amount of electricity and you get out Oxidizer. You use that *same unit* and pump in Liquid Fuel and you can similarly get out Monoprop or EVA prop, again depending on how much precious electricity you want to part with. What about Dirt? Well, it could be used as ballast, brought home for science, or simply dumped overboard because it\u0027s not as useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo units: Drill/Separator, and Converter. Each one takes a certain amount of electricity. Besides the two units needed for the actual mining, you\u0027d only really need to add a third part for storage, and let\u0027s say it\u0027s just one unit that can contain certain amounts of all three mineable resources. Also, notice that the \u0022resource map\u0022 I described only has three branches: Water -\u0026gt; Oxygen -\u0026gt; Oxidizer, Liquid Fuel -\u0026gt; Monopropellent -\u0026gt; EVA Propellent, and Dirt, which doesn\u0027t really do much of anything except possibly net you science points and allow you to fulfill contracts back home possibly. That hardly seems like a \u0022terrible spaghetti mess of resources\u0022 to me. In fact, it pretty much runs off the same principal as Kethane, but instead of discrete deposits that you need to locate you are using the built-in biome structure that \u003Cem\u003Ealready exists in the game\u003C/em\u003E. As long as you\u0027re able to run mining and converting out of focus, this would be a pretty streamlined way of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, I \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E came up with this on the spot. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not a perfect scheme, but if I can come up with this within five minutes of brainstorming I\u0027m sure I could fill any loopholes if I had the combined resources of Squad at my disposal. Don\u0027t you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came up with a resource map for this description, in which I strategically added a few things to highlight the possibilities this could create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree. What I\u0027m trying to do is help come up with something that might be appealing to the devs or modmakers as a potential solution. Something that isn\u0027t perfect, but might be developed into something that works. Isn\u0027t that the least that we as a community can do?\u003Cp\u003EAs for the solution I outlined in my last post, I came up with a graph of what I had in mind because I honestly have nothing better to do. I feel like something like this would contribute to gameplay without becoming the sole purpose of it, because everything you get out of it could help you in your overall mission, but isn\u0027t just the sole reason for being. What do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5tUpvPn.png\u0022 alt=\u00225tUpvPn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would tie in nicely with the \u0022gather surface sample\u0022 mechanic introduced in 0.22, since you could use your surface samples to predetermine what kind of breakdown you\u0027d get when you come back later to mine it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems I feel this would remedy is actually one of the most common complaints with the current implementation in the Kethane mod: the sheer amount of waiting you need to do while your satellites scan a body for resource deposits. Because my example method returns a ratio of resources based on the biome type, you can mine anywhere you want. Your level of success is determined by which type of biome you\u0027re mining in. For example, if you want fuel you should probably be mining somewhere on Eve with a fuel rich lithosphere; if you want water an ice cap would be your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the equipment you need does not have to be exclusively separate. For example, a single prob-sized part might combine the drill, separator, and converter into one unit so that you can produce a very limited amount of a single resource in preparation for the expansion of infrastructure. For example, if you\u0027re about to bring a base to Duna, perhaps you will want a tank of Oxygen there already waiting for you to get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther limits could perhaps be placed on the durability of the parts you are using. For example, as your unit drills down, the friction and motor all generate a heat load on your part. Currently you never have to worry about overheating unless you\u0027re launching a ship with mainsails attached directly to orange tanks, or flying 2 inches away from the Sun. Heat load could then be removed (somehow) through EVA, or by constructing heat radiators to remove excess heat. Now, heat radiators don\u0027t need to be their own part necessarily. AFAIK KSP already has a basic conduction model, so adding some large, flat surfaces might do. Of course, there is probably still a market for a stock heat radiator part. Especially once they start developing environmental mechanics for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis implementation would open the door to other interesting mechanics, without simply existing for the sake of existing. For example, there\u0027s no reason your rocket can\u0027t start out with enough life support \u0022stuff\u0022 for a return trip to Duna for example... But if you want to build a permanent base there, you\u0027re going to have to either set up resupply missions from Kerbin, or get out your mining equipment and start digging! In this way, mining is a requirement for complex or long-term stays on other worlds, but do not penalize the player who simply wants to go visit, take a few pictures, then come back again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I\u0027m expecting other ideas to come out. I\u0027d also like to see improvements made to my own. That\u0027s kind of the point of this discussion! I want to see where the community can take this concept, and perhaps if we get it far enough the devs will reconsider tabling it. At the very least, maybe we can make this an attractive proposition for a mod developer to start working on, and turn it into a useful alternative to Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI digress now, so please post your thoughts, opinions, and concerns. Do try to be constructive though! That\u0027s all I ask. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the double posting, but I had some new content to add in light of some feedback I\u0027ve gotten on this matter. Someone reminded me that a feature like this shouldn\u0027t be essential to gameplay. Well, I disagree somewhat (but not completely); there are some features you just can\u0027t avoid. AFAIK nobody has announced the cancellation of re-entry heat, yet once that\u0027s implemented having a heat shield attached to your craft will be as essential as parachutes, or thrusters. I do, however, think the best that anybody can do is limit the extent to which a feature is necessary. So, I\u0027ll expound: In the example I outlined above, I primarily linked resource mining with refueling and life support. Refueling anything has never been an essential feature in any context, so I\u0027ll focus on life support. Now, there are a couple proposals I would make to limit how required life support infrastructure is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost, I think that when a craft launches, there could be a certain amount of life support \u0022stuff\u0022 loaded on board. Just like how you can choose the number of crew at launch, you can select how much life support you want. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re just running a short mission to orbit and back. You don\u0027t need a whole lot of life support \u0022stuff.\u0022 If you\u0027re running an interplanetary operation, you\u0027d need a lot more of it. Now let\u0027s say the amount of life support \u0022stuff\u0022 you start off with has to be bought and paid for - that provides an incentive to use as little of it as possible at the get go. Therefore, if you can mine more life support \u0022stuff\u0022 when you get there, you can do that at a lower cost than it\u0027d take to simply pack a larger amount on your ship at the get-go! I\u0027ll take it a step further and say that in sandbox mode, let there be an option for unlimited life support, so you don\u0027t even have to worry about it at all! That way if you\u0027re in sandbox mode you can choose to run a mission where you need to manage life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, limiting the consequences of running out of life support. We all know KSP is a pretty family friendly game, and so watching kerbals starve or asphyxiate to death might have somewhat of a... well, traumatizing effect on the younger audience. So instead of killing them when life support runs out, what if they just passed out? Kerbals are resilient creatures! You can think of it as going into hybernation if you\u0027d like. That way, you can always run a rescue mission to come pick them up, deliver some oxygen, water, and snacks, and have them perk right up good as new! In this way, life support becomes very similar to electricity: Just as you need electricity to run unmanned resources, so do you need life support to run the manned ones. Players don\u0027t generally have a problem attaching more solar panels and batteries to their ships if they need to, so the same logic should apply to the things you need to keep your crew up and running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this way, mining as I have defined it above is \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely optional\u003C/em\u003E but still provides its own benefits and incentives.

The resources available would be different based on Biome, plus that that could be extracted from air (if any) on a body. IE, if you wanted to know what the mining prospects in Duna lowland soil was, send a probe to sample the lowlands. If you wanted to know what you could extract from Jool\u0027s atmosphere, send a flyby probe through the outer atmosphere to sample it. This ties in with the current science system fairly well and could be displayed at the top of each biome list in the \u0027Wernher\u0027 page in the research lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI second the thought that scale of components should vary considerably. Small probe units that encorporate drill and convertor, but only can extract one element (and presumably are less efficent and slower that larger units) would work well as an early (or mid) game imprementation. Later in the tech tree more efficient but larger systems become available that are more similar to what we\u0027ve seen in Kethane. A multi output convertor, individual mining units (or at least separate mining/air extractor/liquid filtration systems) and some sensor systems (or the system of sampling I mentioned above) would work quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is however another element you might want to add to your list. Metal. Yes, this is for any possible use of off world manufacturing but also might interface with SQUAD\u0027s proposed repair functionality. What if it wasn\u0027t merely duplicating the existing \u0027repair wheels\u0027 function, but could repair damaged components if materials were available? Connecting a craft via a docking port that contained the neccessary material then getting a Kerbal out to perform repairs could be quite useful, as long as the part needing repairing hasn\u0027t been entirely knocked off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this brings me to another possibility. Probably way outside the scope of this thread but I think I\u0027ll at least put it down here. KAS can already attach certain parts out \u0027in the field\u0027. What if this was more generic? Carry parts out to a damaged ship and replace them, or even \u0027make\u0027 certain smaller parts and have a Kerbal attach them similar to KAS. This leads to something that at first when I heard it (wasn\u0027t my idea originally!) I wasn\u0027t too keen on, but have since started to be interested in. Building complete vessels via a KAS-like system. Basically have some component or other that you can click that enables a VAB like interface off world. You could order components to be built at a location, just like in the VAB, but they\u0027d be \u0027ghosted\u0027. Then deploy Kerbals to build them remotely. A Kerbal would automatically pick up a part and attach it at a spot, perhaps taking time to weld it into place, then move onto the next component. I think any such construction should take time to complete, just as I think the current science system should ideally take a lot longer to do than it does at present. (or at least have some components that take a lot longer to do long term science as well as simple \u0027temp gauges\u0027 etc) This of course has problems when the ship being built is not in physics range. However it is at least possible as a system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis manufacturing/repair mechanism would need some kind of resource system to back it up and allowing for something similar, or just for EL or whatever equivalent SQUAD might come up with would be something to consider, especially if it is simplified to just one material.

Having multiple resources gathered such as the way KSPI does it seems more realistic to me, although honestly I\u0027d prefer something half way between. Something more similar to Kethane in style, but with multiple resources mined. I know this is where Kethane might already be heading.

Right now that\u0027s doable with two, or maybe three mods, or KSPI has sort of all three now, though a little unfinished. On land I personally would like small amounts of resources to be available anywhere, though able to be mined very slowly, but \u0027hotspots\u0027 only on certain biomes/planets/moons. That way, in a pinch, you could set up one base and if you were willing to wait a Loooong time you could have just that one base do anything. However for any efficiency you\u0027d need to spread out your mining operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vladthemad\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vladthemad\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s also a mod that adds propeller engines...not firespitters, but a different one.

I\u0027m pretty sure any part can be added to KAS as attachable, transportable in KAS containers, and carryable by a Kerbal. That functionality was added in case you wanted to add the small bits from other mods into the KAS system for Kerbals to manipulate. There\u0027s no limitation on size that I\u0027m aware of so you could add anything you wanted, athough Jeb walking around with a Mainsail on his back will stretch your disbelief, even if he\u0027s on Minimus! So if you added all the stock parts to the configs, you would actually be able to use parts from say...a crashed rocket, to rebuild something to get home in. Which honestly wouldn\u0027t be a bad way to go if you\u0027d like a really hardcore feel and can overlook the fact that Jeb has a rockomax tank strapped to his back or the fact that you had half a dozen Mainsail engines in a little container.

Try doing any radial symmetry by mounting stuff by hand! Plus you\u0027d need some of the helpers from the VAB for some systems, ie the centers of mass, thrust, and lift. Having a \u0027constructor unit\u0027 make the individual parts, shove them in KAS containers for shipping, or just bolting them on a ship temporarily for transport, then shipping them to an assembly site, then having a Kerbal assemble them via KAS would work (after editing it so any item can be attached via KAS). You don\u0027t even have to worry too much about the absurdity of a Kerbal strapping huge things to his back. You can right click on an object that is attached and find an \u0027attach button\u0027, enabling moving the object from point A to point B (if they\u0027re close enough) without strapping it on. I still think that if KAS style assembly is done it needs to be refined a bit, probably with some central control part to act as if it were the VAB to give you those extra controls/helpers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T10:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like where your going with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T13:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think resources being consistent throughout a biome sounds very fun.
