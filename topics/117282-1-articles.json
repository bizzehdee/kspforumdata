Why!","CreatedByName":"LordHelmchen324","CreatedById":149090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T22:52:06Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"LordHelmchen324","CreatedById":149090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T22:52:06Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nI recently landed an unmanned lander on Mun and now that I wanted to start sending scientific results back to Kerbin I realized that absolutely nothing on my lander is working. The lander is equipped with a battery and solar panels and by now on the sunny side of Mun. I did though land it on the dark side and then accelerated time until it was on the sunny side, so I had the electricity to work the sensors and antenna. I tried everything and googled for ages. Not a single function on my lander is available. The blue buttons in the context menus have all disappeared. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI have no mods installed.\n\nI really hope someone here can help me as this is becoming quite frustrating. Please tell me, if you need more information. Thanks a lot in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T23:25:33Z","Content":"you\u0027re probably still timewarping. double check you\u0027re in 1x speed"},{"CreatedByName":"LordHelmchen324","CreatedById":149090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T10:06:31Z","Content":"I think that was it.
