The lander is equipped with a battery and solar panels and by now on the sunny side of Mun. I did though land it on the dark side and then accelerated time until it was on the sunny side, so I had the electricity to work the sensors and antenna. I tried everything and googled for ages. Not a single function on my lander is available. The blue buttons in the context menus have all disappeared. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope someone here can help me as this is becoming quite frustrating.
