At low altitude or high speed, the deflection we have may be too high causing excessive G loadings, but we can\u0027t reduce it because at higher altitudes we need all of that deflection to keep the nose pointing forwards. Currently, the tools we have for this problem focus on changing input scale (fine control, FAR\u0027s dynamic control authority (DCA) helper, etc.) which isn\u0027t always what is needed.*\n\n*Dynamic Deflection approaches this from a different direction, altering the maximum deflection individual control surfaces can use according to the current dynamic pressure. This deflection scaling can be different for each set of control surfaces (so you can set ailerons to scale differently to elevators, etc.).*\n\n*NOTE: This fixes SAS wobble with much lower complexity than PID tuning and without permanently compromising control output*\n\n*NOTE2: To open the window, mouse over a control surface and press \u0027K\u0027*"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:18:42Z","Content":"Dynamic Deflection was the one, thank you very much!"}]}
