So a TWR\u0026gt;1 during the entire ascent would mitigate this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EBut\u003C/em\u003E higher TWR usually means less fuel, smaller payload fraction, and/or heavier engines - which means either less total dv and/or more massive rocket. So in the real world, many (most?) launch vehicles have upper stage TWR\u0026lt;1. And \u003Cem\u003Etoo much\u003C/em\u003E TWR also makes it difficult to pull off an optimal gravity turn, which is probably more important for overall efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think that was a typo--gravity losses and drag losses are what\u0027s being described.
