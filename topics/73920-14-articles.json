Please pay attention to the warning in the OP: the next update will break saves. Well, not really (hopefully, at least), what I mean is that from the next update each kerbal will have to be trained before he can repair stuff. If you upgrade from alpha 3, the kerbals that are already in flight might not have the perks you need should a failure arise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore details coming soon\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible save breaks scare me. :-P I just want to make sure I understand what you\u0027re saying. It isn\u0027t so much that anything in the save will stop working, it\u0027s just that trained Kerbals wont be available until, well until they\u0027re trained. So after the update, it would just be a matter of training new Kerbals with the required skills and having them replace the current Kerbals in the field, who can then return to Kerbin and be trained themselves?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a different note, WOW! I love this idea. I currently categorize my Kerbals in different \u0027fields,\u0027 but in-game the only difference is the color of their space suit. So this would make it meaningful!! Which leads to another question, which I shouldn\u0027t ask because you said more details will be coming, but I rarely do what I\u0027m suppose to, so... if a current Kerbal gets a random skill that doesn\u0027t fit my current role for him/her, is it something I can change in the .cfg or within the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
