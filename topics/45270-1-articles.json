Then, when the stage leaves physics range, it can be deleted, as long as it is under 20km, as per usual, only to be recoverable from the tracking station x seconds after it is ejected, x being the previously calculated time to impact, provided it was able to survive. In this way, reusable/expensive components would not have to be scrapped because they are not part of the upper (focus) stage, reducing the cost of launches, and making stages less expendable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T04:50:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFairly certain that this is planned.

Like if you parachute your stages to a gentle landing you can recover some of their cost. But the problem is that right now if you are low in atmosphere and a stage gets more than 2.2 km from your ship, the game stops tracking it using full physics. That makes parachuting it not really work. Also, at the moment it just deletes the debris entirely if it\u0027s in low atmosphere, but even if it stopped doing that there\u0027s the fact that parachutes don\u0027t work on rails.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T20:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last post point out the biggest problem.
