I\u0027m building a station with DOS parts, first part is a DOS \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E unit with a 2.5m hub on one end and a separate (so I could have the probe core inline without losing a docking node) HUB DOS 1.25m hub on the other, the latter covered with DP-1s. I put clamp-o-tron senior ports on the 2.5m hub, and first thing added was a 3.75m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank that I docked first try at one of the clamp-o-trons.\n\nNext however is a DOS PWR with an added SSTU 1.25m docking port on a 3-2 long end. I think it\u0027s 3-2, whichever is 1.25m. Anyway, I spent an hour bouncing that guy off of all the docking ports on the 1.25m hub, then broke out \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s docking autopilot and watched him bounce off the 1.25m hub over and over. I went back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to check the PWR, I see no issue with the 1.25m port I added, and there\u0027s no configuration AFAIK of the 1.25m hub.\n\nSo I decided maybe it was a problem with the HUB DOS, but I reset the DP-1 port on the PWR to be certain nothing was amiss. Since I\u0027d attached the HUB DOS to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E with docking ports, I was able to quickly detach it to expose the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s DP-1. I then spent 30 min bouncing off it, at several extended times the magnet power had them locked face to face, sitting there looking like they were docked but never docking.\n\nI don\u0027t remember having this problem with the DP-1 in the past, I used it extensively in the big space station I built (upthread someplace).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-01T07:01:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2018 07:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf**"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-01T11:14:49Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t appear to be me, I switched over to some Contares andro ports and had no trouble docking."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-01T13:55:56Z","Content":"[@vossiewulf](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179033-vossiewulf/) You may need to enable the \u0027angle snap\u0027 on the ports.
