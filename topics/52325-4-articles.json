I might know what is causing the issue. Are you both using Windows? The thing is, I check for \u0022/parts/\u0022, however, I vaguely remember that windows uses \u0022\\\u0022. Thus it can not find any parts folder of course. But I\u0027ll check on my bootcamp version. Else I\u0027ll just skip the check for Parts folders, however, I really prefer that because without it it might also include resources etc. which are unnecessary.

Wow, almost smashed the screen. It works so much better on OSX. At least for me. Therefore I would like someone to test it for me on Windows. I have a v3.2 ready but I am not sure if I broke something. Might be just bootcamp acting up instead of my program. I am thinking of writing a .jar .app and .exe application. Thus writing the program in 3 different languages. Obviously this is a lot of work, especially because I have to learn the other 2 languages. So I first want to know how it works on a genuine Windows and Linux Computer. Would someone liked to volunteer for Windows/Linux and perhaps OSX to confirm what happens on mine?

I got some problems with the 3.1 version of the program. After I click on the \u0027process\u0027 button the orange light lights instantaneously and when I click save nothing happens. Two other friends of mine got the same issue. The directions on how to use this program were very vague so we are not sure if we are doing something incorrectly.\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known problem? If it is then how can we fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using Windows? It is really straightforward actually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
