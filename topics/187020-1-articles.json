I have been finding lots of examples and explanations about how to get the various Co-efficient for planes but I can\u0027t seem to find much on rockets. Allot of the examples are talking about aerodynamics on an airfoil, a plane wing. I was wondering if that same idea translates onto a rocket for working out it\u0027s drag and lift co-efficient etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-07T16:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t think lift coefficient is taken into account when designing a rocket.

They would have body lift if they did have an angle of attack, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor most of the flight, drag is probably dominated by wave drag\u00A0due to the high mach numbers. And once they get to high enough altitudes, drag stops being about aerodynamics and starts being about mean free path. It becomes more appropriate to treat the atmosphere as a bunch of molecules than as a fluid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(These are just guesses.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/17093/is-aerodynamic-lift-ever-useful-in-rocket-flight\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://space.stackexchange.com/questions/17093/is-aerodynamic-lift-ever-useful-in-rocket-flight\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other responses to a similar question.
