Due to a bunch of great additions and changes to the game in regards to spaceplane functionality, this challenge is designed to get players familiar with the new properties of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Odd Spaceplane Challenge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 28 odd aircraft designs here from history. Many flew, some did not. Your job is to replicate the designs and make them fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Replicate the design as closely as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Get it to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

The individual making the entry will not be penalized beyond not getting points for the entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Screenshots are required of the craft in flight. They must show fuel levels, orbit stats (use mechjeb or kerala engineer or another such mod to accomplish this). 2. Video of entire flights uploaded to YouTube is a major plus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Hyperedit (or similar editing) is strictly prohibited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Upload all of your entries at once. They can be across multiple replies but preferably not scattered across a large timespan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclude a list of mods used and their versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is subject to change at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Replicas must achieve an altitude of 500 meters to receive 10 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
