Due to a bunch of great additions and changes to the game in regards to spaceplane functionality, this challenge is designed to get players familiar with the new properties of KSP.\n\nThe Odd Spaceplane Challenge\n\nThere are 28 odd aircraft designs here from history. Many flew, some did not. Your job is to replicate the designs and make them fly.\n\n1. Replicate the design as closely as possible.\n\n2. Get it to fly.\n\n3. Anything beyond basic flight is icing on the cake.\n\nRules for Entries\n\nAny entries that break the rules will not be counted. The individual making the entry will not be penalized beyond not getting points for the entry.\n\n1. Screenshots are required of the craft in flight. They must show fuel levels, orbit stats (use mechjeb or kerala engineer or another such mod to accomplish this). 2. Video of entire flights uploaded to YouTube is a major plus.\n\n3. Hyperedit (or similar editing) is strictly prohibited.\n\n4. Upload all of your entries at once. They can be across multiple replies but preferably not scattered across a large timespan.\n\nInclude a list of mods used and their versions.\n\nThis is subject to change at any time.\n\n1. Replicas will be judged by our staff and given anywhere from 1 to 10 points for accuracy to include function.\n\n2. Replicas must achieve an altitude of 500 meters to receive 10 points.\n\n3. Land at the island airport without losing parts for an additional 10 points.\n\n4. Replicas that use only stock parts will receive a bonus of 10 points.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T19:00:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yuka**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:02:03Z","Content":"I wish you posted the info on the thread.
