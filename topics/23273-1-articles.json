It doesn\u0027t run on my computer very well buy I\u0027ll probably be getting a new PC sometime before years end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some practice in the demo I was able to get into orbit with a basic rocket. After getting the full version my first project was to get a crew module for a space station into orbit and returning safely to the ground. I built the module and rocket myself because I think that\u0027s much more fun than using the default designs. It took many tries, but I eventually got it into an orbit. However, I wasn\u0027t really sure how to circularise it. I have seen a video explaining how to do it with nodes but I must have missed something because a) I don\u0027t know how to get it to show me the information on how and when to burn to achieve the projected orbit and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m not sure how to make the projected orbit circular, it always seems quite off even when I\u0027m using the manouver nodes from the apoapsis. Anyway, I winged it and on second try managed to get an orbit with a periapsis of 82km and an apoapsis of 210.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was happy with that for a first deployed sattelite (although I think that may be a little decaying, because 80km is still fairly low), and all seemed going well returning but I foolishly time accelerated and my parachute just dissapeared when I was not even going fast (it had already opened up). So my ship crashed and my Kerbal\u0027s died. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I had forgotten my plan to put 2 of them in the station module before I left for the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to open my solar panels.

If you accelerate at the highest part of your orbit it will increase altitude at the lowest point. Or reduce speed at the lower point to lower altitude on the opposite side.

You can just burn towards the velocity marker on the navball when you get to apoapsis until the AP and PE markers start to spin around in the map view(you can still control you ship and see the navball in the map view by clicking on the little box with an up arrow in it where the navball usually is) to get your orbit as circular as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as long as the orbit is above 70km it won\u0027t get slowed down at all by the atmosphere, since it completely cuts off around 69km.
