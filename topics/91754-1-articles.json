I am not so sure what I am doing wrong but I jsut can\u0027t seem to get the hang of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am launching a mega Duna mission. Included will be a Duna capable SSTO to do aerial survey missions from Fine Print. I do not need a highly maneuverable aircraft, I want a nice steady flier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried a few designs, and at least in Kerbin they all are very difficult to control. Firstly, none of them get off the ground before the end of the runway. Then they tend to pitch up and down like crazy and start to roll. I got one up to about 25K and it jsut spun out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince i want these for Duna they use rockets only (no air intakes). The wackiest part if they are refuelible on the ground due to a karbonite distiller and drill mounted at the back (see pic). This is the critical part for the design, able to land on Duna then do multiple aerial surveys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ega6DRM.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ega6DRM.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design in a bit weird because it is based around an orange tank. I have also tried MK2 designs, which just disintegrate as soon as they get off the ground mostly, or are INCREDIBLY hard to control. I mounted the engins out on the wings because i heard this was more stable, and stability is key for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really apprecioiate any help on how to get my SSTOs off the ground and flying steady and true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T21:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, when you say \u0022my planes suck\u0022 what experience with NEAR do you have so far? Have you gotten a 1.25m plane to orbit? Really you should drop DRE if your new to FAR/NEAR until you get more experience. If you are new to NEAR as well, you need to start with 1.25m planes with the only goal is getting to orbit and back to the runway. Once you master that, then you can expand from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Really I may have gone too far with that suggestion too, you might design a simple atmospheric craft and learn to land first.

The second link in my signature is all NEAR planes, toy with those, see how I did it and learn from them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing the guide doesn\u0027t entirely cover is Flaps and Spoilers because the guide is really for stock (even though the principles are the same). Flaps are used to allow the plane to fly at a slower speed, ideal for landing. If you plane falls out the of the sky at less that 150m/s, use flaps and deploy them. Spoilers create drag and slow the plane. They can be used after landing to slow on the runway, and with careful planning they can be used as air brakes too (the Harrier in my exchange post has an example of this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have built a plane based on these criteria, bring it back here and let us see.
