Presenting the SAPAF-A20-MK1 Flunderholt, designed to be a slow, but deadly fighter plane, modelled after the A10 Thunderbolt or as it is more affectionately known, the A10 Warthog, it is similar to it right down to the slighly tilted main wing, but a bit different in the fact that the engine pods are aligned with the main body as to avoid engine offset, it IS slow, with a TWR of below 1, so max throttle or just under that is needed to stay in the air, just like the Warthog it has a 30mm cannon under the cockpit, and has four ammunitions boxes worth of ammo, it also as four countermeasure pods, two Sidewinder missiles and two AMRAAM missiles, as well as four SnakeEye bombs and two Hydra rocket pods, it has a good burn time and isn\u0027t all that complicated, keep it simple! It is going to be tested against a Raven tank later, which is a tank also developed by SAP-C that easily took down the V1 Boar, another tank developed by SAP-C, Raven and the FlunderHolt are not yet released on the SAP-C page as of the printing date of this report, but you can visit the SAP-C page by clicking on the flag in my sig!
