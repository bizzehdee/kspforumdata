And you should start with probes first, kerbals laters as stated in description.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Specialized decoupling (15) should contains xs decoupler(230), because when you unlock small payload fairings(35) you cannot use it, because you do not have xs decoupler yet for decoupling the payload. SICK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Micro construction(35) should go before basic trusses(25). Same reason, you start with tiny probes first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically any XS parts should go before S parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe change the behavior of\u00A0 payloads fairing to contains decoupler - even for key to press release instead of stage. So you can click by space decouple shell and when later needed to release payload click the binded key or release palyoad by clicking on part menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally tech points reward at the start is extremely high. If you start the mission to orbit kerbin you are rewarded for science, mission done, etc so you can buy the whole category 1 tech tree. So it basically doesnot make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission should start for example. fly to 5km. -- fly to 10km and stay there for x second. -- fly to 20km and use decoupler to launch second stage (multistage goal) -- fly balistick rocket to distance xxx (learning to do gravity turn).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasicaly the goal orbit kerbin is way to early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-22T14:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the idea isn\u0027t to make tech tree hard, they designed it so when you have done tasks at Kerbin, you have enought tech to go to mun, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T05:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see docking ports moved around.

I did not write this. I wrote that 1) XS should be unlocked before S variants. 2) After two three missions you can unlock techtree 1 in one go instead to unlock some nodes, do mission, unlock next nodes etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could maybe help is to lock nodes to missions too.
