While using 1.9 (has happened in 1.8 and 1.8.1 too) the screen will freeze on whatever is showing, but sound will continue. I think there might have been one time the flight continued as if nothing happened. I have tried mods, no mods, few mods, etc. Tweaked display settings. Lowered my overclock. Nothing seems to matter. Before the freeze happens, I tend to get screen artifacts, blips, and long Spaghettification lines. Sometimes only for a few seconds before freezing and sometimes 10 minutes. Restarting can help, other times not. Just happened to me twice in 5 minutes, both on the mission selection main menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate asking questions because I know how it is when that new person does that, but I know every forum has great members that help no matter what as well.

This has happened in stock KSP 1.8 and 1.8.1 (I haven\u0027t looked at KSP 1.9 yet, too many unsupported mods in my career saves) and also with planet pack mods installed too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few things that might help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Turn the terrain texture settings down. Not the terrain detail setting, the terrain textures- terrain detail changes the shape of the terrain and can make landers/rovers/surface bases suddenly be underground if changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Disable terrain scatters, they use a lot of computing power and often don\u0027t even look that good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Go into the settings.cfg file inside your KSP folder and change\u00A0UNSUPPORTED_LEGACY_SHADER_TERRAIN\u00A0= False to True, it makes the terrain noticeably ugly but it doesn\u0027t crash nearly as much/at all as far as I\u0027ve seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
