All the russian aircrafts i have seen were using exclusively metric, that includes helicopters and SU-27 derivatives (which is disturbing if you come from a western aerospace culture). 2011 is quite recent though, not sure there is still any hardware using imperial.. And that makes no sense intuitively, the international standard for measurements is metric (and imperial is used absolutely nowhere in Russia and China). Very weird decision.
