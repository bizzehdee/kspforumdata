I noticed recently that it was on sale on PS store so I grabbed it anything to support the devs and\u00A0game as it\u2019s awsome. But and this is a huge but. The game is broken I mean game breaking can\u2019t finish the story broken. The EVA issue of being frozen to the side of a lander is ridiculous. I have scanned the forums and see this is an issue that has been present since July of last year it\u2019s been 6 months and their hasn\u2019t been a single update to fix this. I also see no responses from devs or anyone on a possible solution or fix coming. So now I have wasted 20$ on a game that although I love I can\u2019t do anything with other than build and fly in space their is no point in landing or building anything on any planet if you can\u2019t EVA. I really want to know if the console version of this game has just been written off and they dont care anymore and, won\u2019t do anything about it?\u00A0This isn\u2019t a simple little bug that can be ignored or worked around this is literally a game breaking problem. So for now I guess I have to stick to PC version but this is stupid and to everyone should be a reason to not buy this game. I recommended this game to so many people on PS only to find out now I look like a fool because the game is fun until you try to do more than build a ship and fly in space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"canufixit","CreatedById":190691,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T17:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I have found is if you think you are going to have an issues with building rockets or eva\u0027s is save the game,\u00A0 then try doing an eva if you get stuck you will have to close the game completely restart an everything will be fine again,\u00A0 I have to do this so much that I just gave up on playing the game Cause I know console updates are \u003Cu\u003ENOT\u003C/u\u003E a priority to the makers of this game just like every game on console.

I was the first one to report this issue.

Some times wile you do it true the goo\u00A0experiments. If you are on EVA,\u00A0or just controlling the experiments with your cursor, do not, repat, do not, transmit any data. Only, and only use your antena to transmit all your data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to manually select the antena and transmit all your data from it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is safe to transmit your temperature, presure, and atmospheric presure readings directly true the part itselft (review window too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are already stuck in space, the ground,\u00A0your lader, or on any place that you are. Close the game, and go to console settings and restar your XBOX (unplugging the electric cable also works). Restar your game, and you will be able to gain control of your Kerbal aging.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that,\u00A0play as normal.
