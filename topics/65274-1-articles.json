A dicey 500m spacewalk later, he was on board Rescue I and (barely) got back home.(Yay!) But the science he did, except for some \u0022personal\u0022 reports (EVA) didn\u0027t recover. (Boo!) I assume they are still on the original capsule. Is there any way to remove stored science from the command pod and take it home?
