While ground scatter is currently only aesthetic, I think it would be nice to have them on all the bodies that you can land on. As far as I know, Eeloo is the only one without any ground scatter. In this thread, I\u0027d like to discuss the possibilities for Eeloo\u0027s ground scatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion? I don\u0027t have a specific suggestion. I\u0027d say, for now, to just use the generic rock and make it a light shade of blue \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#40e0d0;\u0022\u003E(like this, maybe less saturated and a little... dirtied)\u003C/span\u003E. This could maybe be a placeholder until the geysers are added or could be roughed up a little so they look like debris form the geysers. I\u0027d like to hear what you guys think, so...
