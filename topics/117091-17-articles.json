I also seem to have disproven those who in the Top Gun AI thread asserted that control surface spam was impossible in FAR; in reality, it seems to work quite well, as this is my first aircraft in the latter mod, but yet it flies rather nicely...That is, at least for me; the AI is highly neurotic and always manages to stall it out (thus the prototype status), probably because I am far into \u0022too much maneuverability\u0022 land--I have pulled 20\u002B g turns with it after a few short taps with fine control active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, much optimization remains to be done apart from teaching the AI to fly it properly; I can probably cut about 20% more weight from the airframe, if not more, and fine-tuning the actions of its myriad control surfaces should hopefully reduce stall incidence almost to zero. Additionally, combat \u0022simulation\u0022 versus other entries is probably warranted, as I am uncertain as to the efficacy of its current armament (3 BerezinUBS .50 caliber machine guns, one in each propeller nacelle and one in the nose) against other craft.
