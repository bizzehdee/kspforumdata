I do want warp, and I don\u0027t mind going the long way around to get it, but KSPI and even KSPI-Lite is too much. I wanted warp so bad, I even tried to hack KSPI-Lite just so I could warp around, removing all the extra resources and parts and such, but my attempts proved unsuccessful and I can not try again until Treeloader is fixed or something. Even when it does get fixed, I doubt I would have the motivation to try again.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98293-0-25-TechManager-Version-1-1?highlight=techmanager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETechManager\u003C/a\u003E is a drop-in, clean room, replacement for Treeloader, with a better license and better supporting tools (i.e. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98942-WIN-TED-KSP-Tech-Tree-Editor-v0-2-ALPHA-2-EARLY-TESTING\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGUI config tool\u003C/a\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat being said, Fractal\u0027s code is notoriously interconnected. i don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to have much luck \u0022breaking out\u0022 the warp drive. i\u0027m really not sure why you\u0027d want to. the reactors, thermal rockets and heavy electric engines are probably the best bit of interstellar; the warp drive is just icing on top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UAL002","CreatedById":57127,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T15:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome news roverdude.
