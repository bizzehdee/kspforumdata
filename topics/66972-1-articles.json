And boy do I mean a lot. I don\u0027t even think I can list what it\u0027s taught me, whether it\u0027s directly or indirectly. For example, it\u0027s taught me not only about the physics and calculations behind space travel, but also how to research properly. Possibly as importantly, it\u0027s taught me how to read and use those little formulas in physics (such as gravitational constant etc.), how something acts relative to its centre of gravity/lift, etc.. Indirectly, for example through Scott Manley, it\u0027s taught me about Greek mythology, life in space, orbital mechanics, how to edit save files (for a good cause, of course, no cheating here). Through KurtJMac I\u0027ve learnt about constellations, geosynchronous orbits, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tell me, how do you rate Kerbal Space Program\u0027s educational value and its uses in any kind of situation? Has it made things easier for you to understand in everyday life? What\u0027s the strangest/most unexpected thing you learned about through KSP either directly or indirectly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T22:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP has taught me so much as well.
