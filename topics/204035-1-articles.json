Intercept\u0027s LinkedIn page lists fewer than 30 people. Of them 10 have engineering roles, including one manager and one build engineer. There is no infrastructure, as far as I can tell, and only one engineer working specifically on multiplayer. Now not everybody is going to have a public LinkedIn profile, so we might not be seeing everyone, but this is a good starting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother point of information is that this is a Unity game.\u00A0 There are two general ways to build a real time multiplayer game in Unity. 1) You build it a\u00A0lot like single-player game using Unity\u0027s native capabilities, making sure you specify what game state needs to be synchronized across network. If desired, this can be built as a stand-alone headless server for dedicated server deployment. 2) You write core game systems from scratch in whatever makes you happy. You then run the core either as a stand-alone server or as part of the game client, piping relevant information to game objects. Unity itself acts as basically a 3D animation player to render what\u0027s happening in the core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 2 is scalable and theoretically lets you stand up as many instances on your server farm as needed to support large number of players. It also requires a lot more engineering support. It only really makes sense if you\u0027re building your own infrastructure and focusing heavily on multiplayer. We don\u0027t see any of that at Intercept. This isn\u0027t something you can hide. So it is Option 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that first option, you are limited to two possibilities for core loop. You can have one of the players host a game and have other players join a game running on host\u0027s PC or console. Or you can run a dedicated server and have everyone join. Because it is a Unity server, don\u0027t expect miracles. It won\u0027t scale any better than running the game on your own PC. Which means the player cap is going to have to be pretty restrictive. They might not have a strict limit for number of people joining, but things will digress rapidly as more than a few players join.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are games out there that takes sort of a hybrid approach, where core game loop works via very limited co-op or PVP with just 2-4 concurrent players, but there\u0027s a larger metagame that\u0027s much more social. Unfortunately, even if someone was to come up with what that looks like for KSP2, even that would require more people working on infrastructure and networking, and we\u0027d see evidence of it on LinkedIn in some way. So it doesn\u0027t sound like Intercept is even going to run their own servers. There might be something light for registration and user authentication and they might end up partnering with some cloud hosting service that will make purchasing server instances easy, but my guess is that if you\u0027ll want a dedicated server, it will be up to community or individual players to organize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo just based on the tech, that\u0027s really all that\u0027s left. Either you run your own game and invite a few people to join you across the network or you run a persistent dedicated server somewhere that allows several people to play on it concurrently. Think Minecraft multiplayer as a good example of what that might look like - you can have a lot of registered accounts, but not so many people playing at the same time before it starts struggling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is still a lot you can do in terms of game design with that, but you have to stay within these technical limitations. Large multiplayer worlds just aren\u0027t going to be possible with what they have to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intelliCom","CreatedById":209738,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-27T01:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224010048\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221627327929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166799\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022starcaptain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, starcaptain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe all have high hopes for the multiplayer features of KSP2 but it occurred to me: not everyone likes to play nice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing as we have little to go on for how multiplayer works, it\u0027s hard to imagine what kinds of griefing or abuses may appear.
