Do you think they\u2019re going to be limited to the sizes from Kerbal 1, or do you think they\u2019re going to be able to get bigger? How big? Are they going to be limited by traditional chemical explosions, or do you think other fuels could create larger explosions than others?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-25T15:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy hope is that not only will explosions be larger, they will also generate a simplified physical effect. I think that on the technical side, larger explosions are relatively easy to implement, by waiting a bit before creating the explosions and allowing groups of parts to explode instead of having a smaller explosion for every single part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, with chemical fuels, we shouldn\u0027t expect immense explosions unless there are immense rockets, as standard rocket fuel can only burn so hot, and some fuels like solid fuels burn slowly by default. I\u0027m more interested in seeing how the devs implement small craft with very explosive fuel, because the effects of explosions of that magnitude can be extreme. If an NSWR engine needs to be kept away from a base because of radiation issues, what happens when highly fissile (or fusile) fuel gets caught in a large explosion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowlerHatGuy3","CreatedById":222738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-25T15:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224148589\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656169736\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey will also generate a simplified physical effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
