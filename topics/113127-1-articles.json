See, you need to put imgur albums with their tag (the final qMZNp in the link I can see by quoting you), between the special imgur tag this forum uses. It\u0027s easy they are basically [imgurt][/imgurt], though you can see how I misspelled them so they actually show up (hint: that\u0027s not the name of the website). So this will work better:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/qMZNp)\n\nRune.

All you need are stock Mk. 2 parts, a nosecone and your choice of liquid fuel engine; experiment with the size and type of engine for optimal performance. \n\nYou may not even need mods at all if stock parts can fulfill your performance expectations.\n\nI haven\u0027t replicated a triangle hypersonic craft in 1.0.x yet but\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQtE_1UDIwU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n.\nAs for landing and emergency situations, I found it was possible to soft-land the non-recoverable test version of this craft even with realistic aerodynamics (FAR) so added landing gear and used it for point to point sub-orbital flights since. A single radial stock parachute will do for the worst of cases, since with SAS it is virtually impossible to spin out a Kerbal craft with anything less than physical destruction of parts, or bad symmetry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T08:38:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 08:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"}]}
