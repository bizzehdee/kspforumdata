Effects of Mach number wouldn\u0027t matter (yay incompressible fluids!), so that would actually simplify fluid dynamics for subs greatly.

When in flight, the roll controls are reversed. The ailerons on the winglets oppose the RCS thrusters, and SAS/MechJeb tries to correct any rolling, but the reversal means it just intensifies. Any ideas? I\u0027m launching four smaller pieces that each have probe cores and mechjeb units, so that may be the cause, but I\u0027ve experienced a similar \u0022death spin\u0022 with other large rockets.
