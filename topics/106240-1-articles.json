During procedural shaping mass (and cost) is indicated and it is reflected in the Engineer\u0027s Report. However, once on the launchpad, the mass of a fairing seems to be not included, according to map view Info button, and the performance observation.\n\nFor example, an LV-T45 can easily lift 60\u002B tons of fairings at sea level, when I would expect no more than 15-ish.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I expect that is probably what you are noticing.\n\nYes, this means that there is no advantage to ditching the fairing sides. Another minor detail I am hoping will be addressed in the next patch."},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:36:25Z","Content":"Not quite what I\u0027m getting at.\n\nIt seems to me that fairings have no mass at all other than the base, meaning that larger fairing is not more massive than a smaller one of the same base diameter.\n\nLV-T45 should not be capable of lifting that fairing at all, no matter where the mass is concentrated."}]}
