This user \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ereposted this fanfic on Encyclopedia Dramatica (there is nothing NSFW or not allowed on this forum though, looks like that person just wanted more attention) and made a Youtube reading of this short \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003EProse. So, to preserve it, I have reposted it here. Enjoy!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THU8wFgfG-U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THU8wFgfG-U\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey guys. I just wanted to share with you the story of something very strange that happened to me in Kerbal Space Program, in the hopes that someone out there saw what I saw. It all started at around 3:00 AM EST (I\u0027m kind of a night owl), several hours after the recent 0.16 update was released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to move the game I had been playing, 0.15.2, to an archive folder. The plan was to start new from a fresh install, since I\u0027d heard on the forums that the update would break persistent and craft files anyway. I loaded up the site and began the download. When it was finished, I was extremely excited to play. I extracted directly to downloads and launched it from the application in the main folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was impressed from the getgo. The background was animated now, showing a cute kerbonaut standing in front of a little Muncastle he\u0027d built at his feet. When I updated my settings back to my usual, there was another of some kerbals floating in orbit around Kerbin. Upon starting the game, I spent only a brief time looking at all of the new parts - I wanted to walk on the Mun! This was something every player dreamed of, and everyone wanted to be among the first.An example of what the one-man pod portrait looks like when the pilot is scared. Added by NormanbatesAlthough my plan had always been to send the whole crew - Bill, Jeb, and Bob - I was in a hurry, and in order to save time, I decided to use my old design. Before, all three of the intrepid trio could go, but unfortunately the design could now only accommodate the new one-man pod. Jebediah would be making the trip alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch went perfectly, and soon I was set for a Mun encounter. The closer I got, the more excited I became. I know it sounds silly to get so excited about a computer game, but when it comes to KSP, this is how a lot of players are. Every step forward feels like a major achievement. At 50 kilometers from the surface, I throttled up and began to slow my descent. I was going a bit faster than was safe, and that was when I noticed something strange. The portrait that displays your kerbonaut\u0027s face is creepy for that pod. It shows your kerbal in a dull orange light, with his head at a slight angle. And stranger still: Jebediah, the one that never stops grinning, was terrified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought this was pretty weird, but there was no time to pay attention to that. I had to land this craft. 30 kilometers...25...20...15...10. I came to a perfect landing at 0.6 meters per second - my best yet. This was it. I extended the ladder, and Jebediah stepped out of the command pod. I walked him down the ladder, released, and - YES! I had done it. Kerbal-kind had conquered the Mun. There was only one more thing I wanted to do before heading home. I had noticed in the control settings that the EVA suit had lights, so I warped forward to night-time to test it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never got the chance. At my location, I should have had a nice view of Kerbin at night. Instead, it was nowhere to be found. For that matter, where were the stars? This didn\u0027t seem right at all. I put Jeb back in the command pod and set the time forward. Not only did Kerbin never rise - neither did the sun. Then I checked the map view. I had no idea what to think. Rather than describe it to you, I\u0027ve attached the picture. I print-screened it (by now it\u0027s instinctive, though I know of the F1 command). The screenshot of the map view is attached below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe map view from the time I arrived on the Mun onwards.And so, I did the only thing I could think of - I took off. I ascended to about 5 kilometers from the surface, turned myself to a 90 degree heading, and put myself on escape trajectory from the Mun. I just kept going and going until the Mun was no longer in sight. The map view was now just an empty black screen and a clear flight list. Eventually, I could see indicators of two ships in the distance, but I never got close enough to see the ships themelves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe names of the ships - Columbia, and Soyuz 11.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had had enough, and attempted to end the flight. When that didn\u0027t work, I simply used Ctrl\u002BAlt\u002BDel. I knew of Columbia, but I had to Google Soyuz 11 to confirm what I had already guessed - like Columbia, Soyuz 11 was a spacecraft that was destroyed on re-entry, killing its crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI restarted the game, and attempted to try for an orbit using the new big 3-man pod. This time it actually went off without a hitch, and the spacecraft made it into orbit. I let it go a few times, but when I turned to start my de-orbit burn, Jeb looked scared again. I was a bit unsettled, but started anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I was in atmosphere, I was ready to separate the crew pod from the rest of the ship. I attempted to release, but the decoupler failed, and it remained attached. The command pod was meant to separate from the ship and drift down with a parachute, but if it was still attached, it would come down much too fast for a safe landing. Hoping the force of the drag would break the pod off, as it sometimes does, I deployed the chute. The chute was pulled clean off by the air resistance. When the ship hit the ground, and Bill and Bob died, Jeb\u0027s terrified portrait remained just a second longer than it should have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI checked the forums a few days later to see if others had experienced it. Not only did I find nothing, but I was informed of something that still creeps me out. With everyone trying to patch their game, the servers went down hard the day of the update. I couldn\u0027t have downloaded it directly from the site, and even at the time of this writing, no direct 0.16 download is available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
