If you have strategies in place that convert funds into science and/or reputation but the payout doesn\u0027t include those (such as with an advance) you will not get paid those currencies. In this picture you can see part of the advance is converted into science, but (and I\u0027m guessing) because science isn\u0027t part of the advance payment, you get nothing. I haven\u0027t seen contract payouts that don\u0027t give all three resources so I don\u0027t know if this is only limited to advances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n48/Hyomoto/bug_zpsc9e36e6e.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022bug_zpsc9e36e6e.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see according to this I\u0027m supposed to get an advance of 22 science. However, I get nothing. So either the bug is that it doesn\u0027t give the currency, or that it displays the currency as part of the advance payment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Hmm, now it has paid me the advance. Maybe it only pays those advances on the change of scene? After a launch, albeit failed, I did get paid out for the advance above.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-12T17:00:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2014 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
