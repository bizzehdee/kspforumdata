The main kind are ring laser gyros, this is what modern aircraft and spacecraft use. They shoot two lasers in opposite directions around a ring in such a way that they set up a standing wave when they interfere. If something makes the gyro spin it will ever so slightly change the wavelength of the lasers and that shows up as a change in the standing wave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERing laser gyros have the advantage of not using gimbals, so don\u0027t suffer from gimbal lock, they\u0027re faster to set up, lighter and more compact. They aren\u0027t as accurate as spinny gyros though, and aren\u0027t north-seeking, so they can only tell you how you\u0027ve moved, which is not quite the same as knowing exactly which way you\u0027re facing. In practice that means the system needs to get an accurate fix from something like GPS every so often to zero the errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other kind of strapdown gyro you\u0027re likely to see is a miniaturized vibrating gyro. These don\u0027t actually spin at all, they just vibrate a tiny rotor back and forth, but they\u0027re able to detect torque the same way as any gyro. They can be made very, very small. So small they\u0027re built in silicon chip foundries and you can package one up complete with all of its control electronics into a single chip.
