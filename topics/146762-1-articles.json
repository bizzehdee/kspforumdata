You need stations for long term habitation so you can learn about long term habitation. I think that is a good reason in game---add life support, and tie LS pimprovements to long term habitation (i.e.; you make a station to learn stuff to make better LS parts for farther missions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222754066\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146762\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221473785674\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople said that about rockets back in the 60\u0027s. \u00A0Now, we couldn\u0027t get along without them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace stations are still in their infancy. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are zero examples of economic reasons to build a space station.
