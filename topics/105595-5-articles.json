Land the lander in the vicinity of mining base. Neither of them can move. So you have this rover made of fuel tanks. It drives up to the base, grabs it with the Klaw, and transfers fuel into itself. Then it drives over to the lander and transfers the fuel into it. Doing it this way avoids the nightmare of trying to use docking ports on uneven ground with vehicle suspensions doing whatever they want to under different loading conditions.\u003Cp\u003EThe main mod method to do this is/was to the pipes of KAS, but that\u0027s not yet working with 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr course, the Klaw can cause physics weirdness, but so could/can KAS, so the operation is always fraught with some risk.
