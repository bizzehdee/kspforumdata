I just feel this game has too much \u0022right click - press button - you\u0027re done\u0022 -mechanics as it is.\n\nI have to agree. \n\nI get where you\u0027re coming from, RoverDude, but I do think having to timewarp a little more would be something a lot less people would be bothered by.\n\nPart of KSP\u0027s appeal over other space games is it generally tries to give an impression of realistic, close to current day space exploration, and having insta-scans is another immersion breaker.\n\nPlus, as I, and others have [talked about](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116466-A-bigger-emphasis-on-time-management?p=1873034#post1873034), the career mode could be a lot more fun if it moved away from clicking and grinding, and towards planning and managing things over time.\n\nI do get that sometimes, you just want to land straight away, but scanning that takes time could be an incentive to send smaller, cheap probes to the outer planets at a time when you can\u0027t afford bigger missions. \n\nWhy not give the long distance scanner a really wide field view? \n\nYou\u0027d still scan everything pretty quickly, but it would feel like you actually did it.\n\nPlus, this would allow extra possibilities, like getting some data on a flyby, and eliminate the oddness of slow rotating planets like Moho being mapped straigh away. \n\nWhy not have another tier between the long distance and landing scanners, which you could leave in place for a while to slowly map the planet?\n\nThis would be especially useful if the long distance scan was even less accurate, so using the narrow band scanner to guide landings could still be something useful. Maybe the orbital scanner should have a close up mode.\n\nI particularly like the way the narrow, and ground level scanners work btw. That\u0027s quite clever.\n\nIt seems to be a bit of a waste, to just gloss over this orbital stage, when the stock game is lacking in features where we actually get to collect meaningful data on the planets.\n\nPlus, isn\u0027t the whole point of timewarp so things can take time in a meaningful way, without needing to bore the player?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is good. A few posts/pages back (this thread is hard to keep up with), you said the design is for only a 5\\* engineer to avoid overheating completely. ...\n\u003E That\u0027s a huge amount of both playing time and gametime that goes by doing all this, complicated by the timing of launch windows.

Basically you put a docking port facing down under any piece of hardware you need to interface with. You could put it out on a boom if you need more space to maneuver. Then you stick another docking port facing up on a boom extending from your tanker truck, prime mover or whatever you want to call it. Place a landing gear or leg underneath. Drive the boom under the hardware, extend the landing gear to bring the docking port up higher and - with a bit of wiggling - they should dock up.\n\nHere, let me dazzle you with my amazing Paint skills:\n\n![C7qDMTc.png](http://i.imgur.com/C7qDMTc.png)\n\nThe good part about this system is that it\u0027s low-tech, easy to engineer around and copes well with mild terrain and varying gravity.
