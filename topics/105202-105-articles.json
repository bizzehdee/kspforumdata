I started using TAC-LS because I prefer the added complexity of having to manage multiple resources, but after a few long missions with it I agree that it\u0027s got a lot of problems.  Aside from the parts being in dire need of a model update and spec balancing (WAY too heavy), the resource consumption rates were far too low for my tastes; I doubled them manually and that still didn\u0027t quite feel like enough.  That also threw a lot of the converters and scrubbers out of wack, and with a chronic lack of documentation it was hard to accurately plan requirements for a mission.\n\nWith USI-LS\u0027s additional mechanics to plan around, and now thanks to [@sirreality](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/144756-sirreality/) we actually have good and clear documentation, USI-LS really does seem to be the best option.  And due to [@RoverDude](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/)s seemingly never-ending plans for expansions and enhancements, I have no worries that it\u0027ll be supported for the foreseeable future.\n\nI don\u0027t think USI-LS is perfect, and if I were king of the USI-niverse I would change a few structural things and do some re-balancing (Higher costs associated with planetary logistics, Akadamy should take 1 month per star increase rather than being an instant boost, nerf the Nom-O-Matics a bit because as it stands they\u0027re way over-powered, Urinite to EnrichedUranium should be closer to 1000:1 not 1:1). \n\nI would also really love more IVAs, because I\u0027m kind of an RPGer and they\u0027re important to me.
