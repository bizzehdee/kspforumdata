How close to the ground can you get in an orbit and survive. The map isn\\\u0027t much use here since the comparison is to actual ground level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the inspiration from my latest Mun mission. I decided to see how low I could orbit, well, turns out I passed a mountain close enough that even though I was basically looking horizontal to the ground, the shadow was visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me a little to think to take a screen shot so I\\\u0027m already past the closest point. You could see the entire shadow at a couple points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bA5h1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bA5h1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after I got close enough that I lost one of the legs on the tricoupler (same craft orientation as the above picture). The crew survived for another half second until they hit the significantly larger mountain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
