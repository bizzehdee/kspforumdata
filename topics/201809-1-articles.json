You have access to the latest api, more things in the game to change, higher .net access and all the experience gained from every previous version. Also if you use other mods as dependencies, they are more likely to be maintained to the latest version than one say 10 versions ago. That\u2019s my opinion anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-18T18:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard to tell.
