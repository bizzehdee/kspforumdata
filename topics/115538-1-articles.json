PLEASE review and reconfigure your code for 3rd party controllers\n\n2.) PLEASE set the breaks to toggle as currently the only way is either to HOLD down the button rt using the mouse click on the ui .....(bad immersion breaker)\n\n3.) PLEASE set it so camera zoom ALSO works when in iva as a kerbal as currently the only was to zoom as a kerbal is with my mouse ....(again breaks immersion and kinda deadly as you have to let go of the stick) oh and please leave zoom as a button press ie don\u0027t change it to need a axis \n\nps if anyone out there is in contact with the devs please pass this on as I\u0027m sure if they were aware of these issues they would have fixed them before 1.0 \n\nanyhow hope this helps loving ksp \n\n yours in service \n\n the hawk from za\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T09:22:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 09:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hawk\\_za**"}]}
