I\u0027ve been with KSP for a couple years now, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve been more stumped since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I\u0027d like to say I fully expected the recent aerodynamic/thermodynamic changes to the game. I was a little split on the issue, but now that it\u0027s here... Well, it\u0027s gotten really difficult to play, but I like that the game is leaning towards realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue is that the parachutes seem a little... Too far. I\u0027m currently trying to launch a rocket into sub-orbit. In order to keep the rocket from reentering parachute first, I had to re balance the craft, and did so by dumping the unnecessary heat shield and replacing it with an engine and small tank. Now it enters engine first, which is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no matter what I do, it simply doesn\u0027t bleed speed fast enough, and no matter what I do to the chutes, they ALWAYS FAIL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I enter from an apoapsis of about 100km altitude, at about 45 degrees. I know it\u0027s been pretty steep. But even in 1.01 and 1.02, I hadn\u0027t had any issues with an entry like that. Now, even with a deployment altitude of 50 meters (bare minimum), and pop them at 500-700 meters, coming in at 250 m/s (note, LESS than the speed of sound), flames going away at about 3,000 meters, no heat bars showing up for chutes, chutes protected in small bays, it always gives me that same stupid message, \u0022Aerodynamic/Thermodynamic Failure\u0022, and fails the second I press space bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this really realistic? I don\u0027t think a real parachute would fail only semi deploying at a speed of 250 m/s at ANY altitude, would it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if it IS realistic, but the fact that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is a lot thinner between the surface and the edge than Earth\u0027s is getting in the way of an accurate portrayal of a reentering object. I\u0027m only just coming out of reentry flame by the time I\u0027m just 1000-3000 meters. It\u0027s like there just isn\u0027t enough room to slow down before deploying chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to get around this?

It is more than enough to slow down a drone with weight of 0.1 ton. Its pretty enough to slow down capsule of 0.8 ton. But its not enough to slow down a capsule\u002Bempty_tanks\u002Bengine for total of 2-3 tons, and that is your case. Also you should consider aerodynamics of a surface you\u0027re going first into atmosphere, because the better it is, the worst brake you will have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow you can deal with it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Separate engine stage and capsuse on falling down. You will have twice more surface to brake down now (one on separated engine stage, one on capsule) and it will be almost 100% enough for capsule still engines will crush the ground on higlands and mountains eventually. If you want to have your cash back from engine stage use Stage Recovery mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add winglets (tail fins are perfect for that) of any king and deploy them by right clicking and pressing \u0022deploy\u0022 on reentry. They will increase surface that will be stopping you, efficiently acting as an aerobrakes, also they will cause instability that will eventually turn your craft around, also increasing surface exposed to coming air. Also winglet brake efficiency depends on control surface area, so use one\u0027s with the biggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Just leave some fuel to slow yourself down burning retrograde during descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T08:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by S1mancoder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T07:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, 260m/s \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the threshold at which parachute deployment becomes safe.

Not really an accurate description but you get the idea.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ENow, in 1.0.4, if your object/vehicle/rocket is aerodynamic enough it will simply, well, rocket through the atmosphere and not slow down in time to deploy parachutes. 45 degrees is a very, very steep angle and requires a blunt body ballistic re-entry at high Gs, meaning, something like a Mk. 1 command pod and heatshield. That shape creates enough drag that it will slow down in time pulling upwards of 7Gs and slowing down enough to deploy your parachute safely at about 5,000m. The re-entry flames dissipate way before that. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI suggest to re-enter at a shallower angle and with a \u0027blunter\u0027 craft, Mk.1 pod creates enough drag on its flat side to slow down automatically. A long stick with an engine at the back may re-enter back end first, but a long thin rod is considered an aerodynamic, roughly bullet shaped object and will not slow down in time for you to deploy chutes. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAlso, don\u0027t enter the atmosphere at 45 degrees. Start your re-entry maneuvering by decreasing your periapsis to the planet\u0027s surface, i.e. 0m.

Then, instead of re-entering nose first (and losing little speed while heating up to catastrophic levels), fly it like the Space Shuttle at 30-45 degree angle of attack.
