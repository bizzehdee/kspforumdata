So the fins/wings are too high up. The 4 fins at the very top are probably your worst offenders. They\u00A0can only be used to turn the ship away from prograde very efficiently\u00A0while going up (which you don\u0027t ever want), or for stability during descent (which is not the problem). So\u00A0they serve no purpose during ascent and make stability much worse. Such canards are common on stuntplanes or jet fighters, but those are designed to be unstable!

I put canards exactly like that on the tops of almost all my rockets\u00A0for several reasons. Yes, positive aerodynamic attitude control is naturally unstable\u00A0but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Especially on reentry, as Carl says, when your RV becomes more of a spaceplane glider instead of an overpowered rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the roll stuff goes, I\u0027d think the problem \u0026amp; solution is pretty simple. It\u0027s really easy to make rockets (or planes) roll, compared to making them turn in the other 2 directions. Sadly, you can\u0027t adjust the \u0022control authority\u0022 in just one direction at a time. I\u0027ll assume that\u00A0you have to have about that many control surfaces in about those places to make the thing fly in pitch and yaw. But what you can do is completely disable roll authority on some of them. I would bet that the only offenders are actually the tailfins on the liquid tanks. Disable roll control on those, and I bet you\u0027ll be good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn more detail:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo figure the roll torque from a control surface, you look at the lever arm to the centerline of your ship. The canards at the front have a short lever arm, so they make small roll torques -- which is good. The tailfins on the liquid tanks have much longer lever arms in that dimension, so they make lots of torque. So those are the bad ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe funny thing is that in the other two dimensions, those tailfins on the liquid tanks should be very near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, so they should have almost no control authority. So I\u0027m really surprised to hear they do anything good. So besides turning off their roll authority, I\u0027d certainly try cutting their number to 3. I\u0027d try moving them way down to the bottom. I\u0027d try replacing them with the AV-R8 surfaces instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that the liquid tanks are placed with 6x symmetry, so the editor naturally wants to use 6x symmetry for anything you attach to them. But if you place the winglets one at a time, you can override that. Yes, I understand that if you place them one at a time, they might not be perfectly symmetrical. But you can use the markings on the tanks to get them lined up very close to symmetrical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carl","CreatedById":2645,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T14:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003EThe funny thing is that in the other two dimensions, those tailfins on the liquid tanks should be very near the\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted;color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022 title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003E, so they should have almost no control authority.

But with the extra fins thee \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was doing very little in the way of control inputs that i could see, so i suspect they were working like fixed fins and dampening yaw and pitch by being there. They also helped during the initial turn to get the ship pointed where it needed to go, i suspect the gimbaling on the engines was interacting with them and they became a fulcrum for the gimbals, i just know stripping them all has made it handle worse in the 30-40km range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yes, without the fins on the upper stage i\u0027m having a lot of issues getting it down safely again.

That\u0027s a bit of a special case though, at any other inclination or manually you\u0027ll likely get there with just a few hundred left in the final stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PNT86Hz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PNT86Hz.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xNIbA5p.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xNIbA5p.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vNFnyCi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vNFnyCi.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qLEqZgk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qLEqZgk.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228STYtL3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8STYtL3.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cWgMKHW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cWgMKHW.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IsUIuHp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IsUIuHp.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A4avYR6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A4avYR6.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-31T16:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice work dude. \u00A0This is what KSP is all about. \u00A0Building what feels groovy, identifying potential design flaws, and working them out one by one until you can achieve you self-appointed goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat delivers some of the most satisfying gaming I have been able to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carl","CreatedById":2645,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-31T17:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeh, thanks, i\u0027m going through version 2.0 of this with my Mun Bus atm.
