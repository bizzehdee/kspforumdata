For those of you who don\\\u0027t know, Apollo 13 was scheduled to be the third mission to put men on the Moon, but suffered a number of misfortunes that very nearly killed the crew. Eventually they were returned safely to Earth, hence the successful failure, in that they failed to land on the Moon but succeeded in returning home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage in this challenge is the build a rocket and land on the Mun and return home safely, to prove that your rocket is designed to land on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you can begin the process of re-enacting Apollo 13.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst step, however you wish to, you must simulate an engine shutdown of 1 engine during your ascent into orbit around Kerbin. Historically, this occurred during Apollo 13\\\u0027s second stage boost, when the centre engine shut down two minutes early. You still need to reach an orbital path that will send you towards the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond step, having obtained your orbital path to intersect with the orbit of the Mun, at approximately 9,000 km from Kerbin (which, as far as I can figure, is, to scale, the same distance as Apollo 13), you must simulate an event which, historically, was an explosion in the Service Module number 2 oxygen tank, which put the Service Module engine out of action. Depending on how you\\\u0027ve structured your rocket, this correlates to the stage where you\\\u0027ve jettisoned all other stages and are approaching the Mun, the stage before your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that point on, your main engine must be shutdown and turned off. You can jettison it if you like. Using the engines from your lander stage, you must achieve a free-return orbit, looping around the Mun to return to Kerbin. You can make one burn to fix your orbit so you can free-return, then another burn after the periapsis (the PC\u002B2 burn to speed return to Kerbin), and finally another burn to course correct later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Apollo Lunar Module wasn\\\u0027t designed to sustain the full crew over the time taken to return to Earth, they had to shut down power in the LM. Likewise, you will have to shut down your RCS and SAS systems until nearing re-entry, as well as hitting F2 so you can\\\u0027t see your sphere telling you your heading and so on. This is the equivalent to shutting down the guidance computer on Apollo 13. You can turn it on as you approach Kerbin and make your final course corrections to land on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points for following a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a3/Lunar-orbit_rendezvous.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elunar-orbit rendezvous\u003C/a\u003E path throughout the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra bonus points for doing it entirely with stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to make suggestions or additions to this challenge, which strikes me as being pretty difficult...
