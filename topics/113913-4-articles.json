As I stated before, with so many topics within KSP, there are polarizing factors that some people simply cannot get past. If you\u0027d like to discuss x64 amicably (as the OP asked), then it\u0027s best to stick to factual statements and avoid looking to place blame. You might feel that finding someone to blame is important to you, but it will simply propagate the polarizing factors.

C# compiles only to bytecode, which is then turned into machine code specific for that system by the Just In Time (JIT) compiler. The end result is that we can\u0027t do any win64 development for mods, because there is nothing to develop.
