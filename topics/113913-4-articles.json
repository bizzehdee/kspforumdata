In my personal experience, It would crash every ten minutes or so, with zero mods installed while 32 bit ran perfectly with 30 mods.\n\nWindows-specific? Well, that\u0027s pretty serious, given the huge portion of users who aren\u0027t running Mac or Linux. And also, my friend has Mac KSP. It isn\u0027t very stable either and required a number of workarounds to keep that running as well, even with 32-bit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In my experience OSX\u0027s limit for KSP is in practice \u003C3GB, even though in theory it\u0027s supposed to be a full 4GB (unlike KSP-win32 where in theory and in practice it\u0027s ~3.4 GB). You combine a ~2900MB limit with the texture issue, and yeah, you can hit that stock.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have not had these issues, though I run the osx game at minimum. Maybe it is related to what gpu the apple has. My Intel while not very powerful chugs along fine with no issues. Latest OSX.\n\nPreviously mentioned friend of mine running a Macbook Pro with a GTX 760 or something like that. Crashed every time until he ran the Texture compressing mod. (Before 1.0 which now has that effect natively.\n\nIt\u0027s interesting news that the community has created a stable 64-bit option, however. I will have to try that out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T04:56:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:05:49Z","Content":"Kerbonauts,\n\nI\u0027ll be as much of a neutral party here as I can...\n\nI\u0027d prefer that we not get into a debate in this thread about wielding (or not wielding) moderator powers to gain an advantage. It\u0027s well off topic. If you have concerns about moderators abusing their powers, there are other avenues to address that.\n\nIn regard to the topic, there is a lot of factual information and emotion in this thread about the history and evolution of Windows x64 version of KSP. As I stated before, with so many topics within KSP, there are polarizing factors that some people simply cannot get past. If you\u0027d like to discuss x64 amicably (as the OP asked), then it\u0027s best to stick to factual statements and avoid looking to place blame. You might feel that finding someone to blame is important to you, but it will simply propagate the polarizing factors. Also, as I stated before, bear in mind that regardless of how many times or ways something is explained, some times the \u0022why\u0022 will remain a mystery.\n\nThat being said, I\u0027m now in one of those precarious situations as a moderator. To give some slight insight and perhaps guidance to the rest of this thread\u0027s progression, here are the two most basic options I have available:\n\n1) Close the thread for being answered, and straying off topic. \n\n2) Let the thread keep on trucking, and hope that the agnostic notes that I post above pushes the train back on the tracks.\n\n \\* (Yes, there are more options. No, we don\u0027t need to debate them.)\n\nSo I pretty much can\u0027t use option 1, at least not for now, simply for the fact that moderators have become involved in this topic. Why? Because that would \u0022add proof\u0022 that moderators wield powers to squash down any dissent, regardless of my actual motives. This is the dual hat that we have to wear and be cognizant of.\n\nSo please, back to the topic. \n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:30:12Z","Content":"I don\u0027t believe there really is hate for X64 among the users/modders.

You will get the feedback sooner or later about if the users are happy with your mod running on x64.\n\nAnd obviously you will need to test this everytime KSP is getting an update.

The problem is KSP doesn\u0027t work, more or less, on win64. So to a casual user, it\u0027s not clear whether a bug is in the mod, or in the base game.\n\nOften, they assume it\u0027s in the mod. After all, it\u0027s been hacked in, right (hint: in all actuality, no, at least not any more then stock is)? And they don\u0027t bother to replicate it in stock, especially if it\u0027s difficult or impossible to do so (read: most behaviors in FAR).\n\nSo modders are dealt a lot of bug reports they can\u0027t do anything about. And they need to take time to investigate whether that\u0027s or not that\u0027s the case, because it\u0027s not often clear.\n\nFerram4 in particular has this pretty bad, in part because his mod is so complex and popular. He has enough trouble getting users to understand that the way he works\\*, he needs bug reports to have certain information; and users still fail to do this yet give him flack anyways for not responding to their posts.

As was already noted earlier, though you seem to have ignored it as it was inconvenient, users try random things to make their installs work, like delete ModuleManager and other hard dependencies. Things break more. Eventually, they come back and try to get support and make more noise, and guess what then? More signal to noise ratio worsening, plus, until we recognize that this is a bug entirely caused by user error, we\u0027ve wasted development time tracking it down.\n\u003E \n\u003E The end result is that it adds more work for us *and* screws over your fellow users because they can\u0027t get good support, and mod development slows too. So I gather you want us to have more work, your fellow users to get less support, and for mod development to slow.\n\nSuppose you guys find a way to completely block out mods from being used in 64bit systems. Then the use of ALL parts mods and/or mods that increase memory footprint will drop, since all of us running those mods won\u0027t be able to anymore. We\u0027ll be limited by 3gb, and so we\u0027ll stop using some outstanding mods out there, which means less development on those areas, which is bad for everybody.\n\nI understand your argument and I do agree that it can be very frustrating dealing with users who don\u0027t follow the rules, but you can\u0027t deny that forgetting about 64bit mod development altogether is also bad for the game.\n\nAt least until Unity finds a better way to handle textures.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T14:42:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JeeF**"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T19:54:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It could be because FAR is doing really well with x64! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat would be news to me, considering I can\u0027t get the hack to not crash.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I agree that before 1.0 it was like that, 0.90 was unplayable using x64. But now it completely different. I\u0027m not saying win64 KSP != guaranteed failure at some point, but to find \u0022the point\u0022 is getting hard.\n\nMy tests indicate that the point is where it\u0027s always been; you try to use over 4 Gb RAM, you\u0027re getting a crash. No ifs, ands or buts. Sometimes instability before.\n\nAnd this is with the hack.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E About to block the unfixer, it is very easy (max 5 min) to add the code to block the unfixer. I\u0027m a honest guy, and it is up to you to do it. \n\u003E If I found that unfixer is not useful anymore and I have to go through VS to recompile every single mod, then I will create forks for everything, and a CKAN for x64. Maybe this approach is more fair and I will help to reduce your signal/noise ratio redirecting those \u0027bad users\u0027 to my forks.\n\nUnfortunately, as I noted back in my history of win64 KSP builds, this was tried. Still had nearly all the users coming to my thread. The only advantage is that it\u0027s a little easier to figure out what\u0027s going on sometimes. We also both know that if a win64 issue comes up you\u0027ll blame it on the mod; it\u0027s impossible to convince people that\u0027s not the case.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So I take you\u0027ve never tried the 64bit workaround yourself?\n\u003E Nope, I\u0027ve got it sitting next to the win32 version for the purposes of testing ways to break the unfixer. Can\u0027t add more mods to it than the win32 build without risking crashes, and I haven\u0027t noticed any increase in stability above that of the official builds. I have no idea where this, \u0022win64 is stable now\u0022 idea came from, because it certainly isn\u0027t playtesting.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E See this is contradictory with your quote below:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Win64 KSP guarantees failure is contradictory with what? That users blame the mods anyway and bury legitimate issues? Or are you trying to argue that there are issues that are on all platforms is proof that win64 is completely blameless in all ways, and that\u0027s it\u0027s never caused crashes?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Suppose you guys find a way to completely block out mods from being used in 64bit systems.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see why we would, Linux 64 has always behaved. Just like all the win64-pushers, you ignore this because it\u0027s inconvenient.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Then the use of ALL parts mods and/or mods that increase memory footprint will drop, since all of us running those mods won\u0027t be able to anymore.

Linux users would not, because Linux 64 doesn\u0027t crash frequently, and so isn\u0027t disabled.\n\u003E \n\u003E Why do you ignore that it\u0027s only win64 that is locked? Does it hinder your argument that it\u0027s irrational hate of x64, because all the mods that you\u0027re screaming about aren\u0027t locked on all x64 builds, only the busted (read: win64) ones?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I understand your argument and I do agree that it can be very frustrating dealing with users who don\u0027t follow the rules, but you can\u0027t deny that forgetting about 64bit mod development altogether is also bad for the game.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only 64bit-specific mod development that has occurred is the development of the detection of whether the KSP process is a 64-bit process on a Windows system, i.e., \u0022is it win64 KSP?\u0022 Perhaps you noticed that everyone downloads the same dll, regardless of OS or word size; that\u0027s because the code is identical in all those cases. C# compiles only to bytecode, which is then turned into machine code specific for that system by the Just In Time (JIT) compiler. The end result is that we can\u0027t do any win64 development for mods, because there is nothing to develop. It\u0027s exactly the same as win32, and OS, and Linux 32, and Linux 64.\n\u003E \n\u003E I would suggest that you actually get into modding and attempt to handle any of this if you don\u0027t believe me.
