My Google-fu is weak and I need your help. I am trying to find out the name of a game I played some 15-20 years ago. It was set inside a computer infected by a virus. The virus was represented like a red snake or spider moving on a terrain made out of polygons and you had to kill it using a squad shooting lasers. When you killed it it left peaces called \u0022souls\u0022 which you had to collect using a unit that looks like the ship from the movie Tron. Later in the game these souls could be resurrected in small 2d green men. They could go on to fight the infestation of red 2d men. If. Soul was left on the open for to long it would start to float away and it would be lost forever and the green men would fly box kites as a memory of their lost friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this rings a bell please tell me the name of this game. I have a case of nostalgia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-29T17:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat system did you play it on?
