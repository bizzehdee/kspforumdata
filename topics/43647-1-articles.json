Some paths going between the different buildings. It would make the whole space center feel connected and like a complete facility, rather than just some buildings next to eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbals walking/running around the different buildings. Imagine how funny it would look to see kerbals running between buildings, possibly tripping because they are so clumsy. And at some stage, perhaps rocket launches could take place while you are choosing your building, and all the kerbals would go running to cover because nobody told them the rocket was launching! Or just because Jeb hijacked it. Either way, it would be funny and make it feel much more lively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
