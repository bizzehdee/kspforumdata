All was normal, when the first two boosters where empty I jettisoned those, and all was normal.. Or so I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen suddenly I noticed a marker flying a few 100 meters from my ship. It must have been my spend stage.. But it was coming towards me! It missed my ship and flew up faster than my ship was going! It flew for about 50 seconds and then died in its acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had nothing on the spend stages that could have given it a boost. The tanks where spend and there was no other propulsion on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made these two screenshots in the map view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VhqGuDk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VhqGuDk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fy0UP0W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fy0UP0W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T17:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDat space kraken...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProjectXMark1","CreatedById":58759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T17:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin\u0027s been practicing its \u0027Monolith\u0027 state \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T17:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah... same thing happened to me earlier...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6TUXEtfl.png\u0022 alt=\u00226TUXEtfl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T18:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDat Kessler syndrome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
