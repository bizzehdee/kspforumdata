I\u0027ll probably put some sort of timer on it, so it only activates after X seconds, \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E over a higher threshold. I will look into the no fuel issue, but are you using combined tanks and just loading no O2 in them? If that\u0027s the case, the gauge is detecting the fact that you have 0 of (some amount of O2 above 0) oxygen on board, and correctly illuminates the low fuel warning. The best solution then is probably to have a separate low/no O2 light (and xenon, by extension), requiring a texture re-work. I can also add an inhibitor function, that disables individual annunciators (turns them... blue?) when clicked on. There is a stall warning on the air gauge, and SAS is in the HUD and main UI, so I\u0027m not inclined to duplicate that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ap0r","CreatedById":100383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T23:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso after more playtesting, it\u0027d be great if clicking on an unlit Master warning, cycles between hiding/showing the warning panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaster caution illuminates -\u0026gt; Click shows the warning panel, master caution resets to off, clicking again hides the warning panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo lights illuminated, but you want to check the warning panel for some reason?
