I set mine to 1.0 but now I\u0027m DEEP in my career and I\u0027ve seen 1.0 is too easy. ( I don\u0027t even need any heat shielding ) So I edit my latest save and change the heat from 1.0 to 1.2 but it only works for THAT save. After I save again, somehow the NEW save is back to 1.0? Very strange. Any tips on how to KEEP it at 1.2 without starting my career over?\n\n2nd: How do I (In career mode) open up the debug menu? I\u0027ve heard some people talk about being able to edit some things in there to make the game more realistic and difficult (the way I like it) VS so easy a 5 year old can get to the Mun. That\u0027s fine and dandy for a 5 yo but im an adult and I want an adult challenge in this Sim/Game. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks you guys.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T08:46:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solar71**"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:27:54Z","Content":"I can help you with #2:\n\nAssuming you are using windows it is ALT\u002BF12. It has a whole bunch of options, but I personally recommend against messing with most of them other than perhaps the visualizations for physical forces since those can help you decide what is going wrong with a ship. Instead, if you are looking for a more difficult game you might want to check out the mods forum. There is a whole host of mods that make the game more challenging in different ways (for example, the Real Solar System mod re-scales the entire solar system to be realistically sized and changes engine values to be more realistic)."},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:33:38Z","Content":"#1 is fun\n\nOpen notepad\n\nOpen your persistent.sfs for that career save in your saves folder make sure you have the dropdown set to all files.\n\nCtrl\u002BF then copy this in the search: ReentryHeatScale\n\nEdit your reentry heat scale\n\nPress Save when your done.\n\nBAM."},{"CreatedByName":"Solar71","CreatedById":140993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:06:06Z","Content":"To JT.\n\nThat worked perfectly... Thank you very much!!!\n\nPS: I made your changes and I just did a reentry ... Very nice and shallow ... AP at 78k and PE at 62k on final orbit.\n\nHit 70k at 2300 m/s, 2000 kelvin max temp on my capsule, I got it up to 1860 kelvin before I was able to deploy chutes. now THAT was close!!!\n\nNo heat shield BTW. But this is how I like to do it. Very very careful (shallow) on reentry or BAM!!!\n\nThanks again man. This game has just become challenging again!!!"}]}
