I\u0027ve been researching everything I can on NERVA but it\u0027s a bit hard because some of the specs I\u0027ve found on NERVA rockets were for proposed future versions. So I tried to focus on the actual engines that were tested and versions of which would have ended up on Saturn rockets until the project was defunded. The following pages I\u0027m finding most interesting. So far discussion is focusing on things like fuel tank mass and fuel-tank mass ratios, but none of that really affects anything but your final TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was curious as to just how the fuel consumption of the LVN (especially the modified one in this mod) actually would stack up against real life counterparts. It\u0027s hard to find information about that because there\u0027s so MUCH of it available and for things like wiki entries I\u0027d LIKE to be able to trace down sources so it\u0027s taking me a while\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is wiki page that lists specs for a NERVA-2 engine very close to what we have in KSP except that it had a thrust rating of 333.6 kN. Information is provided not just for the engine but for the entire Saturn third stage it would have driven. I had to make some assumptions on how much of the consumables were H2. For simplicity\u0027s sake I went with 100%. The result is that it consumes 120kg of H2 per second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed the thrust for the LVN (for this mod) to match and it burns through 1,831 kg of H2 in 1 min, 23 sec. That\u0027s about 22 kg/s so it\u0027s consuming quite a bit less. The stock/modded version with 60 kN of thrust (the equivalent of NERVA1) consumes about 5x less. Quite a big discrepancy but it\u0027s a discrepancy in our favor since it means the engine is much more fuel efficient than we\u0027re giving it credit for. We\u0027re just not carrying enough H2 around. Given how light it is we can carry quite a lot of it. My test ship had 6 drop tanks that it jettisons in pairs as they empty. (using fuel hoses to route fuel as appropriate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do question though whether or not H2 should maybe be made denser, but then we start getting into volumes, so how much do we actually know about fuel tank volumes? I\u0027ve seen the term \u0027kerbos\u0027 bandied about as a hypothetical unit of volume as opposed to just using liters, kL or m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. But I never really understood why that was. Is it because we don\u0027t really know what these tank volumes represent?

Look at how massive some of the Saturn stages were. I haven\u0027t seen anything in that neighborhood yet but then the largest tanks I\u0027ve used were 3.75 (from the KW Rocketry pack)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket tanks are really massive. And I\u0027m leaning back towards something I said in my earlier post which is that we just need to get used to carry massive amounts of H2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean really, NERVA has to be considered our entry-level nuclear rocket... that\u0027s all it ever was IRL with better rockets down the pipeline. Or research different nukes using different propellants like ammonia. I have no idea what the performance characteristics of that would be though....

I\u0027ve been researching everything I can on NERVA but it\u0027s a bit hard because some of the specs I\u0027ve found on NERVA rockets were for proposed future versions. So I tried to focus on the actual engines that were tested and versions of which would have ended up on Saturn rockets until the project was defunded. The following pages I\u0027m finding most interesting. So far discussion is focusing on things like fuel tank mass and fuel-tank mass ratios, but none of that really affects anything but your final TWR\u003Cp\u003ESo I was curious as to just how the fuel consumption of the LVN (especially the modified one in this mod) actually would stack up against real life counterparts. It\u0027s hard to find information about that because there\u0027s so MUCH of it available and for things like wiki entries I\u0027d LIKE to be able to trace down sources so it\u0027s taking me a while\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is wiki page that lists specs for a NERVA-2 engine very close to what we have in KSP except that it had a thrust rating of 333.6 kN. Information is provided not just for the engine but for the entire Saturn third stage it would have driven. I had to make some assumptions on how much of the consumables were H2. For simplicity\u0027s sake I went with 100%. The result is that it consumes 120kg of H2 per second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed the thrust for the LVN (for this mod) to match and it burns through 1,831 kg of H2 in 1 min, 23 sec. That\u0027s about 22 kg/s so it\u0027s consuming quite a bit less. The stock/modded version with 60 kN of thrust (the equivalent of NERVA1) consumes about 5x less. Quite a big discrepancy but it\u0027s a discrepancy in our favor since it means the engine is much more fuel efficient than we\u0027re giving it credit for. We\u0027re just not carrying enough H2 around. Given how light it is we can carry quite a lot of it. My test ship had 6 drop tanks that it jettisons in pairs as they empty. (using fuel hoses to route fuel as appropriate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do question though whether or not H2 should maybe be made denser, but then we start getting into volumes, so how much do we actually know about fuel tank volumes? I\u0027ve seen the term \u0027kerbos\u0027 bandied about as a hypothetical unit of volume as opposed to just using liters, kL or m3. But I never really understood why that was. Is it because we don\u0027t really know what these tank volumes represent? Or are there other reasons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe isp of nerva engines can reach 1000 with ease, and if we use better materials so the core can reach higher temperatures then the isp increase even more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those values that you mention are from the 60s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to make a nerva engine is with radiators to release the heat using a brayton cycle so we not need to shutdown the core, and we will generate electricity when we dont needed to thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good about nerva engines is that only needs H2, this is the half of the fuel that chemicals rockets needs and we can get this from water, using the core to separate h2 from water and we have fuel again.
