The most prominent movement is moving Jool to Kerbin\u0027s orbit, changing its color, heightening its atmosphere, and putting Kerbin in orbit around it. Now, this makes the Jool-5 challenge roughly ten times simpler. So I thought, \u0022How about we have a challenge for Alternis Jool too?

I love to experiment with new world mods, but my experience is that if your challenge needs installing mods it will seriously reduce the number of people interested in it.
