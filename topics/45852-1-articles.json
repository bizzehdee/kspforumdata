I\u0027m using stock parts, other than MechJeb2 to help fly this thing. (I don\u0027t consider it cheating, since even the Apollo missions were flown by computer.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a small 2.5m rocket in the middle, surrounded by 8x symmetry long trusses, with a hitchhiker storage container on the end of each. There\u0027s a bunch of other anciliary stuff, batteries, lights, solar panels, SAS modules. This rocket\u002Bcolony, on it\u0027s own, should be able to get from munar orbit to the surface, in one piece, according to MechJeb2\u0027s calculations. The total passenger compliment is 32.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design of the rocket part of it is a bit odd, I think, but functional. It has a single engine, but is 2 stage. The single engine is in the middle, with a small fuel tank on top of it. Each of the hitchhiker pods has a small fuel tank on top fo them too. That\u0027s the final stage. Then, on top of the middle engine\u0027s fuel tank, I have a stack separator, and a large fuel tank. Ringing the large fuel tank are a few of the solid fuel seperator motors. The idea is, the fuel from the top tank gets used first, during deorbit and initial deceleration for landing. Once it\u0027s dry, it\u0027s ejected *upwards* (and to the side somewhat, since a few seperator engines are sideways) and the remainder of the colony ship lands gently on the surface of the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is, of course, getting this monstrosity into munar orbit. And I\u0027m determined to do it in one gigantic launch, rather than launching space tugs, or refueling ships, or anything practical like that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been learning that asparagus staging, while useful, may not be the way to go for this. It takes an awful lot of power to get this thing aloft, somewhere around 8 mainsails on my first stage, to lift the colony and the stages in between. With asparagus, it would be losing an engine each time it dumped an empty tank, and even starting with 13 engines, it just doesn\u0027t get high enough before that happens, and the loss of the engines means there isn\u0027t enough thrust to keep climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027ve attempted to build it is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder the colony lander engine, I\u0027ve stacked an orange tank, with a mainsail on the bottom. Around that, in 4x symmetry with radial decouplers, are the same, orange tank with mainsail under it. That\u0027s my center 5 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, under each of the hitchhiker pods is another orange tank and mainsail, so that\u0027s another 8 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat on it\u0027s own launches fine, would even less than half the engines, but doesn\u0027t have nearly enough delta-v for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I did basically the same thing again underneath. However, this one needs around 8 of the engines going to be able to climb, and if I run the 8 outer ones, then when they run out and I eject them, I\u0027m not high enough for the 5 remaining engines to keep me climbing. I\u0027ve stuck 3x8 booster rockets outside the 8 tanks, to fire along with the first 8 engines, but it still doesn\u0027t get me high enough to continue the climb with 5 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, with all the struts needed to keep things in one piece, my ship is over 800 parts, and my fancy new gaming rig is running KSP at around 4 FPS, but with MechJeb doing the flying, the framerate doesn\u0027t matter quite so much. Once I start ejecting stages, I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll improve a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m wondering if anyone\u0027s succeeded in getting something this size to the Mun in one shot, using stock parts? (other than MechJeb, as previously mentioned)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions for approaches to redesigning the ship?

The stage that gets it from LKO to orbit around the Mun is another 50 tons, so I needed to launch 130 tons to LKO. I ended up using the Supernova launcher from the Zenith launch vehicle set, which I can\u0027t recommend enough.

It\u0027s able to maintain a pretty steady 18m/s on the surface of the Mun, while remaining very stable.
