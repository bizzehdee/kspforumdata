It would be nice to know what is the most efficient TWR to get into LKO. I think the \u0022efficiency\u0022 could be judged by how long it takes to get into orbit. I know from experience as long as at every stage separation your speed accelerates, things are optimal. OR Maybe SSTO might simplify the experiment. You could use Engineer or Mech Jeb to collect the TWR numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts about all I could come up with first thing in the morning, but will give it more thought as my day moves ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.

We have talked about the wing shapes (straight vs swept vs delta) and which is faster or more efficient. Using the fuel (or dV) remaining after a set distance travel is pretty good metric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I guess fuel remaining would be best for jets as neither engineer or MJ can calc the dV for an air breathing engines. However, the only problem with fuel efficiency is that it will depend a lot on the pilots flight skills. Even with the same rig, no two flights will be the same. For level flight for a given distance we might ought to be able to automate it or fly consistantly but getting to orbit might be aiming a bit high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oooooh, bad pun, bad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T19:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that the KSP aerodynamic models, probably even with FAR, are good enough for something somewhat scientifically accurate like what you are suggesting, but I could be wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe something with orbital maneuvers would be better instead?
