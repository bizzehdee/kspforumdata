I am very new to KSP, only been playing for about a week. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically what is happening is whenever I build a ship using a module that came from a mod, once I go to launch there is no crew in the capsule, even though the description shows that it has a capacity of 3. I am currently using KSP .16. It seems to happen on any mod I try, Kosmos, the Deep Space one, Gemini capsule, etc. I really feel like I\\\u0027m missing the obvious. I\\\u0027ve tried searching to see if I can find anything else similar and I\\\u0027m just not finding anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something else I need to do to get the crew to show up? I feel that it\\\u0027s something obvious that I\\\u0027m missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6677","CreatedById":890,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T09:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bug with KSP, just means to mod hasn\\\u0027t been updated to use the new config layout of version 16.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the game is in alpha still the standards on how things work will be constantly changing often breaking compatibility with some things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunter182","CreatedById":23653,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T11:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot the same problem.
