I present to you the Davon Station Logistics Hub: the outsourcing solution for your resupply needs in the Kerbin locale. After transportation and proper activation of the Station Logistics Hub, it allows fuel resupply missions to the station to be undertaken by Davon industries on your request as part of Davon logistic services.

After transportation and activation of the station, to be executed by KSP as described in contract 14-4626, Davon will start to offer its very affordable logistic services(tm) as set forth in aforementioned contract in regard to the so deployed and activated station. Upon a suitable service request by KSP, Davon will employ automated spacecraft to resupply the asset and make available any such resources to KSP operations on location. Read manual before use. Limited to Kerbin and its moons. Delivery time may vary upon location. KSP compatible docking port not included. Terms of service apply. Cost overruns will, presumably, not occur unless they do, regrettably, and lie with the emptor.

This \u0022supply activation\u0022 requires the you\u00A0to already have developed some supply capabilities yourself. This way this part will not start to deliver relatively huge amounts of fuel while the player does not have the rockets and skills to do so. To supply activate the station proceed as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nsupply it with the same resources the module is used for, transfer them into the station and press Supply. Repeat until Supplies is at 100%. Station should remain static throughout this procedure. Unless you have some very serious heavy lifting capability you will have to make at least one or two additional fuel supply runs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTo successfully supply-activate the station, it\u0027s orbit should remain stable throughout this phase. It will reset your progress to zero if is doesn\u0027t.

The fuel delivery is delayed and the delivery time is dependent on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, for example Kerbin 2 days, Mun 6. I\u0027ve tried to make the time a little bigger than the time it would take to do these resupplies for real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The size of the resupply is based on the empty part of the station\u0027s tanks at the time of making the request. So think before you make a request, because resupplying the entire part costs a lot of funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-After activation the station can be moved without serious consequence. However\u00A0during the time between request and delivery its orbit should again remain stable. Furthermore the station will fail to operate on an orbit which greatly exceeds the orbit on which is was activated.

Much more RP than Hyperedit and allows me to avoid launching my heavy tanker for the 15th\u002B time when I would rather do other fun things. I docked this to a space station in orbit and then docked and retained my heavy tankers used to activate as storage. I then can run this a few times and offload it to those heavy storage tankers.
