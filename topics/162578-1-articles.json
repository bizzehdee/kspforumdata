It also hides the navball every time. I would love it if it just remembered the state it was in last time I was there... is there a mod that does this for me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-27T12:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe navball is in the game\u0027s settings. \u00A0For the rest, when you say \u0027right click everything\u0027, do you mean showing the numbers at the various orbital points?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mscottveach","CreatedById":178822,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-27T22:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s right. When I\u0027m looking at the tracking view. With the maneuver nodes and orbit paths... I\u0027m often in a situation where I want to see my AP/PE numbers and I want to see the distance to my target and so on... all of the numbers I can see my mousing over the item in question and if i right-click the item it will pin the information up so I don\u0027t have to mouse over. That\u0027s all great. But I often flip back and forth between this view and the 3rd person view and everytime I return to the tracking screen all of the right-click pinned information is gone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe place where this really gets frustrating is when I am very close to a ship I am going to rendezvous\u00A0with... because for me when the ships are that close, clicking on them becomes a nightmare of fiddly-ness, ha...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this question make sense? I\u0027m new to the game so maybe there\u0027s a solution that\u0027s obvious to this that I missed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
