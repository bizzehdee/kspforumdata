When we want to patch the consoles we merge PC commits and work on the custom code and assets that are needed to make it run on the consoles. The console builds then have to go through certification with the console manufacturer (Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo) before we can make them available. As a result the consoles are likely to run a little bit behind compared to the PC releases, but we will keep updating all platforms as we move forward.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-27T19:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[who cares]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-16T14:24:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2016 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Violent Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
