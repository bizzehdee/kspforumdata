Usually by the time my lander makes it back into orbit, there isn\u0027t much left of it. I\u0027ve done missions where multiple landers all dock with a single transfer vehicle to take them home, but nowadays I mostly just spend a few minutes moving Kerbals, science, and any leftover fuel to the transfer ship and leaving just enough fuel in the lander to crash it into the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
