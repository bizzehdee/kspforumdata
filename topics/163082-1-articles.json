I was thinking of watching them come down, but since Kerbin was rotating I had no idea where it would come down. Anyway, I overdid the time warp and they both impacted and disappeared off the radar, without me seeing where they landed. All I know is that it\u0027s somewhere around 50\u00A0degrees north.\u00A0Is there any way I can locate them? Would my orbiting survey scanner be of any use? Would I see a dot of ore concentration?
