Not too bad, it just took me 7 years to get an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Lost contact with my probe on route, couldn\u0027t figure out the range of antennaes. (deactivated that option, had to reload a quicksave for it to take effect)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The rings are simple lines with no depth and no collisions like we see in the latest trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The rings are at zero degrees tilt, so they appear very dark up close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Dres\u0027s surface doesn\u0027t have collisions. My lander went through the surface at 2m/s and then I decided to let the singularity whip me around a few minutes later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be watching the updates to see when Dres\u0027s surface gets solid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T20:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Dres conspiracy continues... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T20:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair, I could forgive the devs for thinking no one would ever actually go to Dres.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I guess they didn\u0027t go in QA testing either.\u00A0 Or perhaps the real truth is that the QA department was a hologram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T20:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBro...
