You want to be parallel earlier than 70km, though; where, exactly, depends on your rocket\u0027s thrust profile. The Kerbal Engineer Redux mod can give you very important orbital parameters (apoapsis and time to apoapsis, particularly) to help with that; if you can\u0027t/won\u0027t get it, fly in map mode to see what your apoapsis is.
