Take the Vector: 4t heavy, 1MN of thrust, usually placed on 20-40t heavy shuttles for your average STS replica. Now consider the RS-25 (SSME): 3.5t heavy, thrust over 2MN, usually placed on a 70t shuttle (or a 3000t rocket but that\u0027s not the point here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlacing 3 Vectors on your shuttle can account for a third to half its mass which is a lot, and will put your CoM way at the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Variety_Pack","CreatedById":165988,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-02T18:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this post is pretty much right at a year old but I\u0027m gonna revive it anyways.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m having this same problem. I\u0027ve built a shuttle and it works really well if it doesn\u0027t veer too far off course during ascent. The problem, as far as I can tell, is pretty much exclusively the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E being waaaay too twitchy. If you stare at the little pippers indicating control inputs, you\u0027ll see that they snap wildly around. Sometimes the shuttle makes it to orbit with enough fuel, often the shuttle wiggles too far off course, occasionally it even throws itself too far in a direction and enters a sekrit backlip mode or a speshul\u00A0flatspin ascent profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way I\u0027ve found to counter this is to use my joystick, but I feel physically exhausted after 6 minutes of Jedi-quality midichlorian-tapping predictive flight correction. It\u0027s truly tiring but I can get to orbit just fine. Also, the gigantic shuttle tailfin is too big and causes a huge torque moment, but there isn\u0027t really a suitable replacement so I just disable the control surface or reduce it severely. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheels can be sufficient for yaw if you have enough of them, although I just rely heavily on\u00A0Vernor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, if there\u0027s an improvement to be made in the game, it would definitely be the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control. It\u0027s too spastic and it doesn\u0027t predict trends like a human or a decent algorithm. Instead of damping wobbles it amplifies or exacerbates with too-strong of course corrections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
