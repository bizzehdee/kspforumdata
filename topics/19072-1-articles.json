I was going through, messing with settings and had to restart KSP multiple times. I decided to see if it would be faster if I kept KSP on my faster hard drive rather than trying to load from a flash drive every time. There is a noticeable difference based on the read speed of whatever you are loading the game from. Those of you with SSD\u0027s are lucky, but even going to a 7200RPM hard drive is a massive improvement over trying to load from a USB stick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John F.
