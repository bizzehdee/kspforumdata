It seems like a really easy, fixable problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 17:50 in this video, when I see the ship\u0027s trajectory, I can\u0027t see the numbers next to the Apoapsis. That drives me absolutely crazy!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a matter of seconds to plot the maneuver and execute it to get the ship into orbit. I shouldn\u0027t be bothered to fiddle with the UI settings during that time, and I shouldn\u0027t have to do anything. It should \u0022just work\u0022 and show the information that I need, so I can get to the proper orbital altitude without wasting a bunch of fuel. I *don\u0027t want* to mouse hover over the node to see the numbers. I *don\u0027t want* to click the little lock icon to make the numbers stay visible. That\u0027s fine for fuel tanks and battery status displays, but with this map view stuff the game should be smart enough to know the minimum information I need based on the context. I should rarely if ever have to fiddle with this UI to get the right information visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came up with the following simple rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Always show the numbers for the selected object\u0027s current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E (except\u00A0 possibly when editing a maneuver node).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. When editing a maneuver node, while I\u0027m clicking and dragging to edit the maneuver, always show the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E of the revised flight path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. While I\u0027m editing a maneuver node based on a set target, always show what the shortest distance from the target will be on the current/next orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor these three scenarios I should never have to hover or click on anything to get this information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really is that simple. Please make it so.
