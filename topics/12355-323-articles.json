Whenever I turn on autopilot, it suddenly and sharply turns the plane a little, and then lets it tilt back to prograde, and then turns sharply again, then back, repeating every half a second. Doing so then causes the plane to stall.\u003Cp\u003E(I am running FAR... does that have specific requirements?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found you need to manually horse the plane around to point in the general direction of the runway, then set the slope to 10 degrees. Otherwise the autopilot is never going to get the plane turned around the right way and will fly it into the ground or ocean well short of the runway. When you get close enough you can change the slope so it will get down to landing altitude. At the 10 degree setting, adjust throttle to the point where you\u0027re either not losing altitude or are very slowly losing altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I still haven\u0027t managed to do is get a plane down from orbit to a low enough altitude to make a landing at KSC from the west. Always end up way too high and overshooting. Most likely need to fly manually and downwards until reaching a low enough altitude, but not so low as to hit those pesky mountains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent guidance in Build 340, in the limited testing I\u0027ve done so far on a couple of modified stock planes in .25, seems to be somewhat more useful with planes. I manually flew up to jet flameout then engaged the AP while switching to rockets. It didn\u0027t go for straight up but continued to fly like a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you have a plane with very high TWR with a design that can get off the runway with a quick rotation - without breaking pieces off - you don\u0027t want to try using ascent guidance from launch on planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to have several control points on the ascent profile shape would be very useful, especially if the lower section could be curved the opposite direction for horizontal takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just need to modify my \u0022Hot Needle\u0022 spaceplane spaceplane refueling tanker some more so it can actually carry enough fuel to orbit to refuel the modified Stearwing which made 70K orbit with about .25 unit of fuel left. That was despite replacing the cargo bay with a short tank and inline docking port. I also replaced the toroidal LF drop tanks with six of the ReStock drop tanks. Only used about half that by flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stearwing flies great, until it runs out of fuel, then it has the glide ratio of a lawn dart. As a spaceplane it\u0027s mainly useful for stranding Kerbals in orbit, assuming you can get it to orbit before running dry. Definitely requires modding to make it a useful craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T05:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow do i launch into a chase orbit, say i want to be 8 hours or 120\u0027 behind/ahead of another satellite in the same orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T08:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022endl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022endl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow do i launch into a chase orbit, say i want to be 8 hours or 120\u0027 behind/ahead of another satellite in the same orbit?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t help with your question but do you realise that the Kerbin day is only 6 hours long...?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T09:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossible that the desired orbit has a period of 24 hours, the Kerbin day is only relevant for synchronous orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tempes156","CreatedById":65696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T14:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022endl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022endl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow do i launch into a chase orbit, say i want to be 8 hours or 120\u0027 behind/ahead of another satellite in the same orbit?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one way, maybe not the best, but works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Get into an orbit that is lower, or higher if your other object is in LKO, by about 20 to 25km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Select target once you are circularized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Create a maneuver node and move it around until your new orbit is the same as target and the distance on orbital map \u0027looks about right\u0027 by watching the markers for nearest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Make the maneuver and circularize.

MJ will set up the initial de-orbit burn correctly, and displays the RED target icon on the surface where the target coordinates say I\u0027ve selected. The BLUE target, which is supposed to indicate where the ship is actually heading, fixes itself at some odd location, seemingly 180 degrees from where the periapsis of the orbit intersects the surface. When MJ makes the first adjustment in the deorbit burn, it sees this odd location as the \u0022floating\u0022 target. MJ then dutifully rotates the ship 180 degrees (retro-grade to pro-grade) and tries to make that BLUE target meet up with the RED target. That BLUE target doesn\u0027t move at all, and MJ will burn every drop of fuel in the tank in the process. MJ is apparently either reading those coordinates from an erroneous variable, or is calculating the coordinates incorrectly. If I kill the LGAP before the correction burn, that BLUE target will immediately jump to the correct location, and track the corrections I make manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. MUN -- Similar situation. The initial deorbit burn begins correctly, but when it gets to the \u0022fine tuning\u0022 portion of the burn, the burn hangs. In one landing attempt, the correction burn never occurred and the lander completely missed the landing target. It ended up slamming into the surface close to the periapsis intersect point farther downrange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logs are not showing any Null Refs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinux Mint 17, 64-bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.25 -- MJ dev 341, FAR 14.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arthour05","CreatedById":27280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T20:22:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bdito\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bdito\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Mechjeb part is in the control section of the VAB.
