But, remember\u2026 a change to how something works from one build to another is not necessarily a bug. We\u2019re in\u00A0\u003Cu\u003EEarly Access\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0and we\u2019ll make changes to how things work at times to see how that goes and iterate on that over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EHow long does fixing a bug take?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInvestigating a bug takes time to get a precise scenario for the engineer to address (that\u2019s why the steps and info above can help). They will then do their own investigation on the fix itself (what it would take, what parts of the code would be affected, how risky of a fix it is, could it break other parts of the title, etc). Once that\u2019s approved there is a code review of the changes that were made. Then the change is put into a specific branch/build of KSP2 where testers will do full investigation of the original bug and do halo testing around the areas that the code affected. Then, finally it goes into a release candidate build along with a bunch of other fixes and it gets tested again in a very deep regression suite of tests to ensure that other (supposedly unrelated areas of the product) still function as expected. There\u2019s actually even quite a bit more to it than that - but it\u2019s a good summary of how we do things here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EHow do you test a game as complex as KSP2?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Space Program is\u2026.. huge. I\u2019ve owned the testing of products that ship to hundreds of millions of users that had a simpler test matrix than KSP2 does. There are a LOT of areas, processes and stages of testing a product, and I\u2019m not going to go into all of them here (it would be a doc 20x longer than this). So, this blog is mostly focused on end-user reported issues and how we deal with those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut with regards to complexity our KSP2 Test Lead Josh who\u2019s been playing KSP since 2013 \u0026amp; testing it for the past 5 years, put some information together:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Talking about the complexity of construction, and variables for potential issues, there is a consideration on why something may not be known, tracked, or reproduced before.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow unique is your vessel? It\u2019s straightforward to test parts in a vacuum (the \u201Cby itself\u201D kind, not specifically the \u201Cno air\u201D kind) and confirm that all the bits and pieces are functioning as designed. However, interactions between various parts are where we often see things go sideways. There is a hierarchical interaction that can cause problems, and compounded by where it was placed relative other parts, when it was placed (order of construction), which is further exacerbated by what was done before the vessel was made and how it\u2019s been flown.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELet\u2019s break down possible iteration numbers to give an example as to the potential complexities available in KSP 2:\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIf you were to use every stack attach part that has a top and bottom stack attach node in every possible permutation without duplicates, it would be factorial 245, which translates to a number 481 digits long.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFor reference, the estimated number of atoms in the known universe is only about 10^80, or an 81 digit number.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESo\u2026 The above is interesting, but not realistic.

What about just using specific parts together in general in no particular order (combinations)? That has to be a significantly smaller number right?

For example, it\u2019s likely after an engine you probably are not placing another engine, or even a fuel tank (usually it\u2019s a decoupler or separator). But what if, buried in your vessel somewhere, there\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewere\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E2 engines stacked atop one another, and then that was vertically translated into a fuel tank and then hidden?

This is by no means the only game to have this many potential variations to consider, and it won\u2019t be the last, I am sure. The one take away is this, the more information that can be provided with the circumstances something went wrong, the quicker we can identify the issue. Attempting to reproduce issues with just a list of the 20 parts used to create a vessel? That could take a VERY long time.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that being said - someone on the team did the math and even with our entire product team testing on a particular build of KSP2\u2026 our total user base will pass that time spent testing within hours of release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe use a matrix method that combines every feature with frequency of use across all hardware combinations and operating systems.

And things like \u0022this dev team is useless and inexperienced\u0022 are just hurtful, cmon people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-04T21:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224279922\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683228884\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222320\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stephensan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Stephensan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow about having built IN the game... it gathers all your data (it has to be approved by the player), and you can report it in the game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat won\u0027t work if the game crashes, or if there are screenshots to be included, etc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224279945\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683233349\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI AM on the other side of the development veil.\u00A0 I get bug reports on stuff I\u0027ve built from my end users daily.\u00A0 And I have NEVER changed the format of what I am asking them for.\u00A0 Like, ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat works if when you start asking, you specify everything needed.\u00A0 It seems to me that they didn\u0027t even know what to ask for\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-04T21:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224279945\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683233349\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI AM on the other side of the development veil.\u00A0 I get bug reports on stuff I\u0027ve built from my end users daily.\u00A0 And I have NEVER changed the format of what I am asking them for.\u00A0 Like, ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, that\u0027s fine.
