It was on sale for less than 3 dollars (or something like that) on steam for the \u0022May The 4th Be With You\u0022 sale. I\u0027ll just say I\u0027ve sunk more hours into Battlefront II then I care to admit (though I had a few buddies who liked to play with me). I can\u0027t speak for other people, but I\u0027ve personally found a lot of replay value. Republic Commando is a good game, though I haven\u0027t played it on Windows 8 (Yet) I\u0027ve heard it works fine. One thing to keep in mind is that official multi-player services have been discontinued (for both titles), though there are still ways to play on servers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T05:46:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ival70\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T06:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have only played Republic Commando on ye old Xbox, but I found it a very immersive game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe presentation of the HUD really helps with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd unlike most FPSes, the game was pretty tough!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T12:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERepublic Commando is extremely good!
