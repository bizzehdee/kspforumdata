I used to hit F5 it would just save to \u0027quicksave\u0027 but now it is bringing up the menu to name the save, like I hit alt-F5.\u00A0 This used to work.\u00A0 Quickload (F9) is having the same issue.\u00A0 Also you used to have to hold F9 to get a quickload.\u00A0 I checked the help on controls in encyclopedia and it says it should work like I remember.\u00A0 If they changed it they would likely fix the help too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas this broken in 1.7 or is it a problem on my end.\u00A0 I have no mods and never have.\u00A0 I do have \u0022making History\u0027

confusion.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have had this happen rather often on Windows, maybe because I use keyboard shortcuts a lot, and stumble into corner cases that the keyboard driver never debugged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-30T07:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it should happen sometimes but not always.It

working for anyone because I tried it on 2 different computers with the same result.\u00A0 Then I asked a friend to try it and he had to reinstall KSP first and then test.\u00A0 He got the same result as me, so I figured it was the game.\u00A0 Now I might have a problem again.\u00A0 I\u0027m going to try pressing and releasing alt, then trying it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wneubert","CreatedById":197175,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-30T13:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, did some more testing and think it\u0027s \u0027mostly\u0027 solved.\u00A0Pressing and releasing alt didn\u0027t do anything.\u00A0 Since I was testing on a new game I tried loading an old one where it worked, it still failed.\u00A0 Then I loaded a\u00A0quick save from that game\u00A0and it worked then!\u00A0 Further experiments seemed to prove that it always worked if you were in a rocket.\u00A0 If you were just at the space station it worked incorrectly.\u00A0 Maybe it was always like this?\u00A0 I can\u0027t remember since I took 6 months off playing and came back to try out the 1.6 and 1.7 changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut another weird thing happened during the test.\u00A0 I made a simple rocket (command pod, mk-16, flea).\u00A0 I know this rocket goes to 12000m, BUT, it went to 24000!\u00A0 And going straight up 24000m is death because there is no safe time to deploy the chute.\u00A0 I need to figure out how this happened because I am certain it\u0027s not right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-01T03:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, F5 and F9 do bring up the choice of named saves, when used in\u00A0the Space Center view.\u00A0 It does so in version 1.3.1, so maybe always like this.\u00A0 I can see how it makes sense, as you have a fresh persistent save at that

didn\u0027t change because\u00A0before the Flea pretty safe for beginners without them doing more advanced stuff like lowering the fuel.\u00A0 So you could just slam together the most basic rocket and it was easy to survive.\u00A0 Then a revelation when you try a hammer you learn that falling from a great height is a very bad

12,000ish.\u00A0 I watched an old video with 2 goo pods added, and it went to 10,000 which is what I remember with added weight and drag of the

113,000.\u00A0 But now, just a hammer alone takes it to 153,000.\u00A0 Maybe it was wrong before and they fixed it, but it might be wrong now.\u00A0 I was planning to introduce a friend to the game
