I believe heat is only modeled on the active vessel. Most of that time that is not an issue, as it is still very difficult to exploit. Even your \u0022using it as a shield\u0022 example is not really a viable exploit because you could just not decouple the debris and let it explode. By the time it does, most likely you will be through most of the heat and you have still effectively used it as a shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
