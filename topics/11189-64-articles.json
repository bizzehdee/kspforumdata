Then after circularizing, the transfer burn to Mun. After a couple of parking maneuvers I dropped the rover on the surface and went for a good ride (Tatanka rovers fear nothing, they are a very fun ride).\n\nGot back to orbit, RV, docking and home. To discharge some fuel I went for a rocket braking instead of an aero one.\n\nLanding was difficult, the rover was wobbling with SAS on, but I did it.

I called this one Tweety.\n\nThat\u0027s a very nice minimalist spaceplane. Great use of the radial engines.\n\nAnd now for a spaceplane of my own, the Emergency Retrieval Spaceplane Hayato MK1.\n\nThis is my first successful mission to LKO and back with a spaceplane, also my first time landing in the runway. I designed this one for rescueing stranded kerbals in orbit (the contract ones).\n\n![1024x576.resizedimage](http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/23970208759010587/3937F6D1F4EEA81B183338518E2A43F403394EE1/1024x576.resizedimage)\n\nThe ascent wasn\u0027t very efficient but it got there with a little less than half of its fuel left.

The Gull Wing project went all the way to Gull Wing 12, an attempt to build a payload shuttle to carry fuel to orbit. But we always burned more fuel than we carried. So we went back to rockets. \n\nThe Gull Wing 1 was our first successful orbital space plane. The breakthrough came when we stopped using any of jet fuel fuselage components at all and use only LFO fuselages. Back in version 0.24 that meant using exclusively rocket fuselages. \n\nOn the runway\n\n![screenshot1139.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1139.png)\n\nWheels Up\n\n![screenshot1143.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1143.png)\n\nSub orbital\n\n![screenshot1148.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1148.png)\n\nOrbit achieved\n\n![screenshot1153.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1153.png)\n\nDeorbit maneuver plotted\n\n![screenshot1154.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1154.png)\n\nReentry - \n\nWe were a little high on our deorbit perigee point, (This plane is a lot lighter than the ones I use today) so we will overshoot the KSC a little bit, will have to turn around and approach from the water (that is what the actual space shuttle does IRL)\n\n![screenshot1165.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1165.png)\n\nComing in for a landing\n\n![screenshot1173.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1173.png)\n\nNothing in the rules said you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do this.\n\n![screenshot1175.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1175.png)\n\noops, not quite on the runway.\n\n![screenshot1178.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1178.png)\n\nLittle bit of taxiing\n\n![screenshot1179.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1179.png)\n\nOn the runway, 100% recovery.\n\n![screenshot1181.png](http://benmargolis.com/ksp/Kprize/screenshot1181.png)\n\nK-Prize please!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T11:51:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brainlord Mesomorph**"}]}
