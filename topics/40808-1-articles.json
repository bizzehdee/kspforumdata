That\u0027s not a problem when you\u0027re building a rocket typically, but if you\u0027re trying to build multiple units it really makes it difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to do either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELoading Units\u003C/span\u003E - an example would be I build one ship, save it, then start a new ship. I could then load the first ship I built as a modular component and add it to the new ship. An example of this would be: I build a rover pod/small ship, then I build a primary ship and attach the rover/small ship to it so it\u0027s staged as two systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDetach and build separate\u003C/span\u003E - this is pretty simple. Basically when I detach from the primary pod I can still keep building. So I could build both of these ships in one viewing, then just link them when I\u0027m ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow I worked around this:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my first rockets I got into orbit, I then brought back down to earth. I have a recovery unit I built that I could just fly out, pick them up and bring them back. It was a tiny unit designed to land on a fairly flat/stable surface to pick my guys up at. The problem this time was that the pod landed in a rough terrain area that I couldn\u0027t land in. I kept crashing when I tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided the next option would be to build a rover that i can drive out there and pick the guys up with. I never built a rover before, so first I just built a rover and tuned it as I tested it on the airfield. Once I was happy with the rover I could do nothing with it since it didn\u0027t have enough power to go out, get the guys, and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO I then decided to do a carrier drop. So I built a gigantic aircraft with a carriage unit on it. I then tried to build my rover the same way, but I was faced with a very difficult challenge because I have to build the rover onto an existing craft. I couldn\u0027t build it on the ground then drag it and link it to the ship. It was extremely tough to do, I had to really work around the kinks of the system to make it work. It took a good 4 hours or so, but eventually I got the rover built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fly the aircraft over the stranded pilot, slowed down, did an inverted move up, ejected the rover then quickly changed views to the rover. I enabled a rocket boosted on the rover to carry it away from the aircraft and control it towards my guy. I deployed a parachute, landed it about 300m away from him. Walked him to the rover, drove it back to base. (Side Note: I know there\u0027s an archived post on sequenced stages, that would also be a HUGE benefit. To tell my system \u0022Eject Rover, 2 second delay, enable boosters, stabilize, eject parachute @ 1000m, etc.. - instead of having to switch to a component then control it while my aircraft eventually crashed somewhere since it wouldn\u0027t let me switch back while in the air)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a ton of fun, a very challenging mission, but unfortunately I think the fact that I couldn\u0027t build it and attach to the ship made it the hardest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnother Example\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now in the middle of building a large rocket with an explorer unit (remote controlled) that I can deploy to planets first, drive it around to find a suitable landing zone. But again I struggle to build these units on a ship just because the building seems to be centralized around the primary pod and won\u0027t let me build apart from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the long post - I wanted to explain the use of my idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ixolate industries","CreatedById":59366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T15:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had problems like this as well.
