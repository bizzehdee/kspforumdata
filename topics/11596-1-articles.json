Video starts at an altitude of about 41KM right before the engine ignites for descent and spans until touchdown on the Lunar surface.\n\nSpecial Thanks to GoDammit for his Kerpollo parts pack.\n\nEDIT\n\nI didn\\\u0027t feel challenged enough by this landing. I felt I had a little too much fuel, so I modified the CFG file to carry even less and this time landed with about 14 percent fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T01:40:01Z","Content":"I also need to mention that for some reason, the LM landed on its contact probes.

For example, when I landed with one of my ships, I actually appeared to be sitting about half a meter off the surface."}]}
