I would like to do this in a balanced way, however. I don\u0027t want anything that\u0027s overpowered, so I need some way to figure out what kind of numbers for mass and electric charge I should be plugging in to the cfg file. The reason I want this part bigger is because there are some interesting physics glitches associated with trying to cram too many of these close together. Many of the things I have tried to build using these will simply tear themselves apart. Any help would be awesome.

Balanced by what metric? Since you\u0027re asking for mass and EC/s numbers, I am assuming you mean balanced by output per mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, it\u0027s easy to figure out what you need. Just take the stats of the normal RTG: It weighs 0.08 tons and produces 0.75 EC per second. Therefore it has an Ec/s/t rating of 0.75 / 0.08 = 9.375. You could even just say \u002210\u0022 for simplicity if you wanted to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow invent whatever mass you want this to have. Let\u0027s say it weighs 0.45 tons, because why not. Then you just insert that into the same equation: x / 0.45 = 9.375 And then solve for x = 9.375 * 0.45 = 4,21875\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say 4.2 Ec/s for 0.45t and call it a day. If you like a different mass - or want to define a specific output and want to find out what mass is suitable - it\u0027s just as easily solved for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sizzlechest","CreatedById":127814,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T20:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI forgot about TweakScale, but it only increases the size of the RTG by 200%; I\u0027d like to possibly go bigger at some point, so the math to figure out output per mass is very helpful too.
