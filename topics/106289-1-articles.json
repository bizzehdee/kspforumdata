The sure look hollow. Does that mean I can clip a medium reaction wheel into it without cheating?\n\nThe Kerboderbodyne adapter is also hollow so I think I should be able to put reaction wheels inside that too. To me it seems wasteful to have a big hollow thing on my rocket. I\u0027m sure NASA wouldn\u0027t stand for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:03:04Z","Content":"You can clip anything into anything.\n\nIncluding fuel tanks into other fuel tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:03:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can clip anything into anything.\n\u003E Including fuel tanks into other fuel tanks.\n\nYeah but that would be cheating because they\u0027re not hollow!"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:35:53Z","Content":"I would, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s cheating"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:45:33Z","Content":"They probably shouldn\u0027t be hollow... where do the big spinning wheels go?!"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:04:56Z","Content":"The 2.5m torque wheel has a long standing visual bug. The visual model matches its old purpose, which was a small pack of electronics, under the long gone old SAS system. You can see the small bulge which would be the processor pack. The model wasn\u0027t updated to reflect the new contents of large, heavy, spinning wheels (which would require lots of supporting structure, to transmit the torque, even if they didn\u0027t take up most of the space, leaving none for filling it with random stuff).\n\nIf you don\u0027t want to cheat by clipping something into something that wouldn\u0027t be possible in reality, then yeah, putting stuff inside the 2.5m torque module is cheating. Other than something like contests, where it would be up to the contest judges to decide, it\u0027s 100% down to you individually to choose to cheat or not to cheat. There\u0027s absolutely nothing wrong with cheating in a non-competitive, offline, single player game; as long as you are actually honest with yourself, as it\u0027s just silly (and arguably damaging to your long term mental state) to cheat and deny it."}]}
