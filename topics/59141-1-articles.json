But i feel like I haven\u0027t really completed my mission. Because in my head to complete my mission, I need to land correctly, As landing is a big part of it. So i\u0027d like to know how to land what i\u0027m not doing. I end up crashing or falling on the side. (It takes alot of F9\u0027s) So how do i land or what im doing wrong, I\u0027m aiming retrograde marker thrusting slowly so i don\u0027t start going upwards by accident.

It sounds like you\u0027re doing it basically right. You can do yourself a favour by building your landers wide with a low centre of gravity. Use your navball, try and get that horizontal velocity as close to zero as you can.

You can quite often right yourself using pod torque, RCS, and/or retracting and extending the legs. Even if you can\u0027t you can often take off ok from lying down.

Lots of practice in the demo helped in the real game. Make sure you are landing on the light side of the moon, so you can see and mountains and whatnot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommended method:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave SAS on the whole time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with a low orbit, for moon about 12 kilometers. Then, burn retrogade, until your periapsis just dips below the surface and disapears. This way, you are at first coming in for a shallow landing so you are not flying strait towards the ground at high speeds, but rather slowly towards the ground, but really fast side ways. Then, warp until you are 10 ish kilometers from the ground. Burn retrogade until your speed is near 100 m/s. Warp a little more, yes you will start speeding up again. Warp until maybe 5 kilometers. Then, burn retrogade again, (this should still be near the horizon ish). Your retrogade marker should slowly start climbing upwards, and thats okay, just follow it. Once you are going vertically down, keep your speed under 30m/s. Check IVA view every once in a while to see your actual altitude, the one at the top of the screen is to sea level, and mun clearly doesn\u0027t have seas. Once you are under 1 kilometer or 1000 meters, try to keep your speed under 12 m/s going completely vertically down. Once you see your shadow getting bigger on the ground, or you know you are really close, stay near 5 m/s. Don\u0027t throttle too much or you\u0027ll go back up again. Land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Minmus is a little harder to get to, but much easier to land on, i highly recomend it first.

Get into a stable orbit first, then retrograde completely horizontal until your orbital velocity is zero. Once you start falling down, you will drop almost straight down then it only takes slight adjustments to correct and leaves your craft upright the whole way down. Landings were extremely difficult for me to figure out until I found this trick. To find a flat spot (or mostly flat), set a marker on your orbit above a spot that looks good and free of craters, using the retro adjustment to get a vertical line. Once it is vertical, you can drag it around your orbit until it is in just the right spot to give the best chance at a smooth, vertical descent onto flat land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmarterThanMe","CreatedById":58706,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T02:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat everyone else said regarding practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming that you\u0027re not using MJ (or you\u0027re early in the game where you don\u0027t have any useful MJ components), but this is how I do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that your ship is equipped with a decent engine, reaction wheels and RCS. It\u0027s best to build a bottom heavy ship. Towers and top heavy things tend to topple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a maneuver node above the approximate area where you want to land that completely zeroes your orbit and brings you down in almost a straight line. Execute that node. Point the tip of your straight up, gear down, SAS on, RCS on (and lights off, as well). You\u0027re no longer going to move the ship from this axis unless you desperately need to. Use RCS boosters in small increments to zero the difference between your orbit speed and your surface speed (click orbit speed to change). You can tell which direction you need to adjust by where the prograde/retrograde markers are and keep in mind that you might need to adjust further on your way down. Once its zeroed, hold on, and ride it in. You need to reduce speed using your main engines when you\u0027re close to touching down (say, the last 10 km). When you\u0027re in the last couple of hundred metres, reduce your speed down to around 7m/s and try to keep it around there all the way in. You can tell when you\u0027re close because your shadow will converge on you, so use that as your guide. Cut off your engine the second you make contact, or immediately before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how I do it, but, again, it needs practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T09:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat legs does it have?

There are a lot of flat areas that are easy to hit and the KerbalX can do a land and return mission stock, unlike the Mun mission. To help throttle control , when you are low and slow over the body you are trying to land on, try limiting the thrust of the engine via the engine\u0027s right click menu (especially good on minus, as KerbalX needs only ~3% thrust for hover there, so 10-20% is enough. For Mun i would recommend 30-50%).\u003Cp\u003EAlso regarding technique, there are two main reasons the rockets fall on the side: 1) too high horizontal velocity when touching down and 2) ground slope is too big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst can be reduced by training. (When landing keep an eye on the retrograde marker, if it isn\u0027t in the middle of the nav ball, turn the rocket in it\u0027s direction, while slowly descending. Also make sure the speed indicator is in \u0022surface\u0022 mode, minmus has mountains high enough for it to automatically switch to orbit and mess everything up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond can be fixed by picking a better landing spot or making the rocket have low center of gravity and long landing base. Also when landing on slopes, remember to cut all power as soon as first leg touches the ground! SAS also can help in stopping the rocket bounding left and right after touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
