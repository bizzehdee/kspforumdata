Basically my xorg.conf uses the \u0027nvidia\u0027 linux driver for the left two and the \u0027intel\u0027 driver for the right. Running in this mode unfortunately doesn\u0027t let me use __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS. I should probably invest in a pair of video cards so I can just use only the nvidia driver. Either way I see much better frame rate and physics processing speed using 1 monitor with the threaded opt.; i.e. the mission time numbers are mostly always green instead of yellow indicating the physics is able to run in real time.\u003Cp\u003EUh, so in summary I guess I could have just said \u0022you\u0027ll need a fairly beefy machine to run multi-monitor KSP while streaming or recording.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod looks like a great step in a new direction in regards to multi-monitor KSP though, I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently we have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KSP on one screen while using Telemachus in a browser on another screen to display info and controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-One KSP instance on one screen showing flight view with an ENTIRE other instance of KSP showing the map view syncing across their persistent.sfs files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KSP on one screen while using telnet to kOS in a terminal on another screen to display info and send commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new option looks very promising!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I think you are very wrong!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t blame KSP for your problem with using two different video cards \u0026amp; drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would guess that on ANY os, using two different sets of drivers at the same time would cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELGG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I just tried it, and am getting an error from Windows saying that it couldn\u0027t change resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I may need to change the nVidia settings to make them all look like one large display\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Looks like it is an OpenGL error, it starts up when I don\u0027t use that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be a problem, since I need opengl to run.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T05:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T05:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOpenGL error\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoted, will have a poke at it shortly.
