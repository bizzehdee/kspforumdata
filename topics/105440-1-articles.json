I just put some capsules on top of my radially attached boosters and decoupled them with the parachutes as soon as I was above 70k. My original craft didn\u0027t make it to orbit after that and the pilot ended up extremely dead. Also, I had a Kerbal on EVA during a suborbital flight, and I didn\u0027t pay much attention to my altitude. Once I hit the atmosphere I deployed the parachutes and my Kerbal made it all the way to the ground (well, splashed down into the ocean) and survived reentry while on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a sneaky suspicion that this is all linked to the same kind of bug that Scott Manley found in the livestream. These boosters with parachutes, Kerbals on EVA, etc, are all still being treated like the parent craft with respect to the aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T06:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures and craft files are really helpful for trying to replicate these sort of bugs.

For some reason I thought that if I had a command module with the parachutes that it\u0027d still be able to figure out that it was going to splash down successfully. I\u0027ll keep an eye on it in the future, although with my 2nd craft (which has 5 of the starting command pods on it), I can ferry a lot of crew around the Kerbin system quite easily and probably don\u0027t have to drop them off on spent stages anymore (until I develop a comfortable way of doing it - you know, hitch-hiker style. I have to apologize to all the tourists for the cramped quarters every time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Bill did a high dive through the atmosphere, I didn\u0027t notice any reentry effects on him the entire way down either. When he splashed down, he went 16m beneath the ocean and I couldn\u0027t gain control of him until he was back up on the surface. I imagine he would have perished if he\u0027d hit the ground, but I was hoping that he would have turned into a BBQ long before that was even a possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
