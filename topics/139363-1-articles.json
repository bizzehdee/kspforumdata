I thought it was a good read, and it explains a lot of different things such as\u00A0types of orbits, Kepler\u0027s laws, orbital decay, etc. Anyway, here you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/space/au-18-2009/au-18_chap06.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/space/au-18-2009/au-18_chap06.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T05:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one tiny correction. While true anomaly is often used as one of 6 orbital elements, it\u0027s not a constant of motion, so if you look at orbital perturbation theory, it\u0027s more common to see T - time of periapsis. It is a fixed quantity for any orbit, so it\u0027s one of the constants of motion. And difference between current time t and time of periapsis multiplied by 2 pi divided by orbital period\u00A0gives you mean anomaly M, which can then be converted to true anomaly. This is typically how you\u0027ll see orbits treated in most textbooks on orbital mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin vonKerbal","CreatedById":157973,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T06:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222570318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139363\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462770279\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one tiny correction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMakes sense, thanks for pointing that out. I didn\u0027t read too deeply into it, just read a few of the orbital positions and types of payloads that fit with different orbits and their purposes, and so on. Just thought it would be interesting to those who are into that kinda thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
