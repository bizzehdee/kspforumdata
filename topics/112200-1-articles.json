I can\u0027t seem to get anything to attach to them. I\u0027ve tried fuel tanks directly, using docking ports, girders, struts and so on but nothing will connect. I see the small green \u0022bubble\u0022 just fine but that\u0027s where it stops. \n\nI only have mechjeb installed at this point. \n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T21:23:05Z","Content":"Hold alt button while trying to attach a part, that should force it to attach to the green \u0022bubble\u0022 (connection node) and not to anything else."},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T21:52:31Z","Content":"Try moving the camera around a bit, sometimes it works when you look at it from a different angle, like 90 degrees to the place where you want them to go."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T02:44:59Z","Content":"Also, first attach the cargo bay to something solid (fuel tank, cockpit), then attach the item - as if you were attaching it to the same wall (tank, cockpit).
