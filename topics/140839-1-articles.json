It is directly about the state of the game and makes no more statement or ideology than the developers did when they made this decision. If this goes against forum rules, I apologize and someone can feel free to lock or delete this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Valentina\u0027s been wearing the orange suit for a while now, and I\u0027ve had thoughts running through my head this whole time about that. Before we had female kerbals, in my head-canon kerbals were plant creatures without gender who reproduced via... I dunno probably budding. Now that we have female kerbals, this completely changes the dynamics of kerbal life. It gives kerbals a reproductive life like our own, with all the complexities that brings. It draws all the controversy in real life into KSP and drown it in a sea of politics. For example, now that bathroom segregation is apparently a thing, when I build space stations it always crosses my mind whether to have segregated crew quarters or not. Of course in real life there are plenty of mixed-gender missions, but I tend to picture kerbals as children and not nearly as mature as real astronauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t really bother me that much, it\u0027s fairly easy to deal with and there are mods to change it, but in my mind it was not a good development decision and opened the door for KSP to become a lot more controversial than it is. I can already picture an outcry over why there are THREE male orange suits and ONE female one. In my games she always ends up being the \u0022backup\u0022 pilot, the one who goes if Jeb isn\u0027t available. That means she ends up doing a lot of tourist contracts by herself in the Kerbin system while Jeb Bill \u0026amp; Bob are off exploring the solar system. I feel kind of bad for her, but yet if there was a whole crew of female kerbonauts I would always be picturing them as upstart rivals to the three veterans that I\u0027ve grown attached to. I think it would have been better to keep the kerbals gender-neutral and avoid all this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else thought of this, or am I floundering way off in the deep end?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, everybody please keep this clean and follow forum rules.
