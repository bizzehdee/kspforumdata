How much fuel do you have left once in a stable orbit around the Mun? IF you use a bunch of fuel to get there, that might be your problem. Ideally you\u0027d have over the 3/4th. First you want to start rather low, a 20km orbit is nice for landing on the Mun. Then you want to do a slight deorbit burn to start losing altitude and head to the ground. Don\u0027t set maneuver nodes, they\u0027ll distract you too much. Just look at the navball and burn at the retrograde marker. Then, when you\u0027re getting rather close to the ground, just start burning retrograde all along. Don\u0027T let your speed go too low else you might end up going upwards again. Just slow down gradually until you\u0027re near the ground. Then try as much as you can to cancel out any horizontal speed by slightly burning retrograde until the retrograde marker is pointing directly up. Then, you just let yourself fall slowly to the ground and adjust the throttle to get a soft landing. It takes a lot of practice, but eventually you\u0027ll get it fine ^^ Quicksaves (F5) and quickloads (F9) are your friend here.

But I can still give out some information on how I did it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically launching with the Kerbal X is easy, it has a really high TWR. However, it doesn\u0027t have enough delta V to get on a circular orbit without using the lander\u0027s fuel. I had to decouple the main stage during the circularisation burn, but that didn\u0027t eat up too much delta V. Then I just set a maneuver node to the Mun, just as usual, took about 840m/s of delta V. Then I circularized at an altitude of 20km, the lower the better. Landing from there wasn\u0027t so complicated, the lander has a ridiculous TWR on the Mun (about 15, really it\u0027s ridiculous). So you can do a small deorbit burn and come in really shallow, you\u0027ll be able to slow down don\u0027t worry. MechJeb got me very worried, and started the breaking burn at 1km from the ground. Really I was scared for a second. But it went perfectly well and clearly showed how ridiculous the TWR is. Basically, don\u0027t come down steep. You\u0027ll loose too much delta V fighting gravity. Come in shallow, and burn retrograde at around 2km from the ground (be careful, the altimeter gives you the sea level altitude, not the real one). If you slow below 100m/s, stop burning, you\u0027ll waste fuel. Really, the Kerbal X can do 100m/s to 0m/s in just above 5s, so don\u0027t be too scared. Just watch the ground and slow down when closer to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as you can see, it\u0027s really tricky.
