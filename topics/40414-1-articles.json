I\u0027m new on the forums too, although I\u0027ve been playing KSP for over a year now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Mun is smaller and closer than Earth\u0027s moon, I tend to find that it\u0027s easier to simply have an extra stage on your Mun rocket, so you have a stage or two to get up to space, a stage to enter Low Kerbin Orbit around 80 km or so that then transfers you to the Mun, and then your final stage can complete the landing and return to Kerbin. This way you don\u0027t have to deal with the difficulties of orbital rendezvous and docking, EVA crew transfers, or building your launch vehicle large enough to carry your heavy lander rockets, the extra crew cabin for landing, and all the heavy RCS fuel that you need for the docking operation (until you get the hang of it, docking will require lots and lots of RCS.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re ready to learn rendezvous and docking, I suggest putting up two small one-man capsules with lots of RCS on them (make sure you align the thrusters with the Center of Mass), so that you have plenty of fuel to learn how to adjust your orbit to find a rendezvous, and if you run out of fuel in the first vehicle, you can just switch over to the second and complete the docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisWill","CreatedById":77045,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T20:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks dshuck, great idea I was able to make there and back into orbit of kerbin and then I ran out of fuel and can\u0027t deorbit but I\u0027m probably going to use it and practice rendezvous and docking with it in order to rescue them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T21:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking and rendezvous can be quite difficult, it takes many (failed) attempts to complete but one day you will get it and feel like a ksp champ.
