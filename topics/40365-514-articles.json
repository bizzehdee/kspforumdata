A ship powered with this method does need radiators for other sources of waste heat (plasma thrusters, etc.) but the generator itself won\u0027t ever generate waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you use a microwave \u003Cstrong\u003Eelectrical\u003C/strong\u003E receiver, it doesn\u0027t matter how many radiators you put on, you WILL get an overheat-induced shutdown. I tried using 24 Large Flat Radiators in one case and it still overheated. It could be you need to dissapate the total recieved power of your microwave power network to avoid an overheat, but I don\u0027t know for sure because I have something like 400GW of power available on my LKO microwave net (Antimatter power rules, and I can afford paying for it instead of collecting it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: Something in the microwave power code is messing with waste heat generation or radiator effectiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat should always be generated in proportion to (power demand X all inefficiency factors).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the thermal planner is wrong in a bunch of places. Thermal source temperatures on a few reactors show up wrong (Kiwi/SAFE-1500/Agelates), and using base values for radiators when it should be using upgraded ones (sethlans/ akula reactors cause this, so do microwave thermal receivers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-flight checks reveal that the correct numbers are being used there, so the thermal helper is the thing at fault here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least it always underestimates the performance you would actually get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re talking about bugs, I noticed that several engines re-calculate their \u0022maximum thrust\u0022 value depending on how much power is available. That\u0027s fine, but the calculation currently used to do that seems to factor in the current throttle setting. This seemingly little thing has huge effects. It makes MechJeb unable to use plasma thrusters or magnetic nozzles to land, because it can\u0027t tell when to start the braking burn. It also throws off maneuver node execution, and even the stock maneuver node burn time estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the thrust-to-weight estimates that MechJeb produces in the VAB are never accurate. The delta-V is right, but the TWR and burn time are not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETO VERIFY:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMust have KSPI and MechJeb installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse a 3.75m magnetic nozzle connected to the upgraded AIM reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt zero throttle, MechJeb reports 1 nanokN thrust available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrack the throttle open even a little bit, and MechJeb reports the expected maximum of 675kN thrust available, and that doesn\u0027t change until the throttle is at zero again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked at the code for the magnetic nozzles, and it seems like maximum thrust should only depend on reactor size vs nozzle size, and reactor power. Somehow, the current throttle setting got in there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma thrusters display similar symptoms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse a 1.25m antimatter reactor to power a 1.25m plasma thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch, MechJeb has the same estimates as it did in the VAB. As soon as you apply thrust, MechJeb will re-calculate to be somewhere close to correct. Full throttle, it will change to the correct values. Near-zero throttle (probably around 0.5% or so), MechJeb will over-estimate the maximum thrust the engine can put out by a rather obvious margin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother bug with plasma thrusters is that if you have more than one plasma thruster, one engine seems to lead the others by a single physics frame for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes MechJeb\u0027s landing autopilot absolutely useless because the torque from the unbalanced thrust will make it cut the throttle instantly when it tries to start the braking burn, meaning it \u0022stutters\u0022 the engines all the way into a crash landing unless you take over manually. I can save a ship that encounters such a situation, but I\u0027m sure I spend more fuel than MechJeb would, and I\u0027m always off target by at least 100m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the thrust estimation bug with magnetic nozzles means that MechJeb will crash the ship because this happens: Engine reports \u0022effectively zero max thrust\u0022, MechJeb commands full throttle, engine reports \u0022675 kN max thrust\u0022, MechJeb commands engine off, repeat until impact at high velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ship has LFO engines as well as KSPI plasma thrusters and magnetic nozzle engine, MechJeb will crash if I try to use either of the KSPI engine types, but it will land nominally if I have just the LFO engines active. This means that the problem is with how certain KSPI engine types change their max thrust depending on throttle setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T17:16:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaoservices","CreatedById":107953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T18:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy to say I don\u0027t play KSP without this mod!
