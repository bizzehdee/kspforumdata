A very basic model that doesn\u0027t utilize the physics engine could be included without nearly as much effort as the other tasks they are working on (more planets, inter-stellar, career-mode, etc). Yeah people will complain that it isn\u0027t realistic and yeah they will have to apply the current physics model to it eventually, but until then it would be a nice graphical improvement to the game. Especially for those of us who don\u0027t like mods. The game gets pretty dull without them after a while. =/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, my concentration is Web Design, not game design, so what do I know. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 1: Planets most certainly are difficult. First you have to design a giant planet to scale. That means plenty of 3DS Max (days to weeks), then you have to texture it. (Photoshop I assume?). Then you need to set its parameters and make sure they\u0027re accurate within the current celestial laws of physics. Then it needs moons, so repeat the last steps a few times. Then you need to figure out how the moons orbit the planets based on the laws of physics, Then how the planet will interact with the sun, then make sure its orbit won\u0027t disturb any other moons/planets. THEN you have to add it into the already existing game code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat seems like a lot more work to me then using PhysX to generate some random particles to make a meteor shower in the background. (Pretty sure they\u0027re using PhysX already), but like I said I\u0027m a web design guy. My knowledge of code is just that, coding with MIPS and C\u002B\u002B, nothing about applying it to a game.
