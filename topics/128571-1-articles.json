Because water is like a soft mattress and the ground is like a pavement that is made up of klaws that grab any part and destroy it no matter how soft the landing is.

If you go in too steep on land, there\u0027s a chance that at least the command pod will survive, since the exploding parts of the craft don\u0027t instantly explode, and will slow down the rest of the craft a bit. If you go too steep in water, the parts evaporate with minimal effect on velocity of the craft, so a \u0026gt;50m/s steep landing will consume your craft, no matter what angle you slam down at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted that is all from my experience with my lagbeast fleet of shuttles and SS/DS-TO.
