I advance both 2\u00A0pilots and 2\u00A0support people\u00A0this way However, I thought it was expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started thinking of ways to do a 4 passenger lander with capability to land on both the mun and minmus within my \u0027budget\u0027 of about 214,000 which is the cost of running my 4 passenger\u00A0lander twice. My initial thought was to make 1 rocket and then separate and dock with a tug module, a la Apollo. I discarded it, as I wasn\u0027t sure how to stack them. However I might come back to it, if I can make the tug module fit in an interstaged fairing. Or I could launched them docked, I suppose, with the tug over the lander.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought about launching the tug on a separate rocket, but that approached my current cost\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the absolute cheapest, I can slap a probe core on my 2 passenger lander which lets me put a passenger in the mk-1 pod and do the whole thing by launching that twice, which would cost me 88,000 total. But I\u0027d lose on the crew experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are people\u0027s thoughts. 2 launches or one? And if 1, how would you arrange it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional info, I have a station in kerbin orbit I could dock with and drain about 1100 units of fuel, but that would work out to about 600 delta V for my tug stage, and I have 2 stations in orbit around the mun that could provide about the same in total.\u00A0 I also have a refueling craft in an orbit about halfway to the mun with plenty of fuel, but I try to use that only for emergencies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-11T12:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely one launch. I usually hit Mun first. The transfer from Mun to Minmus is extremely easy. You won\u0027t have much fuel left, but you won\u0027t need much anyway. Landing and maneuvers around Minmus don\u0027t really cost anything, and you can free-return home. If you have lander cans or passenger cabins (which you most likely will), set Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to a bit above 40km instead of 30km.

You should always combine contracts to make them more profitable. Also, it sounds like you are overdesigning and overpowering your rockets. My TSTO spaceplane carries 7, gets to Minmus and back without refueling, and lands on the runway for full funds recovery of the spaceplane -- for 36 thousand kerbucks. Admittedly, it\u0027s probably higher tech than what you\u0027ve got. But the point is that you can trim\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ea lot.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EYou might want to think of it this way: a tourist contract is an opportunity\u00A0to get paid to go someplace you wanted to go anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, really, the question is what else can you do while you are carrying a couple tourists to Minmus or the Mun? You can rescue stranded Kerbals at your destination. You can ferry Kerbonauts and rovers and bases to your destination and leave them there to collect science. You can pick up Kerbonauts and their science from the destination and bring them back to Kerbin. There are contracts to grab wreckage and bring that back to Kerbin (to land gently). You can deliver small satellites to the destination CB\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. You can take scientific readings in orbit at the destination for a survey contract. You can ferry fuel from one orbital tanker or ground base to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, generally, I would advise\u00A0saving\u00A0up until you have several contracts at Minmus, and several contracts at the Mun, and then doing the two missions separately. And spending a bunch of brain cells figuring out how to do multiple completely different contracts in one ship -- rather than just a couple similar contracts in one ship.
