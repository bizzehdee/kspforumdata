I was building up a bunch of my \u0022favorite\u0022 mods in sandbox then switching to a career game. Career game was fine earlier, but now I get the kraken/space view upon trying to load a craft to launch pad or runway.\n\nI pulled everything out and the thing that keeps tripping it is RealChute. It\u0027s working great in sandbox, but maybe there\u0027s some sort of node or tweak feature that\u0027s hidden in a newbie career? Or maybe it\u0027s just a one-mod-too-many cooincidence.\n\nSimilarly, the only mod I have that\u0027s not explicitly 1.0-friendly is toolbar.\n\nAnd--of course-- running \\*just\\* RealChute has no issues at all. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n[EDIT:] So, after slowly the rest of my mods, Stock Bugfix Modules 1.0.0 was the bad match. Running only StockBugfix \u002B Realchute reproduced this issue. However -- starting up a fresh career game at this point seems to have \u0022fixed\u0022 it. I\u0027m sure pulling mods in and out does wonders for a save game, but this was a very specific clash with just those two mods. Replacing the rest of the mods back and everything is fine.\n\n[EDIT2:] Second epiphany--the new save crashed again--when my capsule \\*didn\u0027t\\* have a realchute attached (rather, I was using the vanilla part). Interesting! Going back and editing the craft back to having the realchute code allowed it to load and launch normally.\n\nRemoving StockBugfixModules again allowed the craft to load with a vanilla parachute.\n\nand...:[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988-1-0-x-Wenkel-Corporation-RealChute-Parachute-Systems-v1-3-2-1-28-04-15?p=1880466\u0026viewfull=1#post1880466](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988-1-0-x-Wenkel-Corporation-RealChute-Parachute-Systems-v1-3-2-1-28-04-15?p=1880466\u0026viewfull=1#post1880466)\n\nspecs:\n\nWin7\u002Ba couple handfuls of mods.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T06:59:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 06:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beetlecat**\n  \nAha!
