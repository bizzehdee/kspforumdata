Anyone who ever played Orbiter and went to the Moon knows that significant part of journey happens when the Earth is NOT a major body that affects the motion, but the Sun is - this is \u0022computer-melting\u0022 \u00A9 (Squad) n-body physics for you, which oddly enough works OK even on stone-age computers without melting them. Second - craft returning from the Moon has velocity of over 10 km/s, and as such can produce enormous lift if it\u0027s aerodynamic enough (remember lift is proportional to velocity squared!). So the vehicle can bounce off atmosphere almost without losing any speed, and therefore its\u0027 orbit apogee will be close to the distance to the Moon. Now, if it\u0027s lucky (or unlucky - depending on whether it\u0027s intended or not) and reaches apogee when the Moon is nearby, it\u0027s gravity will pull the craft towards it raising perigee out of atmosphere (again, this is n-body physics for you), and this spells doom for the crew. If you think it\u0027s too far-fetched - look at the Spektr-R radio telescope mission, which exploits such Lunar gravity boosts intentionally to raise its\u0027 perigee over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in KSP terms the Moon is outside Earth\u0027s SOI, which may sound rather bizarre until you recall that the concept of SOI is only applicable to objects with mass that is insignificant compared to the main orbiting body, and the Moon\u0027s mass is obviously not insignificant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T00:42:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by asmi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T11:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pappus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pappus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I built a rocket and throw a couple of jet engines on to create a kerbin ferry for those contracts that keep popping up and didn\u0027t want to waste anything so since I only have jet engines it obviously isn\u0027t a SSTO, but still I am wondering while de-orbiting this think as to how simple it is to avoid entry heating.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWOW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat an honor to meet the person who wrote the text for KSP contracts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T12:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo it sounds as though they were making the transfers between Earth and Moon a lot faster than optimum dV conservation would suggest (perhaps to save consumables?).

It was unknown if the landing site would swallow up the lander in a pocket of quicksand-like powder or if maybe the astronauts would succumb to such a fate on EVA. Only a few years before, 1 in 5 Titan rockets blew up. Astronauts and test pilots were dying with alarming frequency and only 5 years earlier some bookies were offering 1000 to 1 odds against man setting foot on the moon in the next 6 years. This was not a high-tech society, and Robbie the Robot was nearly state-of-the-art for science fiction cinema, and pop culture held that the moon was made of green cheese. This was long before Star Wars ever came out and before pocket calculators even existed. Imagine a time when a simple pocket calculator (that could only add, subtract, multiply and divide) was revolutionary -- this was before that! Slide rules were in common use and all telephones were corded, and it was a big deal to get a \u0022long distance\u0022 telephone call (one from another area code). People talk about how 9-11 changed the world, but not nearly so much as the moon landing. As Walter Cronkite said 4 1/2 minutes before Apollo 11 touched down \u00224 and 1/2 minutes left in this era.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I look at it is that they probably choose such a dangerous trajectory because that was the safest path they could achieve given the incredibly limited technology of the time. And compared to the other risks they were taking in this mission, this risk didn\u0027t seem out of line. This was an era when all recorded music was analog, and 8-track tapes were nearly as common as 12-inch vinyl records, and senior citizens were confused by the new term \u0022stereo.\u0022 Cars did not have air bags, anti-lock brakes, fuel injection, front-wheel-drive or even seatbelts that went across the shoulder/torso. Even watches with a digital display were cutting edge exotic and hadn\u0027t yet been perfected. If you wanted to change channels (there were 4 to choose from) on the T.V., you got out of your chair and walked over to the T.V. Anyone who was alive then can tell you where they were and what they were doing at the time of the moon landing.
