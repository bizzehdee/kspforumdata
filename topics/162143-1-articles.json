On Kerbin, just about when you start getting into problematic heating, you\u0027re already at the edge of the atmosphere. On Eve, you pretty much just got off the ground.

The L/D ratio says how much upward force the wings and body generate for a given amount of parasitic drag. For example, a glider with very long wings may have an L/D ratio of 50, meaning the upward lift produced by the wings is fifty times greater than the backward drag of air over the wings. In contrast, a Boeing 747 may have an L/D ratio of 17, meaning the upward lift produced by the wings is seventeen times greater than the drag on those wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportantly, the L/D ratio tells you how much engine thrust you need in order to maintain level flight at constant speed. A 747\u0027s engines need to produce 1/17th of its weight in thrust just to fight the drag produced by the wings.

L/D ratio is dependent on air density, airspeed, and angle of attack. As you climb, the air gets thinner and your L/D ratio drops. As you accelerate, drag forces increase quadratically and your L/D ratio drops. If you pitch up, your wings become less efficient and your L/D ratio drops. So you need ridiculously powerful, ridiculously efficient engines to continue thrusting harder so you can counteract drag AND have enough thrust left over to continue accelerating into orbit. The RAPIER is good for this because it has good specific impulse at all speeds and its thrust skyrockets once you are high-supersonic, which is precisely where you need thrust the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why spaceplanes won\u0027t work on Eve.

The theoretical minimum is the absolute minimum because it is calculated as the absolute minimum change in velocity needed to ascend to orbital altitude and meet orbital speed. In practice, it is impossible to even get down to that minimum because the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that there will be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wasted energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0possible is to use less\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efuel\u003C/em\u003E. Spaceplanes do this by using incredibly efficient engines that produce a greater impulse for a given mass of fuel than a conventional rocket engine, and by using the air as oxidizer for as much of the ascent as possible so that the amount of fuel spent lifting oxidizer for the engines is reduced. They do not require less delta-v to reach orbit than the absolute minimum, because that is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eimpossible\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing is lift. Lift will never decrease the required delta-v to reach orbit around a particular object because doing so is impossible. The reason heavier-than-air aircraft (which really should be termed denser-than-air) benefit from lift is because the wings cover a large enough area that the resisting\u00A0force of the air on the bottom of the wings is enough to counteract gravity. This is equilibrium. It is not free energy, which would be impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason spaceplanes use less fuel than rockets (again, not less delta-v) is because their engines are highly efficient while in the atmosphere. The reason rockets do not use such engines is only that jet engines do not provide enough thrust for use on a rocket, and that they only function in the lower atmosphere where there is enough oxygen in the air catalyze ignition of the fuel.

It doesn\u0027t work that way. the smallest thing missed or the smallest incorrect assumption and it is not true. Even if the physics theory is correct the outlining assumptions may not. And that is being generous. Nobody has fully explored the game. It\u0027s too easy to miss something. Hence the benefit of experience over theory. Theories are too easy to get wrong and when relied on push you to not try and find out(As the person who actually originally came up with the theory should have, or you should question it heavily). Experience on the other hand tends to lend itself to finding possibilities. Although not succeeding does not mean you can\u0027t. So the point of the challenge.

But something like lower stage rocket upper stage space plane off eve would count. It\u0027s about maximizing eve ascent to get more load no matter what!
