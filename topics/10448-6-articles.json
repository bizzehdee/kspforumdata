How I see the missions right now is that those that are repeating the \\\u0027simple\\\u0027 altitude missions are doing so out of (perceived) necessity, the higher missions give increasingly greater reward and thus there\\\u0027s no financial incentive to repeat low missions. That\\\u0027s how I want it to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I over rewarded some of the early \\\u0027high\\\u0027 missions, and because of the necesarry tech progression and cost reductions it\\\u0027s not really interesting to keep increasing rewards on increasingly difficult missions. This leads only to everyone being super rich. A bit like Awaras, who has been incredibly efficient, much more so even than I projected. I added the joint projects to keep things a little more equal, we\\\u0027ll see how that works out in the coming few turns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I did with the Kubble missions is a bit like the opposite of incrementally reducing rewards, instead the reward remains constant but the mission objective becomes harder each time you complete it. As of now, with the other missions I\\\u0027m not going to put in restraints yet, should they show up they will most likely be in the format of \\\u0027you can only fly this mission X times\\\u0027, not keeping track of how often everyone did the mission. It wouldn\\\u0027t be that much work, but it would be cumbersome to display for everyone and it would make the whole system weird in my opinion. Better to then lose the option to do a certain mission altogether I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, one of the things I wanted for this campaign was for the early missions to be attractive to complete using SRBs, and then moving to LFE with SRBs being cheap enough to still be used. I\\\u0027m seeing this in the crafts you guys submit, so I\\\u0027m happy with that. One of the things I\\\u0027m less happy about is how the current pricing scheme still heavily encourages single stage, small liquid fueled rockets. This morning I came up with a system that might change this, I\\\u0027m not going to implement it this time round but keep it in mind for any future rounds.. Basically all LFE\\\u0027s would have the same price (so you can actually pick and choose based on what suits the mission best), but the price for each subsequent engine increases. So say the first LFE would cost 5k, the second 7,5K, the third 10K and so on. Tech levels could modify this or even allow more engines on a rocket in the first place. I\\\u0027m liking this system in my head, but as I said I feel it\\\u0027s too much of a change to introduce this time around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Awaras; SAS, ASAS and Mechjeb are all allowed. In fact all parts are allowed except Rocket fuel tanks and rocket engines (also the Aerospike). Except those that make up the starter rocket, ofcourse. I will be flying the thing with mechjeb aid, but will fool around with it a bit to see how it handles. This also means that this contract is an exception to the \\\u0027I\\\u0027ll only fly it once\\\u0027 rule in that it\\\u0027s more the design I look at than a snapshot of performance.
