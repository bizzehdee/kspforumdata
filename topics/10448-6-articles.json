The crew manning Bellaby\\\u0027s capsule were made of sterner stuff than their Issarlkian counterparts, all the bellabians survived where Issarlk\\\u0027s captain sadly returned home sans crew. Two kerbals dead and their families have been compensated to the tune of 1300 monies in total.\n\n-Cheaper technology! ZOX Tech I has been purchased twice, the price has now dropped to a low $4500. Booster Tech and Salvage Tech I have been researched a couple more times as well, however they had already reached their final and lowest price points.\n\n-The design contest this turn had two very close leaders, **Awaras** and **Sal\\_vager** clocking in well ahead of the pack with ships sporting just 12 and 15 parts, respectively. Thus Awaras claims the bonus contract money.\n\n-I\\\u0027ve seen a fair few of you like to use the Aerospike rocket engine in your contract designs. This is fine, I\\\u0027ve not spelled it out as such but in contracts pretty much all stock parts are fair game, except those specifically ruled out in the contract rules of course. The aerospike engine hasn\\\u0027t been available for regular missions yet, as of this turn I\\\u0027m introducing \\\u0027Aerospike Tech\\\u0027. It costs just $1000 and makes unlocks the Aerospike engine at the same price and salvage level (and subject to the same reductions through Liquid Tech) as the gimballed regular engine.\n\n-Awaras has completed the \\\u0027complete one full kerbin orbit\\\u0027 mission, which unlocks the joint space station (which will unlock munar missions) as well as a few extra extended space operations missions.

The parts required are: 25x full LFT, 15x full large ZOX tank, 4x ZOX panel, 5x tri-coupler, 2x LFE (unused in flight), 20x RCS block, 10x RCS tank, 2x sLFE (unused in flight), 4x command pod (these last, as they will build \u002B occupy the station).

How I see the missions right now is that those that are repeating the \\\u0027simple\\\u0027 altitude missions are doing so out of (perceived) necessity, the higher missions give increasingly greater reward and thus there\\\u0027s no financial incentive to repeat low missions. That\\\u0027s how I want it to be. \n\nBecause I over rewarded some of the early \\\u0027high\\\u0027 missions, and because of the necesarry tech progression and cost reductions it\\\u0027s not really interesting to keep increasing rewards on increasingly difficult missions. This leads only to everyone being super rich. A bit like Awaras, who has been incredibly efficient, much more so even than I projected. I added the joint projects to keep things a little more equal, we\\\u0027ll see how that works out in the coming few turns. \n\nOne thing I did with the Kubble missions is a bit like the opposite of incrementally reducing rewards, instead the reward remains constant but the mission objective becomes harder each time you complete it. As of now, with the other missions I\\\u0027m not going to put in restraints yet, should they show up they will most likely be in the format of \\\u0027you can only fly this mission X times\\\u0027, not keeping track of how often everyone did the mission. It wouldn\\\u0027t be that much work, but it would be cumbersome to display for everyone and it would make the whole system weird in my opinion. Better to then lose the option to do a certain mission altogether I think.\n\nAs a side note, one of the things I wanted for this campaign was for the early missions to be attractive to complete using SRBs, and then moving to LFE with SRBs being cheap enough to still be used. I\\\u0027m seeing this in the crafts you guys submit, so I\\\u0027m happy with that. One of the things I\\\u0027m less happy about is how the current pricing scheme still heavily encourages single stage, small liquid fueled rockets. This morning I came up with a system that might change this, I\\\u0027m not going to implement it this time round but keep it in mind for any future rounds.. Basically all LFE\\\u0027s would have the same price (so you can actually pick and choose based on what suits the mission best), but the price for each subsequent engine increases. So say the first LFE would cost 5k, the second 7,5K, the third 10K and so on. Tech levels could modify this or even allow more engines on a rocket in the first place. I\\\u0027m liking this system in my head, but as I said I feel it\\\u0027s too much of a change to introduce this time around.\n\n@Awaras; SAS, ASAS and Mechjeb are all allowed. In fact all parts are allowed except Rocket fuel tanks and rocket engines (also the Aerospike). Except those that make up the starter rocket, ofcourse. I will be flying the thing with mechjeb aid, but will fool around with it a bit to see how it handles. This also means that this contract is an exception to the \\\u0027I\\\u0027ll only fly it once\\\u0027 rule in that it\\\u0027s more the design I look at than a snapshot of performance.

For now I\\\u0027m leaning to using his set of parts, I don\\\u0027t know if you guys have played with them, but they\\\u0027re a bit weaker than stock and feature very light decouplers, heavily favouring multistage designs. In fact I almost did this campaign with them, but I opted to keep it as much stock as possible to lower the barrier of entry.\n\nAnother thought I had, which is basically the same as Issarlks \\\u0027make em weigh more\\\u0027 is to ditch the standard \\\u0027capsule\\\u0027 and instead design a small plane/spacecraft and just say that that needs to go on every mission. I don\\\u0027t really like that though since it reduces design freedom, which is one of the funnest bits of the game.
