PULSAR: Lost Colony is a spiritual successor to Artemis - but with a twist. Just like Artemis, it\u0027s a multiplayer co-op spaceship simulator (5 players), but that\u0027s where the similarities end. A short summary of the differences below:\n\n- You\u0027re free to move inside your ship! The ship\u0027s systems are controlled by switches and holographic screens located in various rooms (Bridge, engineering, weapons, science lab, medical room etc).\n\n- You can use the ship\u0027s transporter to beam down to a planet or to board another ship.\n\n- The crews of hostile ships can also use their transporter to board your ship, so beware! You can use your phaser pistol to kill them (unfortunately, they also have phasers).\n\n- Planets and other ships often have useful loot, such as weapons, medical supplies and ship modules.\n\n- As mentioned above, ships can be upgraded at Repair Stations by swapping modules for better ones. Modules can also be bought and sold for credits at space stations.\n\n- Characters can be leveled up to improve their skills.\n\n- Characters can also be customized.\n\nYou can get the game at [http://www.pulsarthegame.com/](http://www.pulsarthegame.com/) for $25. It\u0027s Steam Greenlit so it\u0027ll be coming to Steam at some point and you can probably grab it during a sale if the current price feels too high.\n\nI and a fellow KSP Forum group member gave it a go last night and let me tell you, it\u0027s great fun even with 2 players! You can, of course, also add AI crew members to fill any empty slots if you feel like it, meaning you can have any combination of AI and real players. Or you could operate the whole ship alone, although that\u0027s quite difficult (I tried! It didn\u0027t end well).\n\nIf you like Star Trek, co-op games and spaceships in general, I strongly recommend you check this out! It\u0027s still in pre-beta but it\u0027s looking very promising already.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HY3V_vcwIbQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
