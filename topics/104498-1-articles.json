I haven\u0027t posted here yet, figured here would be a good place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027ve been fiddling with parts a little, I figured out the workings of the .cfg format pretty quickly, it shares a lot of similarities with the JSON notation Starbound uses. What I was wondering was, how do I make a new part based on an existing part? For example, if I wanted to take the Quad Nuke Engine from ModularRocketSystems and create a duplicate version of it that uses LiquidHydrogen from NearFuturePropulsion, how would I go about this? Is there a way I can have the .cfg for the new part be in a new folder as if it was a part created from scratch and simply point to the model and texture from the original part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine another solution would be to use modulemanager to make the Rocket be switchable between LFO and LiquidHydrogen, if anyone knows how I can do that, I\u0027d love to hear it, I\u0027d still like to know how to make duplicate parts though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E like to learn how to make parts from scratch, I\u0027ve modded for 3d games before, so I\u0027m already familiar with the modeling \u0026amp; texturing aspect, but I\u0027ve never done anything in Unity before. I\u0027ve read over the \u0022Making an asset from start to finish\u0022 tutorial on the ksp wiki a number of times, and have seen a couple on Youtube, but I\u0027m interested in knowing if there\u0027s a good tutorial more focused on the unity aspect of modding for people who already have *gotten their feet wet* in the modeling\u0026amp;texturing area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T07:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eon the cfgs...

Crzyrndm, your example was very helpful, I was able to change the NFPropulsion patch for the LV-N atomic rocket motor to make it create a duplicate of it that uses LiquidHydrogen rather than an LFO mix. I do plan on making some interplanetary vessels propelled by LiquidHydrogen, but I\u0027ve grown fond of the LFO rocket motors, since I can repurpose the LFO for new rockets when doing extraplanetary bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have another question, where can I find the meshes/textures for the buildings/launchpad/runway at KSC? They don\u0027t seem to be in the squad folder as far as I can tell, but I\u0027m interested in taking a look at them so I can make something based on them. I\u0027m interested in making some full-sized stuff for extraplanetary launchpads for establishing big bases capable of launching huge heavy rockets. I still have to figure out how to make parts from scratch, and I figured looking at some assets from the game would be as good a place as any to start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
