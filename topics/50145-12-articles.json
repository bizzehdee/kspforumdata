I\u0027m having a hell of a time launching anything other than the TH-NKR Science Lab into orbit however. I\u0027ve got a station started, the science lab is up there waiting. I\u0027ve tried the Cyclotron and the Zoology bay (separately), the Kibble stoage (both sizes). Everything results in a rocket that is wildly out of control (wobbling back and forth like crazy). I\u0027ve gotten plenty of things in the air, up to Mun and Minmus, but no approach I know of seems to work for me with this mod. Can someone post a screenshot of what they\u0027ve used to get things into orbit, or at least some suggestions?

The small kibble storage I\u0027m surprised you have problems with though. One trick I always use with heavy payloads is to put arms on my insertion vehicle with struts to stabilize the payload and additional struts from the arms to the lower part of the insertion vehicle itself. The angle of these struts provide a stable base that keeps the platform and vehicle from bending during launch, a particular challenge with FAR and taking fairings into account.

I am trying to add science experiments that will be of ongoing use to the BobCat ISS modules. My idea is to fly experiment resources to ISS on a resupply craft (as is the case in reality) and then use these in the Destiny, Columbus and Kibo laboratories to run the experiment racks and return science data to send back to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mod does almost all of this with it\u0027s experiments, they require resources work (as my experiment racks would require experimental resources to work). The only issue is I cannot use my own resource definitions with your mod, as you have hardcoded the resource types I think in the DLL? Is it a lot of work to create a config file that allows custom resources to be defined and scan that at start-up then use whatever resources are listed there? I realise I\u0027m asking for something outside this mod\u0027s scope but I think your DLL would be very useful if it did this.
