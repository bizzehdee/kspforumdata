There is some sort of bug with the planet surface, so when you return to the ship the game thinks you\u0027re in the air. There is clearly some error-checking code in there, because you do get plonked back down on the surface, but by that time the drill already thinks it\u0027s lost ground contact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere isn\u0027t much you can do. If you restart the drill it should work fine. If you babysit the craft it\u0027ll continue to work fine, even at high warp. If you go away, it\u0027ll probably lose ground contact again when you come back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently the mining that gets done while you are away is calculated when you return to the ship, so if this happens you\u0027ll never mine anything during the time you are away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically - move to another flatter spot (with no guarantee that it\u0027ll work... Pol in particular is a bit messed up), or babysit while you are mining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-10T23:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2016 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
