Baseball is definitely my favorite sport. In order, it\u0027s probably baseball, football, hockey, basketball, and then wayyyyy in the back it\u0027s soccer. I know, I know. Average American ha ha funny. Sorry, I\u0027m getting off topic. But, yeah I watched the baseball world classic, and I hoped that the U.S. would win, but I knew we were nothing compared to Japan. But hey, Trey Turner scored the first run! And speaking of Trey Turner, his performance has left me excied for the 2023 Phillies season. Sadly, Rhys Hoskins has injured himself, but Darick Hall really has potential I think. Now, obviously, I\u0027m a Phillies fan, but I do want to know what everyone else into baseball has to say about their teams and the sport in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-27T04:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe recent Ohtani vs Trout showdown was pretty dang epic. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
