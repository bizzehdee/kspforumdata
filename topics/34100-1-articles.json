Wish they didn\u0027t teach that in schools at ALL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EListen, you want to find out what\u0027s most important in generating lift? Go out on the freeway, driving at 70 miles an hour, and stick a hand out the window and \u0022fly\u0022 it up and down by adjusting pitch. The human hand is a TERRIBLE airfoil shape, but you\u0027ll still get huge amounts of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary source of lift is the pressure on the underside of the wing due to its being pitched upward to the relative wind (i.e., positive angle of attack). The airfoil shape takes advantage of Bernoulli\u0027s principle to make the lift more efficiently, by reducing the upper surface pressure and thus increase the pressure differential. It does allow the wing to generate lift even at zero or slightly negative angle of attack, but very little--this is why airliners cruise in a somewhat nose-high attitude, to maintain a positive angle of attack for efficient flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the airfoil was a critical item in making flight possible in the early days, these days, power-to-weight ratios are high enough to make them merely an efficiency issue. As Peter Garrison (aviation journalist who has also designed and built at least three different light airplanes of his own, from scratch) once put it, \u0022these days, there\u0027s enough engine power available to be able to make a plane fly with a couple of two-by-twelves for wings.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T20:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBernoulli isn\u0027t the best way to describe airfoils, but so is the hand argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirliners have nose up attitude because they use fuselage to generate additional lift, also you can\u0027t really compare a flow of standard wing to an airliner which flies right on the boundary of supersonic flight which is quite different animal to standard model and the fact that the range of speeds the wing needs to be working is quite big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that now days airfoils are as important as ever, just look at the complex mechanization in the wings of modern airliners.

That\u0027s what really differentiates wings from boards. Board or hand can generate lift almost purely from air deflection at bottom side, and the air on the top side is turbulent creating lots of drag. Wing on the other hand has (ideally) a laminar (non-turbulent) flow over the top, not only does this reduce drag by a lot. It also makes the air \u0022glue\u0022 to the wing as it goes downwards on the top side, inviting more air above the wing to move downward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i wouldn\u0027t say that wings generate low amounts of lift at 0deg AoA.

When I mentioned spoilers I wasn\u0027t referring to the drag they generate but rather the disruption of the airflow over the wing, which decreases lift quite drastically.
