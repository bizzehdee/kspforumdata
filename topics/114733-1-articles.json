From what I understand they will eclipse or have done so. And next time we will see it is 2023 then after that. Long long time. Anyways 11:10 pm right now they be low to the herizon. Also saw Venus with m 6 inch telescope to. Nice Cresent light off it. Kind of like they refer to the huntress bow for the Moon. Wish I had a camra attachment for my tele.

That mean that he reflected the sunlight in a specific way (just like a road sign \u0022glowing\u0022 in the headlights). It was really bright.

If your telescope has the standard threads, you can just go to the photo shop with it. You do need a camera with dettachable optics though.\n\nTake a look at this Scott Manley vid:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Twti9xuhNsk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHe shows how you can do cool photos of planets without any kind of telescope.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T07:45:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaos\\_Klaus**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:02:17Z","Content":"Like this, was taken with my phone in Melbourne, sorry for ....ty quality\n\n![EAoyqwLeOcHjtkUXuheBf3chDUCSYoDdKLm9AO60oZB1m0tU-MCOSRfjQuJOKe1kNEwAO0QfwwB6cmgGSWonXg=w1256-h511](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EAoyqwLeOcHjtkUXuheBf3chDUCSYoDdKLm9AO60oZB1m0tU-MCOSRfjQuJOKe1kNEwAO0QfwwB6cmgGSWonXg=w1256-h511)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:29:50Z","Content":"I\u0027ll be looking up there with you!"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:40:31Z","Content":"I am currently thinking about buying a camera, tripod and lense to get some shots on the solar System.\n\nIt\u0027s exciting stuff ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso Kurt made a Video on it:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGD7MHX_csw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:51:01Z","Content":"I did see them pretty close together before the sun went down completely, but they were starting to hide behind a tree.
