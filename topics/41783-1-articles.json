Jersey Kerman, trooper and iron-man pilot, bravely got the stricken craft about 80km away from the KSP before running out of jet fuel and having to set down in the foothills of that mountain range. It happened too fast; either the starboard landing gear gave way or the starboard wing tip dug itself in, but the bird disassembled itself in a long, slow crash that left no debris to recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Jersey wasn\u0027t dead. He wasn\u0027t reported killed in the F3 report. And when I returned to the Space Centre he was listed as \u0022Missing\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay... what just happened?
