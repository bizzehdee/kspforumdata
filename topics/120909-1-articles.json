I took one of my veteran off-the-shelf standardized probe/satellite designs, popped an M700 Survey Scanner on top of it, launched it, and ... noticed some seriously odd behavior with SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I set SAS to its default \u0022attitude hold\u0022 mode, it behaves as expected for a small probe with more gyros than it needs: a brief transient of electrical, rocket nozzle, and attitude-rate activity while the SAS engages and locks down, followed by a rock-solid platform that requires basically no control input. So I know there\u0027s plenty of control authority available. However, if I set SAS to align with a maneuver mode, the satellite behaves ... unexpectedly. There is an ongoing \u0022jitter\u0022 of large control inputs (power consumption presumably from reaction wheels, attitude rates all up and down the axes, and the poor little Terrier is quivering like an overexcited puppy), while the probe\u0027s alignment lazily drifts around a position about 5-10 degrees right-and-down from the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis behavior survives quit-and-restart of KSP. So it\u0027s presumably either something buggy in the .craft file or in my save as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I can work with it just fine; as long as I\u0027ve got the ability to hold attitude, I can just point the vehicle manually like back in the days before \u0022point at maneuver node\u0022 was a thing. But I would rather prefer to have \u0022lazy mode\u0022 be an option...and more importantly, it\u0027s a bit unsettling to watch my satellite drift off-attitude like an incipient dead hulk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is this a known bug/issue with the M700? Or with SAS in certain vehicle configuations that I\u0027ve just never run across before? Or did I just get (un)lucky with this design?
