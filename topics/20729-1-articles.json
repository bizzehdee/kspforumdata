Does anyone know where I can get those two mod groups? It\u0027s nice that they\u0027re getting acknowledgement, but it doesn\u0027t help when I can\u0027t find the resources to add to my game.

I don\u0027t do well with names...) which allows you to put a large breakaway shell around a satellite package. That\u0027s fine. But I can\u0027t figure out how to put a capsule in that with a parachute, because the parachute would obscure the pod bay connector. And most of the MechJeb units I\u0027ve found have no parachute linkage on the top, so I can\u0027t add the satellite cargo bay on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any advice for someone trying to build a cargo rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"emfolkerts","CreatedById":15046,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T13:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efor the large space capsal place 3 small parachuttes on the side of the capsal just be shure its not blocking the door for the small capsual place 2 on the sides or 3 dosnt mattor\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T14:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/2448-0-16-KW-Rocketry-v0-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKW Rocketry.\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T15:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nice to see people taking interest in Voyager Labs work, If you want any custom sattelites you can Message me or post it on the wall.
