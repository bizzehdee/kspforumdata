Whenever I\u0027m viewing space map, there are two ships (out of a dozen) that have blue brackets around them and I cannot select them while on the space map. Thankfully Kerbal Alarm Clock allows to jump to those ships, if I have an alarm setup for those ships. Another way I can do it is by going to Tracking Station and selecting the ship from the list only,\u00A0not the map itself (that still does not work in tracking station.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the both ships have blue brackets around them, I speculate that the issue I\u0027m having is part of the game play, so not an issue with the game but me, not knowing what is going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I think it might be Remote Tech mod that is doing something, but I\u0027m not sure, since one ship is crewed, and another has a link to Mission Control and I still cannot select either of them. I do have a bunch of other ships.probes that work just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone knows what is going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canberra_Gaming","CreatedById":160705,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T13:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you running hyperedit?
