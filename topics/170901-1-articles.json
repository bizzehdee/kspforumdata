Luckily the first time I had a backup in PS\u002B. But this time I saved my game then quit and uploaded my save to the PS\u002B cloud. When I came back to play ,it said \u201Ccould not load save\u201D so I am screwed cause my back up is a corrupted file. I seriously don\u2019t know why this happened. Last time I quit I made sure to wait for the save icon to go away, and then I quit the game. This needs to be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand one more thing since, I now have to start a new game AGAIN! If I give myself like 1000 extra science/money at the start of my new game, will that disable trophies? I want to try and earn all trophies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
