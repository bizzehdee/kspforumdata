So I put together something with the same basic outline and then set to adding my touches. I believe credit for the original ship goes to algwat, who posted the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119038-Showcase-Miners-miners-miners-everywhere-Post-your-pics-here?p=2246663\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2246663\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epic in the miners thread\u003C/a\u003E. Everything past that original pic was my doing - I hope you guys like it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this Big Beautiful girl in a thread about miners and knew immediately that this was quality! Sure, she was under-utilized and under-appreciated. She had a Mk-3 command pod on top for the guys to just party in. Some other hardware I didn\u0027t recognize was stuck up there too, but she looked like too classy a lady to leave that way. So I took her back to my hangar and worked with her a little bit and here is the result. She sports 8 drills that can run virtually free in the daytime thanks to 8 Gigantors. At night, turn on her 8 fuel cell arrays and each one can power a drill. Make sure your highest level engineer is operating her so that you get the bonuses, She only has room for one Kerbal and she\u0027s looking for the right engineer to spend her life with!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the ground, her eight drills can bring up an incredible 3600 units of ore per hour, filling her ore tanks in less than three hours! The on-board ISRU will need about 7 hours to fill her fuel tanks. Running drills and ISRU simultaneously for 7-8 hours should result in full fuel and ore tanks (assuming drill output is 1. for your actual time to fill tanks, divide this time by your drills\u0027 ore extraction rate, so if your drills are putting out 0.5, the time to fill ore and fuel will be 14-16 hours). A cozy living space is provided for her special Kerbal in a Mk-1 lander can. The airlock opens to a convenient walk-around balcony and ladders provide access to the surface or the top docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff the ground, 12 Thud engines provide her impetus while 16 Vernors provide 6-axis control. She can get where she\u0027s going and turn on a dime (whatever that is)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe is powered by Gigantor solar panel arrays in the light or by fuel cell arrays in the dark. She carries her own ISRU, so you can spend all of that fuel on landing and be confident that you\u0027ll get home again. Want to go visit every rock in the system? This Big Beautiful Lady can take you almost anywhere (Don\u0027t try to land on Eve, Tylo, Laythe, Jool, or Kerbin). You might manage it on Tylo, Laythe, or Kerbin, but there would be no margin for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn vacuum, fully loaded with fuel AND ore, she has 1840 delta-V. Without the ore, she packs 3300\u002B. If you launch with full ore tanks, get to orbit and convert all that ore to fuel, you\u0027ll have about 3k available, so your total budget without refueling is over 4800! Where can\u0027t you go with 4800 delta-V to spend!? TWR on Moho is 1.95 - enough to get you to a rendezvous at an orbiting refinery, space station, transfer vehicle, or whatever. Two axial sr. docking ports allow her to join up with a space station core and integrate into the station, adding her thrust and control assets to the station. Four shielded docking ports on her arms allow smaller craft to dock around the axial core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOre capacity: 8700\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel capacity: 11340\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOx capacity: 13860\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dry: 60.585t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Wet: 188.246t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Laden: 275.246t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Atm: 1298.364MN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Vac: 1440.000MN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my long-winded description of her has in any way diminished your appreciation for this fine lady, then my apologies to both you and her.

Note 2100 delta-V left after landing on the Mun. The LV got me to a Munar Periapsis of 19km with about 50dV left in the LV. Took about 250 to circularize and about 900 to change plane, deorbit, and land. Landing was uneventful. It was about 60m away from the target, but I think that is mostly because of the lower than normal starting orbit (I usually shoot for 28k). But obviously, this craft is just easy to deal with - I hope you guys enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T04:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool.

I fired her up to leave the Mun with her tanks up to about 3k delta V and a trace of ore left. The initial ascent to 8km went fine, but suddenly she started spinning like one of the engines had gone bad. I took her off auto-pilot, killed the engines, regained control, and started trying to complete the circularization manually, but the same thing happened. I recently picked up GoodSpeed\u0027s tank balancer and had the fuel tanks balanced, but the ore tanks were way out of balance. So I fixed that (balanced the ore tanks) and tried again, but still got the same result... WTH!?!? This time all tanks were balanced but then I noticed I was out of electric. I had a fuel cell array started up just to make sure I had juice, but I was still out and not getting any. Dark side of the Mun so solar doesn\u0027t work here. So I checked the ISRU and sure enough it is running trying to convert that last bit of ore - and sucking up the electric. I know I read something about how engines deprived of intake air shut down in order of placement or something and I figure the same thing is happening here. I had just enough electric to run some, but not all of my rockets. So I shut down the ISRU and tried again and no more problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the lesson I learned is shut down the ISRU before taking off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Cupcake!
