Also, where to put a cargo bay? \u00A0 \u00A0If the fuel tank is at our CG, cargo will necessarily be in front of or behind it. \u00A0This could lead to handling differences loaded vs empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, was a space shuttle-alike . \u00A0It solves some of these problems (but needs mods) and is tricky to fly, as these things tend to be. Ended up needing 3 mods, tweakscale, GPOFuelSpeedPump and ModularFuelTanks to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JS7JLRed-cc?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original Shuttle concept was \u00A0for a smaller orbiter launched off the back of a large, high speed/altitude carrier plane. \u00A0 This was my take on it. \u00A0In my imagined Kerbal universe, it was the STS\u0027s replacement following a number of fatal accidents. \u00A0 \u00A0As a result, safety was paramount\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhFx5f3rVPY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSticking with 70s tech, it uses Whiplash (Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney J58 ) for the carrier plane, and NERV on the orbiter. \u00A0The cargo bay is small, so it\u0027s not really suited to construction tasks. \u00A0Still, there\u0027s space for a few science instruments, and it has enough delta V to explore the Kerbin SOI somewhat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9C_gp_p_KA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately while the carrier plane has a probe core and is perfectly controllable with the orbiter released, the game deletes it as soon as the orbiter flies out of physics range. \u00A0So the 100% re-usable nature of this system is lost. \u00A02 Mods for this - \u00A0GPOSpeedFuelPump and ModularFuelTanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Personally i think this little orbiter is cute, and with all its safety systems, \u0022very NASA\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested in any of these aircraft, \u00A0I can put them on KerbalX for download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-23T13:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2016 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AeroGav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
