When I activate the SAS on a plane the control surfaces will oscillate a little at first and then they will gradually get to these really wild spazzy oscillations over the course of 15 seconds or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried it without B9 aerospace and it works fine so I know it is B9 that is the problem. I have tried it with the stock parts that come with the game and the B9 parts. It does it for both.
