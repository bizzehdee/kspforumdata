Hopefully someone will follow a similar plan to this and get us back to the Moon before then. This also includes 5 ways to fly by the Moon because many space agencies might do that.\n\n***Landing Missions***\n\n***Option One*** \n\n**CNSA: Long March 5 Earth Orbit Rendezvous (2 launches)**\n\nThe lunar lander would be based on an enlarged Chang\u0027e 3, but with a Shenzhou orbital module as the command cabin. The command and service module would be simply a Shenzhou. \n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2016**\n\n***Option Two***\n\n**CNSA: Long March 5 Heavy Direct Lunar Mission (1 launch)**\n\nBasically the same as Option Two, but Apollo-Saturn V style instead of Apollo-Saturn C3 style.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2019**\n\n***Option Three***\n\n**Roscosmos: Proton Earth Orbit Rendezvous (2 or 3 launches)**\n\nVery similar to Option One, but with Soyuz instead of Shenzhou. Not sure about the lander, though, that would have to be designed and built. This would take a few years unless they somehow have one ready now.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2020 (Unless the Russians have a working LK somehow)**\n\n***Option Four***\n\n**SpaceX/Bigelow Aerospace: Falcon Heavy Long-Duration Lunar Mission (5 launches)**\n\n[See my Artemis thread for more details on this.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120300-Artemis-Could-SpaceX-Land-on-the-Moon-by-2019-Now-with-a-new-mission-overview%21)\n\nThis mission would be 5 launches yet be with rockets that have similar power to the Long March 5 and Saturn C-3 which would take 2 launches to do a lunar landing, however a stay of up to 6 months would be possible. NASA and the ESA (or both) would probably be in charge of the mission, though.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2017**\n\n***Option Five***\n\n**United Launch Alliance/NASA: Vulcan Heavy Earth Orbit Rendezvous (2 launches)**\n\nEarth Orbit Rendezvous with the CST-100 (Or Orion) as the capsule, Altair-like lander.\n\nCould also probably be done as soon as 2017 with an Atlas V Heavy, though there are no plans to make one of these. \n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2021**\n\n***Flyby Missions***\n\n***Option One*** \n\n**CNSA: Long March 5 Lunar Flyby (1 launch)**\n\nSend a Shenzhou around the Moon.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2016** ***Option Two***\n\n**Roscosmos: Proton (1 launch)**\n\nSend a Soyuz around the Moon. It may need to be stripped down.\n\n[The Russians themselves wanted to do this back in the \u002760s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_7K-L1) \n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2016**\n\n***Option Three***\n\n**SpaceX: Falcon Heavy (1 or 2 launches)**\n\nSend a Dragon V2 around the Moon. This might require a Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9, but it\u0027s more likely that the mission could be done with 1 launch.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2017**\n\n***Option Four***\n\n**ESA: Ariane 5/6 (2 launches)**\n\nSimilar to Option 3, but this whole mission depends on whether or not any of the ATV-based manned spacecraft are built. It would require 2 Ariane 5s to launch. Later missions could use Ariane 6s for either 1 or both of the launches.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2017 (Assuming the ESA follows one of the ATV evolution plans for a manned spacecraft)**\n\n***Option Five***\n\n**ISRO: GSLV Mark III (2 launches)**\n\nSimilar to Options 3 and 4. Yes, I know it\u0027s unlikely for them to be ready before 2021, so I\u0027ll use the pessimistic choice and say it\u0027ll take until 2021 for it to be ready.\n\n**Earliest Possible Launch Date: 2021 (Assuming the ISRO Orbital Vehicle gets funding in the next fiscal session or whatever)**So, I hope you enjoyed my ideas!

You don\u0027t really mention the departure stage.

If you had a reusable lander on Lunar orbit, assuming hypergolics, the fuel has to be about four fifths of the total mass, meaning the refuelling spacecraft would require nearly the same launch vehicle as a whole other lander. Of course the refuelling vehicle doesn\u0027t have to have the complex and expensive habitable component but the TLI rocket stage, on the other paw, would have to be refuelled by a copy of itself, maybe without the main rocket engine.

Key word here is decades.

You can\u0027t expect space agencies to suddenly get working together, paperwork only for that would take years, and then planning the mission would also take quite a few years.
