This combination results in a base module that is shoved away and out of range before the port can connect itself. If either the collider were disabled until a connection was made (probably the less good solution), or the port began seeking before fully extending (probably the better solution), this would be the absolute best option for building bases currently available.\n\nThe second minor issue is that the ports become rigid once the connection is made. If the port were to remain flexible, some of the explodiness might be avoided, and building outposts on ground that is not perfectly flat would become less of a risk.\n\nAnyway, I really love your mods, [@DMagic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57416-dmagic/), and I think you do fantastic work.

If the docking port starts seeking out its mate without being completely extended, it would just end up fully extending as soon as it came into range in most cases; there would need to be some kind of manual control of how far the port is extended.
