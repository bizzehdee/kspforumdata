In practice, you won\u0027t be able to get that much useful payload up, because some of that payload capacity gets swallowed up by stuff like staging equipment, aerodynamic control surfaces, command pods/drone cores, RCS, structural elements, etc. Also, the amount of delta-V to get to orbit is variable based on how well you handle the ascent: as a rough guideline, it takes 4400-4500 m/s to get to low Kerbin orbit if you don\u0027t mess up your ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood ascents in stock feature a straight vertical ascent followed by a gravity turn. For the vertical ascent, the most efficient speed to go is terminal velocity*: go faster, you lose fuel burning against atmospheric drag, go slower, you lose fuel burning against gravity drag. A stock gravity turn is to gently tip over eastwards at ~6-12 km until you are straight horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Terminal velocity is how fast you would fall. There\u0027s a chart on the Wiki, else MechJeb and probably Kerbal Engineer tell you what terminal velocity is for your craft. As such, you want to design for a TWR of 1.6-2.0: while you need slightly \u0026gt; 2.0 TWR to hit terminal velocity, you burn fuel as you go up (increasing TWR), and engines are dead mass for the rocket equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theory behind this is simple. Barring atmosphere (and lithosphere), the most efficient way to get to orbit would be to point dead east (in the direction of Kerbin\u0027s rotation), with just enough vertical pitch to keep yourself from hitting the ground, and just burn until you\u0027re in orbit. Horizontal thrust good, vertical thrust bad but necessary. However, Kerbin also has a thick souposphere which eats velocity: you need to go up to escape it, and gradually start turning over eastwards as you get to thinner and thinner atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Rainstorm, the rocket equation (dV = g * Isp * ln(start mass/end mass)) \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the simple equation, although as mentioned, delta-V is not the entire story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT #2: The simple way to get to orbit is to have a launch TWR in the aforementioned range (1.6-2.0), about 5 km/s of delta-V (for safety), and tip over 45 degrees at 10 km, holding that until apoapsis is 80-100 km; you then wait until apoapsis, and burn prograde until you\u0027re circularized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T20:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T21:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you assume SSTOs and \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV vs TWR follows a convenient path (as low as 4400 m/s for craft with \u0026gt;1.5 TWR, more like 4600 m/s for craft down around 1.2)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c128/raptor_87/KSP/SSTOautogen2014_zps25b4b59a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SSTOautogen2014_zps25b4b59a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T21:14:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UmbralRaptor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T23:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe short version is there\u0027s not a \u0022simple\u0022 equation.
