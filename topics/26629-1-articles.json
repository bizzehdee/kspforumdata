I even left the SAS units off my ships to try fixing it. I have come across it with several craft and when I think it\u0027s one thing (ie a piece of a ladder intruding on the docking port) I remove it and it still happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just had a perfectly serviceable rocket blow up multiple times after reloading, restarting the game, restarting the PC, saying a prayer... basically trying ANYTHING to get the thing to work right and it just keeps blowing up as soon as I dock. I docked lined up perfectly, Mechjeb turned off, docking speed was 0.2m/s and KABOOOOOOOOM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is just something weird about the docking code that when it changes viewpoint from the docking ship to the whole new ship (docking ship plus whatever you dock to) where it just folds the whole thing up. I thought it might have been a mod but I have had it happen in stock mode too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know what is really causing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just realised the common denominator of every incident.... it is the shielded docking port on the one ship and a normal docking port on the other. As soon as they touch they go kaboom.

I just had it happen to me last night. After about an hour of tracking down a lag bug (I had to reinstall Mapsat. For some reason after jettisoning my first stage after take off with my probe, it would lag to one frame every 3-4s instead of my launch frame rate of around 25-30 or so FPS). Well I got the probe up to my Jool ship and every. single. time. I docked the ship would fly apart within about a second or two. Didn\u0027t matter if I docked with ASAS on or off on the Jool ship or the probe. It would just fly apart. So I gave up and burned for Jool without the mapping satellite. I\u0027ll send it along on its own mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seemed sort of like it is an issue with the dock connector between the drive sections and the station section of the Jool ship as that is where it would suddenly buck like a bronco the instant I docked. Anyway, I gave up after 10 attempts (quick saved about 5 seconds before docking).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
