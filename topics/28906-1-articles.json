At the time of the incident it consisted of two stock modules connected via a Clamp-o-tron Sr. Linkage, four solar arrays, a Mk-2 Lander Can, Hitchhiker module, and Command Cupola functioning as crew quarters. The second half of the station consisted primarily of a large fuel tank. Both ends had clamp-o-tron docking ports for attaching ships and additional modules. It was crewed by Doodnard and Harrick Kerman, who were billed as \u0022Competent Professionals\u0022 during our selection process and were therefore exempt from the mandatory crash test course (survivors automatically become eligible for higher training).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two space station components were successfully rendezvoused following an incident wherein the docking port of the fuel module was \u003Cem\u003Einstalled backwards\u003C/em\u003E, leading to some embarrassment and a few of the engineering staff fired (out of a cannon into the sun). For approximately a week, the station orbited successfully, acting as a command post during the Minmus-Spotlight and RUMIA-1 Mun Missions. Documents from the latter however were lost due to the bookkeeper being given as a snackrifice to Ame-chan, goddess of candies and current head of KSC administration (he was claimed to taste like lime apples).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe incident itself began when the KSV-1 resupply vessel, carrying a load of fuel was en-route from Kerbin. Rendezvous was completed successfully, and both ships reached a position of about 365m from one another. The KSV-1 was aligning itself for docking. Command line switch was about to be made to the Space Station, when suddenly and without warning, the Station\u0027s fuel module \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30762-Switching-Views-between-vessels-causes-explosion-0-20/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexploded\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31036-Reports-about-Kraken-sighting\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eviolently\u003C/a\u003E, obliterating the top cupola and docking rig of the crew module. Miraculously, the Monopropellant tank acted to shield the Mk2 command pod (which both crew were in) from the blast.

The blast force was so great that a large cluster of debris (erroneously identified as landers) was thrown into an escape trajectory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/2debrisgroups.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img818/5316/2debrisgroups.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222debrisgroups.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, the crew module was still broadcasting via it\u0027s communitron antennae, but it\u0027s power reserves were fading fast. The KSV-1 boosted itself into a close position adjacent to the Space Station to render assistance. The crew, including Rolly von Kerman, Sheroly Kerman, and Brolli Kerman were quick to re-establish communications, and Sheroly conducted an EVA to investigate a nearby piece of detritus to hopefully determine a cause. Unfortunately, the KSV-1 did not have sufficient crew capacity for the two Kerbalnauts, and was instructed to remain in position until help arrived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/203/3response.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img203/1604/3response.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223response.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at KSC, panic ensued, as the scientists examined their options. After sacrificing several of the station\u0027s engineers to Ame-chan to ensure she was not excited by the explosions, they quickly scrambled an NOMAD-2 Orbiter to intercept the Station and hopefully recover the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/542/4rescuelaunch.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img542/1478/4rescuelaunch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224rescuelaunch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blast created a large debris field, which was tracked by orbiting \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_Orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELolmiya\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Sugar_Satellite\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESugar Sattelites\u003C/a\u003E, and fed to the NOMAD orbiter and ground control.

The EVA went smoothly as the Kerbalnauts spent some time examining the damage to the module before boarding the NOMAD-2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/845/6spacewalk.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img845/5655/6spacewalk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226spacewalk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(view from the KSV-1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/827/7spacewalk.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img827/953/7spacewalk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227spacewalk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(EVA in progress)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/703/8boarding.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img703/8661/8boarding.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228boarding.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Boarding the NOMAD-2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter boarding the orbiter, the autopilot was re-calibrated and the vessel made preparations for landing back at KSC. As both Harrick and Doodnard Kerman were quite shaken from the ordeal (and fearful of their proximity to explosions attracting the attention of Ame-chan) the entire flight would be automated. After waving off the KSV-1, the NOMAD-2 conducted a high-deorbit burn to place it on course with KSC. The KSV-1 remained in orbit to begin an investigation and Possibly transfer it\u0027s fuel to other spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/543/9waveoff.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img543/820/9waveoff.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229waveoff.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter being convinced (lied to) that Ame-chan did not know anything about them, the two intrepid Kerbalnauts were reassured and relieved to be returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/577/10kerbin.jpg/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img577/2299/10kerbin.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210kerbin.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry went quite smoothly.

Deployment of a Decrapifier spacecraft to rendezvous with and de-orbit the debris may be done at a later time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitial investigation of the incident reports indicate that the Station was most likely the victim of a Deep Space Kraken attack; one of the first in several decades. In light of this, as well as the recent Controversy involving Kerthulhu, God of the Space Krakens and High priest of the old ones who dwells within Minmus, the Kerbin Military and Space Programs are being placed on heightened alert.
