I\u0027m pretty new to the forums, but I\u0027ve been lurking and playing ksp since 0.18. I thought I would share my favourite design so far, somehting I couldnt find in the forums or the space port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had planned a mission to take one kerbal to the mun, to place a custom flag on the landing site of my very first Challenger 11 Mun landing from 0.19. However, I also wanted to mark Jeb\u0027s landing site in the Challenger 12 mission with a different custom flag, so then I had a problem. I knew you could pick up another flag, so I placed a flag from another craft near the launch pad, so that I could go pick it up before the mission and carry two flags to the mun. Of course, it didn\u0027t work, as it appears your flags are reset if you enter a capsule. However, this challenge forced me to think about how I could get Jeb out of his capsule, and onto the ground to pick up the flag, and then return to his capsule on top of a huge rocket. So, I have created the Kerbal Launch Umbilical Tower:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6oniuvmapkow3z3/RYd2ElHfxI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/6oniuvmapkow3z3/RYd2ElHfxI\u003C/a\u003E (Pictures)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked surprisingly well, and more than anything else just looked awesome as it fell away from the craft. The sub-assembly is here if anyone is interested:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/umbilicaltower2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/umbilicaltower2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is all stock, but I have added the mechjeb and flight engineer console just because they look cool on the tower, so if you are playing stock only it should still work. The chairs are there because it is impossible to get a kerbal over the top of the ladder, so once you get to the top, you can click board on the seat, and then exit it to get on the platform. It is modifiable to most rockets by changing the amount of I-beams connected to the decoupler, and then extending the platfrom with the panels accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-14T04:28:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2013 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by matgg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoodedarche0","CreatedById":58185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T04:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossibly any photos for us as I don\u0027t like to download without pictures as it may or may not fit my plans for my space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matgg","CreatedById":59269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T04:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dropbox link is an album, I tried linking the images directly but it didn\u0027t work for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T05:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a nice tower their!
