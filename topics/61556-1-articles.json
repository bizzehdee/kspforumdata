This has led to some rather unfortunate kerbals drifting endlessly through space and I would like to change that. I know there are calculations regarding delta-v, gravity, and fuel but my attempts to understand them have fallen flat. Is there a calculator online or some basic rules someone can suggest to me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T03:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust use the Kerbal Engineer Redux, no number crunching required. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T03:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb also has a delta-v readout, but I prefer Engineer; it provides just so much more data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fleb","CreatedById":63851,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T04:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBob Fitch just did a video on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWozfZ7bgYw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just use a chart to see whats needed, and then Kerbal engineer to show me the crafts delta-v.
