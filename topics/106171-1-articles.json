Originally I thought it was just the game\u0027s way of creatively removing debris, but then it didn\u0027t happen on my second and third rescue missions.

Was a bug whereby during a craft packing/unpacking and warping it would incinerate remote vessels. If you can post your save files so we can test, that would be a great help."},{"CreatedByName":"JWS","CreatedById":136190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:01:07Z","Content":"Same thing happened to me while I tried to rendezvous to minmus orbit station.
