Dyslexia and dysgraphia (and other similiar conditions) might be an leftover from earlier stages of human evolution. Today they might be seen as a disadvantage - but tens of thousands years ago brain areas affected by them would be used for performing vitally important tasks. Like allowing to notice small changes in environment signalling a danger, better keeping track of places with seasonally available foods (like berries or mushrooms) and so on. Back then such skills were advantageous, and people possessing them fared better than rest of the population - which lead to these traits becoming widespread. Unfortunately times changed, and now ability to read and write fluently became more important than ability to easily recall where you did find a fruit-bearing tree two years ago. Apparently your brain is still \u0022wired\u0022 slightly differently to the brains of people having no problems with grammar and orthography.
