I see a lot of younger kids at the school I go to play KSP. That\u0027s all well and good, but the thing is they all share it via their USB\u0027s etc. A few months ago only a few people in the school I knew of played KSP. Pretty much an entire GRADE now plays KSP from the re-distribution of it. That\u0027s about 200-300 kids. Say, only 10% of those kids actually bought it. that\u0027s only 20-30, so 180-270 kids haven\u0027t bough the game (theoretically speaking). The current cost of KSP on the KSP store is $30. That\u0027s $5400 - $8100 worth of gross revenue down the train. That\u0027s assuming only 10% of kids have bought the game. I highly doubt the figure is that high. And that is why I have created this discussion - to discuss on methods to stop the re-distribution of KSP. Through steam I believe this can be done by using the steamapi.dll and integrating it with steam etc, but I\u0027m not too sure how this would be done for the KSP store. This would also mean that there would have to be two separate \u0022branches\u0022 of KSP - the steam edition and the KSP store edition. Yes, that means more work for the devs in terms of making sure KSP itself is properly synced between the versions, but I\u0027m pretty sure $5400 - $8100 would cover those costs... What do other people think about this? Have any of you people also seen anything like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T07:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna go out on a limb here (not really) and say that your estimates for piracy rates of KSP are quite unrealistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Squad have made multiple statements regarding DRM, and their position has always been \u0022DRM hurts legitimate customers; we don\u0027t want any part of it.\u0022 That does not seem likely to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally agree with Squad on this -- DRM is a waste of Squad\u0027s time, as well as their users\u0027 time.
