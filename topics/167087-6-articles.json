That is an average in some peoples there are no cohesive breeding units, in other places its 1:1. The unit does not have to be chronologically intact, it can male can have a mate for one period lose her and acquire another. This is the\u00A0 reason mitochondrial eve coalesces later and adam (although less so now than it used to be, so it might actually be 1.5:1). It has also been noted in the merger of cultures were males have annihilated they xeno-male counterparts (or collective wife stealing incidences). Matriarchy has the advantage in many cultures that send the males out to \u0027prove\u0027 themselves, the resources under the control of the women. Males then join other groups (cause 50 individuals is too small to retain genetic viability over long periods). Oh yes, there were houses, people carried their houses with them, in the same way that nomadic reindeer herding groups in siberia carry their houses. This was particularly true in Europe where the winters were devistatingly cold, there are sites in Europe that have evidence of prolonged and repeated habitation at spots. Europe was not one climate in the ice age, it was a generally bad climate that became worse from time to time, and peoples would migrate back to the refuges in Iberia, then flow out, this of course was late paleolithic behavior. (off topic however in this group so\u00A0 . . . )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say village, what you mean is a permanent habitation. The late paleolithic is characterized by activities of individuals generally in the lead up to the end of the Younger dryas. This basically means for Europe if you build a permanent settlement outside of the ice-age refuges, your group was dead. But they did travel out with the protection of mobile habitats (i.e. the village moved), they did keep them and repitch these places in France (some areas showing long durations) as they harvested favored resources (one of the questions is what did people do when they were not at the site since 95% of their carbon came from seafood, did they simply move to another warmer site in iberia). In the Mesolithic however, the major focus of what I was talking about things began to change, there was alot of trading going on. Mesolithic people were very mobile, but that does not mean they lack favored places of camping out, the difference between Neolithic and Mesolithic peoples left the sometime harsh conditions of N.Central Europe. But there is one major difference, the Mesolithich people drafted trade even with Neolithic into these migrations. In Europe you see migrating tracks of items that come from the Black Sea, Iberia, Ionian sea that cycle in and out of different parts of C and Western Europe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich Neolithic Europe are you talking about, there is the LBK, there is the Iberian mesolithic/neolithic transition, there are two French neolithic cultures, there is the Iron gorges culture, there is the Ionian neolithic there is invisible transition that takes place in anatolia (cultivation for them begins 12 kabp).

There are several sites of continuous NA settlement in New Mexico. Europeans were arrogant and abusive and often failed to recognize the contribution of NA culture, some groups took offense and went back into the jungles (Lacodan Maya, Achue as examples). Many settled native American farming groups don\u0027t exist any more, that is because they are American (waves hand). Compatible cultures do that sort of thing. If Mexico was purely a colonial state, when New Spain was forced to severe ties with Spain during the Napoleanic period, they would have rejoin Spain afterwards, but that is not what happened. If you look at Mexico per say, its 5 or 6 million NA population dropped to 100,000 individuals,\u00A0 but now Mexico (about 2/3rds native American by gene weight) is 100s of millions. At some point after Cortez \u0027broke\u0027 the population it did rebound in great numbers. This gets into a basic problem with colonials, not all . . .For example the Basque were extremely well suited for pastoral agriculture and fishing in Northern Mexico, but colonial settlements north of the Rio grande faired poorly for 200 years, people were given huge land grants . . and left back to Spain. If you are going to settle in someone else\u0027s territory (planet) you better make sure you have studied the culture well or you might end up on the menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Comanche had a bad habit of allowing the settlers to recover gain livestock, breed horses . . . .and then they would attack steal women, cows and horses take off and not be seen again for 20 years.

To be fair it was nearly stable about 8500 years ago but then again there is evidence of bovid culture in England about the same time.

There are several sites of continuous NA settlement in New Mexico. Europeans were arrogant and abusive and often failed to recognize the contribution of NA culture, some groups took offense and went back into the jungles (Lacodan Maya, Achue as examples). Many settled native American farming groups don\u0027t exist any more, that is because they are American (waves hand). Compatible cultures do that sort of thing. If Mexico was purely a colonial state, when New Spain was forced to severe ties with Spain during the Napoleanic period, they would have rejoin Spain afterwards, but that is not what happened. If you look at Mexico per say, its 5 or 6 million NA population dropped to 100,000 individuals,\u00A0 but now Mexico (about 2/3rds native American by gene weight) is 100s of millions. At some point after Cortez \u0027broke\u0027 the population it did rebound in great numbers. This gets into a basic problem with colonials, not all . . .For example the Basque were extremely well suited for pastoral agriculture and fishing in Northern Mexico, but colonial settlements north of the Rio grande faired poorly for 200 years, people were given huge land grants . . and left back to Spain. If you are going to settle in someone else\u0027s territory (planet) you better make sure you have studied the culture well or you might end up on the menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Comanche had a bad habit of allowing the settlers to recover gain livestock, breed horses . . . .and then they would attack steal women, cows and horses take off and not be seen again for 20 years. The utes were a fairly quite culture that occupied the high plains area of western US until the colonials came, then their splinter groups blossomed or less like Atilla the Hun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW.

Similar processes took place in the Americas between England and the Colonist.\u00A0 If we talk about where the middle east problem came from, people in the west tend to think of it as a Palestinian problem in origin, but that is not true, the problem started with the Mandates (which was in a sense a deflating colonialism) which then broke down because of purely European events (the rise of nationalism in Europe). The irony of the palestinian problem is that palestine never existed, the Ottoman empire broke down, it became a mandate as part of transJordon, which then crumbled in 1948 despite the intervention of the United Nations. In effect the west so messed up transjordon that will of the entire world could not fix it.

You have the metric wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo be intelligent of a level meaningful in a xenobiotic context you left out one very important point that most of these other examples lack in magnitudes. Humans are one of the most manipulative, environmentally exploitative, resource-heavy dependencies of any species that has ever lived on the planet. We leverage our intelligence with machines, beasts of burden, irrigation systems, roads, shipping. The most social ant in the world cannot skype another ant on the otherside of the world asking for advice on how to deal with anteaters. Other animals manage to leverage their cognitive facilities in a few directions. Crows are of advanced EQ and they can take clams and bust them on rocks, find clever ways out of cages, octopus are great at getting into things and escape and mimicry artist. Dolphins are able to sense prey blind and feed as if they had x-ray vision. Wolves work together in packs to take down prey several time their composite size. All these measures of skill and learning are not to be discounted. But the day the first human sat down and crafted an adze, hollowed out a canoe and went beyond the line of site to a new land, where he and his mate(s) learned to exploit new resources human-kind would see the power of serial problem solving that is magnitudes above the manipulative ability, at its peak in societies, compared to other animals. This is why we are here talking about these things and crows are not. There have been many crow level species since the dawn of the Earth, there has only been one space-race.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
