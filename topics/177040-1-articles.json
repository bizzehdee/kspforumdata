Unfortunately I don\u0027t even come close to having the skills to create these models. Now, thanks to Nivee I now have the models I need but I need them textured and I need config files for them. Would anyone be interested in helping me out? I am happy to pay for good work.

I need to make some alternative shaped pieces for the HX line from B9 Aerospace with as much of the HX functionality built in as possible.
