You could rotate the root directly towards the target (the only change needed to go 3d) and apply the trig to get exact values for the pitch of the root and the angle of the elbow. You then interpolate the current joint rotations with the ones spat out by the trig and slowly move the arm over, use a separate solver for the wrist and hey presto. But this only works with two-segment arms, and only if the joints on those arms have no rotational limits. It\u0027s a very inexpensive (computationally) way to handle two-segment arms but with a system like this you need something that can handle any number of joints. The main problem stems from the fact that the trig is deterministic; you feed it variables, it runs hard math on them, and spits out an answer. Invert a variable and it flips the direction of the elbow, because there are only two possible solutions for any 2-segment arm of that type...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...But add a third segment and the solutions become infinite. Especially if a joint has more than one degree of freedom. As such, an iterative approach seeking target-minimization is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral years ago I was looking at IK systems for n-joint chains and had a quaternion-based mockup running in Garry\u0027s Mod. The basic idea is for each joint it would figure out which direction on each axis would move the end effector closer to the target. It also spat out exact values for what angle would get it closest from the current total-state of the arm, but of course each joint was only allowed to move a little at a time before evaluating the next joint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had implemented joint limits but hadn\u0027t figured out how to make the solver aware of those limits yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout the solver being aware of and avoiding the joint limits, it is very easy for the arm to end up bending over backwards and trying to reach the target while bound up on itself. It\u0027s kinda funny to watch, but not so much when it\u0027s plowing into your space station while doing it. (another limitation of the two-segment solution; it doesn\u0027t NEED to worry about joint limits because the elbow cannot ever overextend)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI no longer have the code I was working on, but everything I was doing was based off an old Game Developer Magazine article: \u0022Making Kine more Flexible\u0022 by Jeff Lander. I can\u0027t seem to find a proper direct link but the first google result will get you to a copy of the PDF hosted by Carnegie Melon. In particular, the \u0022Cyclic-Coordinate Descent\u0022 method described therein. It even has code examples that could be used with a little modification ( my own implementation was practically line-for-line verbatim, I just used a quaternion-based existing function as a shortcut instead of matrices). You can also look up anything referencing that article; you will likely find more advanced systems you can virtually drop into place; even a solver capable of handling variable-length segments for telescoping arms. Implementing the code in the article as-is can produce the joint-lockup problem described above, but that article is from 1998 and I guarantee there are more recent articles available that produce better solvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this said, if you\u0027re looking for just a simple kOS solution for a two-segment arm with an end effector, the after-effects expression is perfectly viable as long as you offset the desired position of the wrist to account for your needed end effector rotation. The end effector just needs to point parallel to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T06:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Rybec google OpenRave IKfast\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T18:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERybec\u003C/strong\u003E, i would use an spline in arc to control the multi joints possibilities, and have a separate control for high and spread.
