For example, I have a station in orbit around Kerbin right now that is used as a hub for my efforts to visit every biome on the Mun. I send up a fresh crew, they pile into the station, the lander and transfer stage are refuelled, they dock and head for the Mun. Upon arrival, the transfer stage undocks, the lander goes about it\u0027s business, and it docks with the transfer stage, pumps across the unused fuel, and makes the burn for home. After arriving back at Kerbin, the stack returns to the station, where the experiments are cleaned out and prepped for reuse, the crew takes the samples and data, returns to the crew capsule, then heads back to the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will probably use the same station for use in exploring Minmus, but other than that, I have no need to build any others in career mode.
