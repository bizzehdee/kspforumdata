(even if there\u0027\u0027s only one type of weapon onboard) If you do and you\u0027re talking about the mouse not firing, I think it\u0027s only set to fire guns by default. Every now and again by spamming the mouse or clicking a menu with a missile armed/locked/selected will cause it to fire. I just set an action group to fire missile and that seems to work reliably.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oreodoge65","CreatedById":227580,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-28T04:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I fixed it by reinstalling BDA and dependencies, but thanks for the help!\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
