Need to get better at actually using dV effectively instead of returning from the mun with like 4000 dV left in the lander, as my last legit mun lander (that wasnt a SSTO or dropship carrying tanks) returned home on the bloody orbital insertion engines (i didnt even need the 2nd stage at all since the launcher got the 2nd stage AND the lander thing to mun and had excess dV but i ditched it as no way to land a massive rocket) with an excess of 4K dV left after reentering kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough i have less effective dV then Nefrums and his insane 7.3K dV ion craft since some of that dV will be counted towards the laythe ascent even if its using much more efficint rapiers, i think i can pull off his amazing feat with grav assist to cut down the raw dV i need. Who knows, perhaps i can even pull off a minmus landing too on the way home (although that will be on fumes if at all possible).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T18:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T19:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, ill give it a shot, 1st visit laythe, then do what i can to mess with tylo and grav assists.

Certainly if it\u0027s only a couple hundred m/s, then by all means straight from one to the other would be the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the second question, the most efficient way to land on a particular airless body in theory would be to cross into its SOI from behind at the minimum possible speed, on an approach trajectory that grazes the surface, then suicide burn at PE to bring horizontal velocity to zero. I believe that if you want to do this in stages, i.e. establish a highly eccentric orbit on the first pass and then lower its AP in stages from your low point, that would actually take roughly the same amount of energy as doing the whole suicide burn in one go. For Pol and Bop, as you pointed out, a lot of your energy budget will be spent matching orbital velocities, as their gravity is too feeble to change your speed very much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManEatingApe","CreatedById":151354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T17:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge was a lot of fun, really enjoyed designing smaller and smaller craft that could make it.
