From Laythe orbit, it\u0027s then about 680 m/s to set up a Tylo encounter that could put you just about anywhere in the Jool system.

Btw, i actually believe it is a bad idea to go tylo between Bop and Pol, since they are both in rather far orbits (and its takes ~200-300m/s dV total to get from one to the other based on older trips). Going to tylo is less then this, but dropping your PE so much and then having to essentially lift it to match the target takes ALOT of dV, more then it would take to just hohman from Pol to Bop/vice versa.\n\nNow, what is the best method to actually land on these airless bodies? Should i go with a direct collision course suicide burn? Or is it more efficient to 1st get in orbit around said body before landing (this has the added benefit of giving me more choices as to where i land too)?\n\nWhile i have landed on every body in KSP aside from the sun (keep exploding), jool (keep exploding) and moho (need to send something there so i can finally say ive been to every planet in game), i never really cared as much about efficiency since most of my games i tend to build completely overkill dV vessels in the 1st place (a good example would be the satelite network i set in medium kerbin orbits, these things are ion powered and have ~20K dV left, despite their only purpose being to stay in kerbin orbit until shot down or something). Need to get better at actually using dV effectively instead of returning from the mun with like 4000 dV left in the lander, as my last legit mun lander (that wasnt a SSTO or dropship carrying tanks) returned home on the bloody orbital insertion engines (i didnt even need the 2nd stage at all since the launcher got the 2nd stage AND the lander thing to mun and had excess dV but i ditched it as no way to land a massive rocket) with an excess of 4K dV left after reentering kerbin.\n\nAlthough i have less effective dV then Nefrums and his insane 7.3K dV ion craft since some of that dV will be counted towards the laythe ascent even if its using much more efficint rapiers, i think i can pull off his amazing feat with grav assist to cut down the raw dV i need. Who knows, perhaps i can even pull off a minmus landing too on the way home (although that will be on fumes if at all possible).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T18:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T19:39:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ok, ill give it a shot, 1st visit laythe, then do what i can to mess with tylo and grav assists.

Or is it more efficient to 1st get in orbit around said body before landing (this has the added benefit of giving me more choices as to where i land too)?\n\nAs to the first issue, I was thinking that there\u0027s a pretty big difference in orbital inclination between the two bodies, so it would take a lot of dV to do the plane change, but if that\u0027s not the case, then I agree dropping PE to Tylo is not necessary. Certainly if it\u0027s only a couple hundred m/s, then by all means straight from one to the other would be the way to go.\n\nAs to the second question, the most efficient way to land on a particular airless body in theory would be to cross into its SOI from behind at the minimum possible speed, on an approach trajectory that grazes the surface, then suicide burn at PE to bring horizontal velocity to zero. I believe that if you want to do this in stages, i.e. establish a highly eccentric orbit on the first pass and then lower its AP in stages from your low point, that would actually take roughly the same amount of energy as doing the whole suicide burn in one go. For Pol and Bop, as you pointed out, a lot of your energy budget will be spent matching orbital velocities, as their gravity is too feeble to change your speed very much."},{"CreatedByName":"ManEatingApe","CreatedById":151354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T17:22:36Z","Content":"This challenge was a lot of fun, really enjoyed designing smaller and smaller craft that could make it.

Since im already clipping the tanks to death, volume logic falls out the door, but i refuse to not have dry mass be fair for fuel tanks, and since i cant edit the FLT-100\u0027s mass in the .cfg, ill just take the monoprop tank thats a bit more then twice the mass (and same size), and cram a bit more then twice the FLT-100s fuel into it. Satisfies fuel tank mass fraction, and actually lets me cut the stack of fuel tanks inside the MK2 bay from 35 to 15. \n\nYes this is technically outside of the game limits, but since i do not consider swapping LFO tanks for pure LF a cheat, i see no reason why i cant swap monoprop tanks for LF too.\n\nOhh, and ive managed to BARELY pull off ~7K dV with a fully armed ship.
