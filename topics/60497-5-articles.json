You might have noticed that the Bell Jetranger has those two winglets on the back, in front of the tail rotor? They\u0027re there to control pitch and yaw, they offer no lifting capabilities on top of that. A famous TV example of a helicopter is Airwolf, described in the show as a supersonic lifting body with rotors. Now, there are two things wrong with the premise of a supersonic helicopter: the rotors can\u0027t handle the stress of supersonic flight (no material yet tried, not even carbon nanotube fibre, can handle supersonic rotation on top of an aircraft; even SCRAMjets have to slow the air down so the engine can breathe), and the Bell 222 (the airframe Airwolf was built on) is about as aerodynamic as a brick, so apart from the fairly impressive looking shape could not be described as a lifting body at any speed. Not to mention the fact that the pontoons on the actual aircraft had to be painted to make it look like it had inboard weapons and inline jets* because the props made for it in \u0022deployed\u0022 mode failed FAA inspections (the missile pod had a habit of falling off mid-flight), the closeups of the deployed pods had to be shot using a scale model.\u003Cp\u003E*I\u0027ve seen gas turbines that\u0027d probably have fit in the \u0022jet intakes\u0022 on Airwolf but I doubt they would have been able to deliver the thrust to weight ratio required to take a five thousand pound helicopter to the end of the runway before running out of fuel, never mind beyond the sound barrier at 70,000 feet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there\u0027s an idea for a sub-challenge: build a utility helicopter using the specific helicopter powerplants supplied in FS, to carry no less than two Kerbals to the island and back (so round trip range of ~65km?) while keeping the weight as low as possible.

Particularly, that I didn\u0027t need quite as massive a chopper to airlift 40 tons stably, as long as I enclosed the cargo in the fuselage (where it couldn\u0027t pendulum very far). Thus, I was inspired to improve the design- by reducing the weight of the outboard fuselages (now attached by flat structural panels from one of my many mods), and thus being free to use fewer helicopter rotors and STILL have extra mass to budget for some small wings and a pair of Thermal Turbojets, and yet have a HIGHER rotor-only TWR than before...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Thermal Turbojets aren\u0027t nearly as powerful as they look, by the way. Each provides only about 12-18 kN thrust in the relevant range of altitudes and airspeeds for a helicopter, and that\u0027s with the most powerful 1.25 meter pre-fusion reactors available: KSP-Interstellar\u0027s Solid Bed, Uranium Nitride-based 1.25 meter fission reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s at quite a high mass pricetag for the TTJ\u0027s- I\u0027m not sure that an all electric copter can make 400.87 m/s without much larger wings and at least a second pair of TTJ\u0027s... (once more, the real-world helicopter speed record, by John Trevor Egginton in 1986: 400.87 km/h (111.35 m/s)) So, it probably can\u0027t make that award unless you allow it in on the real-world speed, like you did the HELO: B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt *CAN* circumnavigate at over 136.7 m/s, however...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually, it looks like a lot more than a second pair of TTJ\u0027s would have been necessary to clear 400 m/s.

One would have to exceed a stationary sea-level TWR of more than 9 (extremely difficult- the HELO: C can\u0027t even do that with its forward rotors active) as drag will slow the craft down, and be capable of rotating the net thrust to a more than 75 degree angle through either pitching the craft (extremely difficult at such extreme angles with a craft heavy enough to lift 40 tons, without reaction wheel spam) or rotating the rotors... Of course, while rotating the rotors would allow this, without stacking rotors something like 6 high, it\u0027s not possible to rotate this much thrust vectoring that way without serious part-clipping on a craft that can lift 40 tons...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forward electric propellers are actually WORSE for high speeds than the electric copter rotors, so spamming forward rotors doesn\u0027t work either- they only produce 20% thrust at a velocity of 425 m/s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real-world speed record of less than 120 m/s was not only achieved with an extremely small helicraft capable of safely pitching forward at extreme angles (it could have NEVER lifted 40 tons- its rotor simply wasn\u0027t powerful enough), it was also achieved at BELOW sea level, over an area of salt flats (nowhere on Kerbin does similar terrain exist)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBOTTOM LINE: The golden rule of challenges is that you should be able to demonstrate something is possible yourself before asking anyone else to do it. Therefore, Fengist, I challenge *YOU* to develop an electric helicopter that can both lift 40 tons and exceed 400 m/s landspeed in its various versions, without part-clipping, fusion or antimatter reactors.
