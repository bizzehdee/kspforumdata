A couple more of those on the wall and people might even start to believe that we\u0027re running a space program from here.\u0022\u00A0He raised an eyebrow. \u201CAlthough we do indeed have a lot to do before you can take that picture of Gene on Minmus.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb had the sense to keep a straight face as Geneney blushed. \u201CSpeaking of which, Genie,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Chow\u0027s the new Mark 2 capsule coming along?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot much more than an engineering mockup at the moment, Jeb,\u0022\u00A0said Joemy from the doorway. \u201CNothing you could stick on top of a booster but it\u0027s a good test bed for crew fit and function and the new environmental systems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre we still on for a three kerbal crew?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProbably,\u0022\u00A0said Joemy, \u201Cprovided that we can fit all the electronic gear in too. The lower equipment bay is starting to look a bit crowded but Bill\u0027s working on that. Oh hey, Bill - we were just talking about the electronics for the Mark 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill slumped into a chair. \u201CTalk to me about that, once we\u0027ve got the Mark 1 working properly,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CAny chance of a coffee, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight behind you, Bill,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb, \u201CStill having problems with the radar then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh the radar is fine, Jeb,\u0022\u00A0said Bill as he poured himself a coffee. He added a lump of sugar, paused for a moment and added two more. \u201CEdsen found some lighter weight parts in that heap of old avionics gear that Ornie brought over. No it\u0027s the computer that\u0027s giving us all the problems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA three sugar problem?\u0022said Jeb, \u201CWe havn\u0027t had one of those for a while.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill sighed as he took a sip of the thick, sweet brew. \u201CNo we haven\u0027t,\u201C he said, \u201Calthough the radar came close. But getting the computer to talk to the radar and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, making a robust enough interface board to survive the launch and making the whole mess small and light enough to cram into a Moho capsule is very definitely a three sugar problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can give you more weight to work with,\u0022 said Wernher, \u201CThe LV909 in the upper stage is more efficient than the 905, so we can handle a slightly heavier capsule for the same fuel load.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill stared into his mug. \u201CThat\u0027s something anyway.

What have I missed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree sugars,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan grimaced. \u201CComputer still causing problems, Bill?\u0022\u00A0he asked\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill looked up. \u201CEdsen and Neling got the radar working at last,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut we\u0027re having problems integrating the computer with the radar, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and rate indicators.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Lucan sat down beside him. \u201CWhat if we pull the computer?\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWill the radar play nicely with the rest of the capsule systems?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill took another sip of coffee as he thought it over. \u201CIt should do,\u0022\u00A0he said at last, \u201CThe computer takes data from the radar but isn\u0027t needed to control it. I should be able to rig up a reporter system so that Adelan can get rate, range and bearing data directly and hand off the calculations to Mission Control. It\u0027s a cumbersome way to fly though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually,\u0022\u00A0said Lucan, \u201CI don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be that bad. A couple of guys in the flight dynamics team have been figuring out some backup options. Visual navigation techniques, manoeuvre charts for flying manual rendezvous, that kind of thing. Theoretically we could just about do the whole thing by hand if we had to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHave you run these on the Whirligig?\u0022\u00A0said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027ve had a couple of goes with the charts,\u0022\u00A0said Lucan. \u201Cbut the Whirligig isn\u0027t a good enough sim for the visual navigation procedures.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked thoughtful. \u0022It\u0027ll need some work,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut using the backup options for a non-critical rendezvous would be a valuable test anyway and it would give Bill\u0027s team more time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAssuming that Adelan is willing, that sounds like a plan to me,\u0022 said Jeb. \u201CWe\u0027ll need to have the computers working for Moho 5 and 6 though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded. \u201CWe will,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cand we\u0027ll have them working by then, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know you will, Bill. Right, what\u0027s next?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney pulled a notebook out of his pocket. \u201CI had a rather interesting phone call the other day from a Mr Lodan,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CApparently he\u0027s the director of the Kerbin Space Agency...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb choked on his coffee. \u201CThe what!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s about what I thought,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CDirector Lodan was remarkably non-specific about the details of his space agency but he did wonder whether we would be interested in joining his tracking and communication network.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan looked across at him. \u201CI\u0027d say that we might be,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWhat does it involve?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs far as I could work out, free access to three tracking and communication stations,\u0022 said Geneney. \u201CThe first one has just finished testing - that\u0027s down by the Koluclaw mountains. I\u0027m not quite sure where the others are - Mr Lodan did mention place names but they didn\u0027t mean much to me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan scratched his ear. \u201CAnother station out by the Koluclaws, would be useful,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u0022Between that and Sigbin and Doodie\u0027s station, it would improve our orbital coverage quite a bit. Are you sure you didn\u0027t recognise those other names, Gene?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAfraid not,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney,\u00A0\u201Cbut I think they were supposed to be placed equidistantly around Kerbin, or as near to equidistant as they could manage.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sat up straight. \u201CNow \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E would be helpful,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CEven better coverage for orbital spacecraft but more importantly - proper communications and tracking for M\u00FCn bound craft.\u0022He scowled. \u201CThere has to be a catch here somewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shrugged. \u201CMr Lodan did say that his facilities were for \u0027the further development and free use of any and all spaceflight efforts on Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSounds like a pompous bureaucrat to me,\u0022 muttered Jeb, \u201CThis is a government organisation if I ever heard one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProbably,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201Cbut any money we can save on comms facilities is money we can spend on new hardware. And frankly, I\u0027ll take whatever help we can get right now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHelp?\u0022\u00A0said Jeb, \u201CGenie - we\u0027ve got more money now than we\u0027ve ever had thanks to you. The Moho 4 is going to be more of a flying billboard than a rocket ship. That new deal with Stratus was a masterpiece and I can\u0027t believe you talked Zaltonic into taking out that sponsorship deal \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E giving us free batteries for the rest of the Moho flights. We\u0027ve even got some of the Probodyne money left! I know that we can always use more funds but is it that much of a problem right now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201Cit is. Look - the Moho booster can put a single crew capsule into orbit with enough consumables for maybe a day. With a bit of tweaking and a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of weight shaving, it\u0027ll put a probe into orbit around the M\u00FCn or possibly Minmus if we pare the payload back to the bare essentials. For anything else - we\u0027re going to need a bigger rocket.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow big is big?\u0022\u00A0said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CClustered LVT-20s in the main stage, plus more of the same or scaled up Trashcans for the strap on boosters. For the second stage we might get away with a 909 but we\u0027ll probably need to use another LVT for that as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s face fell. \u201CSeriously, Genie - seven, maybe eight T-20s?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CUsing engines and parts that we have right now, that\u0027s about the minimum we need to put a Mark 2 into orbit with a very basic service and propulsion module. The good news is that a slightly downsized version would also let us put a decent sized probe around the M\u00FCn, Minmus or possibly even Duna or Eve. Roncott and Camrie have also been doing some preliminary design work on a new probe chassis.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sighed. \u201CI can see where this is going. Fine, go ahead and see what Mr Lodan is offering.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf it makes you feel any better, Jeb,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CI\u0027m a bit suspicious about this myself. I can\u0027t believe that a new space agency would simply spring up out of nowhere and build a Kerbin wide space tracking network unless they were planning to do something with it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan laughed. \u0022Maybe you can pick up some business for us, Gene.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb finished his coffee and put his mug down. \u201COK then. Gene has a word with Mr Lodan and in the meantime, we go ahead with Moho 4 without the flight computer. Anything else?\u0022 He looked around his office but nobody else spoke up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, everyone.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan jerked forward against her harness and narrowly managed to avoid bumping her head on the hatch wheel as the first stage engine shut down. A light blinked off on her control panel as the decoupler ring fired, pushing the spent stage away from the rest of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 4\u003C/em\u003E. Seconds later she was pushed back into her seat again as the second stage engine lit with a reassuring rumble. She caught a brief glimpse of the midnight blue sky outside the hatch window before turning her attention back to her instrument panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Moho 4. Second stage ignition confirmed. Altitude and velocity are green.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan\u0027s voice echoed in her ear. \u201CCopy that, Moho 4. Trajectory is nominal - you\u0027re flying straight through the window.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENot the best choice of words after that staging\u003C/em\u003E. \u201CUnderstood, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan kept a wary eye on the booster status displays as the Moho 4 continued it\u0027s long climb to orbit but the tank pressures and engine temperature stayed firmly within their expected limits. Apart from the steady vibration from the engine it was almost like a simulated launch in the Whirligig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYeah and its about now that the Booth Crew like to throw something into the works. Keep on top of it Adelan.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Moho 4, Flight. Forty seconds to loss of signal. All systems are Go. Good luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Flight. See you on the next orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio crackled and fell silent. Twenty seconds later the second stage engine shut down and the capsule shuddered as the final decoupler ring fired to push the empty second stage away. The reaction control system fired automatically, nudging the capsule further away from the lazily tumbling rocket. As the capsule pitched down into the correct orbital attitude, Adelan\u0027s breath caught in her throat as a blue glow filled the capsule interior and she took her first proper look outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI don\u0027t think you\u0027re in the Whirligig any more, girl.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight plan for the first orbit was simple. Monitor capsule systems, enjoy the view and wait to re-establish contact with Mission Control. Adelan spent most of it with her face pressed up against the hatch window watching her home roll past beneath her. From this height it was almost impossible to get any sense of depth. Continents and oceans appeared flat, spread out before her like a fantastically detailed map. Towns and cities were clearly visible as irregular sprawls of densely packed shapes that flowed across their patches of landscape like amoebae, creeping around hills and insinuating themselves into the gaps between rivers. Away from the cities, a mosaic of fields and farms marched across the land broken up by forests and moors and ending in a ragged fringe near the mountains. The regular dots of Kerm groves covered farmland and moors alike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbol dipped below the horizon as the capsule sped out over the ocean. Streamers of crimson and cerise light washed through the clouds and all too soon, the capsule was plunged into darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, as Adelan\u0027s eyes adjusted, the stars came out around her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe softly glowing band of the Great River dominated her view but even from this perspective she could recognise some of the constellations; the Octopus, the Minor Fishes and the Little Snake, the Cookpot, the Plough and the Ship. Around and far beyond the familiar patterns from her childhood, uncounted shoals of new stars littered the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThey all look very different today,\u003C/em\u003E she murmured to herself as the capsule raced onwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lights on the instrument panel dimmed as the first faint rays of light from Kerbol filtered through the clouds below. The radio crackled and buzzed and then she heard Sigbin\u0027s familiar voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 4, Wakira Station. Come in, Moho 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWakira Station, Moho 4. Peaceful morning, Sigbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPeaceful morning to you too, Adelan. We\u0027re tracking you in a one six two by one eighty eight orbit. Barkton will confirm timing for the first burn but in the meantime we\u0027ve got some thrusters to warm up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have the checklist, Wakira. Standing by.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan set to work, setting switch positions and watching for warning lights as she brought the reaction control system online.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy board is green, Wakira. Please confirm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COur board is green, Moho 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHorizon scanners are good. Starting IGU check.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe navball attitude and direction indicator on Adelan\u0027s control panel shifted slightly as the guidance system updated the gyro positions in the inertial guidance unit, aligning them with the capsule axes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlatform is good, Wakira, Re-orienting to local horizon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Moho 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan took hold of the hand controller and nudged it gently to one side. There was a quick rattle of solenoids as the reaction control rockets fired, slewing the capsule slowly round. She watched the navball intently as it drifted round and then fired a second burst from to bring the capsule to a halt. Deftly she twisted the handgrip a fraction, triggering a second set of control thrusters. The capsule spun about it\u0027s axis. Flame puffed out of the thrusters again and it stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWakira, Moho 4. Oriented to horizon, roll and yaw control is good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Moho 4. Standby for handover to Barkton Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Wakira. Have a good day down there - looks like it\u0027s going to be a scorcher.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell us about it. Wakira Station out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule was silent for a moment and then Lucan\u0027s voice crackled over her headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 4, Flight. How\u0027s it looking up there, Adelan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeautiful view from here, Flight. Capsule systems are good, platform is aligned, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E checks out in roll and yaw.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Moho 4. Everything looks good from here too. We\u0027ll confirm \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E in pitch and then we\u0027re Go for catch up. According to the flight dynamics team we can proceed as planned with an orbit raising burn at MET one-four-two minutes followed by circularisation at MET one-nine-one dot thirty\u00A0minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Flight. Apoapsis to two one zero kilometres and then circularise at the start of orbit three. Do you have the burn times?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAffirmative, Moho 4. Stand by.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour tongues of fire lit up the darkness over Kerbin, although nobody on the surface would have been able to see them. The matt black flanks of the capsule remained hidden in the dark, although yellowy white light sparkled off thruster housings and antennas. Inside the capsule, Adelan settled gently into her seat. Then the thrusters flicked off and she bobbed back up against her harness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn observer on the ground would have been extremely hard pressed to spot the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 4\u003C/em\u003E as it crossed the terminator on its way up to the highest point in its orbit. Even with quite a powerful telescope, the small, dark, swiftly moving capsule would have been next to impossible to find. Fortunately, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E tracking station did not rely on optical tracking and the kerbals sitting at their consoles in Mission Control knew exactly when the craft was supposed to pass overhead. Even so Edsen was relieved to see his screen light up with data at the expected time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight - we have reaquisition,\u0022 he reported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pushed his headset back and scratched his sweaty scalp. In the background he could hear one side of the ground to air dialogue as Lucan ran through a systems check with Adelan. According to the altitude reading on his console, the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 4\u003C/em\u003E was near to apoapsis. Right on cue, it\u0027s velocity suddenly increased and then settled at precisely the pre-calculated value in the flight plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s a good burn, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Edsen. Let\u0027s see if we can find that satellite.\u0022\u00A0Lucan turned back to his console. \u201CMoho 4, Flight. We\u0027re Go for radar acquisition. Estimated distance to the Kerbin 1 is no more than three hundred\u00A0kilometres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAboard the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 4\u003C/em\u003E, Adelan reached out and flicked a toggle switch. In the capsule nose, Bill\u0027s rendezvous radar came to life, sweeping the space in front of the spacecraft with its electronic gaze. The reflection from the metal sphere was weak but it was enough. Adelan smiled broadly as she thumbed the microphone switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Moho 4. I have a lock. Range one-five-eight\u00A0kilometres, bearing three dot six radial in, two dot two\u00A0normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe satisfaction in Lucan\u0027s voice was unmistakeable. \u201CGood work. Edsen is working the next burn. Stand by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral orbits later, the satisfaction had given way to frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis just isn\u0027t working, Flight! Maybe an onboard computer or more comms uptime would do it but trying to run the manoeuvre when I\u0027m out of touch for most of each orbit is just impossible. It doesn\u0027t matter how close I get, the damn thing just slides past at a different angle every time!\u0022\u00A0Adelan paused. \u201CSorry, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJudging from the language that I\u0027ve been getting from the press loop, I think we can trust Leland not to write that down. We gave him a good interview with Edsen\u0027s team too. Okay, take a break and get set up for Objective Two on the next pass.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy \u003Cem\u003Ethat,\u003C/em\u003E Flight. Speak to you in an hour or so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan\u0027s headset crackled and then fell silent as the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 4\u003C/em\u003E flew over Barkton\u0027s radio horizon. She stretched as best she could in the cramped confines of the capsule and then reached for the squeeze bottle clipped to the wall. The water was tepid but still wonderfully refreshing after nearly five hours of flying. She set the bottle floating by the window, pulled a foil package out of it\u0027s clip on the wall and ripped it open. \u003Cem\u003ELooks like one of Ornie\u0027s compressed ration bars. Oh well, better than nothing\u003C/em\u003E. As she bit into the bar, her eyes lit up at the wholly unexpected taste of sweet dried sunfruit pieces and chocolate chips. \u003Cem\u003EI take it all back. Ornie - I think I love you!\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWashing down the end of the fruit bar with a last mouthful of water, Adelan clipped the bottle back to the wall and stowed the empty foil package. Then she reached under the control panel and retrieved a coil of crinkled silvery tubing fitted with a blue adapter plug and locking collar on each end. She fitted one plug into a socket on her spacesuit, twisted it and heard it click into place. Then she twisted the locking collar in the opposite direction and felt it click into place too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESuit locked, suit lock locked\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan uncoiled the umbilical and plugged the other end into its socket in the arm of her seat. The tubing was stiff and drifted awkwardly around her in the zero gravity environment of the capsule. She pushed it to one side as best she could and twisted the second collar into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESupply locked, supply lock locked \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe forced her hands into her stiff spacesuit gloves and secured them at the cuffs. Finally she put her helmet back on, snapping it into place on the neck ring of her suit. The suit gloves were too restrictive to let her cross her fingers, so she tapped the edge of the control panel for luck and toggled the cabin air supply switch to EVA. As cool air began to flow over her face, she switched her headset from CAB to SUIT and waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWakira Station, Moho 4. Come in, Wakira.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no reply. Adelan checked the switch positions on the communications panel and tried again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWakira Station, Moho 4. Come in, Wakira.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe heard a faint buzz from her headset and then Sigbin\u0027s muffled voice in her ear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 4, Wakira. You\u0027re very faint, Moho 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan twisted the volume dial up to full.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ve boosted volume to maximum, Wakira. How do you read?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot great but enough to do the job.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Wakira. Environmental systems are Go for EVA. Requesting capsule systems check.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that. Your board is green and you are Go for depress.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan reached out, flipped open a protective cage on her control panel and jabbed the button underneath with one padded forefinger. Immediately air began to vent from the capsule and her suit began to swell as the cabin pressure dropped. As the pressure fell below ten percent of normal, she closed the vents and re-caged the button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWakira, Moho 4. I\u0027m opening the hatch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wheel was stiff and cumbersome to operate with gloved hands but Adelan eventually managed to turn it far enough to withdraw the locking bolts and push the hatch open. She released her seat harness, took a firm hold of the hatch frame and then slowly and carefully stood up on her seat and pulled her head and body hrough the doorway into open space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was absolute silence over the air to ground loop. Sigbin shared a worried look with Doodlie and keyed her microphone again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 4, Wakira. Do you read me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLoud and clear ,Wakira! You can\u0027t see me but I\u0027m waving at you guys!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoodlie slapped his forehead and pressed a switch on his console. \u201CDon\u0027t bet on that, Moho 4. How about another wave for the camera?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small television screen lit up and Doodlie\u0027s jaw dropped open. Sigbin glanced up too and promptly sat back in her chair with a thump. The curved surface of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 4\u003C/em\u003E filled the bottom of the screen. For the first time ever, the capsule hatch was open in flight and a space suited figure was leaning out of it and waving at them. Behind the capsule, the bright backdrop of Kerbin lit up the entire scene. The image was good enough that Sigbin could just make out clouds and the edge of the Wakira coastline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh wow...\u0022\u00A0she said softly. \u201CMoho 4, is that view as good as it looks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProbably even better, Wakira!\u0022\u00A0came the exuberant reply. \u201CThe view from the capsule window is spectacular enough but this... this is something else! I tell you, Sigbin - every kerbonaut that we send up needs to see this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t suppose Jeb has any spaces left in the roster has he?\u0022\u00A0said Doodlie wistfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot for Moho flights,\u0022\u00A0said Adelan, \u201Cbut we\u0027ll need plenty of new pilots for the new three kerbal capsule. We all build them - we all fly them guys.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, both Doodlie and Sigbin decided that they would be taking a trip to Barkton in the not too distant future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s a tempting thought,\u00A0Adelan. Wish we could watch you out there all day but you\u0027re about out of range. One minute to loss of signal and transfer to Barkton Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Wakira.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan waited as the radio crackled into static and back again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 4, Barkton. Come in, Moho 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo I have to, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a pause and then a chuckle. \u201CNot yet, Moho 4. We\u0027ve got you right on camera and you\u0027ve got a lot of people down here cheering at you. From the expression on Jeb\u0027s face, I think you\u0027re giving him an idea or two as well!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe boss is watching this too, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E watching this Moho 4. Everyone here at the junkyard and I don\u0027t know how many others around the world. You\u0027re headline news, Adelan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CToo bad I can\u0027t do much more than wave at the camera,\u00A0Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s good enough for us. We\u0027ll get to more complex EVAs in time but right now - you\u0027re making us proud here, Moho 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan was suddenly very thankful that her face was obscured by a reflective visor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUhh, thanks Flight. I just wish that everyone who helped put me up here could see this too. Flying the capsule is already pretty special but EVA... it\u0027s just me, Kerbin and the whole wide universe, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, there was silence from Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Moho 4. I hate to bring us back to the flight plan but how\u0027s the suit holding up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m as snug as a kerblet in its pouch, Flight. Thermal control is excellent, mobility is good, environmental systems are nominal. Feels great to be able to stretch my arms without worrying about knocking into anything important.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat I can imagine, Moho 4. The Kerbal 2 was a bit cramped too but I only had to spend twenty minutes squashed between Gene and the capsule wall.\u0022\u00A0Lucan paused. \u201COK, Moho 4, I\u0027ve got a roomful of people here confirming your suit status report.

The pressure on his eardrums subsided but he still couldn\u0027t hear anything through his heavy flight helmet. The fuel gauges showed a healthy reserve left in both propellant tanks and for a moment he was sorely tempted to try an engine restart and see just how high his aircraft could take him.

He relaxed his grip on the control stick but the aircraft didn\u0027t respond and his eyes widened as the artificial horizon tipped past 60 degrees. He pushed the control stick hard over, feet dancing on the rudder pedals as he fought for control. Beads of cold sweat popped out on his forehead, as the bank angle fluttered perilously close to vertical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the last possible instant the control surfaces held, flipping the \u003Cem\u003ESkyhawk\u003C/em\u003E back over in another snap-roll.The aircraft see-sawed across the sky, ailerons flip-flopping up and down and rudder flicking from side to side. The nose dipped sharply and it plunged downward, wings still rocking wildly. Enley gritted his teeth and hauled back on his controls For one agonising moment the \u003Cem\u003ESkyhawk\u003C/em\u003E refused to respond and then, centimetre by centimetre, the nose began to rise. Blinking the sweat out of his eyes, he released the back-pressure on the stick and let the aircraft settle into a shallow dive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe utter blackness outside the cockpit canopy faded into a chilly indigo sky, lit from beneath by an iridescent blue glow. For a fleeting instant Enley marvelled at the spectacular view of Kerbin spread out before him.

This time the bank held steady at the commanded twenty degrees. As he swooped down through fifteen thousand metres, Enley allowed himself another glimpse of the view outside. \u003Cem\u003EOnly not quite and all of it at once,\u003C/em\u003E he murmured to himself. \u003Cem\u003EThose crazy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E guys sure got\u003C/em\u003E that \u003Cem\u003Ebit right.

Enley scanned his instrument panel and nodded to himself as the altimeter unwound past ten thousand metres. Working his controls in short, precise movements, he rolled the \u003Cem\u003ESkyhawk\u003C/em\u003E to the right in the first of a planned series of wide S-shaped turns, designed to bleed off his excess speed before final approach. Far below, a vast expanse of forest whipped past in a supersonic blur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnley soared over the thinning forest canopy and across the surrounding grasslands. The edge of the forest was ragged with straggly clumps of trees spilling haphazardly onto the plains. As he shot past, he was startled by a sudden glimpse of smeared out muddy brown amidst the greenery. He pulled the \u003Cem\u003ESkyhawk\u003C/em\u003E round for the last time, easing into a shallow dive to maintain airspeed as he lined up on the distant runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final pass over the trees was lower and slower and Enley blinked in surprise as he flew towards an enormous semicircle of wilted and browning vegetation stamped into the grass at the edge of the forest. \u003Cem\u003ELooks like someone\u0027s making themselves a new field - but I don\u0027t see any signs of life.

Lemdan pulled on the sheets, expertly trimming the sail until it just caught the wind and billowed out with a sharp crack. The heavy rope squeaked against a gleaming brass cleat as he made it fast, rocking back on his heels as his vessel lurched into motion. Almost keel-less, it was about as manoeuvrable as a kaya on a frozen pond but fortunately the light breeze was blowing dead aft, bringing the faintest whiff of salt from the Wakira coastline with it and providing almost perfect sailing conditions for the small, square rigged raft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis close to the sea, the river Wak was still broad enough that even such a clumsy vessel as a raft was unlikely to hit anything. Lemdan pulled the tiller line smoothly around another cleat, dropped a neat hitch over one end and pulled it tight. He pushed his broad brimmed cap back on his head and surveyed the river with some satisfaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA string of similar rafts trailed behind him, their captains less alert to the changing wind than he had been. Further ahead he could make out a number of the larger rafts edging ahead with their sails bulging and their pennants jauntily snapping in the breeze. He nodded to himself: \u003Cem\u003EAnything more than this breeze will tip \u0027em right over. Wouldn\u0027t want to pole one of those damn whales either, never mind take one over the rapids.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tree-shaded river banks were lined with kerbals waving brightly patterned flags printed in the colours of their favourite raft. Small kerblets splashed happily in the shallows under the watchful eyes of their parents, whilst the older ones played with a colourful assortment of toy rafts. Some were painted in official team colours but as far as Lemdan could see, most of them weren\u0027t much more than hastily lashed together collections of sticks and string. He smiled and watched one of the bolder youngsters shin up a tree, climb out onto a convenient branch and plunged into the river with a yell and a mighty splash. Several of the erstwhile rafters quickly realised that it was better to drench than be drenched and soon the air was filled with spray, hurtling green bodies and shrieks of glee!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the bolder spectators had taken to the water themselves, swimming or darting around the slow moving rafts on flat bottomed bodyboards. Lemdan kept a wary eye on the closest swimmers in case they decided to hitch a lift. \u003Cem\u003EDoubt they\u0027d tip me over but one of \u0027em would slow me down fer sure.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the swimmers began to circle around behind him. Lemdan sauntered over to the centre of the raft and nonchalantly lifted his marlinspike off its hook. He propped himself against the mast and set to work unpicking a knotted hank of rope. The swimmer took the hint and backed off to a more respectful distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther ashore, crowds of kerbals strolled amongst a host of tents and an eclectic throng of smaller booths and stands. One particularly large marquee was emblazoned with an enormous stylised sailing raft that proudly proclaimed its owner to be an official supplier of the 24th Annual Wak Race. Kites fluttered from tent poles and a haze of charcoal smoke, liberally flavoured with the appetising aromas of grilled meat, toasted breads and hot baked corn, hung in the air. Lemdan leaned out over the edge of his raft and cupped his hands around his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHo there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nearest boarder looked up. Lemdan fished a coin out of his pocket and held it out at arms length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf yer goin\u0027 to be followin\u0027 me upriver, you can make yerself useful. I\u0027ll have a bucket o\u0027 corn bites an\u0027 a bluefish skewer. Salted not smoked and mind yer don\u0027t drop it! Rest o\u0027 the coin is for delivery!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe flipped the coin over the side. The boarder grinned, snatched it out of the air and paddled swiftly towards the bank. Lemdan watched as the small damp figure hauled itself out of the water, pulled its board out onto the shingle and disappeared into the crowd, emerging with a shiny white bundle, clutched in one hand. The boarder casually tossed his slender vessel back into the river and waded out after it, carrying his prize high over his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemdan raised his eyebrows as his impromptu deliveryman set out across the river. \u003Cem\u003ENot too bad - cuttin\u0027 me off at the bend and aimin\u0027 across me bows instead o\u0027 chasing along behind. Lad\u0027s got some water sense.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a quick flick of his feet, the boarder darted in and grabbed the edge of Lemdan\u0027s raft. He shoved the shiny white bundle safely up onto the logs, tipped Lemdan a mocking salute and paddled away downriver. Lemdan retrieved his parcel, ripped open the thick waxed paper and sighed as the rich smell of tangy pepper sauce, toasted pine kernels and salted bluefish filled his nostrils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy time Lemdan had finished his lunch and stowed away the empty wrappings, the last of the tents were drifting slowly astern. Up ahead, a lazy looping bend of the Wak river marked the first real challenge of the race. He unlashed his tiller, seized hold of the sheets and peered intently at the shallows by the inside bank. \u003Cem\u003ENo rocks, not seein any eddying worth mentioning. Should be plenty deep enough for this old lump \u0027o lumber.\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pushed the tiller away, deftly working the sheets to bring the raft sluggishly about. \u003Cem\u003ECareful, careful - keep \u0027er out of the irons. Not goin\u0027 fast enough fer any proper sailin here\u0027.\u003C/em\u003E The raft cut neatly across the bend, missing the bank by no more than two or three metres and edged back out into open water. \u003Cem\u003ENot too shoddy if I do say so meself.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe river glimmered in the afternoon sun. Sunbeams speared through a patch of shallow water, casting a lambent glow on the gravel beneath, whilst around the raft, surface ripples glinted in an ever shifting mosaic. Along the river banks, the tall trees and wildflower mats of the deep forest were gradually giving way to shorter hardier trees, shouldering their way through a dense carpet of bracken and thorny, blossom-speckled shrubs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe afternoon wore on and the sun sank slowly towards the horizon. The low sunlight turned the river into a blinding mirror, forcing Lemdan to squint hard as he tried to pick out his course. He grumbled to himself and pulled his cap down firmly over his eyes. It didn\u0027t help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly he heard raised voices. Blinking furiously he tried to see where all the commotion was coming from. Thankfully the sun chose that moment to disappear behind a particularly tall tree and Lemdan saw the pilots on the lead rafts all gesticulating wildly at something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemdan\u0027s gaze instinctively dropped to the water\u0027s surface, although he couldn\u0027t imagine how any halfway competent river pilot could fall overboard in these conditions. His eyes darted to and fro, frantically searching for a bobbing green head. Then it struck him that all the other pilots were pointing at the river bank and not the water. Puzzled, he followed their gestures and nearly fell overboard himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA vast swathe of wilted grass stretched out as far as he could see. The few hardy shrubs that still dotted the landscape looked sickly and blighted with a faint haze of insects buzzing over them. Lemdan wrinkled his nose at the suddenly soured air. Behind the stench of rotting grass, he could just make out darker scents of... something. Something that smelt powerfully \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E, although he couldn\u0027t quite work out why.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemdan stared around in dismay as he floated on. The dismay turned to bewilderment as he spotted what appeared to be a perfectly healthy sapling jutting out from a nook in the river bank. He frowned. Much like the smell, there was something he couldn\u0027t quite identify about the lone survivor but at the same time it looked awfully familiar. Something about the shape of the leaves and the way they clustered around the stem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalby strode through the Veiidan woods with his tool belt clinking and jangling around his waist. Around him, the undergrowth was flattened and bent after the recent spring storms and several of the smaller trees were leaning over at odd angles with their roots protruding from the soil. Halby paused to paint a white cross on one particularly fine leatherbark to mark it for the cutting crews that would follow him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA huge fallen sapwood tree blocked his path, its roots reaching into the sky like gnarled fingers. He ducked under it making sure not to touch the sticky sap still trickling down the grooves in its trunk. Underneath the forest floor was dank and slimy underfoot. Halby cursed as one foot skidded in the muck and grabbed at the nearest branch to steady himself. He wiped his boot on a tuft of sickly yellow grass and nearly gagged at the combination of bruised foliage and stagnant black mud. \u003Cem\u003EDear Kerm but that\u0027s awful.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalby bent down to retie his boot lace and was startled to see other clumps of the same yellow grass dotted over the forest floor. He pulled the can of white paint out of its holster and aimed it at the fallen giant. \u003Cem\u003EStill plenty of sap in that one. Should be worth saving.\u003C/em\u003E. Then he paused and took a closer look. He drew his knife and tapped the hilt against the trunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of the clear tap tap tap of steel against hardwood, he was rewarded with a dull thudding sound. Reversing the blade, he cautiously jabbed it into the bark. The blade slid effortlessly through and deep into the unnaturally spongy wood underneath. He frowned and pressed down on the handle. A large chunk of wood tore out of the trunk, ripping the rotten bark away as it went. A cloud of spores exploded into the air and Halby flung one arm over his face to protect himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhat in the hells?! \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalby grabbed a second can of paint from his belt and viciously sprayed a bright red cross on the sapwood trunk. \u003Cem\u003EJust in case. Would take a real bug-wit not to spot something was wrong but \u003C/em\u003Ethat\u003Cem\u003E amount of rot would catch anyone by surprise.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe further Halby went into the forest, the more uneasy he became. The trees around him were encrusted with moss and lichens, even on the dry side of their trunks. Thick skeins of mistletoe ran wild over their branches, streaming down in great gauzy sheets that rustled in the breeze. A cloying smell of mildew and rot hung over everything. Fighting down his rising nausea, he pressed on. \u003Cem\u003ENeed to get to the bottom of this. Doubt anything is worth cutter time though.\u003C/em\u003E He pushed through a particularly thick curtain of mistletoe and emerged into a murky clearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden crunching sound underfoot. Halby looked down in trepidation and leapt backwards with a startled cry. The floor of the was alive with trail after trail of ants, termites, woodlice and other creatures that he didn\u0027t even recognise. In places the leaf litter churned and rippled as waves of insects marched past. The few remaining tree stumps in the clearing were coated black with tiny writhing forms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Halby lifted his gaze and his mouth fell open. Right in the very centre of the clearing was a tall slender sapling. It was tall enough to have started growing its first lateral branches and the second ring of leaves around it\u0027s stem were well developed. It\u0027s leaves were bright glossy green and perfectly formed. They rustled in the dank, fetid air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt can\u0027t be. It\u003C/em\u003E can\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ebe...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe emergency team stared around in horror. The village itself seemed to be largely intact but the surrounding fields and orchards were ruined. Most of the villagers wandered aimlessly, or sat outside their huts gazing blankly into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hut door swung open and the medical team emerged, carrying an elderly kerbal on a stretcher. Sallow skin drooped off his emaciated frame in slack green folds and his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets as he thrashed against his restraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u0027re coming! They\u0027re coming!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the medics held up a syringe and raised his eyebrows. The senior doctor shook her head sharply and bent closer to the old kerbal, murmuring into his ear. Whatever she said only agitated her patient still further. Specks of foam spattered against his chin as he screamed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe sparks are coming! They\u0027re still coming! They\u0027re going to kill us all!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s hand shook as he turned off the television and turned to face Gerselle. Her face was pale and drawn and her fingers trembled on the arm of her chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSparks. I didn\u0027t see any sparks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s eyes twitched at the memory. \u201CI did,\u0022\u00A0he replied quietly. \u201CWhat did you see instead?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI saw a great black wall,\u0022\u00A0Gerselle said. Her voice quavered. \u201CIt was suffocating me, trapping us away from the light, crushing us into our prison.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat makes sense,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Jonton slowly. \u201CYou were the new Kerm, trying to take your own ground. You didn\u0027t care that some of it was already taken.\u0022\u00A0He grimaced. \u201CWe barely managed to hold you off. I don\u0027t think that poor fellow was as lucky.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s voice shook. \u201CDid you see the rest of the village? It was ruined, Jonton - just ruined! Whatever that Keeper was fighting must have been a lot closer to his grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t think there\u0027s much \u0027whatever\u0027 about it,\u0022\u00A0Jonton said grimly. \u201CHe was seeing sparks - he had to be fighting another Kerm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut how?\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle, \u201CWe planted my Grove too close to yours but mine was the first new Grove in...\u0022\u00A0Her eyes widened in horror.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CYep. I don\u0027t know how they missed it but one of the trees in his Grove must have dropped a seed too.\u0022\u00A0His fingernails dug painfully into his palms and his voice turned bitter. \u201CA new Kerm, right in the middle of his Grove. He never stood a chance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s voice was very small. \u201CI wonder if any other Kerm are starting to seed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t know,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201CI\u0027ve been trying to ask my Kerm but just the mention of another seed sends it into a panic. I get a lot of memories of sparks but one memory feels much the same as another to me. I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s talking about the fight with your Kerm or fighting between all Kerm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are we going to do? A few dozen seeds would be bad enough but if every Kerm on Kerbin decides to drop one!\u0022\u00A0Gerselle threw her hands up helplessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton took a deep breath. \u201CI do have one idea,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut I don\u0027t like it. If we can\u0027t make our Kerm understand, then we need to make them capable of understanding.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle frowned. \u201CI don\u0027t follow you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne Kerm tree on its own is barely intelligent,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton.\u201CThirty-seven knitted together aren\u0027t quite intelligent enough. But thirty eight or thirty nine might be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo!\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle. \u201CJonton you can\u0027t break the...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLaw of Thirty Six?\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. \u201CThat\u0027s what I thought too. The thing is, Gerselle, I can\u0027t find any reason \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E that law was ever written. Even the oldest records just take it for granted, just like they take so much else for granted. We follow the law blindly because it works - but we don\u0027t know why!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s there for a reason, Jonton! It comes up in the Records time after time. Why bother doing that if it wasn\u0027t important?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Records are like that, Gerselle. Old facts repeated again and again. For goodness sake, the Records insist that you should never plant leatherbark and sweetleaf together in the same Grove! Try telling that to my great great grandfather.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Records also insist that Groves should be planted a days walk apart, Jonton. That turned out to be pretty important wouldn\u0027t you say!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle suddenly lifted her hand and cocked her head but there was no sound from the next room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought I heard Joenie, \u201C she said quietly. \u201CI don\u0027t like this plan, Jonton. It\u0027s just too dangerous.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNor do I,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton, \u201Cbut I honestly can\u0027t think what else to do. We need answers Gerselle and we need them badly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Conclave?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was my first thought. But you know as well as I do how long it takes to gather the Chief Ambassadors. How many more seeds will fall in that time?\u0022\u00A0His voice shook. \u201CAnd we all own the same Records anyway. I hate to say it but I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll have any more idea what to do than we do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle was silent. \u201COne extra tree, Jonton.
