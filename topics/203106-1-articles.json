My biggest ship by part count, the Dream Big, was close to 1300 parts. It did indeed take minutes to load it into physics range, with the time increasing every time the ship was loaded anew - forcing to close and restart the game after a while, as this became unmanageable. but it could be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother one, named Bolt, was upwards to 1000 parts before it started shedding drop tanks. And it was lagging, but not too bad. while it\u0027s hard to make a comparison, I\u0027d say it was less laggy than the Dream Big was after dropping 300 parts in non-reusable landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now I have a new ship (still no official name), and while it\u0027s still at 1000 parts, it\u0027s performing much worse than anything else. It takes many, many minutes to load it the first time. Loading it the second time can take upwards to half an hour. I generally restart the game every single time i have to load it. I now spent the last three hours and a half just trying to launch it to orbit (notice: I already did successfully launch it to orbit two days ago, but I had to scrap it because problems. some parts were duplicated and clipped on top of each other). Trying to save time, I stuck some of the shuttles that I\u0027d normally dock in orbit after launching the main ship. The ship, including launcher, is now 1200 parts, and it consistently crashed shortly before booster separation (which only happened twice, in three hourse, because it\u0027s really slow).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, lag is not caused strictly by part count; i\u0027d like to know if someone figured out what is causing it exactly, maybe I can try to minimize it in some way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, mods are also involved, and may be partly responsible. All ships use kerbalism, and they have multiple active processes. Would stopping those processes help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last ship also has nuclear reactors from near future electrics, can that be part of the problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-18T16:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIVAs need some processing too, so a craft with lots of crew modules will probably run slower than the same craft with those crew modules swapped out for fuel tanks. Parts with a lot of detail on their surfaces and more complex collision meshes will also be more computationally expensive, and I\u0027ve found the NFE reactors fit this category (and I\u0027d imagine the Kerbalism greenhouses count for this too). Craft structure (long and thin, lots of connections using attachment nodes versus short and fat, lots of radial attachment) could also have an effect as it would change the way that parts relate to each other which would then change how the interactions are calculated; I\u0027m not sure which option would be better though so that might be worth investigating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlpacaMall","CreatedById":209127,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-19T08:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the scale you\u2019re building at, the guidelines for space station design are probably the best things to search for.
