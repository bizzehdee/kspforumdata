Placement of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters,\u00A0amount, and orientation obviously also differ, but in terms of part count the Vernor-variant takes 4 less parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet when I flew the craft, I find it does not perform as well, so my suspicion is on drag. (the mass difference should not contribute much, as it was only 625kg difference for the tank) - delta-V difference is about 300 m/s when reaching similar 80k orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I am aware that both vernor and linear thrusters have drag; however, since they are all placed on the body radially, both solution would have induced drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, I am wondering if there is an orientation of drag for vernor, which does not exist for linear? According to KSP wiki, both linear and Vernor have same drag value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: found answer on my own. Unfortunately, if you rotate a vernor perpendicular to the traveling direction, you do have increase in drag force according to AeroGUI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-24T21:35:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2019 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
