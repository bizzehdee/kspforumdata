an nuclear engine for eve return.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor launching of from kerbin (i aim at around 90km orbits) no stage separation is required !!\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite at launch the outer rockets are only fueled for ~60%!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n( \u003Cem\u003ENotice it wont work with those tanks 100% loaded becomes to heavy then\u003C/em\u003E).\u003Cbr\u003E\n( \u003Cem\u003ENotice also\u00A0 that i use Prakasa tanks here they have better weight ratios\u003C/em\u003E ).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut those outer rockets i think would only be required for Kerbin take off\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for eve take off the ship is a lot lighter leaving a rover and ore processing unit, and heat shields)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother ship will have to pull it to eve (our ship has a docking bay for that).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt around 19km nuclear air-breathing rocket is manually switched (by pressing \u00221\u0022 key), to fuel loop based propulsion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGravity turning at

it needs more tweaking, in regard to heat-shields, and parachute settings, and separation of heat-shield and lander.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am not able to tweak and test that on kerbin, i did a lot of testing but cannot test it all on kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs there a a way to quickly test things out, (taking-of and landing) on other planets ?.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\ni think it might be a good ship for eve, since those nuclear engines carry a long way on atmospheric as their only fuel source (19 km on kerbin).\u003Cbr\u003E\nEventually for taking of kerbin it has 8 nuclear turbo engines, and the common stock nuclear engine (i wonder maybe it can even fly back to kerbin?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my ship if you want to test it out what needs to be tuned to make it all work on eve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShip as ship file\u00A0\u003Ca
