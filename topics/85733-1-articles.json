And if it would be impossible for him to fly with a missing wing, would just loping of his tail work just as well as creating a prosthetic wing?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(disclaimer) I am by the way in no way obsessed with how to train your dragon\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T12:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you serious?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.Joseph Kerbertson","CreatedById":57354,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T15:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do people do this to movies? \u0022we have to break down the reasons this isn\u0027t possible\u0022... no kidding it\u0027s not possible.
