My first Dunar mission was a success, the second one a flop, my first Dres flyby a success, I guess, but this is the tale of my third Dunar mission, and probably the most pivotal one in my Kerbonaut career thus far!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome images from the mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/clOdw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s a breakdown of what happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first, I redesigned my original Duna spacecraft design. I added batteries, I mean. The first one did not have any batteries besides what the OCTO core provided, which was a whopping 10.2 units of charge. Wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter fixing this design flaw, I launched into a standard parking orbit around Kerbin (this one had an apoapse of about 400km, I think) and then something unforseeable happened. A staging error. I hit the spacebar and accidentally jettisoned and ENTIRE orange tank and engine... Which was meant to be my escape stage. Yikes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, I knew that my last stage (besides the lander itself, the one with LV-Ns in the album above) had over 5000 m/s of delta-v, so I had reason to believe it would be sufficient to take me to Duna. I lined up the escape burn, which was a technique I first learned about after anguishing over how I would ever be able to do interplanetary missions and finally watching a Scott Manley video to help me, escaped Kerbin, and warped over to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe retrofire was perhaps the hairiest part of the mission. I was burning, burning, burning, and trying with all my might to get a periapse marker or else I would sail right on by Duna like the last mission... sweat poured down my face (not really) as I watched the fuel marker tick down... 100 units of liquid fuel... 80... 50... 30... And right then, the path began curving and I got a periapse of perhaps 8km above the Dunar surface on the day side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYESSSSSSSSSSSSSS\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom then it was a simple matter of transmitting science, slowing and skimming Ike\u0027s SoI by a hair\u0027s breadth, and finally going and landing on the Dunar surface. It felt amazing because it was the first time I\u0027d landed on anything besides Kerbin and its moons in such a long time... Must\u0027ve been months! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve learned a lot from this mission, and just felt like I\u0027d share it with you awesome people!
