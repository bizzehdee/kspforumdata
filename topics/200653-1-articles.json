Doing any kind of complex work within the craft file starts at magic and _very_ quickly moves into voodoo.

The amount of time and effort to go in and work with the craft file is at least one order of magnitude greater than rebuilding the ship from scratch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve only worked by hand with a craft file once. It was to create a nice 50 x 50 plane of the 2x2 structural panels for a design I was working on. It was a lot of work to get Excel to understand and work with file. And that was simple craft, for very broad definitions of craft.\u00A0 There is a reason why there are very few tools that do any complex work with the craft files. KSP itself is pretty much the best editor we\u0027ve got.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
