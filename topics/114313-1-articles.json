It mocked the trope in gaming of the narrator dictating every action of the player\u0027s movement by having the Narrator say something, and having the choice to either follow it, or not. The second subject is the HD remake that got Greenlit on Steam in 2013. This version was very \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esimilar to the mod, except a lot was still different.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, the Narrator was holding his grasp on me. So basically, this is a discussion thread about this awesome game worth all $15 the HD remake costs with many weird endings, and many choices. (The way I was introduced was by the Danny2462 video. I loved it, watched the Pewdiepie let\u0027s play, and got the game right after I got the demo. (It\u0027s a confusing demo, even for what the game is.)) So just go wild and say theories about this game!
