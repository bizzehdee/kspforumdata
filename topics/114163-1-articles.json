I had no time to fire off the second stage and decouple everything properly as the braking RT-5 was set to something like 25% thrust. I switched the parachute to immediately deploy at the next stage, staged the chute as close to 999m altitude as human reaction allow, heard at least some of the parachute unfurl then- **CLASH POW BANG!**\n\nMiraculously the rocket was just sitting there beside the launch pad undamaged. The expended RT-5 had taken the full brunt of the impact!"}]}
