Not any time soon, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind, most of the least-unlikely options are basically time machines with FTL comms being an obvious side effect. That does put it into perspective. For example, of Kerr interior solution was right, and fire wall hypothesis wrong, it should be possible to set up a quantum teleportation algorithm to pull information out of a black hole before it goes in. Yeah, it\u0027s gross violation of cosmic censor, among other things, but since it\u0027s a classical field theory conjecture, I don\u0027t see why it necessarily have to hold when we involve quantum fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther methods have similarly absurd requirements. All in all, warp might still be our best option. And creating microscopic quantum warp bubbles for sending information might be more feasible than building warp ships. The down side is that we lack a lot more of the theory on how-to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. There are some purely stat-mech thoughts on doing local time reversals, some of which have been experimentally realized, but arrow of time is ridiculously persistent. There might be some quantum trick for pushing information through these against normal time flow, but even if it works, the time span would be measured in minutes, if not seconds. Not very useful for communications, but plenty useful for many other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Las-pen","CreatedById":121174,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T08:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-scientific-theories-head-explode/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.cracked.com/blog/5-scientific-theories-head-explode/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber 5: Quantum entanglement\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MeticulousMitch","CreatedById":34869,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T10:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat Cracked article is appalling.

Lets assume Earth and Mars are stationary to each other, and they are seperated by 5 light-minutes. If we set up the clocks correctly, their alarm seems to go off at the same time (for a stationary observer at earth or mars). Of course, for people on earth the alarm signal from mars will only reach them five minutes later than the earth alarm signal, but because we know the distance and the speed of the alarm signal, we know they have gone off at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thats only the case for a stationary observer on Earth or Mars.
