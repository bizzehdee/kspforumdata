From then through .90 a Mun landing mission was moderately difficult but quite possible. You might think it became impossible again in 1.0x, what with the loss of 905 m/s in dV, but thanks to the new atmosphere model it takes about 1000m/s less to get into orbit than it took in the earlier versions. In fact it can now get to an LKO and have about 135m/s more available than it did in the earlier versions. This makes a mission to take of from Kerbin, land the ship on Mun \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Minmus, and return to Kerbin without refueling possible. Barely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is! Note that I was chicken and took the monopropellant out of the command pod before launch, giving the ship and extra 35m/s of dV. I did this in 1.02, the new versions came out while I was doing it but I don\u0027t think they change any of the space manuevers at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kenJx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I now have to see if the K-X can get to a 72x72km orbit for no more than about 3430m/s with version 1.04, if so this mission is still possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:I just tested it, and the new atmosphere model in 1.0.4 makes it possible to get the Kerbal X to a 72x72km orbit with only 3274m/s, which is 74m/s less than in 1.0.2. So a Kerbin-Mun-Minmus-Kerbin mission can now be done even without my fancy method of getting to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T18:12:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PLAD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.

In 1.0.2, however, it\u0027s atmosphere was a paradise. It aerocaptured you without flames at whatever Ap you wanted, it filled your chutes so that you could land on high ground from steep descents with not many more chutes than needed on Kerbin, and yet impeded your launch way less and before. You could fly a heavy plane with little wing to nearly 20km where such a thing would have been unable to take off at all previously. In 1.0.2, Duna\u0027s air had everything you wanted and nothing you didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
