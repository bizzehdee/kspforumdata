I hadn\u0027t done any C# before kOS, mostly because I didn\u0027t like the prospect of a programming language where whatever Microsoft says just de-facto becomes the standard because they said so. They really didn\u0027t have a good track record with that sort of thing before C#. But I had used a lot of other languages a LOT before C# and I have to admit that it\u0027s a lot better than I expected it to be. There\u0027s still cases where I get annoyed with it, but I do recognize that the things I get annoyed by are not *really* embedded inside the language definition itself. They\u0027re the social conventions on top of it, and as such they\u0027re not really the language\u0027s fault itself. (Things like people\u0027s idea of the \u0022right\u0022 way to indent things, or when there\u0027s 2 equivalent ways to write the same statement, which one is \u0022better\u0022, etc.) These aren\u0027t built into the language, but they do tend to be built into IDEs and refinement tools like Resharper, and as such the whole community of C# programmers have become trained to take those conventions as gospel.

So much of what kOS is doing is coming from querying the actual game\u0027s API that stepping through your code a line at a time would give drastically different results. (i.e. you have 4 lines of code that query your ships\u0027 position, velocity, status, etc. If you step through them one at a time, you either must freeze KSP *itself* as you do so, or you\u0027ll end up getting values from different physics tics when debugging which isn\u0027t how it behaves when run live.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T15:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking for a small script that points my craft in the direction I want to go - but I only have lat/long.
