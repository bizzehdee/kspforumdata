At one time, all objects in the universe were constrained in a finite sphere. (Big Bang theory; doesn\u0027t matter how large the sphere is.) All objects have a finite velocity. (Increasing, sure, but at any given moment finite.) Therefore, for all times, the universe is finite in extension, since any infinity is always larger than any finity. (You can\u0027t \u0027move through\u0027 finitude to infinitude, e.g. you cannot count to infinity.)\n\nUnder this definition, the universe is of a finite but indefinite size.\n\nNow, there are two possible other ways I can see to talk about the \u0027universe\u0027 that bring up the possibility of finity or infinity. The first is to talk about the possible extension of space - not \u0027outer space\u0027 as colloquially thought of, i.e. some kind of very extensive \u0027place\u0027, but of the mathematical concept of space. Space as such must necessarily be infinite.\n\nThe second is to ask what \u0027kind of space\u0027 best describes the actions of the observed universe, i.e. what mathematical rules govern motion and what we can therefore say about the manifold along which motion takes place. This manifold might be either infinite or finite; I don\u0027t know. Personally I think the universe is highly unlikely to be a Hilbert space; I\u0027d guess it\u0027s hyperbolic. (I don\u0027t know if this has been conclusively decided or not, sadly.) Funnily enough, any hyperbolic space can be represented by a finite transform."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T23:04:10Z","Content":"The Universe has to be finite.\n\nIll just drop this thread link here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107575-Infinite-Universe-Impossible](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107575-Infinite-Universe-Impossible)"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T23:12:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Universe has to be finite.\n\u003E Ill just drop this thread link here:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107575-Infinite-Universe-Impossible](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107575-Infinite-Universe-Impossible)\n\nIf you read that thread carefully you will see that there was actually no good reason given why it should be finite."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T23:03:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you read that thread carefully you will see that there was actually no good reason given why it should be finite.\n\nIf the universe was infinite and light has had an infinite amount of time to travel then the sky we see would be bright white light everywhere as every point in space would lead to a star.\n\n The universe has no boundary but is finite.
