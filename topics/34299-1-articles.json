A few minutes before I want to do my ejection burn, all the ship\u0027s controls suddenly just stop working. WASD, throttle, RCS, SAS all totally dead. Thus, I usually can\u0027t get the ship aimed at the ejection burn target and even if I manage that before the controls go dead, I can\u0027t run the motor. As a result, I keep missing all my windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange thing is that this loss of control affects both me and MechJeb. It happens to us both whether I do all the flying, MechJeb does all the flying, or we take turns. For instance, MechJeb might be in the process of aiming for the ejection burn when you can see the RCS suddenly stop working and the ship just keeps turning like it was when this happened and never stops on the target marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS still has fuel and its light on the navball is still on. Time warp is 1x. No error messages of any kind appear. And the game isn\u0027t locked up because everything EXCEPT ship controls still works. I can go to the map and set maneuver nodes for the ship. I can switch to other ships and fly them perfectly fine. It\u0027s like Kod doesn\u0027t want me to leave Kerbin or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs noted, I have MechJeb (2.0.8.0). I also have the latest version of Kerbal Engineer (v0.6.0.3) and am using the dual-purpose part that works both in the VAB and on the ground. The ship contains parts from KWR and ISA MapSat. I have FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T17:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first, and obvious question is did you run out of power?

That does seem indeed to have been the problem. I took off the Kerbal Engineer thinking maybe it was conflicting with MechJeb but that didn\u0027t do it, so I added a RTG and now have a complete map of Duna. Yay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is very strange to me. The MapSat I\u0027m using is a standard design which I\u0027ve successfully put in orbit at Kerbin and Mun before this. It\u0027s never run out of power before, so why did it do so this time? And I\u0027m talking not even making a complete orbit of Kerbin prior to ejection because I was right on a window and kept launching, getting in orbit, having them die, and trying again. The ones that went to Minmus and Mun were in orbit the same amount of time and didn\u0027t die. So at first I didn\u0027t think this could be electric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, question answered and thanks again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T20:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn your earlier launches you probably deployed your solar panels before you ran out of juice.
