It shows that the objects are there when loading the Planets at the start of the game, but skips over the added ones. One fix I did was reworked the RSS config and borrowed a couple moons and used the values given from the extra planets RSS config to have the moons act as Neptune and Titania, which works. So basically you have 16 bodies to work with and because we only need 9 for planets, you can use the other 7 bodies to represent whatever you want. However you\u0027ll have to sacrifice a moon/satellite to get these results. Thus, you can have all the planets this way, however Neptune is meant to use Minmus\u0027s body as a base, and the moons/satellites I chose made Neptune look awful, so I just decided not to use it. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to use Minmus for both Uranus and Neptune\u0027s base PQS (not sure if that\u0027s the correct term, still getting used to how RSS works and how KSP constructs things), in which case it would work great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, I ask the community is there a fix to the extra planets mod not working?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"praise the suuun","CreatedById":69912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T04:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epraise the suuun: you will need an old texture pack, the DDS texture packs won\u0027t work in a version of RSS that old.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei dont know if i could update but dam im running out of time to finalize my save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen i saw the pictures of the latest RVE mod i knew i had to have it for my project. if you dont have those old textures anymore ill understand but it sure would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T04:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E....but the RVE mod depends on up-to-date KSP / RSS and DDS textures.
