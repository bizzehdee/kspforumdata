It\u0027s mainly designed for flying around the KSC. Sporting 2 Whiplash Turbo-Ramjet engines, you will have all the speed you need. It\u0027s not the most maneuverable, but its still good, and it\u0027s impossible to pitch too hard! Prograde is always, at most, 5 degrees behind your directional marker. Any feedback would be appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/V8h3G\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
