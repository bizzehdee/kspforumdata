I have checked back to page 50, but still can\u0027t figure out how to get rid of the additional new not quite hidden resource (no Kolony mods here, and what has repairing modules got to do with life support anyway?), and neither how I can temporarily lock some of the LS containers while transferring supplies between the others. You see, I have been using TacFuelBalancer for a long time to transfer resources, and usually that means temporarily locking the tanks you want to keep at their current levels and then just setting the others to \u0022in\u0022 or \u0022out\u0022 as appropriate. Except - you guessed it - the forced unlocking of all the supply containers prevents me from doing so. I am specifically not locking all containers, so there are always supplies available, but it still won\u0027t let me lock some of the cans ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)  (*Bob, those are Vals snacks, and don\u0027t you dare touch them unless you\u0027re starving!*). And finally there is the problem of changing the recycling \u0022recipes\u0022 -- is there an MM.cfg to set the two Greenhouse modules back to their previous stats?\n\nThe other reason why I updated was to check out what to expect, should KSP 1.1 really break the mods as many knowledgeable people seem to expect and I were forced to update. I would rather sooner than later switch to a working win64, and unless there is some way to keep the old stats, it looks like I may have to say good bye to this mod. I started using USI-LS in part because I really liked RoverDudes argument about how two resources (supplies and mulch) would be so much better than six (TAC-LS), since really, it\u0027s all the same. Meanwhile they first became three (fertilizer), and then four (the repair stuff), so we\u0027re almost back to six, but it\u0027s still a rather easy to use mod and the parts look nice, so it would be unfortunate to loose it.\n\nSorry, this became more of a rant than I really wanted to. But I\u0027m probably not the only one who would be really grateful if RoverDude or somebody else has any LifeSupport.cfg\u0027s and MM.cfg\u0027s to bundle with the release which would allow us to use USI-LS 0.3.5\u002B while keeping the stats slower players like me started their games with.

I spent almost 3 weeks planning for and executing a Duna base mission. Once I was on the ground and set up, I upgraded the mod. Now a base that had around 3 years worth of supplies, which was enough to last until I sent a greenhouse module and resupply ship at my next Duna transfer window, suddenly has about 49 days. Likewise, the return vehicle\u0027s supplies have been reduced drastically below what is needed to return to Kerbin. I\u0027ve tried to edit the Settings.cfg file to bring the rate of consumption back to .00005, but it doesn\u0027t seem to have an effect. This has frustrated me so much, I\u0027ve decided to shelve KSP until 1.1 comes out, and play around with other games in the meantime.

But I think the resource is only partially hidden - from the right-click menus and probably from the stock resource panel, but not from the middle-click-in-VAB window (is that actually stock, or some mod? not sure right now), and of cause not from alternative resource monitors. Let\u0027s assume I manage to write an MM.cfg which would remove the Resource:ReplacementParts and Module:ModuleHabitation blocks from all parts again, do you think that would work? or NRE / crash?\n\nFor the greenhouse recipes I guess I\u0027ll have to make copies of the old parts, rename them to xyz\\_legacy and search/replace in the savegame. Not like we haven\u0027t done that before elsewhere... just hopefully the parts themselves don\u0027t break with 1.1. I\u0027m not MM-savvy enough to be able to replace the complete part configuration :-/\n\nI really like the simple and clean approach, after all it\u0027s (mostly) a game. Since usually different savegames end up in separate KSP installs anyway, even the simple config file approach without UIs works fine for me, although per-save-settings are probably nice to have. And as I said before, I think the Hab-mechanic is fine (for new savegames), too - it simply changes the ship design rules, no more than say... BTSM manned ship designs end up being very much LS-driven.\n\nDo you see any chance of relaxing the forced unlocking of supply containers? Since it worked like this earlier, the code might even still be there and just deactivated right now? It\u0027s mainly causing issues when dealing with ships docked to a station; just two examples:\n\n1. \u0022life raft\u0022 escape vehicles, they have per-determined amounts of supplies to match their mission profile, but with the \u0022grab food from anywhere\u0022 mechanic, they are not ready for use in an emergency (both LS endurance and available delta-v are different)\n2. the same holds for landers attached to stations or motherships; usually after docking, they would dump their mulch into the station greenhouse and re-fill their supply for the next landing mission; but since the greenhouses dump their output all over the place, this ends up in a \\*lot\\* of alt-clicking all the parts which have supplies\n\nBy the way, landers also appear to raise a problem with the new recycler design mechanic: right now, (my) landers do not require recyclers at all; they have storage and their host station takes care of all the recycling. It appears in the future default settings, landers either need recyclers to reduce the basic consumption (which is unlikely - why would one carry a greenhouse down to a moon into a shadowed crater and launch it back up, exposing it to all the g-forces and bad vibrations?), or bigger tanks and more fertilizer later at the station. The bigger tanks.. well okay, but the fertilizer is where it\u0027s kind of broken.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T13:16:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kiwa**\n  \nspelling"},{"CreatedByName":"mitko","CreatedById":137288,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T15:03:56Z","Content":"Kiwa, if you use USI-LS why do you even need supplies on a lander?
