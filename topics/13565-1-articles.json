I\\\u0027m a new member of the Forum and I LOVE Kerbal Space Program. I have been playing for over a month, and have mastered orbiting. However, The moons of Kerbin still remain as an unconquered challenge for me. I have been also attempting to put a ExIP space station into orbit w/ Nova Punch parts, and have been unsuccessful over 16 times \u0026gt;\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E My main orbital vehicle is the Humana III (Yes, I use Roman Numerals), which is named after the mystical constellation of Humana ;P , and is so perfect at orbiting, It\\\u0027s kinda boring.
