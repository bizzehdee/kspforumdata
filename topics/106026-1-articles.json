I did reload a quicksave (or two) during the mission, but otherwise it was nothing special. I surely didn\u0027t cancel it, it was just suddenly gone after loading a quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TA3o8Qc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehave a screenshot\u003C/a\u003E of me going faster than the required speed, with the goal not completed. The screenshot was taken (relatively deep) in atmo, but I also reached a high enough speed outside / in space. Also note that it\u0027s a prograde orbit, so the displayed \u0022surface\u0022 velocity is lower than the orbial velocity would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to reload a quicksave, and the contract (or goal) was just gone. I checked mission control, it\u0027s not in the archives (speed records ends at 1050 m/s), it\u0027s not available or active, and when manually checking the savegame files (both various quicksaves and the persistent file) this entry is also nowhere to be found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all I\u0027m just mostly confused now. What could\u0027ve possibly happened that vanished this entry? As far as I know you can\u0027t manually cancel them or even fail them. I don\u0027t know how important that goal is, but the larger milestones usually have a significant payout (which I wouldn\u0027t mind)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a couple of mods installed, mostly GUI-stuff or tools though: kerbal engineer, PlaneMode, WaypointManager, Enhanced NavBall, ContractsWindow Plus, Alternate Resource Panel KSP-AVC and Module Manager. Everything is up to date as of noon CEST today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI sort of replied to this on the Contracts Window \u002B thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nightingale\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nightingale\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyway, playing around with it, I didn\u0027t see anything that would explain the behaviour of the contracts not completing (I assume that has nothing to do with the auto-accept nature). I\u0027m fairly certain that it kicks off based on the various ProgressTracking events, which would either be OnProgressAchieved, OnProgressReached or OnProgressComplete. There would *have* to be discrete steps at which those fire, maybe the steps for the contracts and progress tracking are out of sync?

At the time I wasn\u0027t much over the required speed, but I was over (both for Orbit and for Surface readings). I wasn\u0027t much outside of the atmo either, but still outside (71 km or so).

I had the speed record contract for 2500 m/s vanish as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a rocket go straight up and down, so that it met the three contracts for 70 km altitude, escape the atmosphere and (on the way back down) 1050 m/s speed respectively. After having clicked around the KSC and entered the mission control building I noticed the contract had vanished. Ten new contracts had appeared as available and one of them was a visual survey (don\u0027t know what information will help debug the issue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI exited KSP, started KSP again, loaded a save from before the rocket launch and did the mission exercise again, so that the three contracts (70km, escape and 1050m/s) completed.

On this occasion \u0027only\u0027 eight new available contracts appeared and not the visual survey one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible there is some mix-up in the random contract generation that can make the world record contract disappear?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
