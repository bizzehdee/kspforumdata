The way RSS is setup is that the new heating dynamics only are tuned to Earth. When you try to areo-brake Mars you will burn up(shock heat) the entire time until you hit the ground at around 2,500 kps. This is due to almost zero atmosphere. Therefore your not allowed to open the chutes to slow you down cuz you are still on fire. Its a game breaking situation since you have no way to slow you down. Albiet retro rockets \u0022could\u0022 be used , but that only happens AFTER the chutes have done their job. I would not even fathom the fuel requirements and weight issues by clunking my lander to death with all that fuel. So................\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Is there a way to get the chutes to force open at these mega super sonic speeds ? (consider that 2,500 m/ps on Mars is like opening chutes on Earth at around only 75 m/ps with respect to air pressure differential)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Would I have to adjust other things?
