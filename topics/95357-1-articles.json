I want to make A box that will be radially attached to your ship that will deploy a platform that has a magnetic force that only attracts one other part, the landing legs that will attach to a smaller ship that can then land on the platform in orbit and stick to it. Just want to get a few ideas on weather or not you are able to make the parts kind of like docking ports, but one being a platform and another being a special pair of landing legs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T18:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting, this would be great for a mothership with (multiple) reusable landers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T05:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm. Yes. Sort of. With a bit of a hack. You could make an \u0027invisible docking port\u0027 that is part of your landing gear setup, then put another \u0027invisble docking port\u0027 on your lander platform. You would set both of their docking module size\u0027s to the same thing... so TECHNICALLY... two landers coming together gear to gear could dock... and two of the platforms could dock together. There\u0027s no way, without a plugin, to make a gendered docking port where port a only binds with part b, though with clever design you can make it only work the way you want it to. This is how FASA creates the Apollo male and female connectors. Technically, if you could jam two of the same gender together they\u0027d dock, but the shape of the attachments makes that impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get the parts built, post back and I\u0027ll help with more details on how to get the docking modules working! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
