The next piece that I would love to see is an actual bridge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce upon a time however, I used to be a very talented modeler using 3DS Max. If some one could prompt me in the right direction that I could educate myself on the matter of making my own parts, I may be inclined to make a few parts myself that I would of course share. I actually see quite a bit of potential for these parts especially since there was never a lot of them to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T10:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should try the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/37-Add-on-Development\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAdd-on Development\u003C/a\u003E section, and more specifically the two sub forums with it.
