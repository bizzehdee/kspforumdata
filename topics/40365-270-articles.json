Lets say you wana go from kerbin to moho. you need to shed alot of velocity to match the orbital speed of your target so we\u0027ll use kerbol to slow down. Position your map so kerbin is at 3 o\u0027clock. your velocity in relation to kerbol in this alighnmet is pointing exactly at 12 o\u0027clock(or close enough, slight variance depending on where your orbit around kerbin is) to slow down you want to warp close to kerbol at 12 o\u0027clock in relation to where kerbin is. when you come out you should be rockiting strait away from kerbol. just chill or timewarp till your vertical velocity drops to near what moho\u0027s is. once you\u0027ve got your speed match move on to bending your orbit so your facing the right direction. Incidently if you wanted to go outward, say to jool and needed to accelerate you would have been warping in at 6 oclock and falling tward kerbol (then agian with jool you could just warp in and areobreak and skip all this jazz)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you should be moveing at orbital speed for moho but your vector is aimed at 12 o\u0027clock. Moho happens to be at 12 o\u0027clock which means its vector is pointed at 9 o\u0027clock. Warp in close to kerbol at ~4 o\u0027clock. Make sure your not so close that you\u0027ll impact the surface. As you fly by kerbol its gravity will distort your orbit. exactly where you end up pointing depends on where you warp to and your speed. Simply look at the map of your orbit and see what direction your outbound vector from kerbol is after you drop out. You\u0027ll probably be pointing out somewhere between 9 o\u0027clock and 11 o\u0027clock. keep warping back a few hours of the clock and passing by kerbol till your orbit is parralell to where moho is, for this example you want your vector pointing twards 9. Once your orbit is pointing in the right direction warp over to moho. Asuming you didnt pick up or loose too much speed while distorting your orbit your relitive velocity shouldnt be too high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T09:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall question.
