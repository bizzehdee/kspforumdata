For example, VABUpgrades = 100000, 250000, 1000000, the initial building upgrade cost to go from level 1 to 2 will not be 100,000 but rather 250,000. What is the first value for and is it needed for some reason I\u0027m just not seeing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Is there a way to enable something in the configuration file to be on by default? I understand the .2/.4/.6/-1 usage for establishing when something becomes available. However, when I change something like EVA capability or Custom Action Groups to be available at the start without paying for any upgrades it doesn\u0027t work. I set those values to .2 but I still have to upgrade the building for it to become available. Additionally, if I set the value to .4, it reacts the same way so the first time I upgrade it, the new capability becomes available at Level 2. No matter what I do I can\u0027t seem to get it to be turned on by default so I wasn\u0027t sure if this was even possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than the second point though, all other configuration values seem to be working properly. I do think that some documentation needs to be written if this is going to go to a full release because the .2/.4/.6 value is confusing and it took me a little bit of experimentation to get how the various scaling factors worked for things like kerbonaut hiring costs and contract scaling for reputation/advance funds/science rewards. If you need any help with that for a full release version I would be more than willing to contribute what I can and let you correct anything that might be incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last note as a suggestion - I don\u0027t know how hard it would be so don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth the time but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf an interface GUI could be built to allow people to configure these values either at career startup or on the initial load in screen after starting (kind of like the TAC-LS config window pops up on first load) then it would make setting these values up far more accessible to average joe user who doesn\u0027t dig into .cfg files regularly like us obsessives. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Just a thought...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat work Sarbian, this is exactly the kind of control I wanted for career mode when I started playing and lacked since I am no code jockey.
