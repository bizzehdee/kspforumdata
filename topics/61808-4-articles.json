I cited wikipedia to show that you are completely wrong here, and any book on acoustics or (pressure) waves will agree with me here. Sound is a kind of pressure waves. This is not more and not less than the information it carries. I never said that any measurements define sound, as by itself it is an abstract concept; we can verify a system to behave that way, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou artificially and without a good argument claiming that certain pressure waves are the very same as the perception they cause is the problem and I still don\u0027t get why you do so as your explainations just sound like repetitions or restating what I said. The former can be measured in many ways, e.g. a microphone, and then be perceived in entirely distinct ways, e.g. a diagram of its Fourier decomposition. This is easily accessible to a deaf person, too. The part that isn\u0027t accessible is the persception of sound itself; I can easily describe sound to a deaf person by showing them the wikipedia article; what I cannot do is give them the feeling of hearing. That we (currently) can measure (or percieve so) exactly one of them should already be enough argument that sound and its perception are not equal, neither in a physical nor a philosophical sense. We can even measure it entirely without ears by e.g. looking for the density change\u0027s effect on light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour statements of that may or may not be a restatement of what I just said after acknowledging the difference between the waves (which by definition contains all information sound has; your claim it not to is at least unfounded and very likely wrong) and the perception. All you do is claiming to be right with your definition while almost everyone else has already agreed on a different one; and the accepted one is in no way less able to express the properties, just in a different way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want this discussion to be meaningful, you will have to scroupulously write down the axioms, the basics of your claims, including definitions. Otherwise I don\u0027t see how this can continue without being another couple of those repetitions. And at least follow the usual meaning (i.e. accepted sources) of words when you define something; if you disagree with them being correct you will still have to use another phrase unless you want to go for lots of equivocation fallacies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lodestar","CreatedById":101720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T01:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh no!

One has to appeal to the same experience in the interlocutor in order to transmit the idea. Most of the time, the main cause of disagreement or misunderstanding in informal talks like this is when one person has some scientific training but lacks the philosophical training, and tends to see everything as a scientific proposition. He understands every statement as a claim the other has to provide proof for, while in fact the other is merely appealing to the same in what he already knows. This misunderstanding is a modern phenomenon. You won\u0027t find instances of that before the 17th century.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake for instance this misunderstanding with ZetaX regarding sound. When I say sound is something we hear, that\u0027s obviously not a claim I can provide proof for, because it\u0027s impossible for me to prove even that there\u0027s any other consciousness beyond my own, let alone prove that what I call sound is the same thing someone else calls sound. Obviously, I\u0027m merely appealing to his own personal experience that sound is what he hears. I can\u0027t do the same with someone who was born deaf and never experienced sound, hence, that\u0027s obviously the irreducible part of what sound is. His objection is that sound actually is pressure waves, and quotes Wikipedia to prove it. In other words, instead of relating what I said to his own personal experience, he\u0027s taking it as a scientific claim that needs proof, and immediately finds opposing proof to counter it, not realizing what I\u0027m saying is something he already knows. Curiously, he\u0027s acting precisely as someone who was born deaf and couldn\u0027t know what sound is besides its reducible parts! A conversation is impossible, because I\u0027m trying to transcend the concept and know what sound really is, he\u0027s trying to increase his grasp on the concept he can quantify and provide proof for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has become kind of pathological in recent years. Take the example of Patricia and Paul Churchland, who say in the future we should eliminate all mental phenomena and describe all mental states based on concepts from neuroscience. We can\u0027t say \u0022I feel tired\u0022, we can only say \u0022my serotonin levels are low\u0022. Obviously, that\u0027s merely confusing a personal state that can\u0027t be communicated, with the reducible, communicable part that can be verified by someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T14:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am completely realizing what I already know.

And there is a 50% chance of them knowing which slot it went through, and 50% where they don\u0027t know. I think that whenever they COULD (they didnt even check, but the mere fact that they could check) which slit it went through, there was a 2 slit pattern, and whenever they could not establish the fact, there was an interference pattern. This is mindboggling because the experiment setup did not change!

They come into near contact with other atoms already in the room and are repelled away from one another creating an interferance pattern. The compostition of matter in the actual oxygen around the slits effects the individual photons. Everything has a mass including light and the photons create that pattern due to bouncing off other atoms. Maybe the equiptment used to observe the process actually interferes with the rotation and deflection of paticals making the photon behave like a wave... if this is true they have accidently discovered a way of altering a particals state!\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Everten P.","CreatedById":103089,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T07:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn idea I have for this is that electrons act like waves and that measuring device is the thing that caused it, in any way either light or material had to have interfered, the light would have affected the electrons with electomagnetism or radio waves.

Dependend on the amplitudes of the propagating wave one can determine the probability of the particle to interact with the wall. For the sake of argument: Say the probability is 80%. If that is the case, than it obviously doesn\u0027t travel further. In the rest of the cases (20%) the particle won\u0027t interact with the wall but propagate throug the slit. Since it hasn\u0027t interacted with the wall, it still resembles a wave originating at the canon, and an interference pattern will form. The Amplitudes of the interference pattern at the back wall now determines the propability were the particle will interact with the wall. If you repeat the experiment with many particles, the pattern becomes visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you place a detector at the slits, you force the particle to interact with the detector.
