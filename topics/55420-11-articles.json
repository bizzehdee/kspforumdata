This time I put on the RCS and it was able to stabalize pointing away from Kerbin. Odd thing, I made one orbit and it always pointed away from kerbin (by away I mean up). I was able te deorbit by rcs\u0027ing to the side. with timewarp I lost the bottom half in a major explosion. I only had the capsual, parachute, heat shield and a decoupler left. The decoupler was stuck and wouldnt come off. When I tried to decouple the heat shield it also stuck. I couldnt stage to my parachute so I had to arm it manually. Eventually I splashed down and Jeb survived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole time I was getting about 5 to 10 fps.
