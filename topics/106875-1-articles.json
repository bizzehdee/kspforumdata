Cool. But how does it work?

Red lines are drag, blue is lift from lift surfaces and yellow (iirc) are aerodynamic control forces. The length of the lines is proportional to the strength of the respective force."},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:07:41Z","Content":"Nice!
