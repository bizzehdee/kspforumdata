I place a small rocket within a Mk2 spaceplane cargo hold. The rocket is attached to either the front or back of said hold using an in-line decoupler. When I fire of the decoupler, the rocket simple shifts to the back end (or front end if the decoupler was placed in the rear) and promptly gets stuck there. Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a good fix for it?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T02:40:58Z","Content":"Use docking ports instead of a decoupler. What\u0027s happening is the decoupler has a force to push things apart and this is what\u0027s making the payload shoot down the cargo bay. Docking ports have the added advantage that you can pick stuff up instead of just launching stuff (provided what you pick up also has a docking port)."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T05:24:44Z","Content":"Alternatively, tweak the decoupler force.\n\nI general, docking ports are better for cargo bays, you can bring stuff back with them."},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T07:33:07Z","Content":"Have you considered attaching the cargo to the \u0022floor\u0022 of the cargo bay?
