The page object takes care of instantiating it, attaching it to an internal prop, sending it globalButton presses \u003Cem\u003E(as numbers which the handler compares to it\u0027s configuration options)\u003C/em\u003E and calling upon it to return text and graphics. I.e. the handler\u0027s button receiver function actually gets a number that it compares to the number that was configured when it was instantiated. It knows nothing of the globalButton list, the number you give in the *HANDLER{} block is what it will compare the number it receives to when a globalButton gets pressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as the \u0027multiHandler\u0027 option is not involved, every time a handler block is defined, a completely separate copy of the handler module is created. \u003Cem\u003E(I.e. JSITargetMenu has options for \u0027buttonHome\u0027, etc, but these are numbers which can be completely different for different copies of JSITargetMenu)\u003C/em\u003E The handler itself doesn\u0027t even know what called it or why, and can\u0027t actually know. \u003Cem\u003E(There\u0027s a very good reason for this: This way, you can write a plugin for RPM without a hard link dependency on RPM DLL, i.e. as part of some completely different mod that only optionally provides RPM with text or graphics when RPM is configured to ask for them. As long as you provide methods with appropriate signatures and provide a module RPM can load and attach to a prop, it makes no difference to RPM what you call it and what else is that module is doing.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only thing you have to worry about is whether the button configuration options of the handler actually match globalButtons that particular page you\u0027re defining it on will accept and mean what you want -- as well as trying not to create too many copies of the handler. (In particular, I recommend avoiding using more than one instance of the PFD, because it creates free-floating objects -- the less of them you have the better.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
