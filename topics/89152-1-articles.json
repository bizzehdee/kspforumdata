The engines won\u0027t ignite until about ten seconds after I activate them (Yes there is fuel and electricity). Then when I activate SAS, it tries to send my rocket or spaceplane into a roll. After it inevitably crashes, it won\u0027t give me the option to revert flight. The options to revert flight and the option to return to the VAB/SPH are completely omitted. On top of that, the little staging sequence icons on the left of the screen are gone as well. This makes it difficult to fly a rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELog: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/m7hbphka3bn9ocl/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/m7hbphka3bn9ocl/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T22:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you maybe need to make a clean install and install the latest B9?
