Now, my laptop may not have the newest technology, but it should absolutely be able to run KSP, and had done so just fine in the past. For 40 hours! And out of nowhere the game suddenly crashes as soon as it tries to load, which makes me very sad. I\u0027ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, going through the files, searching up possible solutions, but nothing seems to help me. A possible outcome that my friend and I came to was that my laptop is shutting down to prevent it from reaching deadly temperatures, but I will look more into that later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also observed Task Manager, and noticed that the application did not ever max out my CPU or RAM, so I am absolutely stumped. And it can run KSP2 fine as well which should obviously crash my laptop if KSP1 does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are my laptop\u0027s components in case it is a hardware issue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nProcessor\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz \u00A0 2.81 GHz\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstalled RAM\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A032.0 GB (31.9 GB usable)\u003Cbr\u003E\nProduct ID\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A000325-96229-38653-AAOEM\u003Cbr\u003E\nSystem type\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A064-bit operating system, x64-based processor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-15T23:17:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2024 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 15\u0022\u003EJanuary 15\u003C/time\u003E by TheSandboxMaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate on the Solution\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSandboxMaster","CreatedById":231569,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-08T08:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: I performed a test and heating doesn\u0027t seem to be the issue either.
