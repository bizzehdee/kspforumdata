That\u0027s especially a problem as the number of different experiments is limited to the number of parts capable of doing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I am suggesting is adding something like \u0022Science Material\u0022 as a resource, with one unit of it standing for one never-done-before experiment (which you get full points for), and one new (maybe 2m diameter) science laboratory which needs to be manned and in orbit to do experiments. That lab might be part of a space station, and when all the material is used no experiments could be done until new material is brought up to the station and transferred to the lab via docking ports. Of course science material should be quite heavy per unit and the experiments should only give you few points, so this method of gaining science points won\u0027t be overpowered, but it would give you the possibility of gaining constant science points (since every experiment counts with full points) if you have a station and regularly bring material up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdosogne","CreatedById":68302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T02:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn another thread, I suggested that some return samples should be fragile; i.e. excessive Gs would ruin the sample.
