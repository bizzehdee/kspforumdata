(And hell, I really loved that series by Hawking, \u003Cstrong\u003Eespecially\u003C/strong\u003E the creation of the universe part. Such an elegant, simple answer to why the universe can be created from naught. Math is quite incredible.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding memory consumption, that isn\u0027t the limiting factor on performance. The limiting factor is the fastest single CPU core available. KSP is single-threaded, and 32-bit. The most RAM is eaten-up on loading, when it reads part files from the HD and allocates all that data to memory, but if you have enough RAM to load KSP, it\u0027s safe to say you have enough to run it. The upper limit on this is a bit over 3GB, because of the limitations of 32-bit memory addresses. Doesn\u0027t matter if you have a 64-bit processor and OS, the program is 32-bit, thus the memory limit. Since it\u0027s single threaded, only one CPU core can be used at any one time, meaning that there is no benefit from having two, four, or eight cores: KSP\u0027s performance is limited to how fast one core can execute all of the calculations, in sequence. There are good development reasons to avoid the pain of multi-threading, not the least of which is that it\u0027s incredibly complicated to write multi-threaded software, and Squad isn\u0027t a huge company that can just toss a whole team of programmers at the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in short: If you want more performance from KSP, a CPU upgrade is in order. Increases in clock speed are better than increases in number of cores. Overclocking the CPU would also help, though it\u0027s a bad idea to do that if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing. (Ideally to run KSP, you\u0027d get the highest-clocked processor you can find, with two cores so that KSP can easily monopolize one core without freezing the system, and then liquid-cooling it so that it can be OC\u0027d to absurdity.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027ve straightened that out, here\u0027s what I suggest to improve performance of the ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Don\u0027t even try to get it off the launch pad. Just skip launching it. \u0022Construct\u0022 it in orbit. When docking is completed you might be able to do this in a non-haxxy way, but for the time being, either hack the thing into the persistence file by launching a smaller ship that\u0027ll launch without issue into orbit and then replacing that ship\u0027s data in the persistence file with the data from your project ship. That, or use the Orbital Construction mod if you feel that\u0027s \u0022cheating\u0022. (Though it\u0027s extremely unlikely that we\u0027d ever launch something so massive from the ground in the first place, so claims that hacking the persistence file in such a way is \u0022unrealistic\u0022 is just silly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Reduce the number of parts required by creating new parts, and/or using parts that already fill this role. Gaby\u0027s payloads mod has a huuuuuge fuel tank that is just one part, but the equivalent of a lot of NP tanks \u002B struts. So it\u0027s the stupid number of tanks, without the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Straight-up cfg edit things to your will (edit: even more than you\u0027ve already done). Make the tanks hold lotsa fuel, or more realistically, make the engines have very, very high vac Isp. (Any such ship would need to have such engines.) Some judicious edits to those files would let you keep the look of the thing, without needing to go overboard with parts. Setting a parts-budget goal of around 200 would be a good target if you want to share it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-YLLogicaL-","CreatedById":51617,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T04:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETips taken.
