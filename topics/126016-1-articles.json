To increase the drag, they either need the canopies remade to sane size, or drag modifiers. The Mk2 radial has the largest drag modifiers because it has the tiniest canopy, far too tiny for the drag it needs to be producing.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fwiffo","CreatedById":148084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:31:13Z","Content":"\nAh, THANKS!
