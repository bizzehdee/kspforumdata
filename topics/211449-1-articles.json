This has happened to me often, especially if the occlusion modifiers in the difficulty settings of the save don\u0027t allow for much leeway. My workaround to this was to take a much steeper but less efficient ascent that reaches a higher altitude (100km is good). This allows your probe to view more of Kerbin\u0027s surface at once while remaining relatively close horizontally to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E - though your mileage may vary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
