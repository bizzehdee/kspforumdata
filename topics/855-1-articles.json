The failure they had on June\u0027s test flight is something that can be solved; NASA has had lots of parachute failures in various tests before getting the design right, and they even had one parachute on Apollo 15 \u0027streamer.\u0027 (Which, of course, is why Apollo used three chutes when two would have sufficed--just in case.) I hope they keep at it, because this is the sort of \u0027shadetree mechanic\u0027 enthusiast work that leads to unconventional solutions that end up becoming industry standards because they work better and/or cost less.
