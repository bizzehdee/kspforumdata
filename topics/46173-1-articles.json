I know I could use something much smaller for first flights to planets, but I like to do complex missions for exploration (a bit of realism), where I complete several objectives at once. My first Duna flight had several firsts for me all in one mission that I flew with the predecessor of the currently planned ship carrying 2 heavy landers and 2 satellites (I\u0027ll post a mission report on that one when I have the time):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First interplanetary travel (with all its mistakes and bad piloting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First landing on Duna and first landing on Ike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First satellites installed into Duna and Ike orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater on I will try boosters for interplanetary stages - if I use docking ports the ship can even be refitted and thus reusable.
