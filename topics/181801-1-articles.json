To achieve this you want to minimize drag. Best ways to avoid drag is using only cockpit, fuel fuselages, intakes, engines, wings and landing gear that are to be exposed to air. That means all the other parts are best to be tugged into cargo bays.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(A)\u003C/strong\u003E In your case I would put a deployable solar panel inside a cargo bay. Why all the parachutes? You want to go to Duna? They won\u0027t be needed on Kerbin and it doesn\u0027t seem capable of reaching Duna. I never use parachutes because you can land planes safely at 50-60 m/s and Maximum wheel brakes (set to 200 in the editor) should stop most craft. If it isn\u0027t capable of stopping using wheel brakes you can use add friction to the wheels, always make sure the friction settings are a little higher on the rear wheels. Assuming your front wheel is for steering its friction should be lowest so it doesn\u0027t steer across the surface like a crazy animal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(B) \u003C/strong\u003ESince your capable of breaking using wheels I also see no reason for airbrakes. Are they needed in your design case? I use to pitch over and pull up violently to arrest speed close to the runway. I assume you use airbrakes for the final descent? I would discard them unless you find it is cool.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother way to minimize drag is to minimize the frontal cross section. If the spaceplane travels through the center of the prograde reticle the cross section is lowest as the fuselage will be dead center in the direction of travel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis never happens if the wing chord line is perfectly horizontal parallel to the fuselage. This is how most people attach their wings, which is straight on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuckily you can put the wings on a incline (Wing incidence) so that the spaceplane can stay in level flight or even climb while staying on prograde to minimize all excess body drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis in turn means less required engine to go through the sound barrrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(C)\u003C/strong\u003E Additionally always try to configure wing incline on the fwt and aft wings/control surfaces so that it stays level flight without key controls. If the incline fwt \u0026lt;\u0026gt; aft is mismatched the spaceplane will either tip over or pull up natively, this means any of the available control surfaces has to be extended which causes additional drag if this balance is mismatched.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis balance is further affected as you burn fuel and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts. I try to build my spaceplanes so wet and empty mass is at the same place. IME you have to be experienced to know where and how to organize your engine mass and fuel mass in relation to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe general rule to further reduce body drag is that if you need more then one engine at the end of a 1.25m stack is that you\u0027d better use a adapter like a bi-coupler rather then bolting 2 new stacks on the sides as the added cross section of a added stack will be greater then the extended surface of i.e. any engine adapter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor that reason I would discard the MK0 liquid fuel tanks and use the larger 400LF MK1 size at the front or back at any of the available 1.25m stacks. Alternatively you can use the BiG-S strake that holds 100 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E. It also has the lightest dead mass in relation to it\u0027s wing lift so it\u0027s the best wing piece out there to be used if you want the maximum wing lift for the least amount of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(D) \u003C/strong\u003EMK 1 fuselages are the least draggy on the frontal cross section. MK2 may look prettier but it is draggier. Because it is draggier you are normally required to move your main wings further to the back to compensate for this in order to achieve a controlled re-entry. Using MK1 your are less draggier and you generally have your wings moved more to the front as you wont have to deal with the drag of a Mk 2 cockpit fuselage on the front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(E) \u003C/strong\u003EWhy two Mk2 drone core? isn\u0027t 1 sufficient?

Isn\u0027t 1 enough? In a spaceplane you are constantly under aerodynamic stress. This stress is so great that the reaction wheel torque is completely futile. It would fly as good as it would without any of them. Furthermore, according to the size of your spaceplane 1 reaction wheel is enough to tumble freely in space, so why even 2, let alone 4?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only reason I can see is if you have problem during landing or takeoff. During landing and takeoff the airspeed is very low so then the reaction wheels will start to have effect. As you increase speed the torque generated by control surfaces will become greater. For this reason a aircraft becomes more maneuverable as it increases in speed which is why you are capable of controlling your vessel using your control surface only past a certain speed while it wouldn\u0027t be able to takeoff or land if it hadn\u0027t the available reaction wheel torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(G) \u003C/strong\u003EI would always go rapier unless you have very draggy cargo that is enormously large. In such a case it might be difficult to breach the sound barrier. Whiplashes have more thrust at transonic speeds so using them will get you past 400m/s. Usually a combination of whiplashes and rapiers is used. (1) so that you have closed cycle mode on the rapiers so that you wont need additional engines, another tip is to amount only the least amount of whiplashes in relation to rapiers to achieve the maximum air breathing speed. Another reason might be to use whiplashes if your aircraft cant take off past the runway. But IMO that is a design mistake as any sized spaceplane should be able to lift off the runway using any engine layout by properly placing landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. : 1 rapier per 20 Ton is to be expected at the top of the table. Most people struggle doing 10-15 Ton as it is crucial to learn how to reduce drag. I expect 25Ton is the utmost using a proper balance of all the drag inducing parts and a proper climb\u0026lt;\u0026gt;dive\u0026lt;\u0026gt;climb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-29T17:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223530932\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221548781733\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aeroboi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Aeroboi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general rule to further reduce body drag is that if you need more then one engine at the end of a 1.25m stack is that you\u0027d better use a adapter like a bi-coupler rather then bolting 2 new stacks on the sides as the added cross section of a added stack will be greater then the extended surface of i.e. any engine adapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting general question - if you need exactly two\u00A0engines, are you better off drag-wise with a Mk 2 fuselage and Mk 2 bicoupler, or a 1.25m fuselage and bicoupler?\u00A0 I tend to avoid the latter like the plague, but not sure if the data backs me up on this.\u00A0 Of course, even if drag is a wash, there are advantages to Mk 2 -- they generate some lift, have better passenger capacity, cargo bays can hold a 1.25m stack, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT - did a very quick and dirty altitude test to compare.\u00A0 Difficult because Mk 2 lift makes it hard to keep rocket pointing straight up.\u00A0 Results were very close - with the same mass and thrust, the Mk 2 stack got to 2412 meters, whereas the 1.25m\u00A0\u00A0bicoupler stack got to 2,360 meters.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-29T18:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2019 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-29T18:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

To achieve this you want to minimize drag. Best ways to avoid drag is using only cockpit, fuel fuselages, intakes, engines, wings and landing gear that are to be exposed to air. That means all the other parts are best to be tugged into cargo bays.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(A)\u003C/strong\u003E In your case I would put a deployable solar panel inside a cargo bay. Why all the parachutes? You want to go to Duna? They won\u0027t be needed on Kerbin and it doesn\u0027t seem capable of reaching Duna. I never use parachutes because you can land planes safely at 50-60 m/s and Maximum wheel brakes (set to 200 in the editor) should stop most craft. If it isn\u0027t capable of stopping using wheel brakes you can use add friction to the wheels, always make sure the friction settings are a little higher on the rear wheels. Assuming your front wheel is for steering its friction should be lowest so it doesn\u0027t steer across the surface like a crazy animal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(B) \u003C/strong\u003ESince your capable of breaking using wheels I also see no reason for airbrakes. Are they needed in your design case? I use to pitch over and pull up violently to arrest speed close to the runway. I assume you use airbrakes for the final descent? I would discard them unless you find it is cool.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother way to minimize drag is to minimize the frontal cross section. If the spaceplane travels through the center of the prograde reticle the cross section is lowest as the fuselage will be dead center in the direction of travel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis never happens if the wing chord line is perfectly horizontal parallel to the fuselage. This is how most people attach their wings, which is straight on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuckily you can put the wings on a incline (Wing incidence) so that the spaceplane can stay in level flight or even climb while staying on prograde to minimize all excess body drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis in turn means less required engine to go through the sound barrrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(C)\u003C/strong\u003E Additionally always try to configure wing incline on the fwt and aft wings/control surfaces so that it stays level flight without key controls. If the incline fwt \u0026lt;\u0026gt; aft is mismatched the spaceplane will either tip over or pull up natively, this means any of the available control surfaces has to be extended which causes additional drag if this balance is mismatched.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis balance is further affected as you burn fuel and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts. I try to build my spaceplanes so wet and empty mass is at the same place. IME you have to be experienced to know where and how to organize your engine mass and fuel mass in relation to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe general rule to further reduce body drag is that if you need more then one engine at the end of a 1.25m stack is that you\u0027d better use a adapter like a bi-coupler rather then bolting 2 new stacks on the sides as the added cross section of a added stack will be greater then the extended surface of i.e. any engine adapter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor that reason I would discard the MK0 liquid fuel tanks and use the larger 400LF MK1 size at the front or back at any of the available 1.25m stacks. Alternatively you can use the BiG-S strake that holds 100 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E. It also has the lightest dead mass in relation to it\u0027s wing lift so it\u0027s the best wing piece out there to be used if you want the maximum wing lift for the least amount of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(D) \u003C/strong\u003EMK 1 fuselages are the least draggy on the frontal cross section. MK2 may look prettier but it is draggier. Because it is draggier you are normally required to move your main wings further to the back to compensate for this in order to achieve a controlled re-entry. Using MK1 your are less draggier and you generally have your wings moved more to the front as you wont have to deal with the drag of a Mk 2 cockpit fuselage on the front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(E) \u003C/strong\u003EWhy two Mk2 drone core? isn\u0027t 1 sufficient?

Isn\u0027t 1 enough? In a spaceplane you are constantly under aerodynamic stress. This stress is so great that the reaction wheel torque is completely futile. It would fly as good as it would without any of them. Furthermore, according to the size of your spaceplane 1 reaction wheel is enough to tumble freely in space, so why even 2, let alone 4?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only reason I can see is if you have problem during landing or takeoff. During landing and takeoff the airspeed is very low so then the reaction wheels will start to have effect. As you increase speed the torque generated by control surfaces will become greater. For this reason a aircraft becomes more maneuverable as it increases in speed which is why you are capable of controlling your vessel using your control surface only past a certain speed while it wouldn\u0027t be able to takeoff or land if it hadn\u0027t the available reaction wheel torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(G) \u003C/strong\u003EI would always go rapier unless you have very draggy cargo that is enormously large. In such a case it might be difficult to breach the sound barrier. Whiplashes have more thrust at transonic speeds so using them will get you past 400m/s. Usually a combination of whiplashes and rapiers is used. (1) so that you have closed cycle mode on the rapiers so that you wont need additional engines, another tip is to amount only the least amount of whiplashes in relation to rapiers to achieve the maximum air breathing speed. Another reason might be to use whiplashes if your aircraft cant take off past the runway. But IMO that is a design mistake as any sized spaceplane should be able to lift off the runway using any engine layout by properly placing landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. : 1 rapier per 20 Ton is to be expected at the top of the table. Most people struggle doing 10-15 Ton as it is crucial to learn how to reduce drag.

Still, about the only thing that I said that wouldn\u0027t necessarily be applicable was my advice\u00A0with the wings. Even in stock, 1500 m/s is still a good rocket delta-V target for a well-built spaceplane, assume your plane\u0027s takeoff mass is going be your payload mass divided by 0.15,\u00A0use a 1.6 wet-to-dry mass ratio for that theoretical mass when guessing how much fuel you\u0027re going to need, and have it about 45% ox, 55% liquid fuel. And then go with however many engines for that theoretical takeoff mass that you\u0027ll think you\u0027ll need. Include one airbrake per engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, let\u0027s say you build your payload and it comes out at 4.5 tonnes (not unreasonable). You divide that by 0.15; your theoretical takeoff mass is 30 tonnes. Twenty tonnes per RAPIER\u00A0has been suggested; you\u0027ve got thirty tonnes, so use two RAPIERS. You still assume the 1.6 ratio for forty tonnes since you\u0027re using two engines - that comes out to 25 tonnes of fuel, of which 11.25 tonnes will be oxidizer and 13.75 tonnes will be liquid fuel. At 200 units per tonne, that comes out to 2250 oxidizer and 2750 liquid fuel. Two engines, so two airbrakes. Already sets a lot of the parameters you\u0027re going to want for your final design right there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Yes, I know that those figures are going to shoot over thirty tonnes - the \u0022theoretical mass\u0022 is really little more than a back of the envelope estimate, but my experience shows it to be a good one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-29T22:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2019 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-29T23:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223530948\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221548784030\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegolius13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Aegolius13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting general question - if you need exactly two\u00A0engines, are you better off drag-wise with a Mk 2 fuselage and Mk 2 bicoupler, or a 1.25m fuselage and bicoupler?\u00A0 I tend to avoid the latter like the plague, but not sure if the data backs me up on this.\u00A0 Of course, even if drag is a wash, there are advantages to Mk 2 -- they generate some lift, have better passenger capacity, cargo bays can hold a 1.25m stack, etc.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would take the 1.25m fuselage and bicoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPassive stability requires low drag in the front, and high drag in the back -- and that\u0027s exactly what this pattern gives you.
