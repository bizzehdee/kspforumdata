It requires no soil and little water (very weight-efficient) and results in plants growing much faster than they normally do, additionally letting the grower fit more plants into the same space (since there is no soil, plants do not compete with each other for nutrients). In result this method achieves yields/sq m/year that are about 10 times that of a regular greenhouse and 60 times that of conventional agriculture. Obviously it has its drawbacks, which inhibit its application on Earth, namely the installation cost, relatively large energy consumption, the need for an almost sterile environment, and its dependence on technology for plant survival (they are basically on constant life support and die in case of equipment failure). Luckily, these are mostly irrelevant in space: cost and energy consumption are large relative to that of traditional agriculture but are still miniscule in comparison to the price tag and energy needs of a spacecraft, while dependence on technology for survival and near-sterile environment are already the default situation for any spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system above is obviously just a small-scale prototype. On a large scale the interior would look more like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jGb7qV8.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022jGb7qV8.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept in space it would probably be even more crowded, given how priceless every inch of ventilated space is out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s compare:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypical KSP greenhouse:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- glass windows \u002B shutters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rigid construction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- one layer of vegetation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- traditional greenhouse or at most a hydroponic (no soil but uses plenty of water) system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually plausible space greenhouse:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- no windows (they result in more additional weight than it is worth)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- inflatable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- multiple layers of vegetation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- aeroponic system (more lightweight, uses much less resources, faster plant growth)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously Porkjet\u0027s models are much closer to what a plausible space greenhouse would look like than the greenhouses that other mods provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s time for the PA550 - specific calculations: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen fully inflated, the inflatable part of the PA550 model is a cylinder about 4 meters high and 5 meters wide, with a spherical cap, about 0.5m high, at each end. Assuming that one of the spherical caps houses the necessary equipment (pumps, control computers, etc.) and the other is filled with a reserve of required resources, we are left with a cylinder 4x5 cylinder of usable space. The height of 4 m is sufficient to consider it a 2-story structure, giving us usable floor space of 2*(Pi*2.5^2), that is around 38.4 sq meters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s assume that 0.4 sq meters of space is lost due to the thickness of the walls. From what I\u0027ve read it seems that the most efficient setup would be an extremely strong light source (probably LED) at the center, surrounded by shelves of plants, slowly rotated to simulate some minimal gravity. We can assume that about 4 sq meters will be needed for the light source and to leave some space around it. Plants can\u0027t grow directly on animal waste, it has to be first decomposed into nutrients by bacteria. In nature that\u0027s what the soil is for - it\u0027s the home for bacteria. In our scenario however, the food production bay would need to contain an integrated bioreactor (basically a small scale biological waste treatment plant) to do the same. Such systems are relatively heavy but compact, so 4 sq meters should be more than enough, assuming continuous operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves us with about 30 sq meters of effective floor space for actually growing plants. But how much space would be needed to provide minimal nutrition to a Kerbal? Sources are somewhat conflicting on this question, as the answer depends on an innumerable amount of assumptions, but it seems that 4 sq meters is a minimum to provide year-round subsistence to a human. That\u0027s assuming a high-efficiency aeroponics system cultivating a single plant variety, selected for its effectiveness (most likely a genetically engineered sweet potato), resulting in an extremely monotonous diet composed almost exclusively of carbohydrates (but adequate calorie-wise). Given that kerbals are significantly smaller than humans, we can assume that they would require half as much, resulting in a minimum of two sq meters per kerbal. Let\u0027s make it 2.5 sq meters per kerbal to have some safety margin. So for a 4-kerbal crew, the minimum would be 10 sq meters of aeroponic greenhouse. Proteins and fats are much more costly to produce, but given that 10 sq meters already cover the carbohydrates, I think we can safely assume that the remaining 20 sq meters of space inside PA550 would be more than enough to provide an adequate supply of proteins, fats and vitamins to our kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result: Perfectly adequate and varied diet for four kerbals, year-round, independent of the amount of sunlight received, with a side effect of recycling all of the waste, waste water and carbon dioxide produced by the crew. Should be much lighter than a \u0022typical KSP greenhouse\u0022 of comparable production capacity. The only drawback: high and continuous energy consumption (the equivalent of at least one large solar array\u0027s power production, imho).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve arrived this far, thank you for taking your time to read all this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS the adequate name for such a part would be \u0022aeroponics bay\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Itsdavyjones","CreatedById":57605,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T16:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hattivat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hattivat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esnip\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery well thought out, and i can also see it possibly being used in the centrifuge as well.

Cetrifuge could certainly be applied to the same purpose, although it\u0027s much less space-efficient. From what I\u0027ve seen the topic of how different plants react to zero-g environment is not too well-researched, but the results of these studies that were done so far were varied (some plants grew less well, while some actually grew faster without gravity), so it might very well be that some plants would require it for healthy growth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify my previous words: I\u0027m not saying that the greenhouses from Biomass and other mods are impossible or unrealistic. They are perfectly possible, and probably realistic as far as biology is concerned. The problem is that due to high mass and low efficiency they are an inferior solution from an engineering perspective, and therefore unlikely to be put into orbit by a realistic space agency. They are basically the equivalent of using a chemical rocket engine to travel to Jupiter - it does work but it\u0027s hardly optimal for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vanlock","CreatedById":549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T19:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery thorough and interesting investigation, thanks for your work ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
