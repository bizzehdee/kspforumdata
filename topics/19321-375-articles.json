I am running KSP 1.0.2 x86_64 under gentoo linux and have the current FAR installed. Currently I am flying a Mk 1 Pod in a \u0022stable\u0022 orbit with a periapsis at 22.5 and apoapsis at 25km. They go up a kilometer, then they go down one, but I don\u0027t lose any speed at all. The atmosphere is hardly slowing me down, despite the constant heating effect. Apparently, the lift is high enough to push the orbit before me up enough to keep me orbiting constantly. It\u0027s quite impossible to land a ship that way, because the parachutes come off if I return from a low Kerbin orbit and still have 2000m/s at 10km altitude.\u003Cp\u003EIs that something that happens with the new FAR, and can I work around it somehow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you have real lift, you\u0027re simply in a very low orbit as if there was no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar issue: 3 MK1 pods stacked on top of each other, during reentry they didn\u0027t slow down.
