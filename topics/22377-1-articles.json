However, I found that even though I departed Kerbin at the right time according to the information I was provided, I missed Duna by quite a wide margin on my first orbit of Kerbol. This got me to thinking that it might also be important not just to depart at the right moment but to be able to accelerate fast enough that you hit that window at the proper time as well. My interplanetary stage obviously lacked enough thrust, but I\u0027m wondering if it would be possible to calculate or adjust your departure position to account for very slow acceleration and if that\u0027s something that a layman could do without too much trouble.
