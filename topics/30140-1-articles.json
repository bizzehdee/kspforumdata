They will always reach to the ground. You need to place your ship very high up at the ramp, and I think, it\u0027s going to be adjusted the same as in the editor. In the editor, to start higher up, you drag the root part upwards and clamps adjust to that new height. So you probably need to edit the .craft file, find the root part, and increase its height.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not completely sure about this but wouldn\u0027t you edit the quicksave file, and edit the hight of the craft, then reload the quicksave, would that not put the craft in the right place?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SDIR","CreatedById":59117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou say Scott Manley launch a capsule like a space elevator right?
