I set myself a goal to design a SSTO space plane capable of carrying small payloads to LKO. I\u0027ve set some restrictions; it must use the Mk3 shuttle cockpit and Mk3 fuselages (because using parts with wonky centres of mass is fun!) and it will not use nuclear engines. After a few weeks of on-and-off tinkering and scrapping four previous prototypes, I\u0027ve finally got something that works. The Hauler Mk. 5 does get into orbit with a lot of brute force and very little gracefulness, with a mass of 50t at launch, 6 turbojets, 92(!) air intakes, 2 aerospike rockets and loads of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has all the power and fuel to get into orbit and beyond, but it\u0027s a nightmare for me to pilot. The craft is really unstable travelling at supersonic speeds at altitudes of about 25k. SAS is not reliable under those conditions; any attempts made to correct rolling ends up with the whole thing slowly resonating into catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have FAR, Chatterer, Procedural wings, Procedural fairings and the Kethane mod installed in my game. What changes should be made to this design to improve its handling at high speeds and altitude? What settings could I tweak in the FAR light Assistance to make this thing fly straight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPics here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq272/roborob112/screenshot7_zpsb4be3157.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlan view\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq272/roborob112/screenshot6_zpsa2f86f6c.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESide view\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you want to fly this nightmare:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/tzs2sxju2iu5tho/Hauler_5.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHauler 5 craft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this thing currently has way too much jet fuel and the RCS needs tweaking, but I\u0027m outta ideas when it comes to aerodynamics.

The add no significant difference in intake air since they function very poor at high altitude. One thing the do pretty nicely at altitude is add drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you could drop 2 or possibly 4 turbojets.

I didn\u0027t know that. My 3 engine planes have been a nightmare to handle when it comes to recovering from flame outs. Its because as a rule I design my fuselage and its back engine first, before working laterally. Now I know this particular rule of mine should be broken when the proper occasion requires it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
