Jeb was killed trying to land on a cliff on Kerbin. He touched down two legs of the landing vehicle, then the whole thing pivoted upside down and exploded. It seemed impossible that anyone could have possibly survived such a crash, but the astronaut center listed him as \u0022missing\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiraculously, a couple of missions later, Jeb was back! He must have survived somehow and wandered back onto the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what was missing. Why didn\u0027t I have to go mount a search and rescue mission to get him back? Earlier I had to rescue an unfortunate stranded in orbit using nothing but my rendezvous skills and the flicker of starlight. Jeb could have popped up as a career mission with no reward but his triumphant return and maybe some reputation points. Then I\u0027d have to demonstrate some pinpoint landing skill to complete it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T22:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big three automatically come back to life...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wronkiew","CreatedById":60802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T22:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m suggesting a change to that feature for career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T03:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d hate to harsh your mellow, but there actually are contracts to rescue Kerbals stranded in various places, the only ones I\u0027ve seen, however, are all in some orbit around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Jeb most likely came back because the \u0022Missing Crews Respawn\u0022 option was checked green when you made the world...
