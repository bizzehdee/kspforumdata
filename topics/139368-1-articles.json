I stopped playing for a while, but decided to pick it back up again with a new career. \u00A0Fresh start and all that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst up, trying to get around the starting part and mass limit\u00A0was a new twist for me. \u00A0And I found getting an orbit more challenging than I remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut ... I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out this whole re-entry heat and drag situation. \u00A0I realise the old way was probably too easy. \u00A0There was a time you could just throw a craft at the ground and as long as you had enough chutes, you were golden. \u00A0I stopped playing around the time when heat became more of an issue, but you could just quicksave before retro and try again if you had issues. \u00A0No biggie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow though, I cant seem to get anything down. \u00A0I start out shallow, but the extended time in the heat eventually melts my craft. \u00A0I gradually make it steeper until I can make it to the cooler air, but then I am going way to fast, and the chutes cant be deployed before hitting the ground. \u00A0I even went so far as to stage the craft to only bring the capsule down (with chutes of course) but again, no go. \u00A0I can\u0027t deploy chutes (drogue or normal) inside the atmosphere ... I just seem to be going too fast. \u00A0The result is the same ... the chutes just never become available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way I can seem to do it is to bring in a heavily fuelled craft and do a massive retro burn to try and slow down enough to deploy chutes. \u00A0But maybe I\u0027m just playing the way I used to. \u00A0So I\u0027d like to know how you would do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a stable 100km orbit, and with a basic craft (Mk1 capsule,\u00A0FL-T200\u00A0tank and an LV-T45 engine, with am Mk16 and two Mk2-R chutes), how would you approach bringing it down, assuming that you only have\u00A0the fuel to set your entry path? \u00A0As I said, in the old days, I would have just retro burned until my Pe was like 5k and just ridden it in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"egoego","CreatedById":138988,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T07:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the current physics you need a shallow reentry path\u00A0(PE above 30km or something like that) so you slow down enough while in the thin upper atmosphere before you fall down into the thick lower atmosphere.

The place where you want to be is the middle. That is indeed the reason why you set your PE to about 30 km, as you correctly stated. But making your descent too shallow is not a good idea, because your vertical speed will be low right after leaving your apoapsis, and thus you will soak heat in the upper atmosphere for a long time before getting anywhere useful. Basically, there\u0027s an optimal corrdidor where you are not too shallow, but not too steep either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the OP\u0027s case, reentering from a 100 km apoapsis is just fine.

That should never happen. Drogue chutes can safely deploy at over 500 m/s to my knowledge, and with a little risk at over 600 m/s. Even dropping straight down like a rock with no sideways motion at all should not result in your capsule being that fast at sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that still happens to you, perhaps your physics settings, or the drag settings for some of your parts, have become borked.
