For it to be a simulation you\u0027d have to decide BEFORE you launch, \u0022This launch isn\u0027t going to be real\u0022, and if you decided it was real, then you don\u0027t get to restart the mission - you have to accept failures at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve often thought that a good simulator mode would be to let you launch the craft, but in a temporary universe where the other craft don\u0027t exist and once you stop it, your craft stops existing too. So your craft is the only one in existence in its own separate persistence file in its own seperate copy of the universe (or maybe the persistence file is never saved to disk at all for it). I sometimes sort of do this now, but it involves having to go in behind the scenes and copy craft design files over between campaign directories. It would be really cool if that was the standard way the game worked - that all campaigns have a temporary \u0022simulator\u0022 universe tacked on the side of them (or maybe they all share the same one since it has no persistence anyway) that you can use if you like. Then there\u0027d be two different launch buttons - the \u0022Real\u0022 launch button and the \u0022Simulation\u0022 launch button. Only when you used the simulation button would \u0022reverting\u0022 be an option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spatula","CreatedById":75305,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T01:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah i like that way of handling it actually... though please let\u0027s not get crazy and remove quicksave or anything, hahaha\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T20:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found that whenever I\u0027m using the revert flight option my motivation is usually not \u0022I don\u0027t want to live with the failure and the death\u0022 but rather \u0022I don\u0027t want to sit here for another 5 minutes before I can relaunch. I see what I did wrong and I want to go fix it and try again now, not 5 minutes from now.\u0022 Waiting for the crash first, when you\u0027ve made it up to say 40,000 meters, can take a while.
