I tried subassemblies, I tried merging. I tried stack decoupelers, I tried redial decouplers, I tried docking ports. Nothing wants to stick. I cannot even seem to add a docking port onto a docking port in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can add a decoupeler directly onto the hanger by itself, and then stick an engine on that, and so on and so forth. But there does not appear to be any way to add pre made assemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour premade assemblies need to have a root part (the main part you attach by) that has a free node.

I would use the old subassemblies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For that, go to the big black arrow, then the green button on the bottom left. You should see a drop subassembly here to save box. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now, use the select root mode (right of the rotate mode) to rearrange the craft you want to save. Make the part you want to attach to be the root, by selecting the part next to it then the part you want to be root. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then pick up you subassembly craft by the root and drop it on the save box. Now load your main craft, select the saved subassembly, and you should be able to attach it by that root part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I had no idea about this root part thing.
