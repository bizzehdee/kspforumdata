I have equipped the telescope with a Basic Falcon 9 Replica which also has (for effects) Cryogenic Vents. The Sentinel Space Telescope is planned to be launched from 2017-2018, where it will fly by Venus to lower it\u0027s orbit, to look out towards the Earth\u0027s Orbit to find Asteroids that could hit Earth.\n\n[Download (KerbalX)](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/Sentinel)\n\n![VEcV2Dh.png](http://i.imgur.com/VEcV2Dh.png)\n\nStats: 145 parts, 2600 kg telescope, Telescope has 500 m/s of Delta-V.\n\nThanks for viewing!"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T09:17:44Z","Content":"Wow, just another reason to have the Asteroid Day mod stock..\n\nLooks amazing, IMHO.
