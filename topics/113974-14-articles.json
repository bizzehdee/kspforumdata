Now Gene made his way to the podium, moving slowly. His face was gaunt, his eyes sunken. He looked decades older. No, he looked like a corpse.

Five aircraft came into view: the dark, dagger-like shape of the \u003Cem\u003EWidowmaker\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0leading an echelon of sleek fighter aircraft. As they passed over the gathered, the \u003Cem\u003EWidowmaker \u003C/em\u003Eabruptly pulled up, shooting skyward like a rocket until it disappeared into a cloud.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the podium, Gene waited until the other aircraft had passed and disappeared over the far horizon, before he began to speak, his voice a taught thread about to break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth, and danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina jerked awake from the nightmare, a scream in her throat as her hands pawed at her neck.

Ah\u0027d never left at all. Just a face and narrative to serve someone else. By the Nine bloody Hells, Ah was so sick of it.

For a long time, he just sat there, his eyes vacantly searching the roof structures. Myriads of thoughts filed through Valentina\u0027s head, but in the end, she just pushed them away, and put a consoling hand on Chadvey\u0027s arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The young Kerb, in the photograph, in the bar,\u0022 she said softly, \u0022who is he?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey didn\u0027t move, only squeezed his eyes shut, casting down a tear the sparkled like diamond in the fading light.

He started with just Werner and Gene, his brothers Bob and Bill. They... they had this crazy idea that they could put a Kerbal into space, with a rocket bodged together from whatever they found lying by the side of the road. But no matter how hard they tried, everything was always exactly 6.4 times harder than Jeb figured it should be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But he never gave up, never would let anyone else, either. They just rebuilt and tried again. And again. He drew people to himself, beckoned them like a beacon in the darkness. They came from all over. People nobody else wanted. Ah never even knew him that well, came a bit late to the game, but...\u0022 he trailed off, once again staring a thousand meters away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared at him, his shaggy red hair dancing in the rising evening breeze. There seemed to be a few more gray strands mixed in, now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So... what happened to him?\u0022 Her voice was barely a whisper.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the sun slipped behind a bold cloud on the horizon, or perhaps not, but Chadvey\u0027s face darkened. She could see shadows there, of something long restrained, old and... dangerous. The muscles in his forearms strained against the skin, and a lesser bottle surely would have shattered in his grip, as his eyes focused to a razor\u0027s edge on it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A young... \u003Cem\u003Eentrepreneur\u003C/em\u003E, by the name of Layland Kerman,\u0022 he hissed through clenched teeth, \u0022he betrayed and murdered Jedediah.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Layland...\u0022 Valentina breathed, \u0022Layland... Heavy Industries?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye, the same. Still Layland Propellium, back then.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But, if he has done this, how does he walk free?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No proof,\u0022 Chadvey said, and spat, leaning back against a metal box, \u0022Layland found Jeb around the same time Ah did. The only person Ah\u0027ve ever known who could rival his passion. They became fast friends, and with Jeb\u0027s ingenuity and Layland\u0027s financing, we finally saw some real progress. Sent empty capsules into space and got back something that didna look like a briquette more often than not.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For a few fleeting, beautiful moments,\u0022 he laid his head back and squeezed his eyes shut, letting the wind blow hair across his face, \u0022...everything was perfect.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a few fleeting, gravid moments, the two sat there in silence as the sun finally dipped behind the jagged mountains, leaving a parting shot of brilliant ruddy colors across the sky. Valentina watched Chadvey\u0027s face, there in the dwindling light, half hidden by his ruffled hair. She could see the subtle creases in the skin where wrinkles would one day settle, yet he seemed far too young for even that. She wondered, by the evanescent twitches in his cheeks, if the demons he now wrestled had something to do with that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length, Chadvey spoke again, the light behind his eyes fading with the words, \u0022but it didna last, of course. Such things never do. Jeb\u0027s dreams were grand, but Layland\u0027s... they were grand\u003Cem\u003Eiose\u003C/em\u003E. He wanted to commercialize the effort, sell it to as many governments as could pay. Use the proceeds to expand it more and more. After pocketing a good chunk, too, naturally. He wanted to make Kerbals a spacefaring \u003Cem\u003Especies\u003C/em\u003E, was obsessed with going to Jool...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jool?\u0022 Valentina frowned, \u0022why Jool?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He never really would say. Just prattled on about \u0027power\u0027 and \u0027future.\u0027 He and Jeb eventually had a falling out over it. They parted amicably enough, with a smile and a handshake. Or so we all thought,\u0022 here, Chadvey paused to brush his hair from his face, not seeming to notice when it fell right back down, \u0022when the day came, Ah was the last one off the gantry. Triple-checked the hatch, did the final close-out. Ah knocked on the tiny window, gave Jeb a thumbs up. His smile was bigger than ever that day. It seemed invincible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis gaze reached out over the indigo waters to the east, his eyes tracking something that wasn\u0027t there, \u0022the rocket rose with a noise like thunder, arced out over the sea. Every data point was exactly on mark, every parameter dead center. The engine shut down within a tenth of a second of nominal. Then, at the very moment Jeb crossed the Kerman line into space, it exploded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey\u0027s eyes dropped to the floor again, but she didn\u0027t think he was seeing anything, anymore. He had finally reached that far away place he had been searching for.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The recovery team saw what was left of the capsule hit the water, said it must have been doing over a hundred. We never could recover it. We found just enough to be... sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb was brilliant in many ways, but he didna know a damn thing about the law,\u0022 and now the darkness returned, turning Chadvey\u0027s face into a deeper shadow among shadows as the last of the evening light faded, \u0022within a month, Layland owned the junkyard lock, stock, and rusty barrel, along with the rights to every scrap of paper and cocktail napkin Jeb had ever so much as scribbled upon. He pillaged what he could, bulldozed the rest, and sold the junk for scrap before slinking off back to Exast. But even that wasn\u0027t enough, oh no. He wanted to send a message, a \u0027good-faith\u0027 offerin\u0027, he called it. He had the entire site excavated down thirty meters, dumped the fill into the sea, then let any company who\u0027d pay enough dump their hazardous waste in the hole. It\u0027s no wonder it\u0027s infested with those blighted... \u003Cem\u003Ethings\u003C/em\u003E, now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey Kerman was possessed of a deep, fearless voice that always spoke proudly and without hesitation. But now, as the shadows gathered close around him and the past whispered its neglected lament, even that began to whither.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022After that, it didna take long. Our close-knit group tore its self apart, just like he wanted. \u0027Its \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fault, no it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eyours!\u003C/em\u003E You did\u003Cem\u003E this!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0No, you didn\u0027t do \u003Cem\u003Ethat!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EYou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0helped \u003Cem\u003Ehim!\u003C/em\u003E You \u003Cem\u003Ecolluded!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0No, Ah--!\u0022 his voice cracked, he stumbled, but forced himself on, \u0022Bob and Bill vowed never to speak to each other after that. Bob emigrated to Omork, eventually founded Rockomax. Bill went up north somewhere and became a banker. Werner went back to Kr\u00FCnia, tried to continue. And...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe trailed off, once more staring at nothing behind the shades of his bushy hair. Valentina watched him for a time, saw the subtle tremor in his shoulders, heard his quiet, ragged breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe laid a hand gently on his arm, \u0022and what about you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah did what Ah always do,\u0022 Chadvey\u0027s voice rasped over his trembling lip, \u0022Ah ran.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Went off and joined a militia in Cerima. Learnt Ah\u0027m no bloody good at killin\u0027 people,\u0022 he sniffed, drew an arm across his face, rambled on as if the words would hold the torrent back, \u0022only Gene stayed. He refused to let Jeb\u0027s dream die. It took him years, he once...\u0022 a weak chuckle, \u0022he once camped out on the steps of the Kleptogart capitol building for three weeks trying to get a meeting with a congresskerb. When he did, the old bodger finally agreed to fund him as long as he promised to go away and stopped stinking up the place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It took Gene a long time, but he eventually convinced Werner to come back. He gathered the best minds east of the border, but they never got much farther than very expensive model rockets. Kleptogarti industry just couldn\u0027t manufacture to the size and tolerances they needed. It wasn\u0027t just amateurs in a junkyard anymore, everybody knew the price of failure, now. Over in Omork, they had the industry, but nobody seemed to know what to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0with it, other than to give it to a young savant named Burdous and hope he was in a good mood that day.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was Gene who finally made the connection. He spent months traveling back and forth between the Beige House and Baking-ham Palace, pestering interns, beseeching aides, bribing custodians, just trying to get someone to listen. Managed to convince the Queen of Omork that she wanted a space program, and what the Queen wants, the Queen bloody well \u003Cem\u003Egets\u003C/em\u003E, and parliamentary procedure be damned! It moved quickly after that. Omorkian industry producing Kleptogarti technology, turning a worthless spit of swampland not far from the original junkyard into the world\u0027s first spaceport. And to support it all, a brand new city dedicated to the whole world, though Ah think they could have found a more creative name than just \u0027Kerbin City.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey was quiet for a while, then let out a long, labored breath, \u0022and then mah damn fool brother got involved.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Far be it from him to miss an opportunity to stick his, er, face, into other\u0027s business. The new Kerbal Space Administration had to launch due east over Gednalna. Most efficient way, besides, if they launched far enough south to avoid it, they\u0027d have rocket bits landing in Cerima, and sooner or later the Cerimans would start shooting back. So mah brother hashed out a deal to his own advantage, like he always does. But he needed a face to represent the Crown. One already known, but not for all the reasons mah \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0damn fool scheming brothers were. And of course, far away enough to be...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe leaned back again, \u0022...expendable. Ah should have stayed in that damn jail cell in Dachland. At least the food was good. But he\u0027s always known how to manipulate me. All they had to do was mention going to space...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It wasna s\u0027posed to happen like it did,\u0022 the shadows danced and swirled across his face, \u0022that should have been Edmund\u0027s flight, it was his by rights... And there wasna s\u0027posed to be an EVA, either. Ah knew it was a 50-50 chance Ah\u0027d get that far, 50-50 again that Ah\u0027d make it back at all. Ah had to see for m\u0027self, with mah own two eyes. Not just that silly little periscope. Ah knew Ah\u0027d never get another chance. So Ah popped the hatch and stuck mah head out. Almost couldn\u0027t get it closed again. They covered it up, o\u0027course, made it look like it was planned all along. Afterwords...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe evening breeze rose toward a steady wind, and Chadvey seemed to draw in upon himself, diminish, as if shrouding himself against it. Or perhaps something else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Long as Ah\u0027ve known Gene... that\u0027s the only time Ah\u0027ve ever seen him angry. Not because Ah broke procedure or embarrassed the Agency, but because Ah risked mah life. Needlessly. Ah don\u0027t think he\u0027s ever really trusted me, since.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So here\u0027s to mah damn fool brother, long-may-he-reign!\u0022 He suddenly blurted out, thrusting the bottle up into the air, \u0022everybody \u003Cem\u003Eraise\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a glass! Raise it up his royal...!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis intensity died away, and he paused there, before pouring out a libration on the roof, \u0022and here\u0027s to the lost, may they rest in peace. And now poor Dean, too. He deserved better. Knew it was coming, didna think it\u0027d happen like it did, but Ah knew something would. It\u0027ll all fall apart, now. Always does. They\u0027ve cancelled the spaceplane program, announcement\u0027ll come in a day or two. The rest of it wont last. Layland always gets his way. Just a matter of time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You can tell the others,\u0022 barely a whisper, \u0022Ah\u0027ll be gone by morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?!\u0022 Valentina cried, \u0022you\u0027re leaving? Why?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottle turned over in Chadvey\u0027s hands, starlight glinting off the dozens of facets. His face was nearly hidden by the darkness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s what Ah do. There\u0027s nothing for me here, now, if ever there was. Ah can fly but Ah\u0027m no pilot. Ah know mechanics but Ah\u0027m no engineer. Ah\u0027ve written books but Ah\u0027m no scientist. Ah\u0027m nothin\u0027. Nothin\u0027 but a...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness swirled, and he seemed to sink into it, disappear, as he closed his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...figurehead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sat there for a time, staring off into that darkness, the wind blowing her hair back from her face, before she finally spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is so.
