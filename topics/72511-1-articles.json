I\u0027m 25 years old and currently working as an engineer in oil and gas production. I played KSP a few months back and did some Mun and Minmus return missions, then sent some probes to interplanetary bodies. That was cool. However, I just discovered FAR, KIDS and DREC, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever had this much fun with a video game. Now I spend my free time researching and studying rocket designs. It\u0027s taking over my life. I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions of other plugins to try to give a more realistic simulation of rocketry. Or suggestions on tweaking these Mods. I like the stock Kerbal solar system so I\u0027d prefer not to do the complete Realism Overhaul.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, glad to part of this community.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boosterspice","CreatedById":58629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T08:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, glad to hear you\u0027ve come so far already!
