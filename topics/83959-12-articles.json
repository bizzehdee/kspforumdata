From what I\u0027ve read on the forum, they look like they\u0027re pretty straightforward compared to other things I\u0027ve already tackled. The tricky part is that the whole deployed parachute has to fit inside the box, when shrunken to a specific fraction (1% I think), so it may place a limit on how small the box can be compared to the chute itself. Also, if the chute is to swing around like the stock ones, while deployed, that animation has to be built in (which is why some mod chutes don\u0027t bounce around). So it\u0027s possible, but has design considerations to think about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, on the docking ports, I\u0027m not sure about changing the node size. It affects the VAB, but that\u0027s also one of the main influences on the joint strength. It\u0027s possible to use the \u0022wrong\u0022 size here, and it shouldn\u0027t screw up which other docking ports it can dock to, since that\u0027s controlled with a different setting.

I just peeked at SpaceY, very similar. I was thinking along the lines of a stackable sepatron (I\u0027ll get the name right, eventually) which would serve a similar purpose to putting two of the radial ones, spaced equally (for thrust balance), pointing \u0022up\u0022.
