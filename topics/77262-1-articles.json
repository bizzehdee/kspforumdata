It took me a minute to figure it out, and I\u0027ve been poking around in the craft file structure since the first week I started playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to double check, is this how you assembled your docking ports in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eplaced a tricoupler \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eadded docking ports in 3x symmetry \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eadded docking ports to those in 3x symmetry onto those \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eplaced a tricoupler onto the second set of docking ports \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is that in KSP when you\u0027re placing a part, it can only attach to one other part. In other words, adding 3 docking ports is fine \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 that\u0027s 3 ports that each attach to one part, which happens to be the same tricoupler.

It breaks down when you add the second tricoupler \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the tricoupler can only attach to one docking port, so the game picks one; the other two are only attached to the opposing docking port, not the new tricoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to make that work is to launch the station pieces as separate crafts, then dock them in orbit. You could also replace the three docking ports with a larger port.

Finally, replace the second tricoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither of these methods will let you have multiple attachment points until you redock in orbit like you\u0027d planned, but they will at least let you get it to orbit in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T05:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the piece I put up was fairly large, which is why I tried the tricoupler thing for \u0027strength\u0027.
