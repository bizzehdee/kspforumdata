This is especially important for stories that \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0use Kerbalizer or somesuch, as there may not be a clear visual way to tell characters apart. Even in mine, where different specialties wear different color uniforms and speak with different color balloons, I don\u0027t rely on that alone to differentiate for the readers. I always mention a name at an appropriate point in the dialogue, or use a \u0027portrait window\u0027 with the name labeled. And then I make sure that character is unique. The one time I realized I was not succeeding in doing that, I put a lampshade on it and Gregmore was born.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelationships--REALLY really important in any fiction. Why should a reader care deeply about characters if they don\u0027t care deeply about each other? Good writing tells readers what to pay attention to, by sharing attention unequally. Good writing tells readers what to care about, by caring unequally--the same way a photographer intentionally leaves the background of a portrait out of focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFocus time on individuals--Critical with a large cast, absolutely critical. It\u0027s the \u0027selective focus\u0027 thing all over again. Sometimes you just have to get Picard and Riker out of the way, and tell a story about someone else. Then when that someone else comes back into the mainstream he adds so much to the fabric of the main cast. An idea like this was the beginning of the Kenlie interludes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConflict--No story is complete without it. When I see a story on the Forum that isn\u0027t achieving orbital velocity, it\u0027s usually because the conflict isn\u0027t clear, or isn\u0027t believable enough that there are stakes the reader will care about. Fighting against the destruction of all Kerbin? Brain in a jar that hungers for the flesh of worlds? Now we\u0027re getting somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStructure-- Another tripping point for a lot of stories. You need a beginning, a middle, and an end. One might think the beginning\u0027s the easiest, but it\u0027s rarely any good if the author doesn\u0027t have any idea of what the end will be. The middle\u0027s tough as well, especially if there are subplots to execute and resolve in time for the big finish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChess master Rudolf Spielmann said, \u0022Play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, and the endgame like a machine.\u0022\u00A0 I think this goes for writing as well. Many might object to writing any part of the story like a \u0022machine\u0022. But I think the analogy holds, in a way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe beginning of the story \u003Cem\u003Esets expectation\u003C/em\u003E. It needs to stay familiar to the readers, and more or less gently tell them what kind of story this is going to be. So we stay with some\u00A0tried and true formulae, there\u0027s some innovation, sure, but no deep shocks before they\u0027re ready. Just like\u00A0executing a recipe \u0022from a book\u0022. Once they\u0027re hooked, play the middle of the story \u0022like a magician\u0022. \u003Cem\u003ENow \u003C/em\u003Eis the time for innovation and daring. Now\u0027s when you really show why your story is different from anything else they\u0027ve ever read before. Surprises! Tragedy! Joy! Terror! Leading to ..the end. \u0022Like a machine\u0022-- as a story winds up we \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s winding up. Listen to the last 16 bars of any symphony and tell me it doesn\u0027t sound like the last 16 bars of a symphony. We prepare\u00A0the reader for the ending. Subplots are resolved. Loose ends are tied up neatly, but not \u003Cem\u003E\u0022deus ex\u0022 \u003C/em\u003Eneatly. We lay the groundwork for a future story, sure, but make it clear that we have done everything we set out to do in this one, leaving the reader thrilled, satisfied, and wanting to read another Beginning very soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T18:32:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T02:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe talk about relationships and conflict and etc makes me wonder about my story.

I have to say that not a lot sticks to me from reading Sentinels. I get threads of conflict--kerbals versus asteroids versus Mort, for example, but what I think I\u0027m not seeing is a real arc with a beginning, middle, and end. Your Kerbals do tend to \u0022romp\u0022 (great word!), rather than\u00A0develop along with their role in the conflict. You might pick one relationship, or personal struggle for a single kerbal, and focus on that--let that one thing play out as the conflict happens. Make sure that relationship or struggle changes in some irreversible way--for better or worse--in the course of that arc.

The \u0022hook\u0022 of this story is that somebody who did not expect to be in charge is now in charge. That could work--but there are some questions you need to answer for yourself first. What will President Bill\u0027s main conflict be going forward? Is it to survive post-apocalypse (i\u0027ve been typing that word a lot lately) or to defeat whatever enemy nuked his government? Are you sure you want to make Bill a Marine general and not, say, Secretary of Billitude? Because if you want the story to be about his struggle to handle something bigger than he ever dreamed handling, that may be a better direction. I would imagine that commanding a brigade of Marines is quite good preparation for all sorts of things, especially in a story that starts with everything getting nuked. Also, how does a general officer not know there\u0027s a war on? And what is he doing on the far side of the Mun, unless there is also a brigade of Marines there?
