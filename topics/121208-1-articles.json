He will be accompanied by other parts separated as a vacuum cleaner, microphone and speakers. These parts when triggered showed an animation that also trigger another animation inside the capsule. For example, the vacuum cleaner will come out of the box and sucked the floor, after the end of the animation, another animation inside the capsule will show a recipient containing the soil. I know nothing of programming and ask for help, it can program something like this where the animation part triggers another animation of a separate part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgive me I\u0027m using google translator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Fv0Ee\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
