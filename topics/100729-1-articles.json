Mods are not central to the game for everyone, but certainly a lot of people love using them and openly talking about them with the devs, getting their opinions on what they find interesting, would be a nice thing.\n\nPersonally, I would love to hear what the devs would suggest to get rid of the crazy shaking your craft experiences should you try to lift anything with Romfarer\u0027s robotic arms, or any arm built from IR parts. I itch to create a space station built using these arms, and not have to worry about quick saving with every little move of my arm, because if not the station will be shaken to bits, and while going really slowly works, its certainly no fun.\n\nOnce again, I think if everyone goes into the discussion with the knowledge that nothing will be guaranteed added or changed to the game and only knowledge is being shared, it would be really successful and useful for mod-makers and mod-users alike."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T20:52:32Z","Content":"This isn\u0027t a bad idea, however the chance of it being done at all is small, and the chance that it would be done on the forum is smaller."},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:15:26Z","Content":"That would be nice, but knowing my luck they would ramble on about big plans for mods i have no interest in. \n\nSaying that, when i check facebook i am usually pleasantly surprised by the amount of mod spotlightage among other things that KSP post there daily."},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:50:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This isn\u0027t a bad idea, however the chance of it being done at all is small, and the chance that it would be done on the forum is smaller.\n\nDoesn\u0027t necessarily have to be on the forums.

I\u0027ll bet you the ISS experiences the same thing when the Canadarm moves, you just don\u0027t see it because it moves slower and smoother while the station compensates automatically.

Imagine those people seeing their mod held up to a more \u0022official\u0022 spotlight, and seeing the masses point out the glitches.

I\u0027m sure HarvesteR and Mu often come across potential ways of implementing fixes, improvements and new features, but don\u0027t have the time to spend putting them together only to find that they don\u0027t work. There are many more modders than developers in Squad. They can try things out and see what\u0027s feasible.\n\nSimilarly, Squad\u0027s experience with Unity would be extremely valuable not just for modders, but for the developers of other games using the Unity engine.

I don\u0027t think it realistic to expect that of Squad. \n\nI suspect the wobbling of robotics parts is due to the same bug/feature that causes attachments between low mass parts and high mass parts to misbehave in stock KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T18:07:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Hey let\u0027s adopt a standardized company Linux install.
