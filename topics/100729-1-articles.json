Mods are not central to the game for everyone, but certainly a lot of people love using them and openly talking about them with the devs, getting their opinions on what they find interesting, would be a nice thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would love to hear what the devs would suggest to get rid of the crazy shaking your craft experiences should you try to lift anything with Romfarer\u0027s robotic arms, or any arm built from IR parts.
