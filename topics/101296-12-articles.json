But for ease of ingame sizes, it\u0027s better to keep it 2.5m. It\u0027s too hard to stick 2 Kerbals into a 1.25m pod in the shape of Gemini, plus they need their helmets (for EVAs). Otherwise, the sizing doesn\u0027t bother me very much. However, if you can find a post of Beale stating that he\u0027s going to resize the Gemini like you said, I\u0027d be very curious to see. Honestly, I\u0027d rather see the Atlas here rescaled to be 1.875m."},{"CreatedByName":"SuccinctLemon","CreatedById":147644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T16:28:06Z","Content":"Cant wait to see Titan.

You\u0027d be the perfect candidate. BDB is overwhelming, and because there\u0027s just ***so much*** in it, I usually don\u0027t install it unless I want something specific out of it. I think in general, chopping BDB into more bite-size pieces would help. I\u0027d love to just be able to easily install specific sets of parts rather than the entirety.
