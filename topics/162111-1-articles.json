If you hit a limit (no wind or too much) invert the rate of change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly have weather in the local bubble, and generate new weather (if you go from space-\u0026gt;atmo) on the fly from the cloud map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere you go, a non-iterative, non chaotic, semi realistic weather in the local area that is cheap on CPU cycles. Not just static either. For people that really want gliders set a centre point for \u0060swirl\u0060 and set the wind vector to a direction based on your position relative to the centre point. The centre point could be inbetween clouds, like it is in the real world for gliders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTell people who want realistic weather to submit a pull request and their code solution can be examined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-23T15:45:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2017 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
