Does the angle of airflow relative to the front of an air intake of any kind affect its efficiency with regard to how much air it is able to capture for the engine? If so, I may angle them down a few degrees to better process air at high altitudes where there is precious little oxygen.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E2. Does having objects \u0022in front\u0022 of an air intake interfere with its air capturing capacity?

Nope, intakes behind solid structures still get air, at least as far as I\u0027m aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The thermometer part actually does this now! Slap one on critical areas like the nose. Else, there\u0027s the debug menu, but that might violate the rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Not sure.

I can\u0027t speak with a lot of authority in response to your question, but yes today I did get a glimpse of an asymmetrical flameout. I had more than one rapier mounted, but when I originally mounted them, I was not using symmetry mode. So as I edged up to a particular altitude slowly (about 10 m/s vertical speed), there suddenly wasn\u0027t enough total intake air to operate the engines. So one of the four shut down but the other 3 kept running. This was at about 26 km altitude. So in fumbling with that I eventually became quite unstable. I wonder if there is a way to tie the engines together so that if one shuts off, they all do. At least that way you could just coast until you regrouped instead of having to re do things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epffffffffffffffffffff.
