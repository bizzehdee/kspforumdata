Most of them aren\u0027t functioning properly and KSP doesn\u0027t recognize that modded parts are even there. The only ones that are working right are MechJeb 2 and SCANsat, and even SCANsat is causing the font to be pixelated or square like. The mods are put into Kerbal Space\u00A0Program\u0026gt;Gamedata. Mods downloaded include: MechJeb 2, SCANsat, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Planetary Base Systems, Near Future Solar, TweakScale, and TacLifeSupport. None of these mods work alone or\u00A0with the other mods. Please help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit\u0026gt; MechJeb and SCANsat work alone and with each other fine, I forgot to clarify that in the second to last sentence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-14T01:28:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2017 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalGamer365\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification Error\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nergal8617","CreatedById":175276,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-14T16:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to need a bit more information, what version of KSP are you using and a screenshot of your Gamedata folder at the minimum.\u00A0 Oh, and welcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-14T17:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs usual at least 95% of all mod related issues are caused by (in order of likelihood):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIncompatible or outdated mods.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIncorrect installation\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMissing or conflicting dependencies.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOnly install mods that are compatible with your current KSP version.
