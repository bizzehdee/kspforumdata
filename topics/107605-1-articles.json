Will you give me a Steam Key?\n\u003E Yes, we now offer the choice to transfer KSP purchases from before the game was available on Steam, note that this process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE. If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSPStore, but also nobody\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s forcing you to go to Steam, if you opt not to transfer, you can still download and update the game as usual. To move to Steam, log in to your KSPStore profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link. If you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see the button in your profile it means you purchased the game after it was on Steam and you are not eligible, no exceptions, please don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t insist. As you can see in our Steam store page, the release date for Steam is March 20th 2013."},{"CreatedByName":"Dessloch","CreatedById":117381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:21:59Z","Content":"Why not?
