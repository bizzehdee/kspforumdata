This game is awesome. Just played it stock and i cant get enough of it. But i got some questions that i cant answer myself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I landed on the mun with and attached rover. When i decouple the rover from the landingship i cant control the landing ship anymore because the pod is attached to the rover. Is there any solution? Like attaching 2 pods to the ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve seen a plugin some weeks ago, that gives rockets some kind of aerodynamic nose-cone. I cant find it anymore, but i would love to test this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope someone can answer this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome community btw.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T00:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely attach another small unmanned pod on to the part that detaches from the rover. Then when you detach the rover, switch between the rover and ship with [ and ]. Hope this helps.
