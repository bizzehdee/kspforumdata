Get as many cores with as much single-threaded grunt and frequency as you can realistically, so translated into actual SKU\u0027s that means Ryzen 2600/3600 and Intel Coffee Lake i5/i7 parts are probably fine.\u00A0 There\u0027s other things that will be on other cores, so \u0026gt; 4 cores won\u0027t be a bad idea so long as they have the chops to hold their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd no, the textures they\u0027re using are basically DX11 compliant and that means that normal texture loading is fine.

Seems like I wasn\u0027t wasting 200 euros more for a 20-30% single core performance advantage at the time. I have to admit however that I should have waited for rocket like. I got a 10700k and am hoping the 11700k is also 1200. Running a 3080 on it and pci 3 is no problem at all so I might consider selling my cpu and buying a rocket lake if the ipc is a good bit better. \u003Cstrong\u003ENot sure.

Intel\u0027s roadmap has slipped multiple times though, so I\u0027m not as confident that they\u0027ll pull it off. But i wish them the best, last thing we need is for AMD and Intel trade places in this race for years at a time.
