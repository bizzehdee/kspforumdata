Radial decouplers can be a bit more solid than attaching directly to the mainbody, but in this case you\u0027ll still have the same problem. Regardless of if you use a radial decoupler or not, the radial booster will only attach at one point.

Here\u0027s what I would recommend. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s too early to shoot for the Mun, but it might take some tinkering. If it\u0027s not working, consider trimming your payload if you need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my recommendations, consider the central fuel stack as the core and the radially attached pieces as the boosters (for simplicity in typing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Split your side boosters between your bottom stage and the next stage up (at your bottom most line). What I mean by that is don\u0027t connect your bottom most boosters to decouplers on the boosters up. Leave the core piece connected and disconnect the lower booster portion from the upper. Slide those boosters down and radially attach them to the bottom core section. This should create a separate bottom stack that is connected by only one coupler on the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use your active fins more sparingly. Find a good balance between what you actually need, and having too many. Having too many things for the SAS to move around can be stressful on the rocket. Maybe trade some fins out for SAS units (if you have them). You can place two SAS units on your newly available mount points on top of your lower boosters. (Probably don\u0027t need symmetry 6 for those. Place them one at a time and opposite each other.) Having them on top (near the connection point) is less bendy than fins at the bottom. If you don\u0027t have SAS units, try to see if you can get away with moving some of the fins up a little. Splitting your boosters (as per #1) will help the bending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I somewhat simulated your rocket and it seems like you would get better performance if you cut down your second to bottom stage with 3x symmetry and leave your bottom stage at 6x symmetry. The TWR seemed kinda low with 6x all that length. It does knock the delta V down a bit, but the low TWR would have spent a lot of that dV fighting gravity anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Don\u0027t be shy about using more FL-T800s in place of stacking two FL-T400s (unless you\u0027re going for looks or something else). Fewer parts and fewer joints mean less bendy-ness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my $0.02.
