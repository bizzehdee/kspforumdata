He attaches the dish directly under the rover and uses structural trusses to attach the two together and offset them. But then he is able to delete the steal trusses from between the two modules, and somehow the two modules are still attached (both highlighted green) by nothing but air. This allows him to fix the two modules together with strut connectors afterwards.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf i try this, clicking the steal trusses will take one of the modules with it? And you can\u0027t attach a green highlighted part to a red highlighted part with struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis trick really could\u0027ve helped like 100 times!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-17T10:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s not using truss parts.

But how did he remove it afterwards and have just the two modules, and still attached? And when he attached it he just offsets it and those fake trusses are like automatically lengthened?

When you enable it, you get something like 8-10 attachment points above the fairing base where you can attach parts. By default, when you enable the interstage nodes it will generate the truss structure. You can disable the truss structure and then things appear to be just floating, but still attached. Here\u0027s an example. The bottom satellite is attached directly to the fairing. The upper one is attached to an interstage node. I generally like to use the truss structure, but here I found that with those wide relay antennas it was difficult to get the probe out if I used the trusses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oJBvxHh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oJBvxHh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TylaJames","CreatedById":206720,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-17T12:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/195516-grogs/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022195516\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/195516-grogs/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Grogs\u003C/a\u003E That is awesome!
