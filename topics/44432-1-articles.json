I just thought I\u0027d share something I\u0027ve been working on lately. Using Blender, I made a model of the canceled Orion nuclear pulse rocket. I wasn\u0027t sure where to put this, but I chose here because it\u0027s not exactly KSP-related, and it\u0027s not real life either. But anyway, here are a few pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/anlw0y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022anlw0y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe starship itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/jj4lk5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jj4lk5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith pedestal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to print it out sometime but I\u0027m worried about it coming out badly. I\u0027d probably have to print out individual components and glue them together like a model rocket. Either way, tell me what you think! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T01:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is in fact a mod in KSP just about this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omicron314","CreatedById":59506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T01:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027ve looked at that.
