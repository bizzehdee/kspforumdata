As low of an orbit as possible. Plan to intercept Tylo so that your periapsis is low over the surface. This way your burn to decelerate into orbit will require less Delta V, since the orbital Velocity is higher and your operations will take place in LTO (Low Tylo Orbit). I think your problem is your method of decent. You should avoid descending straight from high altitudes, and should first transfer to an orbit that has a low Periapsis. If i read correctly, you are de-orbiting at 50 Km, then you fight the acceleration all the way to the surface. This is an extremely inefficient method of landing. You have to fight gravity and will have monumental costs in Delta V because of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should perform your de-orbit burn and landing at as low of an altitude as possible. Once you decrease your horizontal velocity you begin to \u0022drop\u0022 out of orbit. You will no longer have sufficient horizontal velocity to orbit, and therefore your altitude will begin to decrease and your vertical velocity will increase (in the downward direction). You then will spend all of your DV on staying afloat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my best strategy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Lower Periapsis to the lowest altitude so that the terrain will not interfere with your trajectory. (Your periapsis should be over your target landing site)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Time warp to near the periapsis, then depending on TWR, begin killing your horizontal velocity a distance from periapsis, anywhere between 2 minutes and 30 seconds from Pe. (maintain an attitude near the horizon, unless you need to point up to control the v-rate). You should be as close to the surface as possible while clearing the terrain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Enter vertical decent, performing a suicide burn (throttling to 100% at the last minute to decelerate to 0 m/s) or something close to one. You should spend as little time as possible counteracting the full force of gravity, especially on Tylo. Every second you are burning vertical, you expend 9.8 m/s of DV on top of your apparent acceleration upwards.

Just throw a 50 kg command chair and that, plus the (40 kg?) EVA\u0027d Kerbal means you only have to have a mass of (90 kg?) for each Kerbal. No need for a crew cabin that weighs tons. If you want a living area for your Kerbals to live in, then separately land a living quarters that stays behind on the planet\u0027s surface after the Kerbals leave. Heck you can even revisit it later if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubstituting command chairs for pressurized crew cabins, you can make some incredibly small Tylo landers. I\u0027m trying to remember the weight of my smallest one, it might have been only 10 tons. It\u0027s also possible to make some really nice and cheap Eve sea-level-to-orbit spacecraft this way. I made one that could take four Kerbals from Eve sea level to like a 500 km circular orbit, and only massed 300 tons or so. I did put a \u0022windscreen\u0022 (a 2.5m - 1.25 m adapter) over their heads to shield them from the atmosphere during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo be warned though, there is a problem though with quick-saving and quick-loading while Kerbals are in command chairs. Sometimes they get kinda screwed up, and when you try to disembark from the chair, the Kerbal can clip into the vessel and be ejected from the area at a few hundred m/s, or even cause the vessel to break up and explode. However, if you do some experimenting back at Kerbin, utilizing the save game and load game features, you can make spacecraft that are largely immune to this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and also, if the mothership that launches the lander has RCS, there\u0027s no reason to put RCS thrusters and fuel on the lander. Omitting RCS can give you a few hundred additional m/s of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-04T21:51:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T21:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy take is that you\u0027re making your lander needlessly complex. I\u0027ve done a couple of Tylo landers, they\u0027ve all been two stages, the first stage runs about 2,500 m/s, the second runs about 4,000 m/s. Don\u0027t let MechJeb handle your entire landing, you\u0027re correct, it can\u0027t. It calculates the suicide burn point based on the TWR of your first stage, which will almost always be much higher than your second stage. My Tylo landing profile has been this:\u003Cp\u003E1. Start from about 50km (although this isn\u0027t too important, my last one started from about 90km and it worked just fine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Burn the first stage to cancel almost all of the orbital velocity. This should leave you with about 300-500 m/s left in the first stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Coast down until your surface speed/vertical speed is higher than the remaining dV in the first stage. But don\u0027t get too close to the suicide burn time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Burn the remaining fuel in your first stage retrograde to cancel some of your velocity, then jettison the first stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Land your lander like any other moon landing, either manually or just click \u0022Land Somewhere\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do it right, you should have between 2800 and 3000 m/s left in your second stage, which is plenty enough to get you back into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this method to be very useful, it worked for me to do it this way on my first try. I did simplify my lander to make it only 3 stages (1 for landing, 2 for ascent - mostly because I want my final vessel to be as small as possible once back in orbit). I started with 6448 m/s DV at 50km altitude, used roughly 3200 \u002B/- 50m/s to land and it only took about 2600 gain a 50km orbit again. So I can refine the design some more to trim off the excess DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was definitely doing my descent burns wrong before. I don\u0027t think I understood the suicide burn part correctly, I would just burn retrograde all the way down adjusting my throttle here and there until I landed. After this discussion and all the mentions of \u0022suicide burn\u0022 I took notice of the \u0022suicide burn distance\u0022 and \u0022suicide burn DV\u0022 values displayed in my KER vessel window. I think I understand this to mean that the distance ticks on down close to 0 at which point I would need to use the DV amount to stop in time without crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I tried the method TheSaint mentioned, I killed my orbital speed down to about 150m/s at which point I noticed that my suicide burn was about 100m/s more than the remaining DV in my landing stage. I coasted until the suicide distance ticked down to about 100-200m and then burned full throttle, ditching the landing stage* and using about 100 or so m/s DV of my ascent stage to finish the landing (I turned on MechJeb for the final bit). This seemed to work well enough that I am probably almost ready to design the transfer stage and Kerbin launcher for this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for the advice and assistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: When I say ditching the landing stage, I only mean the tanks and engines that helped me land, I\u0027m not quite dumb enough to get rid of my landing gear before landing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-04T21:51:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T03:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to finish my mission, you guys rock!

I had used one of my larger tugs as a transfer stage with the plan that I would refuel it at my Jool fuel station if necessary.

As you can see from the second image, I just BARELY made it to the fuel station with about 62 liquid fuel remaining from tanks that once held over 14,000 liquid fuel.
