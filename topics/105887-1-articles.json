(tongue in cheek, this is supposed to be funny - purely my own opinions, or cherry-picked out of the community. Really, this is a gag post, chllax)\n\nOn Aerodynamics:\n\nBeta - I like soupodynamics, nice and predictable.\n\n1.0 - EVERYTHING I KNOW IS WRONG\n\nOn Re-entry\n\nBeta - Porcupine landers straight from Minmus = no problem\n\n1.0 - WHY IS MY POD FACING DOWN? CHUTES AREN\u0027T ABLATIVE!\n\nOn typical Career progression strategies\n\nBeta - first we do this, then this, then unlock this, and upgrade this and bam, you can do a profitable Mun trip only four flights in.\n\n1.0 - I am going to murder whoever redid the gorram tech tree.\n\nOn Planes\n\nBeta - I keep hearing about those poor sods with FAR ripping planes apart, sucks to be them.\n\n1.0 - IT SUCKS TO BE ME\n\nOn Ascent profiles into LKO\n\nBeta - 10km straight up, turn 45-degrees to the east, maintain that heading more or less until your Ap is out of atmo, done. So easy my kid can do it.\n\n1.0 - Great, spun out \\*again\\*.\n\nOn Contracts\n\nBeta - we need more mods that add contracts.\n\n1.0 - Wow, they actually listened to us? Automatic world-record completions, woot!\n\nOn the Demo version\n\n0.18.3 - jeeze, this version is old, but hey, Mun landings are simple.\n\n1.0 - Why aren\u0027t there any gimbaled engines...? Or articulating fins...? SPAM REACTION WHEELS EVERYWHERE\n\nOn female Kerbals \n\nBeta - I hear this is supposed to be a thing soon.\n\n1.0 - Haven\u0027t seen Jeb around lately, seems that he\u0027s been replaced by the new hotshot pilot...\n\nOn mods\n\nBeta - Finally got my list of desired mods all sorted out and everything.

Even small rockets wobbles now.\n\nThe recent SAS-versions always had a tendency to either understeer and getting thrown off by the slightest imbalance, or to completely overdo the whole thing and work towards the deathwobble. However nobody wants to listen to me so there we are. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nRockets feel a bit more wobbly, independent of aero (used far for a long time), so I assume the connectors got weakened from the post-buff superstable rockets of earlier versions. At least this time the physic bugs seem to be ironed out. It\u0027s fixable by adjusting design, reactionwheels and most importantly lowering/deactivating engine gimbal, tho.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T07:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**\n  \ncruel grammatics"},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T07:48:54Z","Content":"Haha this is actually quite fun to read^^\n\nHow about this:\n\nBeta - I know my Engines, I love my KR2-L\n\n1.0 - What?
