The second is on my later 2011 iMac high spec (like the OPs) running KSP on the last version of Mavericks. This second install was previously running Yosemite, which I later reverted - hence my position regarding instability of 10.10 on a specific Mac platform rather than it being a KSP issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seanth","CreatedById":79989,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T17:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wallygator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wallygator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo be clear, I\u0027m of the opinion that the issue between KSP and Yosemite \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eon my machine\u003C/span\u003E is on the Yosemite side.

High CPU (Kernel Task at 350-400%). It\u0027s a late 2013 27\u0022 iMac with the Nvidia GTX 780M video card, the 3.4 Ghz i5 and 16 GB RAM. It seemed to be KSP that tipped it over but then it would reboot still in trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have uninstalled Google Soundflower, a screen capture sound add-in and that seems (for now !) to have stabilized it significantly. No crashes for nearly a week nd it was daily before that, with multiple OS reloads. So just in case you have a program that adds a third party .kext file (Kernel Extension) to start up it can be the cause of a lot of problems. KSP and Unity don\u0027t seem to have kexts, so as I seem to have found, check for any third party (non-Apple, non-NVidia if you have an Nvidia card) and try uninstalling that app/program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust FYI and YMMV, but it saved my KSP experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
