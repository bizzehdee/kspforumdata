I\u0027ll send a rocket to the pad from either the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E menus, and it\u0027ll spend nearly 15 seconds frozen, run for less than a second, then freeze for another 15ish seconds. It took me nearly 10 minutes to go through 30 seconds of game time, and it never once showed the yellow time clock for \u0022sim speed\u0022. Always the \u0022real time\u0022 green color.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue has not happened on previous launches, and only triggers above a certain part count on a vessel that I\u0027m still trying to nail down, but is probably around the 80 part area. I\u0027ve tried multiple different rockets, but the only commonality seems to be that the vessel in question has inventory space on it that has cargo loaded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat files and/or info do you need from me to help figure this out? I\u0027d really like to fix this issue so I can continue with the save...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
