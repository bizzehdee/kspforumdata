With those issues in mind, i created a smaller than usual cargo-plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first i tested to see that does the Stock craft still work, after this test tough, i noticed that........wait a second, the space-plane hangar floor isn\u0027t weird anymore, wings aren\u0027t falling off and the medium gear wasn\u0027t spazzing out. I went to the main menu and noticed that it was a new build of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the game got updated and the new version has fixed the bigger bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft is quite the beast indeed. It\u0027s not as big as most of my designs but is big enough to full-fill pretty much any role ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerformance wise it does really well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTop Speed: 280 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCruising speed (2/3 thrust): 200 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinimum takeoff speed: 45 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStall speed: 50 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLength: 39.1m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWingspan: 38.1m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeight: 10.4m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass: 69,9 tons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts: 175\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarrying capacity: propably around 80 tons of cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BWuXx/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft is very easy to fly and feels very responsive with or without SAS on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s made to full fill various different roles:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Cargo-plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Troopship (soldiers and their stuff).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. bomber. It does have a bomb-bay believe it or not, right after the crew tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersions for the future:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Tanker aircraft. Just need to modify one of my fighters and do some testing after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. AWACS. need to get BD-armoury back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Gunship. See above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMainly we use this aircraft with our newly developed pallet system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut our commandos are have also started to use it, since it can carry 16 commandos, their stuff, a scout vehicle, and some bombs and other support weapons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, not only can it transport them into the field it can also do some damage itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pallet system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the main cake itself, a fully working and reliable pallet system for all your tactical airdrop needs in rough terrain/situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt pretty much allows you to drop anything into the field without needing to land the plane itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt comes in two main variants:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: the standard cargo pallet. This one is used for carrying all kinds of cargo to the field and even more, like for example: fuel, crew, science equipment etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FERThDK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FERThDK.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just some examples i\u0027ve made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make your own to suit your needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou just have to detach the end panel and replace the middle with anything you can fit. I don\u0027t suggest making them any longer than that tough, there might be a lot of issues involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, that in theory, this could also be used for Duna missions as well (you need to attach some drogue shutes), but i\u0027m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Rover pallet. You can load small rovers into this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GbIBylc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GbIBylc.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built this one around the rover that i made. sadly the rover could not be turned into a subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this, i built a cargo-aircraft around the pallet in around 10 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: the attachment node in this one is the small strut on top of the panel, not the separator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. You will need to attach a separator to the cargo-bay attachment node and then the pallet to that. Please put on the end of the cargo-bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Some struts might be nice, to keep the thing from wobbling around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Remember to make an action group for the pallets landing gears, if they are retracted during drop, things will explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Always remember to point your nose slightly up, or otherwise your plane will plummet to the ground, and your pallet will hit the roof of the cargo-bay and things will explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. A slower speed will always help, but i have been able to make successful drops with the rover pallet at speeds of up to 200 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. The rover pallet will always land on it\u0027s side because of the placement of the parachutes. To fix this, it has vernor thrusters, so use them keep the thing straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. After touch down, tell the pallet to recover itself, otherwise you will be stuck inside the pallet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: More versions of the aircraft coming later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSB-15 scout buggy:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a bonus, i\u0027m adding this one here as well. It has a tendency to want to flip over when doing high speed turns, also the wheels explode more than enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus it\u0027s not that great at high speed, but it does look pretty cool tough\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p8OHzil.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p8OHzil.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe just welded together the front end of a very old V-12 racing car and the back-end of a more modern military scout buggy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DUMCbgy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DUMCbgy.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zPDOImA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zPDOImA.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere it is for you, the KTP-120 TaskMaster, an aircraft for many roles. i hope you enjoy it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload link: Comes with all the versions and all the different pallets (only subassemblies).
