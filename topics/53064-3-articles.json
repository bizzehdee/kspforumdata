The data recorder on the probe only appears to be \u0022calibrated\u0022 for one Mun altitude while it has 4 experiments on it at varying altitudes (including surface). So I am unable to gather data for all of the different experiments... (trying to use the data generated at the \u0022calibrated\u0022 altitude, even at the proper altitude for the experiments themselves, fails with the message that I need \u0022at least 100/200/etc data\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, gravity scans show a value of 198 science, but upon completing the transmission they actually deliver 0.0 science...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother Edit: Ok, so gathering all of the data for the upper experiments and then actually performing them, will allow you to gather data for the lower experiments - but still at the upper altitude. So you need to gather 350 data in the upper orbit, then do both upper orbit experiments, then gather another 500 data, then go to low orbit, do readings there, then land, then do readings there with the last 300 data...seems a bit awkward, but it DOES work at least...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T22:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RaccoonTOF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
