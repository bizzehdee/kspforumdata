Unfortunately, even though you have 8GB of memory, you\u0027re using a 32-bit operating system (so you only have ~3.5GB available as you pointed out).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix for this is to reduce texture quality to half or less. Since the game crashes and you can\u0027t do it in there, open up your settings.cfg file with something like notepad. Look for the line that says \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY = 0\u0022 and change it to \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY = 1\u0022 (or you can try 2 or 3 to start off with). Now you should be able to start the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 -Could be due to one of two things. Either it\u0027s related to memory issues from above, or you have a corrupt KSP installation. What you describe has been common with steam installs (which I can\u0027t tell if you\u0027re using). Try the graphics fix. If that doesn\u0027t work, re-download KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you got it from the store: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/instructions.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/instructions.php\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you got it from steam: delete or move KSP to another locaton. Open steam and verify the game cache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any save games you want to keep, you\u0027ll need to copy those directories out of KSP/Saves directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and as a final note. KSP doesn\u0027t like to be installed to places like \u0022My Documents\u0022 or the desktop. It\u0027s recommended to use some place such as C:/Games/KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
