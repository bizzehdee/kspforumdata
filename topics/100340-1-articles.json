Complete with an over the top, part count be damned stock faring. I have really enjoyed making small fairings out of cubics and backwards solar panels. \n\n I even don\u0027t think many others made these either so they are a rarity and I personally hope they live on even after the 1.0 release. \n\nThe Atlas V itself is a very accurate replica complete with \u0027off center\u0027 boosters and a detailed Centaur second stage.\n\nIt is capable of placing the payload into a 190,000m orbit with fuel spare to de-orbit the Centaur. \n\nWeighing in at 620 parts its not for the faint of CPU but this kind of detail comes with a price doesn\u0027t it.\n\nEnough talk! Pictures!\n\n![2q9xpxw.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/2q9xpxw.jpg)\n\n![28bbjhy.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/28bbjhy.jpg)\n\n![254yr84.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/254yr84.jpg)\n\n![33w5u1k.png](http://i58.tinypic.com/33w5u1k.png)\n\n![rrscwz.png](http://i62.tinypic.com/rrscwz.png)\n\n![64f4ly.png](http://i58.tinypic.com/64f4ly.png)\n\n![2ufyuwz.jpg](http://i60.tinypic.com/2ufyuwz.jpg)\n\nThere she is.
