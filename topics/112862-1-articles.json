This means that the kerbal bleeds off speed very rapidly at really high altitudes, where there\u0027s not enough air to generate reentry fireworks. It\u0027s like trying to throw a feather.\n\nThat\u0027s the game-physics explanation.

That\u0027s way higher than you would use for an aerobraking ship (doing that high would cause a ship to need multiple passes). Should slow him down gently as a feather, with no reentry F/X, even though you\u0027re hitting atmosphere around 3 km/s."},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:11:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was just asking about this the other day - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125053-EVA-re-entry-is-possible](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125053-EVA-re-entry-is-possible)\n\u003E Was really surprised this was possible.

Water landings are always fatal, but a ground landing often results in a bounce. Oddly, the second impact, the one from the bounce, is more often fatal than the first, in my experience. If you\u0027ve got a ship coming in too fast to land, the safest thing to do is to bail out at the very last second. You\u0027ll bounce more often than not."}]}
