Water landings are always fatal, but a ground landing often results in a bounce. Oddly, the second impact, the one from the bounce, is more often fatal than the first, in my experience. If you\u0027ve got a ship coming in too fast to land, the safest thing to do is to bail out at the very last second. You\u0027ll bounce more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
