The cost of recruiting kerbals is outrageously high... even if I don\u0027t account the fact that we get payed if we rescue Kerbals from LKO. It\u0027s an easy mission and virtually any number of such contracts can be done in one launch. As we don\u0027t have to feed them, it\u0027s easy to quickly end up with 30\u002B kerbals just by picking one or two up when going to or returning from missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T23:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew applicants are too expensive.
