The cost of recruiting kerbals is outrageously high... even if I don\u0027t account the fact that we get payed if we rescue Kerbals from LKO. It\u0027s an easy mission and virtually any number of such contracts can be done in one launch. As we don\u0027t have to feed them, it\u0027s easy to quickly end up with 30\u002B kerbals just by picking one or two up when going to or returning from missions."},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T23:36:37Z","Content":"New applicants are too expensive.

Which is only reasonably, considering they have zero skills when they show up so there\u0027s no reason to pay them much if at all. I have my recruit cost set at $10K which never changes.

I believe the game generates a new list if it\u0027s empty (at least it used to, haven\u0027t checked in 1.0). Once you get the folks you want, you can fire the ones you hired and don\u0027t want. You do have to make sure you exit the astro complex in between hirings and firings though, in order to force the lists to update.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"JMS1959","CreatedById":139721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T16:59:20Z","Content":"Thank you Claw, that worked a treat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd thank you for the welcome Evanitis ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
