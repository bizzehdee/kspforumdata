There are very good news though. The new wheels are now well within playable levels of physics stability, and all of the new wheel modules are implemented (in varying degrees of completion).\n\u003E \n\u003E The new modules gave us the opportunity to revise everything that we felt could be improved with the old wheel implementation. One big improvement is the Motor module, used on the four powered rover wheels. Before, the rover wheel motors would drain a fixed amount of electricity when driving, regardless of how much power the engines were actually putting out. The new motors drain electricity proportionally to their torque output, which means they need more juice to get you going, but that requirement goes down as you approach top speed and the motors power down to coasting. It also means you need more energy going uphill than downhill.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also improved is the wheel damage module. Until now, wheel damage was a consequence of essentially just driving above a speed limit. Now, the damage module factors in stresses from downforce and skidding independently, and wheels only become damaged when overstressed. Drive hard or burn donuts for too long, and you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have tires to keep driving with. Aerodynamic (or thruster-generated) downforce also contributes to wheel load stress. As before, engineer Kerbals can repair wheels in Career Mode, or any Kerbal in other modes.\n\u003E \n\u003E We also have a new differential steering module. This is steering done by driving the wheels in opposite sides in opposite directions, and is how the large rover wheels steer. Before, this existed as an alternate mode in the wheel modules. Now, the Diff Steering module is an extension of the Motor module, meaning differential steering uses the motor in the same way driving does, and consumes power in the same way. Wheels are able to go beyond their max driving torque for differential steering, as that does require a lot of torque to get the wheels spinning against the ground. Power consumption is still proportional, however.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also gone through all of our wheel parts this week, re-exporting and reconfiguring them all to use the new system. This means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also getting a new gear bay, between the small and medium-sized bays, which had to be put off from the 1.0 release because of time constraints. The large gear bay has also been improved, and now features a bogey module which controls the 4-wheeled pivoting undercarriage. \n\u003E \n\u003E This bogey module is also used to orient the feet on landing legs. The legs, even though they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look it, are also wheels internally. This allows them to have working suspensions and friction physics. Because they obviously can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t roll, they have the brakes constantly set. This makes the wheel colliders behave as static, suspension-supported feet.\n\u003E \n\u003E I reckon we are now on the final stretch of wheel development, which is none too soon, I may add. This has been a lot more work than anyone could have anticipated, but I do think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be well worth the effort in the end.\n\n**Mike (Mu)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly my dev notes are also a little repetitive! Work continues unabated on the UI side of the Unity 5 upgrade. It is making for slow progress, and even slower reading, but we are soldiering on. We merged all the branches together today to get the latest updates from the other side of the team and are aiming to push the completed UI branch to QA within a few weeks.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The highlights of this week include more pushing to get the Amazon update out, still unsuccessfully, creating the KerbalEdu installers and shuffling ideas back and forth with Ted, discussing the best way to get the patcher back in working order as soon as possible. we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not quite ready to tell you about that, we haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t gotten to a concrete conclusion yet.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I kept working on different assets for the game. Managed to move forward on one of the tasks at hand, which should be revealed at it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own time. On the other hand we just revealed the Valentina Kerman 3d printed model, one more Kerbal to have next to you while you fast forwarding a ship. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done a couple of graphics for the announcement, and a couple more that Max needed for other media related things. \n\n**Jim (Romfarer)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Firstly i just want to clear up a misunderstanding from last week. When i said the R\u0026D tech tree was completely re-done I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean to say we are reorganizing the tree. The goal is still to have it look the same. \n\u003E \n\u003E As Felipe and Mike already have pointed out, we are repeating on getting the gui\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s converted to U5. This week i started on the Application Launcher and all the stock apps associated with it. We are actually planning some changes. Before the applauncher was anchored in the top-right corner of the screen and the apps were laid out to the left. Now the plan is to lay the apps out downwards so they will take up the right hand of the screen. It is also in the plan to merge the knowledge base into the applauncher.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been sorting out details of our PS4 version with our friends and collaborators over at Flying Tiger. Their control schemes are pretty creative and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re sure people will find the experience enjoyable. Other than that and the usual business of meetings and organizing, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been enjoying the ins and outs of getting packages in and out of countries that contain .testkits. Importing is never fun and rarely a convenient thing that can be done in a whim.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d also love to hear from you guys on the subject of changing Squadcast\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s format. Maybe doing something like going through community provided saves and challenges.\n\n**Ted (Ted)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been continuing with production-type tasks. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve begun the planning and design stages for 1.1 now. In the past week, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve discussed and decided with Porkjet, RoverDude and Arsonide what features they will be working on for 1.1, respectively. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re very eager to be getting back into the swing of things for development in a post-1.0 world and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m really liking the look of the features for 1.1 from them - even though at this point they exist more on e-paper than in-game.\n\u003E \n\u003E Outside of that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had the usual dose of meetings about various areas of KSP and development support for the Unity 5 upgrade work, which doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have long left to go now! Additionally, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been continuing my work on our internal documentation, which is going slow but steady, taking a backburner in favour of a lot of the more pressing tasks.\n\u003E \n\u003E On that note, the Experimental applications will actually be opening Monday 20th as other tasks have taken priority for the moment. Not to worry though, still looking forward to reading them!\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been focussing a lot on studying this week, and took next week off completely to make sure I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m as prepared as I can be for my final exam. That means that there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a lot to report on from my end, but I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ignore the fact that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve just announced the Valentina Kerman figurine!

Will the new and improved landing gear be height adjustable? For example, if I use a medium landing gear as a nose wheel, and heavy as main gear, will I be able to adjust how tall the landing gear is to keep the plane somewhat level when on different sized landing gear. Also, will the medium landing gear be steerable? And will the 1.0 landing gear have lights?\n\nVery curious about the improvements!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T23:11:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Merandix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T23:19:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about allowing the user to set the icon size via preferences and also be able to move the toolbar around? Also, with the knowledge base moved into the app launcher can we get the ability to see the crew info on the flight screen to make it easier to EVA the correct Kerbal? How about moving, or allowing the viewing of, the intercept information to the flight screen as well (that would be very helpful, right now it\u0027s in a very inconvenient place)?\n\nWhile we\u0027re at it, howsabout all that info at the top of the screen and on the left goes into map mode too?

Can the game remember that if the Pe goes underground and then back up? And can it remember it when we leave map mode and come back? And can we get the same functionality for approach markers?
