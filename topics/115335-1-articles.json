There are very good news though. The new wheels are now well within playable levels of physics stability, and all of the new wheel modules are implemented (in varying degrees of completion).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The new modules gave us the opportunity to revise everything that we felt could be improved with the old wheel implementation. One big improvement is the Motor module, used on the four powered rover wheels. Before, the rover wheel motors would drain a fixed amount of electricity when driving, regardless of how much power the engines were actually putting out. The new motors drain electricity proportionally to their torque output, which means they need more juice to get you going, but that requirement goes down as you approach top speed and the motors power down to coasting. It also means you need more energy going uphill than downhill.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also improved is the wheel damage module. Until now, wheel damage was a consequence of essentially just driving above a speed limit. Now, the damage module factors in stresses from downforce and skidding independently, and wheels only become damaged when overstressed. Drive hard or burn donuts for too long, and you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have tires to keep driving with. Aerodynamic (or thruster-generated) downforce also contributes to wheel load stress. As before, engineer Kerbals can repair wheels in Career Mode, or any Kerbal in other modes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We also have a new differential steering module. This is steering done by driving the wheels in opposite sides in opposite directions, and is how the large rover wheels steer. Before, this existed as an alternate mode in the wheel modules. Now, the Diff Steering module is an extension of the Motor module, meaning differential steering uses the motor in the same way driving does, and consumes power in the same way. Wheels are able to go beyond their max driving torque for differential steering, as that does require a lot of torque to get the wheels spinning against the ground. Power consumption is still proportional, however.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also gone through all of our wheel parts this week, re-exporting and reconfiguring them all to use the new system. This means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also getting a new gear bay, between the small and medium-sized bays, which had to be put off from the 1.0 release because of time constraints. The large gear bay has also been improved, and now features a bogey module which controls the 4-wheeled pivoting undercarriage. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This bogey module is also used to orient the feet on landing legs. The legs, even though they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look it, are also wheels internally. This allows them to have working suspensions and friction physics. Because they obviously can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t roll, they have the brakes constantly set. This makes the wheel colliders behave as static, suspension-supported feet.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I reckon we are now on the final stretch of wheel development, which is none too soon, I may add. This has been a lot more work than anyone could have anticipated, but I do think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to be well worth the effort in the end.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Mike (Mu)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sadly my dev notes are also a little repetitive!

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done a couple of graphics for the announcement, and a couple more that Max needed for other media related things. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Firstly i just want to clear up a misunderstanding from last week.

This week i started on the Application Launcher and all the stock apps associated with it. We are actually planning some changes.

One of the reasons I use KER is it\u0027s super clunky in stock to know both my apoapsis and altitude at the same time, and there\u0027s no way to know both of those things at the exact time you stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you click on the Ap or Pe its information stays on the screen. Can the game remember that if the Pe goes underground and then back up? And can it remember it when we leave map mode and come back? And can we get the same functionality for approach markers? I\u0027ve never understood why you can click on the Ap to keep its data on the screen, but not the approach markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022falloutaddict\u0022 data-cite=\u0022falloutaddict\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat kind of qualifications would be required to be an experimenter? or will there be more on that later?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also curious about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut KSP is not a stone.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a series of tubes!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T23:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut KSP is not a stone.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
