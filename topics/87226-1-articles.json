It makes the screen get completely wiped out by those red fire particles that can be seen when entering atmospheres. The screen then turns white, and the game needs to be manually closed. Once the game is restarted, all of ships will disappear except for EVAs and Flags. Occasionally debris in orbit around the sun will survive. When reopening the save, it says that the parts to just about all of ships are missing. This doesn\u0027t just affect ships but also affects the research. All archives go unharmed, but random parts go missing. The node is still researched, just a lot of parts require another entry fee to gain access to them again. There seem to be varying degrees of Ass Kraken, sometimes deleting parts and ships, and other times leaving them unharmed. This is probably the most devastating, but rarest kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romuless","CreatedById":121244,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T05:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry for laughing for like 3 minutes at this man, really I am but it\u0027s out of feeling your pain and sharing the ridiculously brutal journey of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T05:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming this is the equivalent of a massive nuclear explosion hitting the KSC and wiping out your stuff.
