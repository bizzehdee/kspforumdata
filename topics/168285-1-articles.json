I sent a probe to Duna with a 90 Gm dish and had it set to be pointing at Kerbin. The satellites orbiting Kerbin are only 90 Mm. I was told the better dish should compensate for the weaker one. However, I have no connection with the duna probe and it\u0027s only 20 Gm away. Is it because Kerbin\u0027s satellites need to be the ones with the strong dish?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-07T13:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022

for which side of the link gets\u00A0the stronger dish:\u00A0 the range in root mode depends only on the antenna combination, not the order.\u00A0 However, the solution is easy:\u00A0 add stronger dishes at Kerbin.\u00A0 You won\u0027t even need to re-do your current satellite constellation:\u00A0 just have one new satellite in a large-radius polar orbit (this reduces the chance of occultation) that has a dish powerful enough for Duna\u00A0and enough\u00A0antennas to connect to your existing constellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the reason why you cannot connect, the range is not the average or arithmetic mean of the component antennas\u0027 ranges;\u00A0it\u0027s the geometric mean.\u00A0 The formula for it is\u00A0\u221A(r\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003Er\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E), where the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Er\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0values are the antenna ranges involved.\u00A0 90 Mm x 90 Gm gives 8.1 x 10\u003Csup\u003E18\u003C/sup\u003E, and the square root of that is 2.846 Gm.\u00A0 There is also something called a clamping value, which says that an antenna is limited to a hard increase of 100x its base range for omnis and 1000x its base range for dishes, but we\u0027re not running up against that.\u00A0 The idea there is that it keeps you from using a DP-10 to communicate from Eeloo just by linking it to a stupidly-overpowered dish at Kerbin.\u00A0 This also means that you will never be able to connect a KR-7 (which, if I have it right, is what you\u0027re using at Kerbin) to anything more than 90 Gm away, because 90 Gm is 1000x the KR-7\u0027s range.\u00A0 When linked to a sufficiently-powerful dish, they\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0reach Duna, but the dish you chose to use at Duna is not powerful enough.\u00A0 You\u0027d need something rated to 4.5 Tm or better to connect when Duna is 20 Gm away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is essentially that while Duna has powerful dishes orbiting it, the ones at Kerbin are so weak that they can\u0027t transmit a usable signal with enough strength for the Duna dishes to sort from the background noise.\u00A0 In reality, more powerful antennas are perfectly capable of picking out the signal from weaker antennas.\u00A0 For example, sensitive antenna technology is what allows us to continue communicating with the Voyager probes (at least, I\u0027m\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efairly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sure that no one\u0027s upgraded Voyagers\u0027 radios), but the simplified model used in RemoteTech does not allow for that because it doesn\u0027t simulate noise at all.\u00A0 They\u0027re working on it for RemoteTech 2.0, but there\u0027s nothing like a release date on that yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
