However, this still puzzles me: Whenever we enter the gravitational sphere of a celestial body in KSP, we need to circularize by adjusting our speed, hence we spend fuel doing so. Even if one considers real orbital trajectories, it still makes sense that it would work that way: if you fly by a planet close enough to use its gravity as assistance, to save fuel, it only makes sense as a maneuver if it\u0027s accelerating you and increasing your speed along your current trajectory - from what I understand, that\u0027s because your distance from the object and your speed don\u0027t correspond to a stable orbit, hence you get a gravity assist due to the force the object is applying on you (which should, by this logic, be the difference of your current speed and the speed of a stable orbit at that distance from its center). Thus, I see two ways Ed Lu\u0027s statement can reflect what they\u0027re actually doing:\n\n1. Somehow, in the real world, you can pass by an object at lower than escape velocity and have its gravity assist increase your velocity enough to circularize your orbit (not around the object itself, I think their probe is intended to somehow get a circular orbit similar to Venus\u0027s) instead of just getting left with a sub-orbital trajectory\n\n2. You pass by it at a high speed, but counter to its rotation, thus losing speed.\n\nThe second one is pretty much my question: I know that when you\u0027re already on an object, it\u0027s wise to use the planet\u0027s rotation to get a bit more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, but when you\u0027re passing by it, does entering a retrograde or prograde orbit matter in terms of how its gravity assist will work or the scale of its effect? As far as I understand, it shouldn\u0027t matter at all since the body is pretty much producing a gravitational field and as long as its strength is the same, the way it alters your own energy should be the same, no matter the angle of attack. Do tidal forces apply here?\n\nAs an addendum, do we see any strange effects in KSP related to this? For example, if one enters a body\u0027s SOI retrograde, prograde or in a polar trajectory, do we get a different kind of gravity assist?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T21:47:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T22:02:35Z","Content":"Hypotheically, lets consider a rocket launched sraight up into the Mun\u0027s SoI. it\u0027s a suborbital launch, no orbital velocity at all.\n\nBut by slingshotting the Mun right, you can put the rocket into an orbit with the same semi major axis as the mun, or smaller (or larger, but limited to a bit less than twice mun\u0027s orbital velocty)"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T22:24:15Z","Content":"They intend to use a gravity assist from Venus to lower the aphelion of their spacecraft (making its orbit more circular and closer to the Sun than Earth\u0027s orbit).

If the object pulls the craft counter to its velocity vector it loses speed, if it pulls it prograde it gains speed.\n\nThanks to you both. Just to clarify, does the rotation speed/direction/tilt of the planet, relative to the craft\u0027s vector, have \\_any\\_ effect on it at all? If so, is that effect comparable to the effects of its gravity alone or can they be ignored as far as its new trajectory is concerned?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:17:03Z","Content":"\u003E Thanks to you both.
