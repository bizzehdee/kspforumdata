Also, adding reaction wheels to a ship adds many weak joints to it, causing it to flex and wobble more when you turn it. Because of that, it\u0027s often preferable to keep the individual modules of a modular ship as rigid as possible, and only use a minimal number of reaction wheels in the ship. My typical ~200-tonne interplanetary ships usually have three large ASAS modules near the center of mass in the thruster modules, and a number of command pods in the payload section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, anything with reaction wheels and RCS turns faster with both RCS and reaction wheels than only with the reaction wheels. Because large ships are always too slow to turn, it\u0027s better to use the RCS if the ship has it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T05:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1.
