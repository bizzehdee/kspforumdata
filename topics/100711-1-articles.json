I always follow this rule and my spoilers give no unwanted torque to my planes.\n\nEDIT: Found a good answer on the web:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Air brakes increase the drag on the aircraft, but do not directly affect lift. Air brakes are often positioned on a non lift producing part of the aircraft and are useful if you want to slow down, but maintain lift. Spoilers disrupt the airflow over the wings and therefore reduce the lift they are producing. Spoilers are useful when landing to prevent bouncing. The auto brakes on many transport aircraft also deploy the spoilers once the wheels touch the ground to prevent the aircraft from becoming airborne again. Spoilers also can increase the drag on an aircraft, and are often used to slow down during decent and approach.\n\nControl surfaces in KSP can be used both as spoilers and as air-brakes, depends on where you place them. B9 Procedural surfaces are awesome for this job cause you can make them look cool.\n\nThe Space Shuttle tail surfaces opened like a clam-shell during landing.\n\n![fp7HJ4Om.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fp7HJ4Om.jpg)\n\nThe design is called \u0022deceleron\u0022 - a control surface can split itself and serve as an air-brake when needed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T10:13:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 10:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:26:44Z","Content":"I actually suggested the implementation of a deceleron design to bac9, in his procedural B9 thread.\n\nBut I would not get my hopes up, splitting parts seems like a quite a challenge for procedural parts.\n\nBut on the topic of airbrakes, I just saw airbrake models in Ven\u0027s StockPartRevamp thread.\n\nOne of them is a cylinder part with 2 small brakes coming out of the sides of it."},{"CreatedByName":"Arron Rift","CreatedById":113722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:23:21Z","Content":"Hey, just saw this mod on ckan and downloaded it, but what do you mean by \u0022the jet engine rebalances by Taverius\u0022?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T13:00:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hey, just saw this mod on ckan and downloaded it, but what do you mean by \u0022the jet engine rebalances by Taverius\u0022?\n\nThere are some module manager config files included, which change the stock engines.
