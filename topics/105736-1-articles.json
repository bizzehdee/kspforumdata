In this case I have a 2.5m service bay packed with other parts and now I cannot open it to access what is inside while I\u0027m editing the ship in the VAB. It opens fine once the ship is active in space or on the launch pad, just not in the VAB where I need to edit it. With a ladder it was a simple matter of taking it off, throwing it away and adding a new one as a workaround, but I\u0027d rather not have to do that since I have so much stuff inside this service bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a workaround for this that doesn\u0027t require me starting from scratch with a brand new service bay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I can probably start over and have the bay the way I want it in the time it takes to get responses from you guys, but it would be nice to know of a workaround for the future).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T20:23:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you can take it off and put it back on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaws909","CreatedById":78157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have a fairing over it do you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do have a fairing which I have not tried taking off first - does that make a difference?
