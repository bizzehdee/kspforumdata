All you need to do is take a screenshot of a working science experiment as proof.

Anyway you guys have been doing it all this time without useless points. Of all the things people can complain about, people want points they can\u0027t use? I don\u0027t mind either way, I\u0027m all for science in sandbox if that\u0027s what people want even though I don\u0027t care about the science points, but I\u0027m not gonna complain about that option not being there. It\u0027s like throwing a fit because someone says I\u0027m not allowed to open a bank account to save up useless monopoly money. It\u0027s nice to have options but is it really a big deal?
