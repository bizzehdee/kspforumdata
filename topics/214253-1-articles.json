While the Jool\u0027s surface pressure is very high, due to being primarily hydrogen, it\u0027s not very dense, so while it starts as an almost the same kind of soup that you see on Eve, it grows thin a lot faster, leaving you with very little to push against once you\u0027re high up above the clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA nice quirk of the kind of aerodynamic simulation we see in KSP and KSP2, and to some degree in the real world as well, is that the lift and drag of the wings remain roughly in the same proportion despite the changes in ambient pressure, which means that with the right tuning, as the atmosphere gets thinner and lift drops, so does the drag, allowing the craft to spin up to a higher angular velocity and compensate for the lost lift. In fact, so long as the torque remains constant, you can keep going higher and higher until you hit some sort of a rotational speed limit. In this case, the centrifugal stress simply tears off one of the rotors at 43km. I\u0027m sure that with some work, an even higher altitude can be achieved, but from 40km and up, the atmosphere is thin enough for conventional rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe construction of this craft is intentionally kept as simple as possible. There are only 4 struts in the whole thing, but they are strategically placed to provide sufficient rigidity. The \u0022rotor blades\u0022 are made of just 5 parts, one of which is the stack separator that initially holds them to the craft, and are caged in eight of the smallest landing gear on each side. This is a kind of design that might be possible to scale up for an even larger lifter, but hard to scale down, which means that a proper Jool surface return vehicle might end up being rather gigantic with this approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and for the sake of a clean record, yes, the craft was save-hacked onto Jool. If I design a proper return vehicle, I\u0027ll look into figuring out how to deliver it to Jool properly, but I need to build something that works there first.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
