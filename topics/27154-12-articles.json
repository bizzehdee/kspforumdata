The Dragon capsule, by itself, slows down my system A LOT and causes the graphics and audio to stutter, even in VAB. The other parts seem to be okay, because when I remove the Dragon capsule from the rockets, there is no reduction in performance. Do we really need windows that we can see into the Dragon capsule from the outside, especially since we can\u0027t see the Kerbals in their seats anyway?
