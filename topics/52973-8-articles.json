However, after flying sploden\u0027s craft (which used them on the lander), it seemed to me like you\u0027d need a lot of them to get the same TWR that I had with those two radial engines. I like them, but they seem to be best for 1.25 m parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, my lander had over 2,000 m/s Delta V, so that was pretty decent in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just did some math, and you\u0027re definitely right.
