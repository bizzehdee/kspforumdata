I used to run it on the one X and it was ok but I couldn\u00B4t tell if it was really better than on the normal One I had before. Probably there wasn\u00B4t a difference at all but the performance was ok especially since the micro stuttering disappeared this year due to a patch I guess. So now I had the honor to try it on the Series S as the very first game installed and I have to say THIS IS IT! That\u00B4s how it\u00B4s supposed to run. It runs even better than it ever did on my PC which was pretty siilar\u00A0to\u00A0the One X performance but with way less boot up times. On the Series S the boot sequence is pc level but the performance on auto HDR settings 4K UHD (Skaled I guess? But it looks crisp like true\u00A04k) is stunning. The CPU indicator remains green even for big rockets during maxQ\u00A0and it runs smooth as butter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u00B4s a joy and I want to make this statement for all who maybe were wondering if it was improving KSP to run it on the new Xboxes or no. It does it by a lot. I can really suggest to consider a go for a series X and also the S (if you can live with the 500GB small HDD-space). The performance is top and you will find all your XBO games in the game library ready to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Base","CreatedById":208507,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-03T13:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor series S\u00A0with very high performance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
