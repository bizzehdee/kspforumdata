It is caused by the fact that most points of SOI boundary move through space at different speed than is the true orbital speed at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ If an object passes Mun or Minmus orbit it might get gravitationally slingshotted just right to enter stable orbit around Kerbin even though its original orbit would eventually send it out of the SOI again. Such orbit, however, still crosses the trajectory of the moon that caused this, and over time the object will get another gravitational slingshot. In the end it will inevitably either crash into some body within that SOI or exit the SOI again after series of such slingshots but that may happen in very distant future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T11:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is caused by the fact that most points of SOI boundary move through space at different speed than is the true orbital speed at that point.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhh, that makes a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T13:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETimewarping through SOI changes can shift your orbit.
