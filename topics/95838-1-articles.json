Using the Higgs Field to generate exotic matter is an interesting idea though, but I feel as if there might be a barrier of sort at zero mass, sort of how there is a barrier at C.

Hypothetically speaking, an object with negative mass isn\u0027t so hard to believe. There are singularities with what some consider to be infinite mass and density.

Negative mass is required to make \u0027blip\u0027 in spacetime as opposed to the \u0027hole\u0027 conventional mass creates in spacetime. Using the blip of negative mass and the hole of conventional mass you place your ship in the middle to ride the spacetime wave. That\u0027s a pretty simplified version of what it is. Because you\u0027re asking about it I assume you know that already. The negative mass required to get FTL speeds \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be created from higgs field manipulation. The negative mass has no bearing on the energy required to sustain the field. That, as Howard White recently published(2 years or so), seems to be dependent on the shape of the field. Apparently football(american) shaped fields are less energy intensive than spherical, reducing the amount of mass-energy required from the mass of Jupiter to that of a small asteroid.

Sounds insane, but given that we are dealing with a non-positive definite metric, maybe? My measure theory is rusty at best. I\u0027m going to bug my friends from math dept. about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to slightly less insane physics of General Relativity, in general (heh) negative energy does not mean negative mass. In Alcubierre metric specifically, however, you get both. It\u0027s negative energy density and negative mass density. But both are densities, so your volume comment still applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Has anyone actually integrated the energy density in a warp bubble? I mean, has anyone actually verified that the total energy is negative? I mean, I know I didn\u0027t think of that, but somebody ought to have, right? Right? I\u0027m going to need to do some serious math. After I talk to some serious people who know how to do serious math. Already looked through some analysis textbooks. They all assume positive definite metric. Gah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little while later edit: Looks like I\u0027ve managed to thoroughly confuse myself up there. The densities in GR are 3-volume densities, which, naturally, are frame dependent. That\u0027s why the 4-vector quantity containing energy, the 4-momentum, has a tensor density. It\u0027s sort of like the flow density, and we are interested in its intersection with a 3-volume in selected coordinate system. Since the 3-volume is always normal to proper time of the coordinate system, the 3-volume is always positive. Essentially, you have to be moving faster than light to begin with to get positive energy turn into negative energy. So for all sane purposes, negative energy density of the warp bubble translates to negative total energy, as well as negative total mass. Ergo, requirement for exotic matter stands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T04:49:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominatus","CreatedById":76870,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T13:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay!
