If it calls itself that, it fails, \u003Cem\u003Eutterly\u003C/em\u003E. Adding a mislabeled building (mission control is a \u0022contract office\u0022 or something, as real \u0022Mission Control\u0022 manages flights in progress), and mislabeling things \u0022strategies\u0022 doesn\u0027t make it a management game. Another way it is not a management game: in a railroad management game, does the player have to stop each train at any given set of points, get out (EVA) and switch the points himself, then continue driving the train? No. In a empire management game does the player have to micromanage each army he moves, literally walking them down the road, and deciding which turn to make? No. Do you have to serially reload each individual musket in Empire: Total War, the level and fire yourself? No. In KSP the player must do EVERY action of spacecraft personally. Without some autonomy of the astronauts flying their craft, doing EVAs, etc, it\u0027s not a management game, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience mode fails, too, IMO, partially because the tech tree being unlocked by science makes no sense, and the tech is largely concurrent as well, making \u0022later\u0022 stuff seem silly to anyone who knows that is should be concurrent. The main reason is that science is not useful for gameplay, other than this flawed tech-unlock mechanic (the only reward system in either science or career mode). There is another current thread regarding better science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question OP poses stands, what is KSP trying to be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we stop with Sandbox, then all the additional buildings, career, contracts, etc are wasted effort. Personally, I don\u0027t think Science and/or Career mode should be continued out of a \u0022sunk cost\u0022 fallacy, but I think they should be continued/fixed because they are in fact a good idea---but they require really looking at what the goal is, and steering the gameplay in those modes to make them work well, which they just don\u0027t right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox: Fine as-is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience: Currently the goal is science points and unlocking the tree (the sole game \u0022reward\u0022 system). Science mode should shift entirely with the design goal of Exploration (for science!). Have the Kerbol system randomize each science game start (stock system as an option). Not just locations, but have different planets possible. Have nothing known about the worlds that would not be known from Kerbin surface. Explore, and have science usefully giving the player more information about the worlds therein. Fog of war is not just good gameplay, it makes it exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer: Currently rudderless, IMO. Set a goal. If it is \u0022management,\u0022 then the player is a manager who can also \u003Cem\u003Eelectively\u003C/em\u003E fly missions. If I cannot groom astronauts to actually do their work, it\u0027s not management, period. No AI kerbals, no \u0022management as the focus.\u0022 With the player as the sole pilot, management is not the goal of career, but career exists (IMHO) to \u003Cem\u003Epresent the player with novel problems to solve\u003C/em\u003E since things have a context they lack in Sandbox. As such, career needs meaningful time progression so that time-critical tasks are a thing. Life support at a bare bones level would help, as would redoing the whole \u0022contract\u0022 paradigm. More random busywork (Fine Print) is not the solution. FP has some great ideas within the system, but it is predicated on the status quo, and has issues because of that. Have budgets. Have a purpose (space race? colonization?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovel career idea: Space race\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 not against another country, but against TIME. Code in a new planet, comet, or huge asteroid/planetoid. It is on a collision course with Kerbin in 50-100 years (number could be a difficulty setting). A world-killer. The race is to colonize other worlds before this happens, or possibly to deflect it if it is in a size range where this is plausible. Time MUST matter for this, have the player get budgets. Change \u0022Funds\u0022 to \u0022Resources,\u0022 as this is a save the world event, and the limit is what you can make while still feeding the planet, etc. Add some larger parts, as well as some threshold at a world where you can start to build in-situ facilities. Set up X amount of ISRU, and within X km of that base land X many kerbals, and so many tons of \u0022cargo\u0022 (add cargo parts that have some large mass of \u0022cargo\u0022 for this), then you get a nascent in-situ facility you place on the surface. You then upgrade it via ISRU extraction and cargo delivery and colonists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think I\u0027m not the only one who thinks those two terms aren\u0027t mutually exclusive.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.

I don\u0027t think Squad really know. I\u0027ve felt that since Day 1, but it\u0027s become more and more apparent as the updates have slowly wandered into release. There\u0027s never really been a roadmap of what the game is trying to be, and only the broadest of references to \u0022tycoon-like\u0022 features (which were never going to make a compelling game anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy honest opinion, reading between the lines of things that the Devs themselves have said, is that that they got lucky with the basic concept, and have had to scramble additional ideas together as the project gained more interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that we got this amazing sandbox environment that plays to people\u0027s desire for exploration and, dare I say, wonderous grandeur - something that was clearly driven by the Dev\u0027s own passion for the subject. This works well enough and would have benefited from greater development. But the lack of any clear plan has led to a ponderous and turgid set of career features that fail to capitalise on the qualities of sandbox and turn it into a compelling narrative.

Specifically, halting development soon after 1.0 (I expect this to happen anyway) and opening up the modding API as much as possible to allow as close to an Open KSP as possible. That will probably net Squad some longevity in the project and (if they think themselves capable of competing with modders) would increase the market for future DLC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T00:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is KSP trying to be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose Harvestar would say, \u0022Fun!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI consider it a simulation game.
