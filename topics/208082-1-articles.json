As i know that exist a image telling about the delta v costs, i just want to know how to calculate it and try my self with math. im new, sorry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKellerBR","CreatedById":144229,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-25T13:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BwZpO4f.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022128.00\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BwZpO4f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
