Under this menu you can also adjust brake torque on each wheel. Set the rear wheels to maximum torque and leave the front alone or even reduce it\u0027s brake torque to avoid nosing-over on landing (to answer your question, you should be using brakes just after touchdown, provided you\u0027ve set them up correctly)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo practice landing: Skip the actual landing (seriously!) Take off, get up to speed and altitude, then turn back to the runway, but instead of going to the ground imagine the runway is floating 100m up. So come in straight and work on getting your speed as low as possible while maintaining a steady altitude (say around 150m) Reduce engine thrust to the level needed to maintain this speed and altitude. Note the level of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now you\u0027re flying around at 150m altitude, going 70m/s, and your throttle is at 30% (numbers made up, but probably close for something that size) how does this help you? Well it helps because from now on you know that you can reduce throttle to 30% and descend to 150m while you\u0027re still kilometers away from the runway and you\u0027ll be able to hold that altitude and speed for as long as needed. Once you get to the runway all you have to do is loose a very small amount of altitude and maybe 10m/s of speed and you\u0027ll be on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare that to a\u00A0\u0022normal\u0022\u00A0KSP landing where\u00A0you\u0027re coming in from high speed, high altitude, with engines going full blast or off completely, and you\u0027re trying to kill all that speed and altitude while not crashing or overshooting. It\u0027s a lot to handle in only a few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet rid of speed and altitude early and landings will be a breeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T23:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding at over 70ms is likely to break things you want to float gently down just above stall speed, which by the number of wings yours has is probably around 30ms\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T23:03:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mast","CreatedById":98292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T10:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/101722-whiteknuckle/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022101722\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/101722-whiteknuckle/\u0022\u003E@WhiteKnuckle\u003C/a\u003E Looks like the front wheel was mounted right after all, inverting actually inverted the steering.
