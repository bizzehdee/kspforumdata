It was not my intent.*\n\n*Cheers,*\n\n*~Claw* \n\nThanks Claw for your response, you have cleared up the confusion about how the posts got stickied but that does lead me to a train of thought.\n\nThe problem arose because the post was stickied without letting anyone know why there was a change in the policy behind sticky posts or who had stickied it.\n\nTo the average forum user, (like myself or raptor specifically it seems) there was just a decision to sticky a particular suggestion when suggestions had not been stickied before to my knowledge. Daze mentioned in the thread about one that had been stickied previously which was the first time I had seen another stickied suggestion. It seemed like the suggestion was promoted by a particular mod as no other mod had posted and the normal convention is a small post inside the thread when a mod stickies it saying why. This really seems like a good policy for wider adoption.\n\nHad you stickied the suggestion as part of a new \u0027featured suggestion\u0027 section and actually posted that in the thread there would have been no discussion, disagreement or negative posts as there would have been no room for speculation.\n\nThere is no need to spit the dummy and not sticky suggestions, the description of your plan sounds actually good and would highlight suggestions but I must ask, why did you not use a similar format to \u0027threads of the month\u0027 on the main page if that was your plan?\n\nI would hope that is is plain that just stickying things without explanation will obviously lead to speculation and (possibly intense) discussion and that any changes in the way things are done should come with a little note saying what has changed and why. For months now the forum has just been asking to be kept informed of changes. This is a very good example of a case in point.\n\nIt is natural in the absence of other information to ask \u0027why did X get treatment Y when Z did not?\u0027. If the mod who stickies says \u0027This week/month I have decided to start featuring suggestions and stickying them for a bit\u0027 then pretty much everyone would go \u0027cool, I wonder what will be next\u0027\n\nI would have replied in the stickied thread about sticky threads but that is locked and just seems to be a \u0027name and shame\u0027 post (to me at least, being one of the named) when a couple of PM\u0027s could have let me and raptor know if that was the intention.\n\nA generic post like\n\n*\u0027Due to the recent intense discussion regarding stickied suggestions I have decided to not continue the policy. I thought it would be an interesting change of pace to rotate though various topics every week or two, giving people a chance to post their own thoughts an opinions about a new topic. I didn\u0027t realize people would interpret that as a rogue element, or some moderator gone awry.

The flip side is that when I do post in threads like that, people also take that as a cue of official endorsement. Heck, even posting it as a sticky looks like an official endorsement. Also, the discussion in this sub-forum is different because it is primarily aimed at devs more than fellow players\n\nHowever, I do understand your point. One small line in one post that\u0027s been buried does not inform everyone (or even anyone).

Not because I was making some attempt to ignore the problem, if there was any concern about that.\n\nBelieve it or not, there is no hidden agenda here. I\u0027m not mad, or hurt, or angry at anyone. It is just sometimes difficult to make everyone happy. Sometimes we try things on the forum, but not because we have some conspiracy in mind. We often struggle with deciding on any change at all, because we know that someone will interpret meaning where none is intended, no matter how big or small. And by \u0022we,\u0022 I am talking about the forum moderators, who are not squad employees but fellow KSP players like yourself.\n\nAlso, the process of informing becomes a challenge in itself, because some people look at every word and try to decipher some hidden clue. This often leads to posts that are very sterile and bland, which likely leaves people unsatisfied (but I suppose that\u0027s a bigger issue, beyond the scope of this sticky discussion).\n\nThat probably all sounds like whining, but I\u0027m just trying to explain some of the background. I\u0027m hesitant to post even this, because it isn\u0027t as bland and as sterile as I normally post. For all the reasons stated above.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For months now the forum has just been asking to be kept informed of changes. This is a very good example of a case in point.\n\nFair enough.

As you say, the post got lost among many others (maybe it could have been stickied? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) I thought this was something that just started with no preamble of any sort, now I realise that all the preamble happened and I just missed it so the blame lies with myself.\n\nI can understand how difficult being a mod must be at times, you can\u0027t please all the people etc. I completely believe there is no hidden agenda of any sort and I do not want to suggest that. It is not easy even being just a user to keep up with all the posts n stuff and if a post is not on the first page for a week or two there is a good chance it may get missed.\n\nNo bad feelings, no conspiracy, no agenda."}]}
