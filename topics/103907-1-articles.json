But when I started KSP this morning I got a message in my menu that my savegames were not compatible anymore with this version of KSP and if I wanted to delete them. Of course I didn\u0027t and went on to the resume savegame screen. In de savegamebox my savegame was grey and unloadable stating \u0027this savegame is unfit for this version of KSP\u0027.\n\nWhat is the problem? Was there an update this night? Or are my savegames corrupted and do I need to reset my backup (wich i luckily still have somewhere)\n\nI\u0027d rather be stuck in a Kerbin orbit than start all over again..."}]}
