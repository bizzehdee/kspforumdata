The Procedural Fuel Tank now has an option for LqdHydrogen (\u0022NF Lqd Hydrogen\u0022), and the Procedural Xenon Tank has an option for ArgonGas (\u0022NF Argon\u0022).\n\nWhen calculating the config values, I kinda just eyeballed it by using a procedural part and adjusting it so that it\u0027s roughly the same size as the fuel-containing part of the NF tanks so the new parts may still be a bit unbalanced. Improvement suggestions are welcome!\n\nFor now, this\u0027ll be a standalone \u0022mod\u0022, but I may ask the NF devs (OtherBarry and RadarManFromTheMoon) if they\u0027d like to include this in the mod (If you two see this, let me know if you\u0027re interested! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)).\n\nRequires ModuleManager and Procedural Parts.\n\nDownload: [https://github.com/CaptainKorhonen/ProceduralNFTanks/releases](https://github.com/CaptainKorhonen/ProceduralNFTanks/releases)\n\nLicense: GNU GPL V2.
