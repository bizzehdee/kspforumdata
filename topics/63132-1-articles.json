I follow a beta course at school (math physics chemistry etc.) so I choose the subject of rocket engines. I have come up with a couple of points I am going to research:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does a rocket work? (sec, focusing on the principles of rocket engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the different fuels used? (liquid, solid etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent nozzle shapes \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efuture projects (non-scientific, but looking at the (near)future of spaceflight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif anyone has good source material (scientific please) on these that would be awesome but what the reason that I write this post is for the following part of the essay. To take all the things we have learned and apply it to a real life example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to take an existing launch and analyze it focusing on the engines and fuels used. Basically looking at the rocket ascent into space analyze why it is using a certain engine with a certain fuel, and why on the next stage this is completely different. The only problem is that I am pretty new to the subject and I do not know a lot about rockets and launches. So can anyone recommend an interesting existing launch that has a lot of different engines and fuels uses for reasons I discus earlier in the essay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T22:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tembaco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:39:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWikipedia is a pretty good source for such things actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe principle of a rocket engine is rather simple: Take a propellant, and accelerate it. Ion engines use Xenon, Caesium or Argon, ionise it, and accelerate it using electromagnetism/electrostatics. Liquid fuel rockets combine fuel and oxidizer, burn them, and use the nozzle to direct the resulting hot gas out the nozzle. Thermal rockets work similarly, but they heat the propellant without combustion. Nuclear thermal rockets (would) for instance use a nuclear reactor of some shape or form to heat typically hydrogen or water. Rocket engines are a rather diverse category.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T23:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell there are quite a few interesting historical rockets that used different configurations for different stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe classical example would be the Saturn V. It had 3 main stages, a service module and a 2 stage lander and it used 3 different fuel mixtures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage used RP-1 (Highly refined Kerosene) as fuel with Liquid Oxygen as oxidizer. This is essentially the baseline fuel mixture for launch stages because it has a pretty good density and packs a lot of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the second and the 3th stage used Liquid Hydrogen with Liquid Oxygen. This mixture is highly efficient (very high specific impulse) but it is also very light. So this means that you need very big tanks to carry any significant amount of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe service module and lander used Aerozine 50 with Nitrogen Tetraoxide as oxidizer. This is because those 2 fuels spontaneously ignite when you mix them, that way your engines become more reliable (Don\u0027t want an ignition failure trying to escape the lunar surface...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a good book on the history on rocket fuels (and the crazy kerbal style shenanigans they ran into along the way) I can recommend \u003Ca href=\u0022http://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIgnition!\u003C/a\u003E It has gems such as this section on Chlorine trifluoride (a possible oxidizer):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EChlorine trifluoride, ClF\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, or, \u0022CTF\u0022 as the engineers insist on calling it, is a colorless gas, a greenish liquid, or a white solid.

It also has a nice fat density, about 1.81 at room temperature.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also quite probably the most vigorous fluorinating agent in existence - much more vigorous than fluorine itself. Gaseous fluorine, of course, is much more dilute than the liquid ClF\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, and liquid fluorine is so cold that its activity is very much reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this sounds fairly academic and innocuous, but when it is translated into the problem of handling the stuff, the results are horrendous. It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that\u0027s the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hyperbolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water - with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals - steel, copper, aluminum, etc - because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m less versed in the area of rocket engines themselves. But the main difference between lower stage and orbital engines is efficiency - thrust balance. For a lower stage engine thrust is way more important than efficiency. A 10 minute rocket launch with an ISP of 300 takes more fuel than a 5 minute rocket launch with an ISP of 200. Upper stages don\u0027t care how long they have to burn, so much more focus is placed on efficiency there. This means large bell nozzles to optimize the gas flow and usually pretty low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
