The ability to fix anything damaged on the outside of the spacecraft should be an option. I think the if a takeoff is too violent the panels should \u0022malfunction\u0022 and you need to manually open them/ repair them.

I landed a rover on Duna, and as I drove it toward the lander the crew came down in, it ran out of electrical power. When it finally came to a stop, I thought \u0022ok, maybe I can walk a Kerbal over and manually extend the panel\u0022 since the rover didn\u0027t have the power to do it on its own.
