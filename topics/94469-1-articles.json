I had Xamarin studio in the past but when I installed Unity 4.6 I think it replaced it since I started getting MonoDevelop instead. Xamarin works fine with Unity?

I was thinking how nice it would be if I could just work in Sublime Text. I love Sublime and hands down it is the best code editor I have ever used, but generally I use it for things like Python, or Javascript, not compiled languages. I\u0027m thinking, well I \u003Cstrong\u003Ecould\u003C/strong\u003E just edit in Sublime then run MonoDevelop to compile, but that is a pain. Decided to do some searching and lo and behold, you can build an existing MonoDevelop solution from the command line! So now one simple configured build setting in Sublime, and I can now work completely inside Sublime Text!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me throw out some links for anyone else who may want to go this route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Using_Sublime_Text_as_a_script_editor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Using_Sublime_Text_as_a_script_editor\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8480157/building-and-running-monodevelop-solution-in-os-x-terminal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8480157/building-and-running-monodevelop-solution-in-os-x-terminal\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have ever used Sublime Text then you know how awesome and FAST it is at writing code, so enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PoorYorick","CreatedById":116759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T05:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EXamarin doesn\u0027t have any problems with unity, you just need to point it at the Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll in the KSP.app bundle.

I see it now. I\u0027ll stick with Sublime for now and see how that workflows works. If it works, then it is awesome. If I have issues, or if I need to make more project level changes that I need an IDE to do I will definitely try using Xamarin. I do recall it being pretty good int he past.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
