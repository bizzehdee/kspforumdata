I have played this game hundreds of hours and I know there will be plenty more of hours I will play in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, this game got released quite time ago. 99% of the people who are interested in the game have bought this game. Nevertheless Squad is still developing the game and adding new content aswell as improving the code and the game mechanics. And I love Squad for doing this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that Squad keeps developing and polishing the game also in the future. And here comes in what worries me. Squad dont earn much money now cause the majority of players allready bought the game, so the development must stop sooner or later, and I am afraid that it is sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I write this post to ask Squad for something like a DLC or Addon or Standalone-Addon. Something I can pay for and throw my money at Squad (I dont like to donate, I want to Invest).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made many thoughts what can be done or released which won\u0027t upset or split the community and the loyal fans of this game. So it came to my mind that there is kinda big fanbase for the SuperRealism mods. Mods which change the Solar System to our real one, change sizes of planets, distances; isp, trust, size and weight of parts to real Human Earth parameter for example. So maybe Squad can releas a Full Realism (as far it is possible with the engine) overhaul Version of the game. Me, and I guess many of the players would like to buy such a game. So Squad would get some money, and imho they deserve it after this long time of developing and good work. On the other hand this kind of release won\u0027t upset the owners of the normal KSP, cause they wont miss anything in the game which stays the way they love it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI write all this cause money is neccessary for any future devlopment of the game. And I don\u0027t want that this development ends for as long as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am interested in commands and thoughts of the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T12:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDLC\u0027s already planned to be added at some stage.

After that, they can always add little free expansions to keep everybody excited, consisting of maybe a handful of new parts or some easter eggs.

Developing KSP wasn\u0027t initially thought to be the company\u0027s future, but I imagine it helped a lot - probably to the point of no longer having to do the marketing stuff. Though admittedly I know nothing about what Squad is doing beyond publishing the game. They must have other employees, doing other things outside of KSP\u0027s team, but I couldn\u0027t tell you what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/1/27/5338438/kerbal-space-program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.polygon.com/features/2014/1/27/5338438/kerbal-space-program\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022[Marketing] was never our passion,\u0022 says Ezequiel Ayarza, the other cofounder of Squad. \u0022Not ever.\u0022 (...)\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ever since the beginning of the company,\u0022 he says, \u0022it was always us trying to find new, exciting things for our clients.
