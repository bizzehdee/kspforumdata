Or at least to the part that the antenna is attached to. Therefore a good way to speed up your transmissions is to make sure the antenna is attached directly to a battery, so you have a nice buffer ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is great advice! But I still have a slight issue. Right now the only battery I have available that an antenna can be attached to is the small, circular battery which stores, IIRC, 100 charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also unlocked the surface-mounted 400 charge battery, but no parts can be attached to this, so I can\u0027t attach an antenna directly to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this leaves me with a question: Is there any way to optimize the speed of the automatic electricity transfer? For example, is it better to have the large batteries closer to the antenna in the part tree? Or does it work like the manual fuel transfer, where the transfer rate is the same no matter how far apart the parts are in the part tree?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T15:15:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T15:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have never ran into such an issue.

From what I can tell, the lack of power comes from the pod draining first, then being refilled from external battery capacity. If you watch the pod power directly you can see it being depleted rapidly to zero even though you have plenty of total electricity on the whole ship. I actually started using the TAC Fuel Balancer mod configured to transfer electricity into the pod, since it seems to do it at a faster rate than the default game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly certain my antennas are usually connected directly to the pod, so the question of connecting to a battery remains, but I suspect it won\u0027t matter. Many of the science/transmit mechanics are tied to the pod. I also don\u0027t know how multiple pods would behave, since I usually just use one.
