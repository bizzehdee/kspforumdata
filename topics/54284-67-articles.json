My experience so far is that the energy supply is not really an issue and due to the fact that construction usually takes multiple days effects like eclipses don\u0027t have much of an influence. Given the fact that I need to put smart Kerbals in my construction craft I think it is save to assume the guys ensure that the vessel is kept oriented to the sun such that the solar arrays produce at least 90% of their nominal power on average. (Ok we are in role-playing terrain now given that unfocused craft don\u0027t rotate on their own, but who cares) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my proposal is to allow background construction.
