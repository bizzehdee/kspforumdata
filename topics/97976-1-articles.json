(i.e.: keeping a log of all control inputs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Add a new requirement for flights. You would have a pull-down for each launch where you assign it to a contract, or a destination (if you leave blank it doesn\u0027t record). This links the mission recording log to a certain mission (say \u0022explore the Mun\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The game then sets up a rival space program that is \u0022AI.\u0022 This is easy, because once in orbit, everything is on rails, anyway. Your game would pop on the net, and \u0022borrow\u0022 a flight from another person\u0027s game to populate these \u0022AI\u0022 missions. The game would have to record executed maneuvers, etc, so that when loaded into your game, they would simply repeat exactly what they did in their game. So at day XXX, year 1, another player at the other launch site sent a munar probe to land. Your game happens to borrow that (it goes out looking for craft assigned to \u0022explore the mun,\u0022 and picked that randomly), and if you happened to be in orbit above their site, you\u0027d see the rocket launch, and you could track its progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
