My starting point is the cupola with the science center next. I then connect an I-beam (200) to the science just below the side hatch. But then I\u0027m unable to connect a hitchhiker module to the end of the i-beam. What gives? I did manage to connect a mk-2 fuel tank. Similarly, I can\u0027t attach a fuel tank onto the BZ-52 radial attachment point in an intelligent manner. It never wants to snap onto the connection point, rather it attempts to attach the tank sideways.
