It is suppose to be launch by Proton, which is famous for delivering Salyut, Mir parts, and quite a lot of Commercial cargos to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is that while the Shuttle is easily made and launched on that Ariane V clone, trying to make a Proton seems impossible without going with Vector engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first stage is pretty much 6 \u0022side\u0022 tanks, each with an engine, radial attached and autostruct to the central tank. So far I have tried making one with 1.25m parts, 2.5m parts;\u00A0a mix of them; Gave up on 1.25m parts (and thus no more T-30) and gone using Mainsail or Skipper; Removing all fuels from the center \u0022tank\u0022... It refuse to reach orbit.\u00A0And this thing is suppose to be able to launch the Salyut and Mir!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid the Russkies discovered some secret sauce that made it so powerful? Must I go with Vector engine? The idea is that I can use something that is cheaper or having lower tech requirement than the Kerbodyne parts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T23:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re making a full sized Proton, the mainsail engine has basically the same specs as the RD-253 first stage engine.
