Then you can set up colonies with friends, and blow up enemy ships. It would be great for videos, even on a small scale (LAN networks) and would make the game 5 times more awesome! One problem though. there is one aspect of the game that you can\u0027t really play without. An aspect that cant work in a multiplayer environment. It is the time warps. They let you fast forward through the year long journeys the kerbanoughts make. It is essential for the game and prevents multiplayer from existing. I opened this thread to discus possible solutions. I hope to get some good ideas from this. if we get a good one, we can tell the Squad about it. I\u0027m sure they want it as much as we do. Please tell me anything you got. I\u0027m all ears.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T22:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Solutions have already been discussed to death and no viable Solution has been found.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T22:12:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/17168-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/17168-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T22:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, so, your new. welcome to KSP, and the Forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplease give the \u0022how to post\u0022 threads a read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might want to search the forums for the word Multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere are two links, this is as good as it gets for multiplayer in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26514-Hawkinator-s-almost-multiplayer-pass-along-the-save-file-challenge-thingy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26514-Hawkinator-s-almost-multiplayer-pass-along-the-save-file-challenge-thingy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24926-0-19-Kerbal-LiveFeed-Passive-Multiplayer-Plugin-Client-Server-v0-6-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24926-0-19-Kerbal-LiveFeed-Passive-Multiplayer-Plugin-Client-Server-v0-6-2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
