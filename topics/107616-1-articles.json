Every part would have some amount of it and it would be consumed during time. Activities would increase consumption significantly, because it should be possible to make probes with age of several decades (Outer Planets Mod). If level went too low (for example 30-50 %) the part would start to lose its performance (thrust, resource production/conversion, strength, etc.) and eventually break. You could get maintenance stuff tanks from KSC and use engineers to maintain ships. For example, a service ship with an engineer and maintenance resource tank could dock to the station and move maintenance stuff from the service ship to station parts. Of course the maintenance resource would be heavy and expensive. Only engineer astronauts could do maintenance and more experienced ones would give a resource bonus. Engineer on board could also decrease the consumption of maintenance stuff in every part of the ship. That would be relatively easy to implement to game and manage by players. It could very well be a mod like life support mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lorunification\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lorunification\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can get alone ~300 Science from the KSC by visiting all KSC Biomes as soon as you get the first wheels and the jet engine.
