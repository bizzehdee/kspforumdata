It seemed to about double the science points. Or can I use same samples again?\n\nThis kind of slow action would work better if time were a real resource in the game. In my opinion it would be very interesting to have month or year long experiments. But there should be maintenance costs of everything so that you would have to calculate if something is productive or not.\n\nThere are some mods which give such an elements. Kerbal Construction time, life support mods etc. I combine it with some roleplay, for example crew circulation. But there could be more time dependent costs in game. \n\nI suggest that wearing, maintenance work, tools, spare parts, expendable chemicals, and everything would be modeled by one maintenance resource. Every part would have some amount of it and it would be consumed during time. Activities would increase consumption significantly, because it should be possible to make probes with age of several decades (Outer Planets Mod). If level went too low (for example 30-50 %) the part would start to lose its performance (thrust, resource production/conversion, strength, etc.) and eventually break. You could get maintenance stuff tanks from KSC and use engineers to maintain ships. For example, a service ship with an engineer and maintenance resource tank could dock to the station and move maintenance stuff from the service ship to station parts. Of course the maintenance resource would be heavy and expensive. Only engineer astronauts could do maintenance and more experienced ones would give a resource bonus. Engineer on board could also decrease the consumption of maintenance stuff in every part of the ship. That would be relatively easy to implement to game and manage by players. It could very well be a mod like life support mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:06:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can get alone ~300 Science from the KSC by visiting all KSC Biomes as soon as you get the first wheels and the jet engine.

Some fixed solar panels (or you won\u0027t go very far). To go faster, add some tiny reaction wheels. Fill a scientist and any other kerbal, then ROLL !

Science is early-mid game when you unlock. But after that, it more a collection.
