I have it rigged so the bottom orange tank drains first, then to top. This keeps the weight in the front of the ship the entire flight and helps counteract the offset thrust from the skipper. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull throttle off the pad. Launch is the new standard, turn a few degrees right of the pad and it almost flies itself to space. Usually just minimal input is needed to keep it on course. The SRBs stage ~8km. From there its a gentle turn and climb to space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets a little unstable as the last of the fuel drains out of the orange tank and it isn\u0027t heavy enough to help keep the nose down. The last ~500 units of fuel in the orange tank the ship wants to pitch up. I put a vernor to help out that last bit, but its the only time you need it (along with some light throttling). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2.9k dV is enough to get to minmus, mun, or anywhere else in Kerbin\u0027s SOI and return.
