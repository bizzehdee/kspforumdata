I know you can get both of these things in mods, (In fact I\u0027m running a mod that gives me planetary base parts) but I think they should add a life support system and base parts to make them stock. One because it would add so much more to the game, two because I know for some people mods can slow their game down, and I think something like this should be in the game anyway. Plus as I found out with an earlier idea, that the game developers try to keep the game realistic (Which I totally understand) and this would not really be detracting from the realism of the game, in fact a life support system would make it more realistic (if people new to the game found having to add a life support system to their ships to hard for them the game developers could make the life support system an option when a person is creating a new game) Any comments? \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noud","CreatedById":176567,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-23T10:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni agree some form of life support should be stock.. but i think it more for balancing reasons. the life support mod i used are great but the only thing is that they can become extremely messy in combination with other mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif there was 1 stock life support system it would make it a lot more manageable in\u00A0my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut i think squats focus should be more on a complete career overhaul as the core game is great but the career mode is seriously lacking\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-23T20:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always thought of colonization as a good overarching goal for a KSP playthrough.

In such a case, the logistics of resupply become missions you don;t have to fly. If one has a mishap, then it should not just reduce the funds by the lost craft cost, it should require some R\u0026amp;D time for return to flight (which would remove that failure mode, or reduce it). Regardless, the flights are autonomous, and failures (if any) are management problems to solve---fly immediately, and have a chance of another failure, or do something else. You get the idea, it can all be solved by good game design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-26T07:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223102368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498394071\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146422\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022322997am\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, 322997am said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t want the devs to waste their time with things like this when there is an amazing mod called K\u0026amp;K kolonization system, which does colony stuff very well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK\u0026amp;K kolonization?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoogle can\u0027t find it, brings up MKS which is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E which in my mind should be considered basically stock anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-26T12:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223103206\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498462601\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mattinoz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, mattinoz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK\u0026amp;K kolonization?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoogle can\u0027t find it, brings up MKS which is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E which in my mind should be considered basically stock anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I meant usi, cause I had the mod installed and I thought it was a separate mod.

Rinse and repeat for various planetary bodies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy dream KSP game is somewhat of a mix between what we have now and Civ V playstyle where you can create different \u0022units\u0022 to do the mundane stuff for you. Just imagine starting a KSP game as it is now and doing all these things yourself, and then unlocking the ability to tell other \u0022Kerbal Krews\u0022 to continue doing the mining or the refining or the science on a particular planetary base so that you (the player) can remain at the forefront of discovery and keep building rockets that use cleaner fuels, hotter fuels, more efficient fuels, stronger structural bodies, heat resistant bodies (bye bye heat sheilds) etc etc.\u003C/strong\u003E And it doesn\u0027t have to be just technological gains either. You could have funding play a part as well: Company A will give you a science boost if you establish a radio communication relay in orbit/on the surface. Company B will give you 20 prospective astronaughts that you don\u0027t have to hire (and pay for) if you build a base on planet whatever.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe bottom line is that as long as planets remain barren wastelands, the only reason to ever go there is merely just to say that you\u0027ve been there. If we put the keys to better tech on those planets in the form of mine-able resources and monies we wouldn\u0027t normally have access to, we give players a reason to go there.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-26T20:27:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2017 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Greenfire32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Equoted wrong person, formatting, general user error (I\u0026#039;m an idiot)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirgoodman","CreatedById":178276,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-26T21:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if they don\u0027t add an LS an assortment of base parts would give the game so much more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
