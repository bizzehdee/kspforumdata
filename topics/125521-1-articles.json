For steam KSP users, it is a long process to implement mods into the game. You have to sift through stacks of folders and files just to get to the KSP directory. If we had Workshop support, it would make the process quicker and easier and would supply greater support for the craft-sharing and modding community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T13:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI invite you to read \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a lot of people playing KSP do not use Steam, but rather bought it from the KSP website itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T14:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor steam KSP users, it is a long process to implement mods into the game.
