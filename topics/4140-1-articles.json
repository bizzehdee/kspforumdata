It\\\u0027s nearly bulletproof (nearly, as in, this time (when else?) I managed to crash land and my rocket took off by itself... but it should still serve the purpose), and it should allow ANYONE to do a successful Mun flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst: Orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot72 is about where I start banking towards 90 degrees. The general idea is to achieve an orbit around 80,000 meters, so bank whenever YOUR rocket needs to, to achieve that orbit. Screenshot75 shows such an orbit, with a Perigee of 79,000 and an apogee of about 86,000. Anything will do, as long as Perigee is above 70,000 meters, you didn\\\u0027t use too much fuel and apogee/perigee are not too far apart. Preferably, the perigee is about where the rocket is in screenshot76. This is the point where we will initiate the TMI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin -\u0026gt; Mun\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, the best moment for a TMI is when you look at the overview map, put the Mun at about 30\u00C2\u00B0 to the right of the y axis, and when your rocket now crosses below Kerbin. As seen in Screenshot76. This is the moment to apply full throttle towards the direction indicator. Depending on your orbit, the position of your apogee/perigee and your orbital speed, you usually end up with a speed of 3000 to 3200 m/s. In the end, your orbit should look like Screenshot79.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoon insertion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\\\u0027re close enough to the Mun, your orbit indicator will turn into something like in Screenshot80. When you reach the perigee, push full throttle against the direction indicator until you end up in an orbit around the Mun. Try to push the former perigee down to about 40,000 meters, turning that initial perigee into an apogee. Like in screenshot83.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChoice of landing site\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to land inside one of the craters, and you want to land in a crater on the lit side of the Mun. Now, the Mun rotates towards the right, meaning areas at the right of the Mun will get dark while areas on the left of the Mun will become lit. It takes a few hours, but you\\\u0027ll be flying a few hours. So try to aim for a crater at the left side of the lit Mun, or at least one that\\\u0027s around the center of the lit area. You might have to incline your orbit, like I did in screenshot86. You want to avoid an oversight I made: The Mun rotates. So aim for the right edge of your target area because your orbit will move towards the left (actually, the Mun moves...). The more inclined your orbit is, the more you have to compensate for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescent\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour next goal is to push the perigee towards your landing point. This can be accomplished by orbiting past the \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E of your landing point (i.e. past the point 180 degrees opposite of your landing site) and thrust. Your goal is to either reach a low perigee (like I did in screenshot89) or a flight path that ends at the far end of your target crater (i.e. you\\\u0027d crash into the wall exiting the crater if you didn\\\u0027t land). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDe-orbit burn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach the edge of your crater, or when you think you\\\u0027re about to reach an area where you want to land, it\\\u0027s time to stop. Turn your rocket away from the flight path marker on the artificial horizon and thrust. Full throttle. Your goal is to have that direction marker end up either on top of your horizon or bottom, as I have achieved in screenshot93. And keep it there! Note: If you\\\u0027re \u0027falling\u0027, i.e. if you see the crossed out marker, aiming your rocket \u003Cem\u003Etowards\u003C/em\u003E the marker and applying thrust centers you. If you\\\u0027re climbing, aiming your rocket \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from the marker accomplishes that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELanding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is a critical moment. It\\\u0027s easiest done by having an ASAS in your rocket and a belt of 4 or even 6 RCS thrusters. Then you simply turn SAS and RCS on and just try to keep the rocket coming down smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiftoff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso fairly easy. Apply thrust and take off. Try to head quickly towards 90 degrees and try to not waste too much fuel on climbing, just past about 700 meters once you reach the edge of your crater will do. Try to keep your orbit as circular as possible, since you do NOT want to have an apogee that points far away from Kerbin, that\\\u0027s energy you have to compensate. Try to have your apogee pointing towards Kerbin, more or less, but your best bet is still a fairly circular orbit. If your apogee \u0027runs away\u0027 from you, just stop thrusting until you reach it again and keep getting faster. Not higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETKI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time to push the throttle up and head back to Kerbin is when you have circled the Mun almost once, when you cross that line that represents the Mun\\\u0027s orbit around Kerbin. Thrust towards Kerbin when it rises over the horizon (give or take, timing ain\\\u0027t critical here), the red \u0027home\u0027 marker makes a good direction finder. You want to push your speed to about 700-750m/s. Note that you don\\\u0027t have to push it so far that you actually \u0027hit\u0027 Kerbin with the escape path you will get to, the path I get in Screenshot99 is plenty. The reason for this is that Kerbin moves towards the left, relative to the Mun, since the Mun moves towards the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEstablishing Kerbin orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might fall into a stable Kerbin orbit, or you might end up with some abomination like I did in screenshot100. That flight pattern would have led back to Kerbin, but also to a VERY hard descent. To soften that up, I increased speed until a Perigee appeared and I pushed that Perigee past 70,000 meters. A bit more wouldn\\\u0027t hurt, since we\\\u0027ll have to slow down considerably at that height to get our apogee down from beyond the munar orbit. Your goal in your first revolution around Kerbin is to get into a stable orbit that doesn\\\u0027t suddenly make you end up in a Kerbol orbit, i.e. get that perigee to above 80,000 meters and that apogee as low as time and fuel permits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChoosing a landing site\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you reaced an apogee/perigee pair like in screenshot103, it\\\u0027s time to find a landing site. In that screenshot, that huge sea area we fly over would make a great landing spot. Generally, you do not want to end up on land. More than one great flight I did went down the drain by hitting the ground too hard, hitting a rocky area and having my capsule crash after sliding down some mountains... very frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHitting water isn\\\u0027t as easy as it first sounds, though. Kerbin rotates. Towards the right. Meaning, your orbit, your perigee, your apogee, they all move towards the left over time. If you have a highly inclined orbit, you again have to take into account that you will not fly over the same area you fly over now in your next revolution. In other words, if you choose a landing site, note that you will end up some miles to the left of it when you eventually touch the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EComing back down\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the rest is fairly straightforward. At apogee, push against your flight direction, lower your perigee past 25,000 meters and you\\\u0027ll come down. Note again, you WILL end up considerably left of your perigee, depending on your apogee and hence speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-25T15:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMunar landing is only an ordinary pastime for you, but a brick-shattering maneuver for me... ???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-28T18:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat seems to be the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-29T01:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKilling horizontal velocity.
