Sometimes I\u0027ve gone heavy with mod parts, other times I\u0027ve focused on mission planning with life support and RemoteTech, and recently, I went stock with just helper plugins.

Thing is, they only operate well once you are out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImho, using mods should be on a \u0022need to\u0022 basis. As in: you do stock until you realize something important is missing from your game. THEN you add a mod that does exactly what you lack in stock game. After that, if you feel some other aspect is missing, then you install another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really calculate stuff before the launch. I DO however put on a MechJeb and watch the TWR while I am building stages in the VAB. That helps a lot, prevents me from building underpowered stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate motorsports (I value my limbs more than the adrenaline high), but I do like simulators (I value my adrenaline high more than the time I spend in front of the screen hehe). I also dab in 3D modeling every now and then (mostly when work calls for that - I do graphics, and sometimes it needs a bit of 3D in it).
