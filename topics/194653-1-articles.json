You can trim the control surfaces to reset to a non-zero position without any input, and this is a far more effective way to stabilize an aircraft. Keep in mind that airspeed and altitude will change the lift and drag characteristics of the aircraft, and you will need to adjust trim accordingly. For a center-line single propeller aircraft, trimming roll against the torque from the engine is what you want to do, but you\u0027ll have to re-trim frequently as airspeed increases and your controls become more effective, or if you change the torque output of the engine. If it feels like your controls aren\u0027t enough to counteract the engine torque, there\u0027s a simple solution and that is...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223801724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591978234\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258281\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022betaking\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, betaking said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can manage aircraft, typically I turn the engine-size/power-down quite a bit and\u003Cstrong\u003E never use full-engine torque\u003C/strong\u003E.(typically I keep the torque-limits for say a light biplane somewhere around 35-40 in value, with the engine \u0022size/power\u0022 at something like 10-15).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very important when constructing propeller aircraft - the R121 can produce an incredible amount of torque - an incredible amount that you will never need to utilize for any propeller-driven aircraft.
