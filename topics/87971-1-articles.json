It has looked into Kethane, but is too busy with contracts to make any progress in the area. So, PLB-I has decided to challenge the community to profit off of missions, economically, without the use of contracts. This would need to be done with mods, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea is that, using either Kethane or Karbonite, you set up mining operations on the Mun, refine the Hydro-karbon substance into some resource (Like Fuel), and recover a craft with that resource near KSC. You don\u0027t need to use these mods, but the mods you do use can\u0027t be very over-powered, and must be found on the forums, and listed. (You don\u0027t technically need to use mods, but without them, you can\u0027t really make money from missions alone.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou may only use mods which aren\u0027t overpowered, and are found on the forums.
