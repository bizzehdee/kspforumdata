But it kept running into some invisible something that flipped it. Not a single invisible object, more like an invisible wall. Probably where one bock of terrain ended and the next block began, since I tried going some different ways but always flipped over when I finally turned and started going back in the original direction I wanted to go, far away horizontally from the earlier flips.

(The same is true of space stations, unmanned probes, and so on... if you\u0027re not using mods, you\u0027re going to be VERY limited in what you build.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most obvious mods for this discussion are Kethane and Karbonite; add resource generation through drilling and refining, and you\u0027ll want a mobile platform to do this. These rovers can refuel anything that lands even remotely near them, which makes things a LOT easier than a static base. You won\u0027t often be traveling to other biomes with this sort of design, but you\u0027ll still need them to be able to drive to wherever your nearby landed/crashed ships are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to toot my own horn, but here are a couple of my own designs from 0.25 that illustrate some of these issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/70OpYtL.png\u0022 alt=\u002270OpYtL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smaller design in front is the Iguana, a 30-ton rover with eight wheels. Due to its height (necessitated by the 2.5m kethane tanks) it was unfortunately unstable at high speeds, so I\u0027m redesigning it now that I\u0027ve switched from Kethane to Karbonite to be a much flatter design. You can\u0027t really see in that shot, but the rover has VTOL rocket engines (originally on the sides, which I\u0027ve had to use several times when the rover hit a bump and started to tumble. It\u0027s a fast design, easily going 50m/s on flat terrain, but since the wheels are stock there\u0027s no cruise control and the tires had a tendency to rip at even the slightest bump. Still, it was a great design for refueling or emergency recovery, along with any \u0022plant flag\u0022 missions I wanted to do before I had a real base in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design in back is Mun Unit Zappa, my 600-ton mobile base. While it\u0027s designed along the same basic principle (cylindrical body with rows of wheels along the lower sides), it was far more stable in practice and so didn\u0027t need any kind of vertical engines. It uses 22 caterpillar tracks (from a mod, obviously); its top speed is only ~11m/s, but those tracks DO include a cruise control, so it can maintain that speed pretty much indefinitely and eight of the tracks (four each at the front and back) are raised a bit so it can even handle slope transitions without problems. Plus, the tracks don\u0027t break like rover wheels do, so you didn\u0027t even need to pay much attention to it. Like the smaller Iguana, the Zappa included Kethane drills (albeit much larger ones) and all the power generation and such necessary for a refinery, and the two were designed to connect to each other (with the Iguana pulling under the front of the Zappa to link up with the docking ports there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of its sheer mass and the characteristics of the tracks, stability wasn\u0027t really an issue. Braking, on the other hand... not only was it slow to accelerate and brake, but turning was really iffy unless you were either at top speed (where it\u0027d just stop driving the wheels on one side) or at rest (where it could pivot by reversing the drive on one side). There wasn\u0027t much in between, and that\u0027s a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to the original discussion: it\u0027d be nice if the stock rover wheels included all the extra bits that mods have added (adjustable suspensions, cruise control, intelligent throttles, etc.). And it\u0027d be nice if things like braking were handled more intelligently by the game engine, with the equivalent of ABS being standard on all wheels. We had the same complaints about SAS, with it needing a more intelligent algorithm than just \u0022I want to rotate that direction\u0022, and we got it in a recent version, so why not expect something similar for wheels in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, a lot of the headaches we have can be avoided with just a bit of intelligent design, even without a change in the code. It took me a while to realize that I could disable the brakes on certain wheels/gears, which was a tremendous improvement in general, but even the defaults work well if your designs are done well. I mean, look at that Iguana design above; the wheel base just isn\u0027t nearly wide enough for a design of that height and mass, and I knew it, but it took a complete invalidation of the existing design (the 0.25-\u0026gt;0.90 transition) to make me fix the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T17:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour rovers suck?

Having taken the autopilot offline to let the rover free-wheel, and now past the speed where passive braking (holding down the reverse key) has any effect, the driver has no choice but to take heading control offline as well (as even touching the steering at this point will surely flip them*) and pray that stability control keeps the rover upright. This it does, and after a wild ride of \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E five klicks - with a maximum speed of 40.6 m/s, perilously close to wheel failure - a convenient hill finally slows them down and ends the excitement without having to resort to a quickload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* and may have; memory is fuzzy after all that white-knuckled excitement, but I seem to recall a full barrel-roll that ended up with the rover back on its wheels, early on (at a mere 25 m/s or so).
