Shouldn\u0027t the air you\u0027re falling \u0022in\u0022 also fall with you, and accelerate the same way? I know why they would have a speed limit for falling in the video game, but it occurred to me that the air should be able to fall through the portal just the same any other object would fall through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got to thinking as to how the physics of that would work, because:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay we had a cylindrical chamber, with Portal A at the top, the exact diameter of the cylinder, and likewise shaped Portal B at the bottom. The volume of air inside the chamber would gain kinetic energy from falling through the cylinder just as the object falling through the cylinder would, and the only friction would be that of the walls of the cylinder. If the object, and the air, could just continuously accelerate forever (or however long it would take to reach the speed of light constantly accelerating towards the earth at 1g but never getting any closer), would not the earth itself accelerate in the opposite direction of the cylinder and object? A reactionless drive of sorts, as it changes its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I flawed in my gedankenexperiment?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T19:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blue\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blue\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShouldn\u0027t the air you\u0027re falling \u0022in\u0022 also fall with you, and accelerate the same way?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy should it?
