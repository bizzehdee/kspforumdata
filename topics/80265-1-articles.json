Sorry if a topic like this has been made before, but I checked 4 pages back and didn\u0027t see a place to post this specific themed spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m making a replica of the Apollo program missions on my 0.24 career. I\u0027ve simply stayed inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI and finished part-testing contracts to raise funds, collect science, and unlock everything I thought I needed. No space exploration whatsoever. I\u0027d like to share my first rocket payload I intend to send to another celestial body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI modeled it after the Apollo series of Lunar Modules. I also have the Command Module/Service Module but the lander is the interesting part I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bhLkj9m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bhLkj9m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing weighs a lot. I\u0027m going to have to Kerbalize the Saturn V rocket in order to get this thing on the moon, but it will be worth the money. I think...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: A little side note. Before you guys give me too too hard a time since I obviously part clipped; only aesthetic details were part clipped. All of the guts and practical equipment is legit. No 100 fuel tanks inside of each other or any funny business such as that.
