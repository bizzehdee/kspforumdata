What you have to do is find a color, if All you are going after is a monotonous color then you need a program that converts PNG to mbm format. Then you can apply the texture in the config file for the part. This is not the best way to do it, because when game updates are made the file is often broken. The best way to do this is blender a cylinder and you can paint it PNG.

You can do a blind coloration and if it works, then use it if it doesn\u0027t try flipping the png and repeat. Another way of figuring out where the parts are on the grid is to make a numbered grid of 1024 say 9 verticle lines and 9 horizontal lines, Number the first horizontal row of squares 1a, 1b, . . . . . 1j 2nd row 2a. . . .10th row 10 a, . . . .10j.
