Or, alternatively, make two cylinders of the appropriate dimensions in 3ds max, texture them and export them as .mu. Is there a quick and dirty way to do this? And what are the dimensions for the fuel tanks? Diameter is, obviously, 3.75m, but which are the lengths?"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T16:26:27Z","Content":"I believe the .mu file is not what you\u0027re looking for.

What you have to do is find a color, if All you are going after is a monotonous color then you need a program that converts PNG to mbm format. Then you can apply the texture in the config file for the part. This is not the best way to do it, because when game updates are made the file is often broken. The best way to do this is blender a cylinder and you can paint it PNG. If you follow the post I made for blender to KSP it gives step by step instructions of how to go from a basic volume in blender to a part in KSP including the very tricky Unity part.\n\nThe length of the big orange tank is the difference between the Y values\n\n\u003E \n\u003E node\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, 3.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\n\u003E  node\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, -3.75, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 2\n\nIt is thus 7.5 meter tall is the scale is equal to 1. The node attach (side sticky) is \n\n\u003E \n\u003E node\\_attach = 1.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1\n\nDefines the distance along X of the collider mesh from the axis of rotational symmetry as 1.25 meters this is a radius that produces a diameter of 2.5 meters, the scale of the tank.\n\nAs a consequence we can be assured the scale is 1 and the length is 3.75 - -3.75 = 7.5 (approximate, it may be slightly more or less depending on the look the devs wanted for the part when snapped, an example of parts that differ from surface would be the F2 nose cone).\n\nIf you select an older tank such as the 400 or 200, the bottoms of the tank are often two filled circles on the bottom of a 1024 x 1024 grid, where as the sides are on the top half. You can do a blind coloration and if it works, then use it if it doesn\u0027t try flipping the png and repeat. Another way of figuring out where the parts are on the grid is to make a numbered grid of 1024 say 9 verticle lines and 9 horizontal lines, Number the first horizontal row of squares 1a, 1b, . . . . . 1j 2nd row 2a. . . .10th row 10 a, . . . .10j. Then convert and apply the grid and the part will show you were the paints end up."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T00:49:01Z","Content":"Ok, I\u0027m trying to make a tank from scratch.
