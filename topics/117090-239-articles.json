Stock code (and stock-compatible code) expects CelestialBody[0] to always be the Sun (kerbol).  Kopernicus-enabled mods often re-arrange the CelestialBody array/list to put a black hole/other star at the center of the world.  Thus all radiators/solar panels align to whatever the new replacement body is (in your case, \u0027The All\u0027, whatever that is).\n\nEssentially the solution to this needs to come through stock code.  There needs to be a way to specify the current \u0027main solar body\u0027 so that solar panels can look at it, and radiators can look away from it.  Until such a time as this is fixed in stock code there is little that I can do to properly solve the situation (there are some hacky workarounds, but I prefer to not use hacky stuff if at all possible, and even these work-arounds would not fix the problem in setups with multiple stars)."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-13T23:09:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That would appear to be a Kopernicus problem\n\u003E \n\nThis is correct.
