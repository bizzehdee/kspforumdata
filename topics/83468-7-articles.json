I have code that worked under the old addModule.cfg system for making MechJeb attachable but I\u0027m at a loss regarding how I would patch MM to give MechJeb this functionality under the new system.\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to make a new .cfg file somewhere in your GameData directory. I suggest making a MyTweaks folder, where you can store your own .cfg files that are easily moved/backed up. However, once you do that, then you can adapt the old addModule.cfg format to a MM patch by following this example comparison:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E stockPartName = batteryPack\u003Cbr\u003E evaPartPos = (0.0, 0.00, -0.15)\u003Cbr\u003E evaPartDir = (0,0,-1)\u003Cbr\u003E storable = true\u003Cbr\u003E stateless = false\u003Cbr\u003E storedSize = 10\u003Cbr\u003E attachOnPart = True\u003Cbr\u003E attachOnEva = False\u003Cbr\u003E attachOnStatic = False\u003Cbr\u003E attachSendMsgOnly = False\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EGRAB\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E name = KASModuleGrab\u003Cbr\u003E evaPartPos = (0.0, 0.00, -0.15)\u003Cbr\u003E evaPartDir = (0,0,-1)\u003Cbr\u003E storable = true\u003Cbr\u003E stateless = false\u003Cbr\u003E storedSize = 10\u003Cbr\u003E attachOnPart = True\u003Cbr\u003E attachOnEva = False\u003Cbr\u003E attachOnStatic = False\u003Cbr\u003E attachSendMsgOnly = False\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[batteryPack]\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany parts may not have the \u0027stateless = false\u0027 and that\u0027s OK, you can leave it out safely.

In fact, it\u0027s even more than an overhaul, it\u0027s a complete redesign with a lot of new features. To be simple, the goal is to create a inventory system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis step is very important on my roadmap, as a lot of new features coming next will be based upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA prototype is already working, and I must say I\u0027m pretty happy with the result thus far : it\u0027s a lot more user friendly and intuitive than the old system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see below, Bill is working hard to make a good inventory system \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FQnSSCd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FQnSSCd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome exemples of enchancement are :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drag and drop items/parts between storages or from the scene directly (grab)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tooltip and context menu for each items/parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal inventory !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal can carry multiple items/parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can do some action on items from the kerbal inventory (more on that later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Hopefully, adding grab module to each parts will no more be required, as part is no more attached on back and part size is calculated automatically from mesh volume.

KAS will include only the winches, strut and pipes stuff, and KIS will include only the inventory system, the containers and some items. This way, people that only want the inventory system or the winches system will no more be forced to get more than wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think people will be pleased by this change, but I\u0027m waiting your feedback on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T14:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the look of the inventory... i really am gonna have to stop playing on a small monitor though, so much screen estate is needed for all the mods i use! but yes, love it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i think i\u0027ve missed a trick somewhere, i was trying to climb a mountain with a rover and got it stuck. i had a few KAS attachments and things i thought might help me out of this jam. got the winch out walked it out to the max range - attached an anchor. dropped it and tryed to winch the rover to it... no dice, as far as i could make out the winch doesnt have the power to pull my rover uphill \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E i also tried with a ground attachment point, but those seem to be strut useage only not winches... ah well... i resorted to using an ion drive to push me up the hill...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave i missed a trick, is there a nice solution out there i havent found?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are fuel lines \u0022solid\u0022, the behaviour i\u0027ve seen so far suggests they are. personally i think it would make more sense for them to be more like fixed length winch lines (set when you place them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, KAS is one of my more essential mods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E *hugs*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidelasTyren","CreatedById":34141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T15:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve hardly ever posted on these forums, but I had to dig up my login information in order to tell you that the inventory system looks brilliant.
