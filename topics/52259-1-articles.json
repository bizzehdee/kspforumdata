However, when I switched to the probe, all my science stuff fell off... and when I went to check on Bob, his entire craft came apart! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, he\u0027s now orbiting Kerbol and passing Duna. I want to rescue him legitimately, no killing, but I\u0027m at a loss as to how to best do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking a probe with an empty single lander can and plenty of fuel (and ladders), but I need to get an intersection. As Bob has a 19.7B/12.8B orbit around Kerbol, (currently 19.2M, heading towards periapsis, closest Kerbin encounter 22M Km), how should I do this? Just wait it out and move when I see he\u0027s getting close in several hundred days, or can I try something more direct, like a Kerbol-assisted slingshot? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T18:46:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Shrike42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T18:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse a craft like this one, it has enough juice to escape the solar system on a straight shot from Kerban. Just attach a lightweight unmanned pod under the parachute. Use the ion engines to do all of the work after the core engine is depleted.

I suppose that would work. I was sorta-kinda toying with the idea of sending a new mission to duna and picking Bob up on the way, but that really would require a ton more effort and waiting.

I was flying around the moons of Jool with this thing. You ride the air lifter up to about 22,000 meters and then hit the next stage and it will handle the rest, no asparagus needed. Once that main engine runs out, use the ion engines to move the craft the rest of the way. You also use the ion engines for the return journey to Kerban. Once you\u0027re coming in for a landing, use the last liquid fuel engine to slow the craft down to about 20 m/s and then deploy the parachute, just in case. Then touchdown with any speed less than 10 m/s and there you go, Kerbal saved with minimal effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get the craft I posted above in this link, just look for Atlas I: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-vTRL2n8wvzRmtqaWowdnZYTXM\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-vTRL2n8wvzRmtqaWowdnZYTXM\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber 1 on your keyboard deploys both of the solar arrays and I think 2 shuts down the ion engines, if you want to use this craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you want to be sure to aim the Kerbal Space Center along Kerban\u0027s prograde orbit around the sun, that way when you launch, it\u0027s a straight shot out of the Kerban orbit, so you don\u0027t have to get into orbit around Kerban first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T18:51:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
