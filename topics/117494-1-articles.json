That\u0027s why it\u0027s frustrating when I can\u0027t use them without significant rebuilding. If I had it right the first time, I certainly would forget something on the second time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience the system fails about 40 percent of the time. Moving from the SPH to the VAB is especially problematic. I\u0027m guessing that the symmetry rules are enforced differently, and this throws any struts way off. They do not have to be attached to other things to suddenly face the wrong way. Half the struts that supported your undercarriage will suddenly be facing out in space. One workaround is to never use symmetry when strutting, but that\u0027s not an optimal solution when so much of the game depends on symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerging has other issues that go beyond struts. Sometimes only half the craft you are loading as a merge shows up. Sometimes the parts are grossly misaligned.
