I find that advance staging (space bar) glitches and doesn\u0027t respond every so often.

Also, make sure the light at the bottom left is green and not pink because that means you have the staging locked. To fix that, press alt\u002BL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T03:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf its a probe make sure it has at least one type of battery and at least one of those radial solar panels.
