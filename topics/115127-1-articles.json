It used a low energy transfer using the L1 Lagrange point to reduce fuel requirements. While you can\u0027t do that in KSP (yet), this replica can still orbit the moon. It had a short mission, lasting less than an year, but conducted major science before it impacted into the moon. It was part of the Discovery Program of low cost mission less than 450 Million$.\n\nNow you can study the Mun\u0027s gravity with my replica of the twin space probes nicknamed Ebb and Flow. It comes with a few science experiments, weighs 1299 Kg, 60 parts, and a hefty 703 m/s of delta-V. It\u0027s monopropellant powered like the real spacecraft.\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/GRAIL)\n\n ![n8Zpayu.png](http://i.imgur.com/n8Zpayu.png)\n\nThank you for stopping by, and leave some rep if you enjoyed!
