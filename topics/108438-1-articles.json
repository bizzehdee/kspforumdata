The weight gain and the inability to use the standard fuel (LF\u002BOX) made it a \u0022fifth wheel\u0022 ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nTherefore, a BIG request to Squad:\n\n1. Return LV-N to its previous state - reduce its weight and allow the use of other types of fuels.\n\n2. If this isn\u0027t possible, allow the player to choose the type of fuel in the fuel tanks.\n\nI do know that it\u0027s possible to do with mods, but a lot of people prefer to play vanilla KSP, or KSP with minimal modifications (like me).\n\nAnd, IMO, the ideal option: add the fuel switcher AND some new interplanetary engines (like the [Atomic Age](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855-1-0-Atomic-Age-Nuclear-Rockets) by PorkJet) in the official version of the game.\n\nP.S. Again, IMHO: the KSP should be *fun,* not a hardcore space simulator - we already have the Orbiter for that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T19:05:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tsinik55**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T18:41:59Z","Content":"I think simulators are fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T18:55:18Z","Content":"Asking Squad to change something is not likely to yield a lot of results...\n\nInstalling mods, however, will."},{"CreatedByName":"tsinik55","CreatedById":143421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:13:12Z","Content":"They *are* fun, but to a certain degree.\n\nIt\u0027s very disappointing that what was easy done in 0.25 and 0.90 is no longer possible.

Basically you should be able to perform a transfer and braking to anywhere in the Kerbol system if you have a big enough heat sink since no normal transfer will take more than @ 3km/s on either end (about the most brutal thing you\u0027ll encounter is Moho braking, so planning for a 3.5km/s burn will cover all your bases).
