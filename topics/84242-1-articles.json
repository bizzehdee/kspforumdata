Do you like spaceplanes? Do you get annoyed by a shifting CoM as you fly?

Build Aid to align dry and wet CoM\u0027s in the hangar and TAC to of course try to maintain that during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that just balancing all tanks is not enough to maintain the CoM and I still need to use TAC to manually push fuel around and feel for the right CoM. It\u0027s kind of messy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy proposal is a fuel balancing mod that actively attempts to maintain a set CoM.
