Used it 2 times without problems. Now I returned to build a base, transfered 2 kerbals and landed, when I noted that I can\u0027t see their faces in the right corner, and can\u0027t EVA. First I thought it was a bug with\u00A0the vessel, but creating a new vessel resulted in the same problem. The bug is with the Mk2 Lander Can.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything indicates that are kerbals in there, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, chatterer, crew leds, etc. When docked to another ship, the \u0022Interior Overlay\u0022 don\u0027t work in the Mk2 Lander Can, only in other pods. Internal view also don\u0027t work, and the Kerbals in there still don\u0027t appear, but I can transfer them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSearching I found out that I can left-click on the door, and then EVA them normally. But I should be worried?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI removed some recently installed mods, created new save, and replaced the folder GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Command\\mk2LanderCan with a fresh one, nothing helps.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecently I pruned some stock parts with Janitor, I fear that I might pruned some texture used in it\u0027s interior. The only command pod I pruned is the Mk3 (the shuttle one), I suspect the lander can uses some texture of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut everything it uses seems to be in it\u0027s folder. Or there is anything outside? Can someone help me with that?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
