I purchased Profiler to play with my wireless Xbox 360 controller and now ALMOST everything works great. I even have it so the pitch up/down, yaw left/right for EVA works with one of the joysticks when I have it in EVA mode. The thing I find impossible is that I can\u0027t figure out how to turn off the camera-gravity well snap \u0027feature\u0027. I just want the Kerbal in EVA mode to go in the direction I want him to go without the program \u0027helping\u0027 me. I\u0027ve lost more Kerbals this way. When I hit \u0027translate forward\u0027 I want him to go forward according to his pov, not spinning off into the abyss, regardless of what direction the camera is facing or what the program decides is a fun direction to send him off in. In other words, I want to control him just like he was a little spaceship, just like the real ones do.

All of these accomplishments are from about a year ago, and recently just bought the game for myself (had been using roommates shared copy on steam).

I did however put some of my newly found knowledge from aforementioned media outlets to use, and just (and I mean JUST) achieved an orbit around kerbin with only a 5km differential!

Minimum recommended launch TWR is 1.2, 1.6-1.7 is \u0027usual\u0027. As you burn fuel your mass decreases but, since the thrust remains the same, the TWR increases.

Together, it\u0027s all a measure of how much you can accelerate, slow down (accelerate in the opposite direction) or go sideways. For Kerbin launch you need ~4,500m/s deltaV and gravity and the atmosphere grab most of it, in space once you\u0027re moving you keep moving because there\u0027s no atmosphere to slow you down. You therefore use deltaV (by burning fuel -\u0026gt; changing \u0027potential\u0027 into \u0027actual\u0027 change in velocity vector) to change where you\u0027re going or how fast you\u0027re going there. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe rocket equation\u003C/a\u003E looks difficult but basically means \u0022the more efficient your engines are and the more fuel they have, the more they can do\u0022, which makes sense :-) Use a spreadsheet or one of the MechJeb, Kerbal Engineer Redux or VOID mods to work it out for you.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIsp is engine \u0022Specific Impulse\u0022 (mathematicians are wierd, so that\u0027s \u0022I\u0022mpulse \u0022specific\u0022 in jargon).

Seriously - in the VAB/SPH when you mouse-over engines their max thrust is shown, so you know that bit. There is an \u0027i\u0027nformation button at the bottom of the screen that will tell you the vehicle mass. (Thrust / Mass) -\u0026gt; TWR; \u0026lt;1 means you\u0027re glued to the ground, =1 means you can hover or maintain vertical speed but that\u0027s all, \u0026gt;1 means you can fly! Minimum recommended launch TWR is 1.2, 1.6-1.7 is \u0027usual\u0027. As you burn fuel your mass decreases but, since the thrust remains the same, the TWR increases. When you jettison stages the whole thing changes so you ideally work all this out for each stage, working backwards from the last (topmost).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDeltaV is \u0027potential change in velocity vector\u0027. \u0027Velocity\u0027 = \u0027speed\u0027, \u0027vector\u0027 = \u0027in a particular direction\u0027. Together, it\u0027s all a measure of how much you can accelerate, slow down (accelerate in the opposite direction) or go sideways. For Kerbin launch you need ~4,500m/s deltaV and gravity and the atmosphere grab most of it, in space once you\u0027re moving you keep moving because there\u0027s no atmosphere to slow you down.
