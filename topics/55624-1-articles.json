I had always gotten the impression that it was a mix with the core team working out of an actual office and additional staff/interns telecommuting in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have to say that telecommuting based teams are a really interesting beast of their own, and can really change rapidly. One project that I\u0027ve been contracting with for QA testing has changed so much that me and the other QA guy are now the most senior members of the project with everyone else having been replaced through natural attrition. People have come and gone, some rather rapidly, but it just ended up that the two lowest guys on the project randomly ended up being the two most experienced guys with the project itself. (Which is great for my bank account.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighly virtual teams are hard things to run well. Very prone to miscommunications, very weird office dynamics, and very low loyalty drive. You\u0027re not seeing people face to face, and don\u0027t build nearly as much attachment with coworkers. This in turn can lead to more slacking and caring less about projects, and rapid ship jumping as people dodge around looking out for themselves and not the company\u0027s welfare. So when there is a fairly high turn over it isn\u0027t really something that is an outright bad sign or suggestion that things are going wrong, but merely the nature of things. It is easier to find people when you can accept applications from all over the world, and it is easier to slip away from a group when you\u0027ve never actually seen someone face to face and therefore don\u0027t have to feel any guilt when they look at you while you\u0027re boxing up your stuff because you\u0027ve changed jobs for an extra dollar an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N3X15","CreatedById":12073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T08:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaxmaps himself, if you must know.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Max told you this, then Max was poorly informed.
