Many good times and snacks were shared by all, but the most important thing was the discovery of a face on Duna!

They did not notice Bob approach them quietly from behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Geez, Jeb, what do you think is on Vall?\u0022, Bill said quietly in almost a whisper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb replied back, trying to be equally quiet but failing in that regard because of his ongoing inability to contain his excitement. \u0022I don\u0027t know, but we need to get some answers out of Bob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob, having heard enough from Bill and Jeb to realize that they didn\u0027t know anything about what was really going on in regards to Vall, put his hands on their shoulders from behind and said loudly, \u0022Bob\u0027s not likely to tell you guys anything!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill and Jeb let out shrill screams from the shock of Bob grabbing their shoulders. They both dropped what they were holding and spun around to see Bob\u0027s glaring, expressionless face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Since you guys aren\u0027t supposed to have those sheets, I\u0027m guessing you found them.

It was a Munar lander that was modified to carry some extra fuel to accomodate Vall\u0027s gravity which was slightly higher than Mun. It was capable of delivering four kerbals down to Vall\u0027s surface and was equipped with enough science to make the trip worthwhile. For Kerbin tests, the main descent engine was replaced with an uprated engine to allow short flight tests around the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Please don\u0027t let me kerb up..\u0022 Ludlong said to himself, but out loud, not realizing his helmet mic was still on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Vall Lander 1, this is mission control.

Wait a minute, he blows up more stuff that anyone so that can\u0027t be it.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong was a little uncomfortable with Jebediah Kerman, test-pilot and hero to all Kerbin, out there watching this simple engine test. Ludlong recalled that if the test looks good when the engine fires, he can take the Vall Lander for a short hop.. as long as he sets it down without breaking it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong started a countdown but got too excited at \u00223\u0022 and hit the staging button in the command pod. Instantly, the engine aboard the Vall lander roared to life! Ludlong burned the engine for five seconds then shut it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whoo hoo! Engine burn test successful, mission control!\u0022 Ludlong exclaimed gleefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Roger that, Vall Lander 1. The report down here says that thrust was sufficient for a short flight if you think you can manage it without crashing. Are you going to fly it around a bit, Ludlong?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I sure am, mission control!\u0022 Ludlong replied enthusiastically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob had taken Ludlong under his wing and had been very kind to him, but ever since becoming a test pilot with the Kerbal Space Center, Ludlong had been looking for acceptance from Jeb and Bill, too. Ludlong wondered if Jeb would be nice enough to fulfill a little fanstasy of his and give him a test-pilot\u0027s \u0027thumbs-up\u0027 from the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong climbed out of the command pod and called down to Jeb who was standing on the pad, \u0022Hey Jeb, how did the engine test look from down there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, a little confused as to why the test seemed to be starting without him, replied to Ludlong who was perched on the ladder outside his command pod, \u0022The engine looked good, but don\u0027t you want an experienced pilot to do the test flight?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No thanks, Jeb! I got it from here. You might want to stand back!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong climbed back into his command pad and announced to mission control that he was about to launch. On the launch pad, Jeb could hear the engine re-pressurizing as Ludlong prepared to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Ludlong, wait up! I want to...\u0022 Jeb yelled towards the Vall Lander as he started to run towards it. A moment later, the engine re-lit and the launch clamps released, and the Vall Lander took to the clear blue sky. With a long, forlorn expression, Jeb watched the lander ascend without him. Without even a glance to see how the craft flew, he turned slowly and began walking back to the kerbalnaut complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA saddened Jeb watches the Vall Lander test depart the launch pad\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jx4eaATl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jx4eaATl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAboard the Vall Lander, Ludlong was grinning from one green ear to the other. The spacecraft was performing flawlessly! He flew it over the research and development building, then out past the tower, then started lining up for a landing. However, when he looked down at the fuel guage, he became a little concerned: he was almost out of fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, mission control, this is Ludlong.

However, until now, he not spoken to anyone. He was addressing the entire workforce at KSC, from Bob the director down to the kerbal who paints the little marks on the side of the Astronaut Complex for every explosion on the launch pad; Kerson had to make an appointment long in advance to talk to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerson was an efficiency expert who was to play a key role in the Vall Space Program. He would have executive control on all design decisions, all pilot assignments, and all mission objectives. He was even going along on the mission to Vall to ensure that everything is carried out with the highest level of efficiency. Jeb and Bill were suspiciously absent from the meeting, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter pacing back and forth several times, with every kerbal\u0027s silent gaze following him in unison, he said quietly, \u0022On Duna, there was...\u0022 his voice raising in pitch and volume, \u0022..considerable..\u0022 then finishing off in a shrill scream, \u0022..WASTE!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe paced back and forth several times agin then resumed in a slow, quiet voice, \u0022I read the crew reports.

Clearly visible were pieces of the fairing, which surrounded the decoupler and protected the ascent avionics package, being ejected in all directions into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the KSC staff looked at the image, various quiet comments could be heard about the new lander and its ability, the new science parts added to it, and the recent loss of the prototype when Ludlong ran it out of fuel and crashed it into the grass outside the VAB. However, more notably, a \u0027gasp\u0027 was heard from the back of the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerson continued, \u0022Look at this lander. It is not efficient! It is massive, has many unneeded parts, probably isn\u0027t stable on anything but a perfectly flat landing site, and its incredibly ugly! This lander must be scrapped and redesigned immediately.

Next slide!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next slide showed the deployment of the Vall Station from its booster stage, again pieces of the protective fairing could be seen floating away from the station after the booster stage was jettisoned. And again, from the back of the room in a dark corner, everyone could hear a loud \u0027gasp\u0027 from an unseen kerbal, followed by a quiet, \u0022Why.. why.. why..\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerson began, \u0022Now, bring your attention to.. who is that back there? Who is interrupting my efficient discussion of inefficiency? Lights!\u0022 As the lights came on, everyone turned to see who was causing the interruption. In the back of the room, one of the junior engineers could be seen holding his head in his hands and shaking his head slowly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Kerson addressed him, the clearly distraught kerbal looked up and replied, \u0022I\u0027m Kessler..

Come on, speak up,\u0022 Kerson said with a harsh glaring stare towards Kessler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKessler stood up and pointed towards the slide image still faintly visible on the screen. \u0022Look at that debris! All those little fairing parts, the decoupler, they\u0027re all still up there in orbit above us right now!

Kerson appeared to turn a slightly lighter shade of green, then spoke, \u0022That would not be efficient.\u0022 After a short pause he regained his normal green color then said quickly and loudly, \u0022Meeting adjurned early!

Kessler, not sure if he was really supposed to follow, shrugged his shoulders and had a confused look on his face as he sat back down. A moment later, Kerson popped his head back into the room and said loudly, \u0022I don\u0027t like to repeat myself! That is not efficient! Kessler, you are in charge of the new debris-free lifter for the Vall Space Program. Let\u0027s go meet with Bob to get the ball rolling.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKessler stood up with a prideful smile and followed Kerson out of the room. The rest of the KSC staff slowly dispersed back to their normal routines, except for the kerbal who was operating the lights and projector; instead, he quietly ducked out the back door without anyone seeing who he was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NUvPGWGl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NUvPGWGl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[Vall Lander Mk.2 Mun Landing Test]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter working furiously hard over the next two days, the Vall Lander Mk.2 was ready for testing. Ludlong was not chosen to test it on the ground. Instead, the lander was launched, untested on the ground, into Kerbin orbit. Unfortunately, the new debris-free lifter was not ready for this launch causing Kessler Kerman to shift uncomfortably in his seat when the lander was deployed in orbit, sending fragments of its launch fairing into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn board the lander was Bob and Ludlong, both experienced pilots, but neither had been in space since returning from their trip to Duna. After the lander was safely in orbit, they both went on EVA to inspect the lander for damage.

When Bob and Ludlong returned, Bob asked a few other senior staff around the KSC if they found anything usual about Kerson Kerman, besides his obsession with efficiency, but no one else felt suspicious about Kerson. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Bob trusted his own ability to sense when things were wrong, and he sensed something very wrong with Kerson.

In every lab and office all the way out to the VAB, cheers and applause rang out in celebration of the biggest undertaking the KSC had ever taken on. The Vall Station, with eight science crew and one pilot and would also serve as the Kerbin return vehicle for the landing teams, would arrive at Jool in 250 days. The dual Vall landers, docked together for the trip out, would arrive 14 days later. Aboard each lander was a crew of five science experts and one pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, one room was not celebrating: the Uncrewed Science Robotics engineering room. Due to a shortage of Kerbal engineers, the robotic components of the Vall mission were not ready for this launch window. The Vall orbiting science crew and landing teams were prepared for this and were happy to wait for the probes to arrive from the next window, but Kerson Kerman, efficiency expert, was furious!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Kerson heard that the landing team and orbiting science team were heading to Vall without their robotic science probes, he called Bob into his office and demanded answers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, Kerson, you know.. it\u0027s the holidays. We didn\u0027t have time to finish the robotic components of the mission. We were thinking that the orbiting team could look around for anything interesting for the landing teams to investigate and then when the probes are ready we would just sent them out on the next window,\u0022 was Bob\u0027s explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The holidays? You think you get holidays?!? Holidays are.. NOT.. EFFICIENT!\u0022 Kerson yelled. \u0022How did we ever make it to Mun?\u0022 Kerson asked rhetorically. \u0022It is a good thing I\u0027m going on this mission. You are going on the mission, too, Bob. You are on the landing team. Bill will pilot the other lander. Jebediah will pilot the Vall Station craft. I will be keeping an eye on you, Bob. You don\u0027t seem very efficient for the Director of the Kerbal Space Center.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, Kerson agreed to let the orbiting team and landing teams head to Vall before the science probes were ready. All the crew members were boarded on their crafts and waited in LKO for the Jool window. After 4 burns arounds LKO to gain advantages from the Oberth effect, both craft were set for an encounter with Jool where they would aerocapture into Vall\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the launch of the Vall station, Jebediah looked rather exhausted like he\u0027d been running around KSC all morning. Bill, who arrived late to the launch of his Vall lander and almost missed it, also looked rather disheveled. Kerson boarded his lander very early and was continually barking orders through the radio all morning right up until launch. He would not be denied his efficient launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bob ascended to LKO he had some time to reflect and noted that he had never seen Kerson talking to Jeb or Bill but instead always gave Jeb\u0027s and Bill\u0027s orders to Bob so he could relay them.

Bob\u0027s theory that Jeb was pretending to be Kerson Kerman had started when Bob noticed that Jeb was absent for every meeting where Kerson was. But, what really made Bob believe this theory was how excited Jeb was when he was handed the mission to fly the Vall Station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vall Station mission would be the first to arrive at Vall and perform high-orbit science around Vall until the landing team arrived. When the landing team was ready, Vall Station would fly to a low Vall orbit after which the landing team would launch from the surface and dock to the station. Vall Station was crewed with 8 science experts, so all Jeb had to do was fly. He didn\u0027t even question his assignment when he heard that Bob and Bill were leading the landing teams. As far as missions go, this was little more than a bus-driver job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile in deep space still some 45 days away from Jool, the landing team vessel and Vall Station were scheduled to perform some deep space communication tests. The Vall station pilot and the lead pilots from both landers were to EVA and fly 1000m from their craft then perform EVA communication tests between each other to make sure a pilot on EVA could still communicate over long distances without the need for a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lander 1, this is Lander 1 pilot Bob. Can you hear me Lander 1.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure thing, Bob!\u0022, replied Ludlong. Ludlong and Bob were inseparable ever since the Duna mission where they spent 174 days together on Duna\u0027s dusty red surface. Bob taught Ludlong to fly and helped Ludlong join the KSC Test Pilot program, and Ludlong helped keep Bob from being too sarcastic and dry-witted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks, Lander 1.

I\u0027m not about efficiency; I\u0027m about going fast and making big explosions! Now that I think of it, that\u0027s probably why I\u0027m not on the landing team...\u0022, replied Jeb, his voice trailing off at the end as he pondered his philosophikal views on \u0027moar boosters\u0027 and \u0027moar struts\u0027, and that maybe less extreme positions on boosters and struts was in order. Luckily, that idea went out of his very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb continued, \u0022Besides, Bob, you should know I\u0027m not Kerson since you hired the guy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What are you talking about?

As flames engulfed the station while passing at a periapsis of 117400km through Jool\u0027s thick green atmosphere, everyone gasped and awed at the thick flames surrounding the delicately assembled spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, know one asked how, it came through on the other side in a near perfect orbit parallel to Vall\u0027s. After several orbits around Jool, Jeb found an encounter window with Vall and the station entered into a steep inclination orbit, allowing for scans of the surface from many angles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems occurred when 14 days later, the landing teams arrived docked together with their interplanetary transport stage. Just as the landing team entered Jool\u0027s SOI, Kerson took control of the spacecraft and raised their aerobraking periapsis. And, because he was the efficiency expert, no one asked what he was doing or why. But, when they came out the other side of Jools atmosphere, their orbit was far too high and was almost into Tylo\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the landers crept up toward their apoapsis, they had a brief encounter with Tylo. During the Tylo encounter, Kerson used a device he brought aboard and furtively pressed keys on the device while peering out his window at Tylo. During this time, no one spoke to him, and he spoke to no one. It was very mysterious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, they were able to bring their orbit back down and a few orbits later descended further into Vall\u0027s orbit for an encounter. As they burned their transfer engines to establish Vall orbit, Bob glared at Kerson. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Kerson\u0027s unneeded and detrimental last minute course correction, they had to burn their engines for far longer than they planned to and their fuel supply was getting low.

What were you thinking?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am the effienciency expert and the commander of this mission. You must not question my actions. That is not efficient!\u0022, replied Kerson without remorse over his near mission-ending mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You may be the commander of this mission, but I am the director of the Kerbal Space Center and if I want to know why you almost caused this landing mission to fail, you\u0027re going to tell me. Now.\u0022, Bob said sternly, although realizing that he had no real recourse if Kerson didn\u0027t respond to his inquiry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerson snorted and clutched furtively at the mysterious device in his pocket that he used when they were near Tylo, but did not respond to Bob\u0027s question. But as Kerson turned his head back towards his window, the small device fell from his pocket. Bob noticed the writing on it: \u0022Scan-o-Tron 2000\u0022. Bob quickly and quietly pushed the device under his seat and decided he would have to have a look at that when they landed, whether Kerson approved or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter performing some last minute checks with the landers, the interplanetary drive stage was ditched. Its tiny amount of remaining fuel burned the stage into a slightly ellilptical orbit, but would remain in orbit around Vall as a permanent reminder of Kerson Kerman\u0027s unexpected and unexplained \u0022mistake\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landers, which had been docked together since just before leaving Kerbin, undocked in low Vall orbit and opened communication with the science team on Vall Station to get their landing coordinates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IsIwsS1l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IsIwsS1l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeographic Survey Vall Landing Team\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lander 1 calling Vall Station.

I\u0027m bored\u0022, replied Jeb slowly, his voice faint and sounding tired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hi Jeb! How\u0027s the Vall Station mission going so far?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong could hear Jeb breathing, but it took almost a minute before Jeb finally responded, \u0022Yeah... it\u0027s alright. We found some weird things on Vall down near the south pole. They are at the same place where that image was taken that was floating around at KSC before we left. Some kind of \u0026lt;yawn\u0026gt; pyramids or something. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m transmitting exact coordinates now. You guys should head down there and have a \u0026lt;yawn\u0026gt; look. You know, Ludlong, I need a nap. Catch you later.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb closed the communication channel and a moment later, Ludlong\u0027s navigation system lit up with the exact coordinates for landing. Aboard the second Vall lander, Bill called up to Vall Station for their landing coordinates. When Jeb didn\u0027t answer after numerous hails, Bill called Lander 1 and asked Ludlong if he was able to reach Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong confirmed that he got the landing site information, but that Jeb mentioned he was going to take a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A nap?\u0022, Bill asked. \u0022Jeb doesn\u0027t take naps. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen Jeb sleep. This can\u0027t be good.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill then used their onboard equipment to select a landing site with a low elevation and a nearby mountain with a high elevation. Without wasting any more time, both landers made their descent burns and commenced the first Kerbal landings on Vall. The Geographic Survey Landing Team was first to land and images of their success were beamed across Kerbin with pride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bob and Ludlong\u0027s lander approached their target, they could see the pyramids that Jeb told Ludlong about. The pattern of the pyramids on the surface reminded Bob of something, but he couldn\u0027t think of what it was. He would have to check the database for something that looked like the pattern the pyramids formed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was also very curious about the device that Kerson had dropped.

The engines were burning with a light thrust to maintain altitude while they approached the landing site, less than 100m from the pyramids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong watched the altitude radar intently while Bob was observing the landing zone from his window. No one spoke as the lander got closer to the pyramids. It was difficult to see the structures with any detail; that would have to wait until morning. But, Bob could see enough detail to make out that there was a ring of rectangular blocks that surrounded the five pyramids, and not all the pyramids were the same size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shape, a circle with a bisecting line, was a pattern he saw.. recently.. just before they boarded. \u0022What was it?!\u0022 he thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust then, Kerson looked at Bob and asked, \u0022What\u0027s our status, Bob?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, Bob knew. He recognized that pattern! Just before they left the KSC, there was a small group of zealots handing out pamphlets to onlookers; something they called \u0022Tylotology\u0022. Bob recalled one of them stuffing a pamphlet into his hand instead of shaking it as they met supporters before leaving. It was Kerson! He was a Tylotologist! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid he throw it away, or did he just leave it in his pocket? That question would have to wait until they boarded Vall Station after their landing mission. Until then, he would be keeping a very close eye on Kerson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob knew a little bit about the Tylotologists and their belief that all life on Kerbin originated from a volcanic eruption that occured millions of years ago on Tylo. It was their understanding that life-carrying pyroclastic debris was ejected into space and landed on Kerbin, spawning all known life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were obviously crazy, he thought. However, \u003Cem\u003Esomeone\u003C/em\u003E built the structure he was looking at, and it was in the exact shape of the icon for the Tylotologists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Landing complete, Bob!\u0022 exclaimed Ludlong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob could also recall something about a science fiction book he\u0027d read as a child, written by the founder of Tylotology, which stated that another volcano would erupt, but this time on Kerbin, and would then become the space seed for another planet while at the same time destroying all life on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Landing complete, Bob!\u0022 exclaimed Ludlong, again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob had totally missed the landing, he was so deep in thought!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger that, Ludlong.

There was so much tension from the landing, and a sense of awe and wonder surrounding the pyramids, that no one spoke a word as they exited for their surface mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as Bob turned to tell the team that he was about to plant the flag, Kerson appeared immediately in front of him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a solid unblinking stare, Kerson said quietly \u0022I know you tried to hide my scanner, Bob. I\u0027m not worried about your accusations and your suspicions. There\u0027s nothing you can do, now, anyways.\u0022 Kerson then walked towards the others and took his place for the group photo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter planting a flag and taking a photo of the team near their lander, the science experts starting taking measurements around the blocks. Ludlong and Bill followed Kerson, closely. Kerson\u0027s job, besides efficiency expert, was to take surface seismic readings. Bob noticed that Kerson was brazenly brandishing his Scan-o-Tron, apparently the device Kerson used for seismic readings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter taking only two readings, Kerson filed his report and headed back to the lander. While the other science crew members continued their research, Bob and Ludlong also returned to the lander. On the way, Bob suddenly had an idea to have a look at the structure from its highest point: the top of the tallest pyramid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a long, careful burn of his EVA pack, Bob ascended to the top of the pyramid. From this height he had a unique perspective of the structure and took a moment to ponder the Tylotologist\u0027s ideas about life from volcanoes.

This was a science lab, only recently added to the KSC equipment roster, and would be docked to Vall Station to assist the science team.

What would their discovery of Vall Henge bring to his fellow kerbals? It wouldn\u0027t be up to him to learn the rest of the secrets; he was just a pilot who brought back the science for others to study. He was a pilot, he realized, who was ready to retire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Bob informed Ludlong that this would be his last mission, Ludlong insisted that Bob fly them back to Kerbin\u0027s surface. It was too late to make a formal flight plan change, so at the last moment Ludlong switched the pilot controls over to Bob\u0027s seat, and Bob flew the landing team back to Kerbin\u0027s warm oceans for the last time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the second landing team missed their landing zone and had a hard ground landing far off course, Bob and Ludlong shared a nod of acknowledgement. Bob still had \u0022pretty good stuff\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Bob\u0027s retirement party, the new KSC Director was announced. To no one\u0027s surprise, Ludlong gladly accepted the position stating that he could never replace Bob; he could only succeed him. Afterwards, off the record, Ludlong told Bob about a new, secretly developed space program. One that was meant to land not on Tylo, as Bob had expected, but on Jools last moon: Bop. Ludlong hadn\u0027t learned, yet, why there was a secret space program to visit Bop, but he promised Bob that when he figured it out, he would tell Bob everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor months, Bob awaited some kind of announcement regarding what he and Ludlong had seen on Vall. He expected to hear about some kind of connection between Vall and Tylo and even, perhaps, the extreme ideas propagated by the Tylotologists. But no such announcement from KSC ever came.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, KSC released details diagrams about how such formations like Vall Henge form though natural planetary development and erosion processes. They claimed that the Vall pyramids were natural formations, and no one questioned it. Soon, it was all but forgotten and seen as an expensive waste of money sending so many kerbals so far from home, only to look at some pointy rocks in the sand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Bob, and Ludlong, and everyone else who walked amongst the Vall pyramids, knew that there was nothing natural about the formations. But without any proof no one would take them any more seriously than the Tylotology zealots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then on a warm Kerbin morning almost a year after returning from Vall, Ludlong appeared at Bob\u0027s home unannounced. After a sincere and warm greeting, Bob invited Ludlong in for koffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong had acquired, and told Bob not to ask from where, a photo taken of Bop\u0027s surface. It seemed that Kerson had only used Tylo as a slingshot and had really highjacked the Science Lab to fly to Bop. The photo, probably stolen from the Tylotologists Bob thought, showed a very strange looking shape on Bop\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob,\u0022 Ludlong said, in a serious tone possibly for the first time Bob had ever heard, \u0022..there\u0027s something on Bop.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, Lud, I see that. What is it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know, Bob, but I\u0027m going on the mission. This mission is off the books, quite dangerous and definitely illegal since me and some others are planning on stealing the Bop spacecraft.\u0022 After a long pause while Bob absorbed Ludlong\u0027s news, he continued, \u0022And Bob, there\u0027s an extra seat. Do you still have your orange space suit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s already packed, Ludlong. I\u0027ve been waiting for this moment for months.\u0022 Bob shook Ludlong\u0027s hand and within the hour, they were orbiting Kerbin and, with Jeb\u0027s and Bill\u0027s help, had stolen the secret spacecraft designed to land on Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5iwtq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
