It was a fresh install, as I had moved my 0.9 files elsewhere. \n\nThe game loaded suspiciously quickly - in a couple of seconds - and only mentioned the cockpit internals in the yellow text box on the loading screen, no parts showed. \n\nThen in the options for my first save I noticed there were no flags to choose from, just a blank box. I entered the game and there were no parts in the VAB or SPH. \n\nThe parts are all successfully downloaded in Gamedata\u003ESquad\u003EParts, with their .cfg files etc. The KSP\u003EParts folder is empty, but I think that has always been the case. I checked Steam for additional downloadable content but there is none. I tried the game a few more times but always with the same result - no parts. This is the case if I click Play in Steam, or if I load by clicking the KSP.x86\\_64 exec file\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T08:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Oafman**"},{"CreatedByName":"v8Dave","CreatedById":134518,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:10:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The parts are all successfully downloaded in Gamedata\u003ESquad\u003EParts, with their .cfg files etc. The KSP\u003EParts folder is empty, but I think that has always been the case.
