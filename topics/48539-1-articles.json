I think that this would work similarly to how main engines can push other entities away from said engine, but an explosion would produce this effect in a 360 degree ball and exert a large (depending on the size of the part exploding) force on all nearby parts/Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would, of course, make in-flight accidents a bit more disastrous, not to mention having some cool effects if two spacecraft were to collide (per se)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo?
