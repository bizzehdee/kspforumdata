Now, when I go to the tracking station, I find that all my missions have vanished. When I try to build a craft, I find that many items are missing. Other items have swapped their models. for instance, I found a big cargo bay that was labelled as a parachute. Other models have become grossly disfigured and are missing parts. Also, if I try to load any scenario world, I find myself on an asteroid being catapulted into space...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 I am completely baffled.

Then proceed trying any mission and if you find anomalies there - then there is local data corruption. In that case I suggest checking hard drives (SMART) for failures and complete reinstall of KSP as minimum. If drives are failing - new drive and reinstall of whole system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
