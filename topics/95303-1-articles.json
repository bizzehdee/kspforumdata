Well, here\u0027s my first truly successful attempt:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/pincushionman/ksp/porkypine-plane/2015-01-01_00003_zpse0394ac9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-01-01_00003_zpse0394ac9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebidiah is jumping for joy, because I didn\u0027t flip out and crash him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a slight modification of a plane I made for some nearby survey contracts I wanted to do. I say this one is \u0022first successful\u0022 because at the time I didn\u0027t have landing gear available, so it needed a Separatron-assisted clamp takeoff and a chute landing onto legs, which doesn\u0027t really count. But with the landing gear unlocked, I was pretty proud of its performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo some tweaking and here\u0027s the rev. A:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/pincushionman/ksp/porkypine-plane/2015-01-01_00004_zps14aff2d0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-01-01_00004_zps14aff2d0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI moved the intakes around so there wasn\u0027t one scraping the ground anymore. In-game, it appeared to clip into the ground when I retracted the gear, so it may not actually have changed any behavior. But it seemed silly. There\u0027s an extra intake to increase thrust - not for extra speed, for extra run-time! It\u0027s thrust limited to 40%, but there\u0027s plenty of power in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t unlocked \u0022mobility enhancers\u0022 yet, but if I retract the gear after landing and roll to one side Jeb can run up the wing and onto the cockpit to get back in. It tips back on its tail when I do that, but that\u0027s nothing a little thrust with the brakes on can\u0027t fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVto = 70 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVmax = 350 m/s @ 11,000 m (roughly terminal velocity at that altitude)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERange = 284 km (round-trip; assuming 5 minutes of full-power takeoff and climb, and un-powered glide descent and landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of mass moves very little during flight - maybe about 25 cm or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flies all right, as far as I\u0027m concerned - assuming there\u0027s an SAS-capable pilot in there. Without, it seems to suffer from the same problems I run into with any other plane while flying with the keyboard. The ability to apply trim would be nice. It is longitudinally stable, though, and the dihedral helps roll stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/gjls1od1oi9cppu/Porkypine.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the .craft file,\u003C/a\u003E if anyone wants to take a look and give suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQUESTIONS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is there a way to disable the reaction wheels in the VAB/SPH? The only way I\u0027ve been able to do it is during the flight scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is there a way to apply trim? The only way to trim I\u0027ve found is by using SAS, which is not exactly trimming, in my opinion, and doesn\u0027t help if I want to fly with, say, a Scientist instead of a pilot. It may not be a big deal with proper input devices, but the joystick I have isn\u0027t compatible with Win7x64, and flying with the keyboard means all-or nothing elevator input. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tidus Klein","CreatedById":72277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T22:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrimming...
