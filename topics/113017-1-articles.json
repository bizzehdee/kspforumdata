My problem is that I have Solar charge going to the panels but the batteries are not charging - it increases slightly and then back to 0 again. The problem is that all of my science instruments (Scanner/Telescope/ etc/etc - you name it) are all running and obviously taking the charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way that I can turn off the instruments to allow the batteries to recharge. Whenever I click on anything it kind of just flash/glitches and I can\u0027t do anything with my probe. Apart from sending an Engineer on an EVA using KAS mods to bolt on some new Solar panels - is there anything else I can do or is it now effectively a dead probe? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be handy if all instruments just powered down when they were out of charge (like SAS)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T09:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you \u0027Right Click\u0027 on each instrument, there should be an option to toggle it Activate/Deactivate (On/Off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might have Antenna range mod (or something similar) installed, where you need \u0027line-of-sight\u0027 with the Ground Control station in order to control the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no sun or comms.. your probe is virtually dead until it comes into view of the ground station again - don\u0027t forget to place decent aerials on the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried on a probe, but put mechjeb (auto-flight computer) on it and set up the flight parameters - this might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks ColKlonk - No I don\u0027t have that mod installed - the craft was perfectly in control around minmus as I was just changing my plane to pick up science from the Biomes when I had battery power - but as soon as power hit 0 - I lost all control of it - I have time accelerated 1000 for a few complete orbits of Minmus to see if I can get enough charge to deactivate instruments but to no avail - when I click on the main \u0022stock\u0022 scanner I have double click/left click/right click - nothing happens at all - I get no information whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this by modifying your save file: Either find the offending experiment part and change Deployed = True to False, or similarly modify the ElectricCharge value and FlowState of a battery to fill it and lock it - thus giving you time to shut down instruments in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an annoying race that renders the activate/deactivate buttons in the context menu unusable, and it is wise to lock a small battery in the VAB for this reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756-1-0-HyperEdit-v1-4-1-May-14-2015-Teleporter-Orbit-Planet-Editor-More\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehyperedit\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T10:30:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry manually transferring charge (Alt\u002BLClick) from the panels to the battery - maybe this is a new trick in V1.02 (A connection link between the battery and panels ?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure whether items work in accelerated mode... try 1x mode in the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise we might be looking at another bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdt... ah..
