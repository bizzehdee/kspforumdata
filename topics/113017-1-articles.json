My problem is that I have Solar charge going to the panels but the batteries are not charging - it increases slightly and then back to 0 again. The problem is that all of my science instruments (Scanner/Telescope/ etc/etc - you name it) are all running and obviously taking the charge.\n\nIs there a way that I can turn off the instruments to allow the batteries to recharge. Whenever I click on anything it kind of just flash/glitches and I can\u0027t do anything with my probe. Apart from sending an Engineer on an EVA using KAS mods to bolt on some new Solar panels - is there anything else I can do or is it now effectively a dead probe? \n\nIt would be handy if all instruments just powered down when they were out of charge (like SAS)?"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T09:39:19Z","Content":"If you \u0027Right Click\u0027 on each instrument, there should be an option to toggle it Activate/Deactivate (On/Off).\n\nYou might have Antenna range mod (or something similar) installed, where you need \u0027line-of-sight\u0027 with the Ground Control station in order to control the probe.\n\nWith no sun or comms.. your probe is virtually dead until it comes into view of the ground station again - don\u0027t forget to place decent aerials on the probe.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried on a probe, but put mechjeb (auto-flight computer) on it and set up the flight parameters - this might help.\n\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:09:23Z","Content":"Thanks ColKlonk - No I don\u0027t have that mod installed - the craft was perfectly in control around minmus as I was just changing my plane to pick up science from the Biomes when I had battery power - but as soon as power hit 0 - I lost all control of it - I have time accelerated 1000 for a few complete orbits of Minmus to see if I can get enough charge to deactivate instruments but to no avail - when I click on the main \u0022stock\u0022 scanner I have double click/left click/right click - nothing happens at all - I get no information whatsoever."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:26:45Z","Content":"You can do this by modifying your save file: Either find the offending experiment part and change Deployed = True to False, or similarly modify the ElectricCharge value and FlowState of a battery to fill it and lock it - thus giving you time to shut down instruments in game.\n\nIt\u0027s an annoying race that renders the activate/deactivate buttons in the context menu unusable, and it is wise to lock a small battery in the VAB for this reason.\n\nOr use [hyperedit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756-1-0-HyperEdit-v1-4-1-May-14-2015-Teleporter-Orbit-Planet-Editor-More). ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T10:30:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:27:25Z","Content":"Try manually transferring charge (Alt\u002BLClick) from the panels to the battery - maybe this is a new trick in V1.02 (A connection link between the battery and panels ?)\n\nI\u0027m not sure whether items work in accelerated mode... try 1x mode in the sun.\n\nOtherwise we might be looking at another bug.\n\nEdt... ah..
