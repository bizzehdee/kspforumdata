Kerbals never had a need for time, since they are carefree and do what they want.

Year number is arbitrary, it\u0027s 2015 to us but it\u0027s 1436 to some people. Both represent the same \u0022real time\u0022 year, they\u0027re just two different calendars. If you mean what equivalent technology do they have, that was answered: nonsensical. They have space pod technology before bolted on ladder rungs. A welded pipe frame chair represents scientific progress to a race that already has what must be powered armor suits given their incredible tolerance for heat and impact. None of it makes sense bud, they\u0027re little green men.\n\nWhich is great. To me, kerbals are the ideal proxy spacefarers. They aren\u0027t tied up to any particular human culture, they don\u0027t have any irrelevant history gumming up the purity of their science, they have nothing but peaceful intentions and a wonder for the universe.

If you\u0027re asking what the date would be, as measured by the gregorian/Christian/western calendar, on Earth when you start a new game there\u0027s no sensible answer because KSP doesn\u0027t take place in our universe.
