While expensive on the fuel, this path gives me a predictable requirement for my transfer stage - and coming back is easier than deorbiting from LKO, so it kinda balances.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T16:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally made friends with Aptur...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nbBvDXw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nbBvDXw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe route wasn\u0027t very efficient, but my standard Fox class lander turned out to have excess fuel capacity, returning to meet with a lab in LKO before deorbiting, still with it\u0027s nacelle fuel pods attached. Generally those would have been left on the Munar surface ^^ \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tough rock to crack, but this landing should reward me with a goodly haul of analysed science over the next few hundred days, which I shall be directing towards the excessively luxurious extendible solar panels! Also tempted to move the lab out towards Serran... but that would probably need a refuelling station to guarantee return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note; my transfer stage is still there. I kicked it off at 1km above the ground and it survived the fall \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit* After a second mission, I got the Kerbin-Aptur transfer down to about 1500m/s. Mostly it\u0027s about waiting an orbit or two before burning - or looping round again and burning in an \u0027earlier\u0027 orbit. Also managed to transfer from the far side of Sonnah, when Aptur was on the inside lane.
