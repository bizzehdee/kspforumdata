You\u0027ll still need to EVA a Kerbal over to transfer and store the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that the lab can hold more than one copy of a given experiment, unlike a command pod or lander can. So you can do a seismic scan (for example), take the data and store it in your lander can, then do another scan and leave the data in the scanner, and when you get back up to the orbital lab you can store both and return them, or process and transmit one and return the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clean goo canisters and material bays in order to reuse them, you will have to dock the lander to the lab, but, as mentioned above they don\u0027t need to be directly connected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T23:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re collecting science the same way I do. The process to follow is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Go to the surface and collect samples. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Transmit anything that gives you 100% right away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pull the data from the experiment bays and put it in the pod. I usually do this when I go out for a surface sample. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Repeat in as many biomes as you have fuel for then return to the orbiting refuel station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Dock with the station and refuel the lander. (right click on one fuel tank then ALT right click on a second tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Right click on the mobile lab and clean the experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Get your lander pilot to EVA. Right click on the lander pod and choose take data then go to the lab and right click and choose store data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Get back in the lander and head back to the surface to do it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few other tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get more science points for transmitting a sample AND returning a sample than you do for just returning a sample. You should always transmit your first surface sample then go back outside and get another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got enough experiment bays on your lander it\u0027s not a bad idea to do this with Goo and material observations as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the lab may be able to hold 2 copies of the same data, it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll be taking the lab back to the surface of kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more practical to just send a small courier ship to pick up the data and return it to kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you take data from the lab you can\u0027t choose which ones you want to take. It\u0027s all or nothing so if you\u0027ve got duplicates you won\u0027t be able to board the courier ship unless you discard the duplicates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if your courier ship did have 2 pods and you were able to take back the duplicates, I\u0027m not sure you\u0027d get credit for them when you recover the vessel on kerbin. It might just give you credit for the one of each data sample on the ship. I usually send a second courier for the duplicate data, but I suppose you could just separate one pod in orbit and land it separatly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have much practice with Mun landings you might want to use this method to harvest science on Minmus first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science is worth more there. The gravity is a lot lighter so you use less fuel and your lander can carry more experiment bays. It\u0027s also not as hilly so that makes landing easier as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the setup I used for harvesting Minmus but it would also work on the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the 3 man pod since it gives me enough crew to use the lab and still be able to move the ship if I want to. Fuel capacity is the same as an orange tank and it carrys 4 of the larger RCS tanks radially mounted. The engine is a poodle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFully fueled it\u0027s pretty heavy so I sent it up half full. The booster stages got it a good AP and some of the orbital velocity while the poodle was able to finish making orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fueled it in LKO then moved it to Minmus. The lander went seperatly on it\u0027s own booster and transfer stage. If I were going to Duna I\u0027d probably dock the lander to the nose of the mothership and just do 1 trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership could completly refuel the lander 8 times, but the lander is never empty when you get back to the station. You run out of experiment bays before you run out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFully fueled the mothership has about 4000 dV and you burn just under a quarter of that getting to minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small ship docked above the lander is the courier. The docking port (sheilded) is on the bottom while a parachute is on the top. It\u0027s only engines are RCS thrusters. Once I did the transfer burn from kerbin, they were enough to enter Minmus orbit, dock with the station and get back to kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen returning to kerbin I use the RCS to drop my PE to about 35km to areobrake and land without needing a lot of fuel or thrust. (you want to set your PE just after leaving Minmus\u0027s SOI when it doesn\u0027t take much energy to do it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure the RCS courier would work as well in Munar orbit. It takes more dV to enter or leave orbit of the Mun and the TWR of the RCS courier is pretty low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that setup worked great for harvesting minmus and you don\u0027t need to unlock too much of the tech tree before you can build it. (a single minmus landing got me enough science to build this for the second trip)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3298062012329246822/DDDAD79AA7A791F91BDA6CD9D4CAEDCF157E4EBD/\u0022 alt=\u0022DDDAD79AA7A791F91BDA6CD9D4CAEDCF157E4EBD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-09T22:42:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2014 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kerba Fett\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
