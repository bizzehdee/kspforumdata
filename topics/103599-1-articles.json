I\u0027ve had some minor success, but have two main issues I\u0027m hoping to get some ideas on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs you\u0027ll see from the attached screenshot, I had to put a reaction wheel in the middle of the plane. Without it, I can get up to around 19km, but then the plane tilts forward in a dive that I can\u0027t pull up out of until ~15km. With the reaction wheel, I can get to 19km, gain speed, then point up. I make sure to use fuel from the rear tanks first to keep my CoM forward, so I have no idea why I really need the wheel/why I get stuck in a dive I can\u0027t pull up from.

Even with the 1.5 fuselage tanks, I barely have enough LF/OX to get to a 72km circularized orbit, with enough to then de-orbit after launching my probe. Is there a better engine? I tried an LV909, but it didn\u0027t seem to have enough thrust to actually get me out of orbit. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hnnX6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The crux of the problem is shifting CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next few weeks until 1.0 drops, this will continue to be an issue. With 1.0 fuel will be used evenly from all tanks in a stage, so this will no longer be a design constraint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour craft does not need the weight of the aerospike. For my spaceplanes in the 10-20 tonne range, I get almost all the way to orbit on the turbojet (up to 15-20 tonnes you only need one) and use two 48-7S engines for circularization and orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very efficient profile is possible in stock aero. Flying only on turbojets, climb to over 10 km. Between 10 and 20 km you want to climb fairly slowly and get your speed up close to 700 m/s. Between 20 and 30 km, you climb \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E slowly, getting your speed to about 1600 m/s by 30 km. Still climbing extemely slowly, between 30 and 36 km keey building speed to around 2100 m/s surface velocity. At around 36 km, depending on number of intakes, your engine will become oxygen deprived. If you throttle back slightly, the engine will keep running and providing thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, you will have essentially orbital velocity even though you are still climbing through the atmosphere. It doesn\u0027t take much thrust to maintain velocity and get your apoapsis up to where you want. It\u0027s a slow climb, but if you have patience you can make orbit using only 30 m/s or so from the rocket engines. Of course, this will all change with the new aero in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would use a single turbojet, add more lift, and replace the heavy aerospike with small light OMS engines. The balancing part can be very tricky, especially with the cargo bay being on the CoM. I often try to place my tanks lateral to the CoM if I can\u0027t place them right on it. Also, keep the two ram intakes to feed air to the single turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T14:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emekasha,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour design looks like it should be fairly aerodynamically unstable, so your pitch problem is likely due to shifting CoM as the jet fuel tanks drain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027d definitely get rid of the aerospike.
