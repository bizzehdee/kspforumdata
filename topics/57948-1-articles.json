Given that, there\u0027s just no reason for me to try assembling a station in orbit from parts, when I can just lift the entire thing in a single go. That\u0027s a big part of why my stations got so big in the first place; my spaceplanes are very efficient, but the heavy rocket constructions tend to be a bit bloated when you have no reason not to go bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T05:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...In KSP, it was probably sending 24 ships to Jool at once only to have them all obliterated when most of the mods they were built around had game-breaking updates for 0.23.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh noooo!
