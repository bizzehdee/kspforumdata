They are about to make something the size of the SLS. Its called Long March 9, or in Chinese CZ-9.

As cute as this idea is, Russia is simply unable to develop large rocket systems with its failing economy and internal unrest. If things improve there, which they could, then perhaps this could be a good option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027m definitely going for SpaceX here. Once they develop full reusability, launch costs will be tenth-ed and space will be more accessible than ever. Let\u0027s just hope they succeed with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A very good option if it wasn\u0027t for a complete lack of cooperation due to political disagreements. China\u0027s economy could go either way, so it\u0027s hard to say how good an option they will be in the coming years and decades. But I like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a few backup plans you missed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Orbital Sciences Corporation. Similar to SpaceX only less developed. They might be a good option further down the track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The ESA. Right now it\u0027s facing the same problems as NASA, and it is being run by a loosely held together group of countries, so no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. India. Similar to China except less developed, but without as many political issues. Economically India is almost certain to keep on growing for decades to come, so I like this option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Japan. Too many internal problems to focus on space, so no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Virgin Galactic. They currently say they can get lunar tourism and transportation up by 2043, but their success rate says otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I do a quick poll: do you want another space race or not? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES.
