Metallic hydrogen engines will probably cut that time down to a few months. It takes over a year to get to Jool. Again, MH would get you there in the time it takes to get to Duna with conventional engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-02T19:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210403\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667365124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of some of these engines is that they let you do constant-burn trajectories between planets.

Im more concerned about engines that are designed to help you for when you get to other planets (Like advanced plasma engines and other very high efficency engines) then I am about torchships because the latter are intentionally overpowered. I think some indicator of where the engines are supposed to be on the tech level would be good as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
