I tried removing settings.cfg, changing its permissions, etc... to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t say no settings are persisted at all though - when I start the game, it\u0027s fullscreen, at my desktop resolution... and half the time I don\u0027t get the \u0022send statistics\u0022 dialog. Even though I don\u0027t get the dialogs, still important settings such as terrain quality (which is the main setting to lower in my situation, Intel HD 4000 is so slow whenever I have terrain in sight) aren\u0027t kept after I closed the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help!
