We\u0027ve talked a lot about\u00A0this\u00A0and I\u0027ve posted some thoughts\u00A0in the past, but I wanted to make as clear a suggestion as possible. The science system is one of the oldest career elements and the one I think people are at present least satisfied with. Its doing a lot of things right and I love the general idea, but in practice its pretty\u00A0clicky and more than a little grindy, and I for one think the problem lies not in the tech tree or the principle of science points in general but with the experiments themselves. There\u0027s also the matter of the current \u0027emptiness\u0027 of the planets. There just doesn\u0027t seem to be much out there to find. I intend to suggest fixes to both problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1: Biome Mapping and Anomalies:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first and foremost is Biome mapping. Anyone who\u0027s used DMagic\u0027s very clever Scansat mod knows just how helpful this can be. Right now in stock biomes are essentially invisible, which means you really have no idea where you\u0027re going before you get there. What should happen instead is that players could send an orbital probe ahead to scan the surface and use those scans to plan landing locations for more ambitious missions. Landing locations should also \u003Cem\u003Ematter,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewhich is why I propose that different biomes should have slightly different science multipliers. Here would be a sample map of Duna:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nfvKr1G.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nfvKr1G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally this would simply be displayed as an overlay with the bonuses listed on mouse-over. Notice the ??? Those are your anomalies. You wouldn\u0027t know what they were from orbit, but upon landing and entering the very small biomes around them\u00A0they would hold significant science boosts. Here\u0027s what you might find if you located them on the surface:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ikenMVN.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ikenMVN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reduce legwork I imagine across the entire system you might only have several models with effects that could be re-skinned from world to world.

Because visiting them gains science rewards (and World Firsts) there\u0027s a real reason to go find them. Because they appear small, perhaps only 5km in radius from orbit, there\u0027s\u00A0also now a\u00A0reason to bring rovers and planes and send probes ahead\u00A0so you can scout the surface. They also make for great screenshots to show your friends where you\u0027ve been, and could form a solid goal for hardcore completionists. More than that they give the planets \u003Cem\u003Edimension\u003C/em\u003E. The exploration process doesn\u0027t stop when you put a flag in the ground. These are real places to be explored and interacted with. But we can do more than that I think:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMake Experiments Fun:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll totally admit this is a heavy lift, but I think its really critical to making experiments not just a thing to click but something really fun and rewarding to engage with. There are 2 main problems: 1)\u00A0clicking on half a dozen experiments and crew reports and eva\u0027s and sending a scientist out to collect everything over and over is really, really repetitive and takes away from the core fun of the game: flying rockets; and 2) Experiments don\u0027t feel like conducting science because they\u00A0aren\u0027t producing information valuable to the player \u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E the tech tree. To fix this,\u00A0first, the process of data collection\u00A0should be made automatic so players aren\u0027t preoccupied by constantly right-clicking through parts. Instead players should have to fly differently or\u00A0do something special \u003Cem\u003Ein-engine\u003C/em\u003E to make experiments work. Next, each experiment should provide the player with information valuable to playing the game. Not only would this make experiments feel more relevant and real, but it would make them v\u003Cem\u003Ealuable even after the tech tree was complete\u003C/em\u003E. Here are some examples:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGoo Canister:\u003C/strong\u003E This would be your first bit of science equipment and would be one time use unless you had a scientist aboard. It cannot discern between biomes and only gives unique science points for being landed, being in atmosphere, or being in near space. It works like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sjXmrTz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sjXmrTz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThermometer\u003C/strong\u003E: This is up next, and automatically logs science whenever it enters a new biome. It cannot discern between Biomes above the low atmosphere. Also having one aboard will make heat bars show up rather than parts just glowing red.

This means landed on the surface it gives basically zero science, but if you put it on during launch you get a great deal. You can also exploit this using drop-probes on other planets. As an addition to skills pilots might be able to predict aerobraking and trajectory information factoring drag\u00A0for planets with a complete barometric scan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UA7qEZx.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UA7qEZx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmospheric Analyzer\u003C/strong\u003E:\u00A0Next we\u0027re going to turn this into an atmospheric sample collector. For this experiment to work you would need to roughly hold altitude and speed for 10 seconds, which generally would mean resting on the surface or under\u00A0some form of powered flight. At some point down the road if atmospheric Xenon could be collected and refined these might give precise concentration values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022n462HA3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n462HA3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGravoli\u003C/strong\u003E: This is now your Biome Mapper and should come much earlier in the tech tree.\u00A0I won\u0027t steal DMagic\u0027s wonderful work, but I do think there\u0027s a value to understanding surface mapping in a real way so I think its worth actually having a scanning radius which would be displayed graphically and the player would have to inject it into a polar orbit that would produce a complete scan. Science would\u00A0pay out for the proportion of the planet\u0027s surface that had been scanned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAltimeter\u003C/strong\u003E: This is the first new part I would add. It works similarly to the Gravoli as a surface scanner and pays out for scanned area, but instead produces an attitude overlay. This could be really critical for night landings and if stock clouds are added. I think it should also have a different operating altitude necessitating either repositioning or a separate probe.\u00A0Also having one on board would allow the player to see real surface altitude rather than their altitude above sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESurvey Scanner:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EWorks similarly\u00A0and produces a low-res resource scan as it does now as well as science. Each of these could also have different power requirements that could make staying outside the planet\u0027s shadow important for efficient scanning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nyLjAIm.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nyLjAIm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENarrow Band\u00A0Scanner\u003C/strong\u003E: I actually really like the way the stock prospecting system works, but I\u0027d make a few tweaks here as well.\u00A0This should really display as a steady stream rather than requiring manual refreshing. I would also have it add a position marker on the Nav Ball for anomalies once they were within 5km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESurface Sample Collector\u003C/strong\u003E: This would replace the surface scanner and should really have a little armature and drill so you had to do some careful design to make it work. It should come late in the tech tree but in principle allow surface sample collection by probes. These\u00A0could determine ore concentrations themselves or be delivered to\u00A0a mobile lab for processing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESeismometer\u003C/strong\u003E: This is now our impactor experiment. First you place the sensor on the surface, then you smash an object into the surface near it. You are then awarded science points for the \u003Cem\u003Eoverlapping area\u003C/em\u003E. The impact radius would be determined by the speed and weight of the impactor,\u00A0so\u00A0more precise hits and bigger booms make for more science.\u00A0You will also be able to see high-res resource values within the scanned area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ffUvbPA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ffUvbPA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMaterials Bays\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003EMaterials Bays would\u00A0be moved back in the tech tree and be used\u00A0for loading and exposing \u003Cem\u003Esamples\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0When a surface or atmospheric sample is recovered, it goes into a catalogue\u00A0of available samples.

This means that a sample from the launchpad exposed at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E will be worth very little, but a sample from Gilly\u00A0exposed on Laythe will be worth a great deal.

Materials Bays could\u00A0be reloaded by a\u00A0Mobile Processing Lab, but only with samples banked at the time of the Lab\u0027s launch and with samples processed by that lab. This means bringing a lab to another body will be useful for processing and gathering science from that body over time, but samples cant be magically transported across the Kerbol System.

Flying high above the planet would give you mapping points for the face of the planet you see (that is, all of it if you remain in orbit), but at a very low resolution. Flying in atmo means you map a smaller area, but at a higher resolution. Sending a rover to the surface gives really high-resolution data, but of a very small area. Following the same logic, a Kerbal on foot would give the highest resolution and the smallest area, but since it would be such a massive chore to \u003Cem\u003Ewalk\u003C/em\u003E around the various biomes of the planets, I think it could be enough to send rovers. For extra \u0022fun\u0022, the night side of the planet could yield a lower resolution multiplier, giving you a reason to stay in orbit until you\u0027ve seen the entire planetary surface in sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis feature would essentially replace the current crew reports/EVA reports, or rather, perform them automatically. Actually, I\u0027d be content enough if Kerbals were allowed to write their reports after the fact, meaning that you could get EVA reports from orbit above the Mun\u0027s Highlands, Lowlands and Midlands if the Kerbal stayed in EVA while passing over those three biomes. No need to get out and write while you\u0027re above them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your suggestion about the Materials bay, I think it could use a slight tweaking.

It\u0027s filled with various samples of materials from Kerbin, which you bring to the different locations and expose to the elements. After you collect samples from the Mun, a new setting would be unlocked for the materials bay in the VAB, allowing you to load it up with Mun materials instead. This somehow implies that the handful of dust you picked up on the Mun is enough to stock the Materials bay for experiments in all of the game\u0027s 100-ish biomes, but I\u0027d say it\u0027s still within reason. Besides, it means you won\u0027t have to stop on Minmus for every trip to other planets to stock up on samples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, I like to see some discussion on the Science in this game.

The Goo and Thermometer are basically the same for instance, just made automatic so you don\u0027t have to fuss with them all the time. Others like the barometer and atmospheric analyzer are pretty simple as well, and are really just working while you do things you\u0027d be doing already: ascending, descending, and maintaining level flight. The Gravoli and other surface scanners really just need to be put in polar orbit at somewhat specific altitudes, which you\u0027d already be doing with the survey scanner.\u00A0This only leaves the Impactor which Im sure people would have a ton of fun with and the Materials bay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso important to note is that the uses of these experiments is now limited\u00A0so we\u0027ve massively reduced the level of outright grind.

So you could make a survey satellite with the\u00A0three scanning parts and either run all three simultaneously or adjust their altitude after each scan. You also really only have to do the barometric scan once for each planet with an atmosphere, so just put one on a lander probe and you\u0027re all set, no need to keep clicking away at it everywhere you go.

Flying high above the planet would give you mapping points for the face of the planet you see (that is, all of it if you remain in orbit), but at a very low resolution. Flying in atmo means you map a smaller area, but at a higher resolution. Sending a rover to the surface gives really high-resolution data, but of a very small area. Following the same logic, a Kerbal on foot would give the highest resolution and the smallest area, but since it would be such a massive chore to \u003Cem\u003Ewalk\u003C/em\u003E around the various biomes of the planets, I think it could be enough to send rovers.

The answer to both is: its a game and that\u0027s how games work. Science points are an abstraction. Better than that they\u0027re an open incentive that allows players to solve problems in multiple ways. They can fly around in planes taking readings or send probes to other planets or land on the Mun. If you remove that currency then to incentivize those activities you have to specifically tell people where to go and what to do there to get what they want. Players need to be able to change their minds \u003Cem\u003Ein flight\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0They need to be able to look down at some interesting feature and go check it out because they\u0027re curious. If they can\u0027t do that then the entire time they\u0027re flying they\u0027re just going through the motions. There\u0027s no spontaneity and no real exploration.\u00A0You\u0027ve robbed them of the individual\u00A0choice to engage with science on their own terms\u00A0and so doing have destroyed the open-world nature of the game.

The difference is they simply wouldn\u0027t be rewarded with science points and get reputation\u00A0instead (which would have an influence on the annual income). And reputation is something we have in real life and people know how to deal with it.
