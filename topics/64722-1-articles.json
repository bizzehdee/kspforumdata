That said, I routinely put things into orbit at ~6Km over minmus, and 10Km over mun, So I know that those altitudes are perfectly safe, over the equator at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheScareCake!","CreatedById":103641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T18:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0022slingshot II\u0022 mun lander is in orbit around the mun right now with a periapsis of 6000 metters, but still, i want to go lower\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Inconvenience","CreatedById":104644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T19:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe highest point on Mun is 7061 meters.
