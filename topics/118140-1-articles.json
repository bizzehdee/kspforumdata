This also helps me find mods with PNG textures that can be converted by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELilleman\u0027s tool\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome decisions are also made based on intuition and experience. For example, IVA props and spaces seem to be especially costly, so I\u0027ve set aside Firespitter (besides the plugin), Near Future Tech, and ALCOR/ERS, even though they\u0027re all way cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T02:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, WinDirStat is one of the coolest tools I\u0027ve seen in a long time.
