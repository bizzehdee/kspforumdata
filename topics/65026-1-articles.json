In normal staging, each tank is lifted by a rocket engine directly beneath its center of mass. The *only* stresses you need to accommodate are from uneven tank emptying(due to fuel lines), uneven engine specs and uneven mass distribution of payload. With your scheme, *all* the energy produced by the engines has to skitter over multiple tanks, girders, docking ports and fuel lines, before pulling at the bottommost tank. In real life, your mass penalty due to structural and control linkages would override the benefits of this layout. In KSP, it is more forgiving, but you will find your design tops out at a much lower tonnage before becoming Kraken bait, and even for a smaller vehicle the maxx survivable G-forges (due to TWR) will be less. Much less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig Advantage: As your asparagus is hanging vertically, you can drop a single tank at a time and still maintain radial symmetry. Normal asparagus requires you drop 2 (or 3,4,etc) tanks from opposite sides at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantage: You can pick and choose *which* engines to drop, and when. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Build your lifter segment with a couple different engines for different altitude \u002B thrust profiles.
