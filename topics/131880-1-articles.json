On a planet filled with opportunities for it to happen, it\u0027s only happened once. So I would theorize that humans could be \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe only species in the entire galaxy\u003C/strong\u003E that got past rubbing two sticks together to make fire.

I think it was explained like this: \u0022The life of the aliens is so different to ours that they don\u0027t see a point in contacting us, in the same way that we humans have no interest in \u0022communicating\u0022 with ants or worms for example, also because it\u0027s not really possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr because they\u0027re afraid of accidentally transmitting communicable diseases to us.

A35K pointed out the theory that aliens don\u0027t consider us worth talking to. There are other theories that say \u0022we humans are too violent\u0022 or \u0022too \u0022primitive\u0022 and a bunch of other possibilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat these theories have in common is that they all paint humans in a very poor light.
