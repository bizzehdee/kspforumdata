It is much longer and more involved than most tutorials, providing and explaining more than 30 vehicles from a rover to interplanetary transfer and space-stations. Four (space)plane designs are included but the focus is very much on rocket design because spaceplanes are hard to build and fly and do not scale well to larger payload sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/HDiNPnR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HDiNPnRl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HDiNPnRl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Into Space\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the vehicles are intended to illustrate one or more design points while being easy to build and use. They are generally robust and capable rather than being \u0027the best\u0027. Optimised designs tend to be hard for beginners to build and there are several different criteria you may choose to favour over others, so what \u0027the best\u0027 means is up to you. The intention is to explain the reasons for particular design decisions so that you will be able to create your own vehicles, when you want to, with more confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tutorial is organised into \u0027project\u0027 chapters with a logical progression. Chapter 2 provides \u0027starter vehicles\u0027 for complete beginners who don\u0027t yet know how to drive and fly in KSP. Most people will want to start with chapters 3 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 5, which begin by putting unmanned satellites into Kerbin orbit and end with manned landings on Kerbin\u0027s moons. The step from \u0027beginner\u0027 to \u0027intermediate\u0027 is marked by Chapter 6 which is a reminder to keep things light. By the time you reach this you should have a fairly good idea of how you want to run your space missions. Chapters 7 and 8 are for more experienced players and look at building a cost-effective, reusable infrastructure throughout the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XhfQMiF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XhfQMiFl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XhfQMiFl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplore With Small Satellites\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach chapter begins with a \u0027project briefing\u0027 outlining the background, objectives and vehicles for the project. Within projects each vehicle is introduced with a \u0027data sheet\u0027 giving its most important features. Following the data sheet there is a narrative discussion of the design, construction and staging/action groups. Each vehicle\u0027s section usually finishes with a number of missions that should be completed in order to follow the logical progression of the tutorial. It is, of course, up to you whether you actually build the vehicles and fly the missions but you should at least read-through these details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESECTION 2: THINGS YOU NEED TO LEARN\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough no prior knowledge is assumed during this tutorial an awful lot isn\u0027t explained either.

The oversight committee have asked that before you begin new operations you follow the standard induction training and learn about the vehicles available to us. In driving the rover you will discover that KSC is quite a detailed setting, not just the game\u0027s main screen. The developers have included statues and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u0027other things\u0027. Flying an aeroplane allows you to go further and faster than driving a rover and, of course, is in three dimensions rather than two. Despite its low performance the Trainer Mk1 aircraft is a useful vehicle for short-range exploration so you may decide to use it for later missions as well. In contrast the Rocket 1A is completely useless in itself but learning to fly it is vital. The lessons here are just the main controls and instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENB: This prologue is somewhat different to the later chapters as it is just preparation for the main campaign.

For now just have a look at the thing in the SPH and live with the notes below. (From the KSC screen click on the Spaceplane Hanger, click the Load button at the top-right of the screen, click Mr. Kerman\u0027s Electrical Carriage in the ship window, click the load button at the bottom of the window.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you add lights and wheels to a vehicle KSP automatically assigns the appropriate action to the Light (U) and Brakes (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E action Groups. Similarly, when you add landing-gear/legs, KSP will assign them to the Gear (G) group. As there isn\u0027t any landing-gear on this rover I\u0027ve used G for the ladder below the hatch on the back of the rover. Stage (spacebar) should be used when you start this vehicle to deactivate the reaction-wheel torque in the lander can. Keeping things simple at the moment, this is to minimise the problems it can cause while you\u0027re trying to turn. Check the action groups in the SPH. In the SPH and VAB screen, just to the left of the vehicle name, are three buttons \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 parts, action groups and crew.

Mr. Kerman\u0027s Electrical Carriage will be placed on the runway, KSP\u0027s physics engine take a second or two to kick-in and then you\u0027ll see the rover and camera \u0027settle\u0027 a little and it is ready for action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at the navball at the bottom of your screen \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the \u0027forward\u0027 direction is taken from the command pod orientation and is currently pointing straight into the sky. The Mk1 lander-can is upright and facing the right way but it\u0027s designed for rockets, not rovers, so KSP incorrectly assumes it will be going upwards. This means that your heading isn\u0027t the way you\u0027re facing and will wave all over the place as you cross slopes at different angles, making navigation difficult at best. For this reason the okto 2 at the top-front of the rover (it\u0027s what the headlight is attached to) is oriented forward properly. Right-click on it and select \u0027control from here\u0027 to align the navball to the horizon. Click the IVA button on your Kerbal\u0027s portrait at the bottom-right of the screen (or press \u0027C\u0027) to see the view from inside the lander-can. Press C again to return to the external view. Unfortunately the navball resets to the command-pod in IVA mode so you\u0027ll have to \u0027control from here\u0027 on the okto 2 again. In later designs, and especially when docking ships, which part you are controlling them from can become very important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite likely that the rover is rolling forward a little by this time (KSP does that) so press \u0027B\u0027 to activate the brakes action group and bring it to a stop. Now click on the Resources button at the top-right of the flight screen \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it looks like a fuel-can \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and check the electrical charge. If it\u0027s night-time this will be draining steadily but otherwise the solar panels should be keeping the batteries topped-up. Electricity is the only fuel/resource that the Electrical Carriage uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Carriage is all in one piece so there are no \u0027stages\u0027 as such but press the spacebar to disable the reaction wheel in the lander-can. This has been set-up as an action group just because it\u0027s easier than right-clicking the parts each time you \u0027launch\u0027 the rover. Experiment with the camera modes (V) - Chase is probably best, with the camera behind the rover \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and try out the light (U) and ladder (G).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrive around KSC and explore the buildings using the WASD keys. These correspond to pushing a joystick forward (W), back (S), left (A) and right (D); accelerating and steering the rover in the corresponding direction. You can slow down by \u0027accelerating\u0027 backwards or use the brakes (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E. Squad have included quite a lot of detail in the KSC model that you\u0027ll otherwise never notice. Between the VAB and SPH, for instance, is a \u0027Mk1 memorial\u0027 statue. Be warned that steering too sharply at speed will cause the rover to roll over. Stop somewhere, extend the ladder (right-click on it and select that action or just press \u0027G\u0027) and \u0027EVA\u0027 your Kerbal.

Aircraft usually use roll instead of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 or at least much more than \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the yaw controls A/D. To turn left or right you roll in that direction and \u0027pull back on the stick\u0027 (S) to pitch the nose \u0027up\u0027 in that direction. The controls work in one of two modes \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 coarse and fine, which are toggled using the Caps-Lock key. In fine mode the pitch/roll/yaw indicators at the bottom-left of the screen change from red to blue and give you much better control of the aircraft. You are strongly advised to use fine controls whenever flying a plane. Fine is less useful for rovers and rockets but you may want it when performing more delicate manoeuvres such as docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also become familiar with the trim controls if you will be flying aircraft much. Trim is used to adjust the \u0027natural\u0027 pitch/roll/yaw of the plane so you don\u0027t have to use the main controls to correct it as much. You adjust trim using the same control-keys but holding the \u0027mod\u0027(ifier) key (not to be confused with installable game mods) at the same time. On Windows \u0027mod\u0027 is the \u0027alt\u0027 key so alt-S, for instance, will increase the pitch trim of the plane, increasing its tendency to nose-up on its own. Exactly how trim should be set depends on each aircraft, its speed, throttle and fuel-load at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION 2: First Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP defaults to \u0027launch\u0027 with 50% throttle (don\u0027t ask me why) and this \u0027plane will fly well at that setting. With the camera and fine controls set, just activate the engine (spacebar=stage or 1=toggle engines) for take-off. Jets take time to \u0027spool up\u0027 to full power so in real life pilots \u0027hold the plane on the brakes\u0027 to prevent it rolling down the runway at low speed.

Retract the landing gear (G). \u003Cstrong\u003EUse short key taps/presses\u003C/strong\u003E as planes are very sensitive to controls. Try to maintain a nose-up pitch of about 10 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 20 degrees. To counteract the nose-down tendency adjust trim-up (alt-S), when you get it right (about one \u0027tick\u0027 above centre on the lower-left indicators) the plane will more or less fly wherever you point it, without WASD correction. BY DESIGN it is harder to control the trainer without adjusting trim. Fly around \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you have plenty of fuel for practice. Do not exceed the operational ceiling and try to avoid hitting the ground or buildings!

A standard procedure is: take-off and climb to 2-6km on heading 090 (East, 90 degrees, the direction the runway faces). Level-off and turn to 0 (North) then 270 (West) degrees. Fly past the runway and continue for ~20km; half-way to the mountains. Turn left to 180 (South) and then back to 90 degrees, reduce throttle (left ctrl-key) to 30% and line-up on the runway. Descend to ~1km at 10km from the runway and 100m down each kilometre closer (so 500m at 5km, etc.). Reduce throttle to just one or two \u0027ticks\u0027 on the navball gauge about 2km from the runway and control descent-rate using pitch and trim as speed decreases. \u0027Flare\u0027 (pitch-up more) to reduce speed and descent rate just before touch-down near the start of the runway, landing at under 100m/s horizontal speed and -10m/s vertical. For bumps immediately put the throttle back to half or more and go around again. It\u0027s relatively easy with this plane and practice works for larger/faster ones; don\u0027t forget you can pause or revert the flight (escape key) whenever you want. Don\u0027t worry too much about landing on the runway, any flatish space will do and there\u0027s plenty of it North of KSC. Also try circuits to the right instead of left and just generally exploring when you have the confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Space)planes are something of a specialism in KSP \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 some people use them all the time and some people never do. This tutorial includes them as a significant and useful aspect of KSP but it is up to you whether you want to spend much time learning to fly them at this stage.

Correct use of trim (alt-WASDQE) makes all the difference between a stable and unstable aircraft. Above their operational ceiling jets will run out of air and \u0027flameout\u0027 - re-igniting when you fall (or throttle) back enough that there is sufficient air again.

Every vehicle needs a manned pod or probe core to control it so start with the Stayputnik Mk1 by clicking on it in the \u0027pods\u0027 tab of the parts list. From \u0027command and control\u0027 select and add a small inline reaction wheel. Switch to the \u0027fuel tanks\u0027 tab and add an FL-T100 fuel tank below the Stayputnik and a Rocomax 48-7S engine, from the \u0027engines\u0027 tab, below the fuel tank. Pretty simple rocket, but it works. To see the performance figures add a (KER) ER-7500 computer flight unit from the \u0027science\u0027 tab or (MJ) MechJeb 2 (AR202 case) from the \u0027control\u0027 tab, depending on the mod(s) you are using. There is no way to see these figures in the game without mods and they are vital to rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E****Save the vehicle once you\u0027ve built it****\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENB: as explained in \u0027flight\u0027 below it is a good idea to put KER/MJ or some other very light object on the front of the rocket so you can tell which way around it is later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort shuts-down the engine while Custom03 (3) toggles it on and off.

As with the other vehicles wait for the physics engine to kick-in, then press \u0027T\u0027 to engage SAS when you see the rocket and camera settle a little. SAS is a stability aid, making use of specific SAS units, inline reaction wheels and the torque provided by most manned pods, that attempts to keep a fixed heading when active or speeds-up the turn rate when not. It can be important for rockets as some of them will tend to fall over on the pad without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe navball will be pointing straight up into the sky, as it did on the rover, but this time that really is the \u0027forward\u0027 direction we want. As with the plane, the primary flight controls are WASDQE and you can toggle coarse/fine with Caps-Lock (you shouldn\u0027t need to with this). Looking at a rocket on the pad the yaw and roll left/right keys (A/D, Q/E) work as you\u0027d expect with \u0027forward\u0027 being towards the top of the rocket. The pitch controls (W/S) can be a little confusing, however, because there is no obvious \u0027up/top\u0027 - as opposed to \u0027forward\u0027 - direction, so what do \u0027pitch up\u0027 (S) and \u0027pitch down\u0027 (W) mean? To understand rocket pitch you have to know that the \u0027top\u0027 of the command pod/probe core is the side which faces right in the VAB when it is first placed, towards you as it appears on the pad. It\u0027s easier to see in the SPH as they are placed right-side-up but rockets are expected to launch standing on end so things are different in the VAB. For this reason it is a good idea to put something light \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 like KER or MJ \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 on that side so you can see where it is in-flight. Alternatively, and more flexibly, get used to using the navball, where the nose indicator is always the right way up and is the ideal way to navigate in space rather than looking at the rocket itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION 4: Up Like A Rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrottle to max (left shift-key/Z) and press space to go there \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 space, that is. Watch the rocket, watch the altimeter, watch the Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, thing to the right of the altimeter), watch the navball and its speed reading. Enjoy the view, especially of the rocket between 7km-26km. When the fuel runs out the rocket will continue upwards a long way. When it starts to fall again (VSI points below horizontal) press F3 for a flight report and check the maximum altitude it reached. If it\u0027s above 69km, congratulations \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you\u0027ve made it into space!

Getting into orbit not only means getting high enough to escape the atmosphere (70km) but also going horizontally fast enough to stay there. The most efficient way to do this is to gradually turn from straight-up on the pad to a heading of 90 degrees and pointing at the horizon around 40km. Don\u0027t worry about it too much at the moment, especially as the Rocket 1A can\u0027t get into orbit anyway (until mission 7), just get the feel of the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION 6: Slow But Sure\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your first couple of flights you should have seen white, then red, atmospheric effects around your rocket as it got faster and faster. This is the same thing that causes burning-up on re-entry and, simply, means you\u0027re going too fast. Specifically, you\u0027re going faster than \u0027terminal velocity\u0027, wasting a lot of energy to atmospheric drag and compressing the air itself so much that it is heating up and, eventually, getting to the point of plasma. That sort of thing can kill your rockets and crews and even if it doesn\u0027t that wasted energy means fuel you can\u0027t use later, in space. Drag means it isn\u0027t worth going any faster than terminal velocity but that velocity itself increases as you go higher and the atmosphere gets thinner \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 there\u0027s less of it to push yourself through. The best ascent profile accelerates very quickly at full throttle to terminal velocity then throttles-back to \u0027only\u0027 accelerate at the same speed terminal velocity is increasing. Beyond about 15km your rockets won\u0027t be able to keep up with this increase anyway so you can go full-throttle again without wasting fuel. The first balancing act of getting into space is that if you go too slowly gravity wins and you waste fuel to lift, if you go too quickly the atmosphere wins and you waste fuel to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave another flight with the Rocket 1A, leave SAS engaged as in the first flight, but this time reduce to half-throttle at about 400m (altimeter at the top of the screen) and put it back to max at 15km. Get another flight report (F3) and compare your maximum height to the first flight. My figures are roughly 148km for the first and 234km for this \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 quite a big improvement and no danger of burning-up (which doesn\u0027t happen in stock KSP anyway, so don\u0027t worry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only trouble with all this is that the sky is not notable for its speed-limit signs. KER/MJ/VOID can tell you when you\u0027re going too fast but otherwise you\u0027ll just have to check and test your designs/throttle against atmospheric effects and the terminal velocity figures for various altitudes (see the wiki and other places). Also note that MJ is an auto-pilot and amongst its Utilities settings is \u0027limit to terminal velocity\u0027. If you enable this MJ will automatically control your throttle for you and, for instance, will reduce then gradually increase it as you get higher rather than just going flat out at 17km. MJ\u0027s about 5% better than my simple instructions above \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 with a maximum altitude of 244km \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 but some people think using an auto-pilot is \u0027cheating\u0027 (I don\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION 7: Orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/hTZmJgi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hTZmJgil.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hTZmJgil.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket 1B In Space\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the rocket has gone up and come more-or-less straight back down. Getting into orbit, so you stay in space, means going horizontally fast enough that you keep missing the ground as you \u0027free fall\u0027 towards it. The ideal \u0027low\u0027 orbit around Kerbin is generally taken as 75km; space starts at 70km, the extra is a safety-margin. As it is the Rocket 1A does not have enough fuel to establish orbit so go back to the VAB and give it a bigger fuel tank (FL-T200 instead of FL-T100 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 save it as Rocket 1B). Note that the \u0027wrong\u0027 way to get to orbit is to go straight up and then turn to go sideways. Instead, as briefly mentioned before, you should gradually turn from straight-up to pointing at the horizon as you climb. The standard ascent instructions given to KSP beginners is \u003Cem\u003E\u0022go straight up to 10km, yaw right (D) to 45 degrees pitch (from 90=straight up). Switch to map mode (M) and when your apoapsis reaches 50km yaw further right to reduce pitch to 20 degrees. When your apoapsis reaches 75km cut the throttle (X), create a manoeuvre node at apoapsis to bring your periapsis above 70km, coast to the node and burn into orbit.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...You probably want to read some \u0027getting into orbit\u0027 tutorials at this point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, as you will see, an awful lot to do and not much time in which to do it.

Orbit means getting high enough and going sideways fast enough that your periapsis (low point of orbit) is over 70km, preferably 75km. You can\u0027t, efficiently, go faster than terminal velocity so may need to throttle-back at lower altitudes and throttle-up as you get higher. NB: the throttle-settings depend entirely on the performance of each craft and those given here are specific to the Rocket 1A/B; don\u0027t expect them to work with other vehicles. The best way to get horizontal orbital speed is to perform a \u0022gravity turn\u0022 during your \u0022ascent burn\u0022. Remember to disengage and re-engage SAS before/after each manoeuvre. Once your apoapsis reaches the desired altitude cut throttle, coast to Ap, then do an \u0022injection burn\u0022 to increase your periapsis to orbital height as well. Cut engine again, wipe the sweat from your brow and breath.

Usual design practice is to treat \u0027the payload\u0027, which has a job to do in space, as completely separate from \u0027the launch vehicle\u0027 (rocket) which gets it there. It is best to design the satellite payloads first then, when you design the launch vehicles, the only things you have to worry about are how much the payload masses and where you have to put it. It would be possible to design and use only the largest launch vehicle for all three satellites but the oversight committee have rejected this in favour of three different vehicles. Starting with the smallest and simplest and gradually building-up will enable KSC to gain early, and cheap, experience before working with bigger payloads and harder objectives.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart small, otherwise you can easily get frustrated.

They will need to have a probe core and carry a SCANSat sensor or other instrument(s) of the same mass and in a lot of ways this is the only payload. For these to function, however, they will need electricity. You can get that with solar panels in sunlight but on the night side of the planet a battery will be necessary and the solar panels will also have to charge this. In practice it is almost impossible to establish and maintain a perfect orbit so some form of propulsion for orbital adjustment and station-keeping is important, even more so in real life. The smallest, lightest fuel tank and engine in KSP are plenty for such small satellites as these \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you\u0027ll use the fuel in short bursts, if at all; first to fine-tune the orbit and then at long intervals to maintain it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch a complete satellite will form the payload for the launch-vehicle and the more it carries (specifically, the higher its mass) the more powerful and therefore bigger and complex the launch-vehicle will need to be. As a rule of thumb rockets may only be 10% efficient \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 meaning 100kg added to the payload results in 1 tonne added to the total launch. With decent design this 10% \u0027payload ratio\u0027 may easily be increased to 15% and good designs can reach 18-20% but that still means even a small increase in the payload has a big knock-on effect. The lightest probe core is the Okto 2, but the heavier Okto includes a reaction wheel, so that\u0027s what we go for. Similarly the Oscar-B fuel tank and LV-1 engines are the lightest. Each SCANSat sensor masses the same (0.03t). As a compromise between minimum-mass and maximum-functionality the satellite design given uses the slightly heavier Z-200 battery instead of a Z-100 and OX-4L solar panels. Planning ahead \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 how long will a satellite spend on the night side of Eeloo? How much power will it use during that time? Will the solar panels be able to power it and recharge the battery during the daylight transit, so far from the sun? This is a tutorial not a walk-through so you\u0027ll have to find those things out for yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstrument particulars: For \u0027placebo\u0027 the pictures illustrate an instrument-payload of one Communotron 88-88 and one Communotron 16.

The SCANSat orbital-sensors themselves are found on the \u0027science\u0027 tab in the VAB/SPH, if you have installed the mod. The \u0027low\u0027 satellite needs to be equipped with a SCAN RADAR altimetry sensor (5-500km, optimal 5km), \u0027mid\u0027 with a SCAN multispectral sensor (5-500km, optimal 250km) and \u0027high\u0027 with a SCAN SAR altimetry sensor (5-800km, optimal 750km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparate groups have been assigned to toggle the engine, instrument(s) and solar panels. The instruments and solar-panels should always be operating in space but can\u0027t be deployed in the atmosphere, during launch, or the drag will rip them off and destroy them. Their operation could be combined into one group but if power is nearly exhausted it may be necessary to turn off the power-consuming sensor while keeping the power-generating panels deployed. It is also a good idea to disable the engines on every vehicle except when using them; at least if you are as ham-fisted as me and make a habit of pressing left-shift at the wrong times, thereby throttling-up and sending the craft off to an unintended destination/death. When assigning action-groups you will save a lot of sanity if you try to standardise the numbers that you use. Throughout this campaign (and almost everything else I do) groups 1-5 are for the vehicles that deliver payloads, 6-8 for the payloads themselves and 9-10 for space-stations/bases. Experiment to find a convention that works for you, otherwise you\u0027ll find yourself switching between craft, forgetting the action-groups and (de)activating the wrong things at the wrong time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort should always turn off engines, and/or take more useful emergency escape action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiv) Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/1qIBGGe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1qIBGGel.png\u0022 alt=\u00221qIBGGel.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANSat Placebo Over Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese satellites are dependent on their launch vehicles to get into space.

This will need to separate from the launch-vehicle once in orbit so a TR-2V stack decoupler (structural tab) goes underneath it. If you are using the Procedural Fairings mod for streamlining (aerodynamic parts tab) add a 1.25m fairing base under the decoupler and, with symmetry 2, enclose the payload in egg-shaped or conic fairings. In order not to leave debris in space (a best practice) the last stage of a launch vehicle should be able to de-orbit itself after separating from its payload. That means it must be an independent vehicle in its own right, however briefly, and will need a probe core. The RC-001S remote guidance unit (RGU) is used here to fit with the fuel-tank size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s now time to start looking at performance figures; TWR (Thrust to Weight Ratio) is an easy concept. TWR is how much harder your engines can push (thrust) up than your mass (weight) is dragging you down. With a TWR lower than 1 your engines can\u0027t even lift the rocket off the ground and you aren\u0027t going to space today. At exactly 1 you can hover or maintain any speed you already have but can\u0027t accelerate away. Obviously then you need a TWR higher than 1 to take-off but less obviously you also don\u0027t want a TWR that is too high, because that would make you accelerate too quickly and exceed terminal velocity (see mission 6 in the previous chapter). In stock KSP an ideal launch TWR is considered to be between around 1.4-2. Putting the same FL-T200 fuel tank and 48-7S engine as used on the Rocket 1A under the RGU gives a TWR of 1.78, which is almost perfect. Another FL-T200 tank, however, adds so much mass that the TWR drops to 1.08, which is too low for comfort \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 stay with the FL-T200/48-7S combination. You can increase the TWR of a rocket by removing excess mass or by adding extra/more powerful engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeltaV is a slightly more difficult concept; it is the amount by which you can change your velocity vector; usually measured in metres per second (m/s). This is a speed, like mph, but as a \u0027vector\u0027 it also has a direction \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 simply put, if you are going \u0027at 80mph\u0027 you must be going in some particular direction. From stopped and with a deltaV of 1,000m/s you could accelerate to 1,000m/s West or 1,000m/s Up, etc. Stopping and turning are the same \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 accelerating to 500m/s East and then slowing down to 0m/s again would also take 1,000m/s. Likewise, you could accelerate to 500m/s North then turn and accelerate 500m/s East, with a resultant velocity vector being the North-east diagonal you\u0027d get if you draw a \u0027500\u0027 line up and another across on a piece of paper (a bit over 707.1m/s). The amount of deltaV a rocket has mainly depends on the amount of fuel it has and how efficient its engines are at using that fuel \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the engine\u0027s Isp, shown in the VAB/SPH. Like TWR it also depends on the vehicle\u0027s mass \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a heavier vehicle will be harder to push than a lighter one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary then, in KSP, engines burn a particular amount of fuel per second to produce a certain amount of thrust. Their thrust must be enough to lift the mass of the rocket with a reasonable acceleration. Depending on how much fuel the engines have and their efficiency that thrust will be able to change the rocket\u0027s speed and direction by a certain amount, less if it is heavier. NB: Stock KSP does not show you these figures. You will either have to work them out by hand every time you make a change to a rocket or use KER/MJ/VOID to display them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the Two-step launch vehicle: we have a rocket with an FL-T200 fuel tank and 48-7S engine giving a TWR of 1.94 and deltaV of 3,459m/s. While the TWR is fine we need at least 4,500m/s deltaV to reach orbit (remember this figure!). In particular, for this our first useful rocket, we want to add some margin for error and de-orbit fuel and would ideally like \u0026gt;5,000m/s deltaV. If we add fuel to increase the deltaV the TWR drops to an unacceptable level so what we have to do is add another \u0027stage\u0027 to the rocket \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 in effect, build a rocket to lift the rocket. Add a TR-18A stack decoupler under the engine, then an FL-T400 fuel tank. This is all much too heavy for a single 48-7S engine to lift but two can; add a TVR-200 stack bi-coupler and two 48-7S engines. This gives a TWR of 1.46 and deltaV of 6,593m/s, as shown in the data sheet. The rocket is a little under-powered at launch (TWR low) but has plenty of fuel (deltaV high). The bottom two engines will launch the rocket, burning through the 180 units of fuel in the FL-T400 tank. When that is empty we will activate the TR-18A decoupler, dropping the now useless engines and tank, and use the \u0027upper stage\u0027 FL-T200/48-7S to complete the launch into orbit. Once in orbit this upper stage will also be jettisoned and the payload is free to continue its mission. Note that however we build the lower stage(s) and whatever they do the stage(s) above them remain complete and intact, just as they were originally designed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally Two-step would have an extra, or more powerful, engine on the bottom stage but this design is sufficient to illustrate a classic, 2 serial stage, strategy for rocket construction. Rocket 1A was simpler, being Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) but such designs are usually not efficient or even possible \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 there has never been a real-world SSTO. Splitting the mass between two or three stages, typically serial-staged like this design, improves efficiency and is the way nearly all Earth rockets are launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two lowest engines must be set in the VAB to the first stage to fire at launch (stage 3 if using procedural fairings, stage 2 otherwise). The stage above/after that has the TR-18A decoupler and upper 48-7S engine. The procedural fairings are jettisoned in the next stage (if you are using them) and, finally, the top/last stage activates the small TR-2V decoupler and the satellite\u0027s LV-1 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with all vehicles the \u0027abort\u0027 action group will shutdown the engines. We have no idea when/if this will be used so ALL the engines should go in here. Action group 3 is used to toggle the launch-vehicle rockets but not the satellite\u0027s, which has already been assigned to group 6. Finally, if you are using them, the streamlined fairings should be jettisoned once the vehicle leaves the atmosphere and before the orbital circularisation burn, so they aren\u0027t left in space as debris. They are therefore assigned to action group 4 in this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite a lot of action groups are being defined now. As I have mentioned, I try to maintain a single convention for them just so I don\u0027t forget which does what. This convention will be followed throughout this tutorial but you will probably want to experiment with your own \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 whatever works for you is best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStage, RCS, SAS \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 generally not used\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGear, Light, Brakes \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 automatic KSP assignments \u002B parachutes\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbort \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 shutdown all engines, other \u0027escape\u0027 options\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECustom01 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Launch Vehicle: jets\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECustom02 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Launch Vehicle: intakes\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom03 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Launch Vehicle: rockets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom04 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Transfer Vehicle: enter orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECustom05 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Transfer Vehicle: operations\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom06 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Payload: engines\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom07 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Payload: instruments\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom08 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Payload: solar panels\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECustom09 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Stations: Engines\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECustom00 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Stations: Instruments\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiv) Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal launches, as you will have learnt, use a gravity turn to the East for efficiency, resulting in an equatorial orbit. That won\u0027t do for the SCANSat satellites though because they would be going over and mapping the same \u0027strip\u0027 of ground around the equator again and again. Instead they need to be placed in a \u003Cem\u003Epolar\u003C/em\u003E orbit \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 crossing the North and South poles. As they orbit the world turns beneath them, presenting a new strip of ground on each pass. Over several orbits these strips add up to give us a complete map of the surface. The optimal height for the SCANSat altimetry sensor, as fitted on the SCANSat Low satellite is 5km. This is not a viable orbital height around Kerbin as it is deep within the atmosphere, so our first mapping mission will be put into a 75km orbit; as low as possible while still being outside the atmosphere. It is still well within the operating range of 5-500km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION 8: 75km Polar Orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove Two-step to the launch pad by clicking \u0027launch\u0027 on the VAB screen or clicking the launch-pad from the KSC screen and selecting it from the vehicle menu. Once the physics engine has engaged press \u0027T\u0027 to engage SAS. Throttle to max and press the spacebar to launch. From now on this sequence will be assumed and not repeated for every launch. Follow your preferred ascent-profile but do your gravity turn to the North (pitch down, W) instead of East. Press the spacebar again to stage \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 jettison the tank/engines \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 when the first stage is exhausted between 14km and 16km. An \u0027advantage\u0027 of the under-powered first stage on Two-step is that you won\u0027t have to worry about throttling-back at terminal velocity, you can just keep full throttle all the way. The upper 48-7S will immediately take over when the lower stage is jettisoned. Cut engine as normal when your apoapsis reaches 75km, set your \u0027circularisation burn\u0027 manoeuvre node and then stage again to jettison the fairings when you leave the atmosphere (69/70km). As these are jettisoned before the circularisation burn is carried out they will fall back into the atmosphere like the first rocket stage and be destroyed without leaving any debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also need to ensure that the vehicle does not run out of electricity at any point. We will use the payload solar-panel for this as it will not detract from the satellite\u0027s functionality later. Consumables (fuel) on a payload should not be touched at all but solar panels won\u0027t be used up so it is \u0027ok\u0027 to make use of them.

These can be seen in the map mode (M) or using KER/MJ/VOID. Map mode will show you the apoapsis and periapsis figures directly but not the inclination. You can get around this by clicking Mun and \u0027set as target\u0027. Since Mun\u0027s orbit is at 0 degrees relative to Kerbin the difference shown at the Ascending and Descending Nodes (AN/DN) of your orbit is also your inclination (it really is a lot easier to use an information mod). If you did your gravity turn directly to the North your orbit will end-up passing East of the pole and the inclination will be less than 90 degrees \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 why? For an \u0027ideal\u0027 orbit we want Ap and Pe to be equal (a circular orbit) and the inclination to be 90 degrees. If you\u0027ve got such a perfect orbit; stop showing off! It\u0027s unlikely that you have though so we will use the satellite\u0027s ability to manoeuvre to improve it. Return to flight mode by pressing M again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the satellite can adjust its orbit we need to separate it from the last stage of the Two-step launch vehicle and, to avoid leaving debris, de-orbit those remains. Stage again to separate the satellite and use \u0027[\u0027 or \u0027]\u0027 to switch between vehicles. The satellite should be fine for the moment because it has the solar panel but now Two-step is running on the residual charge left in its probe core. Before this expires turn the vehicle so it is facing retrograde on the navball and throttle-up to burn all the remaining fuel and push it back into the atmosphere. Cut engines (X) when the fuel is used up or KSP will still think you\u0027re \u0022under acceleration\u0022 and not let you switch to another vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t be able to switch back to the satellite with \u0027[\u0027/\u0027]\u0027 because it\u0027ll be too far away. Change to map mode again and you\u0027ll see Two-step\u0027s orbit-line in blue, hitting the surface, and the SCANSat Low satellite\u0027s orbit-line in white and going completely around the planet unless you\u0027ve done something wrong. Click on and \u0027switch to\u0027 the satellite in order to take control of it again. Now use its engine and fuel to make the orbit as circular as you can (equal Ap and Pe) and with an inclination of 90 degrees. You will probably need to do several, small, adjustments at Ap, Pe, AN and DN to achieve this but don\u0027t worry, you have plenty of fuel. You don\u0027t need to be exact, as long as the Pe is above 70km (otherwise each time the satellite orbits it will re-enter the atmosphere, be slowed by drag and the orbit will be lowered even more until, sooner or later, the satellite falls to the ground). The inclination needs to be at least 80 degrees to ensure that the satellite \u0027sees\u0027 the poles. How much time you want to spend perfecting the orbit within those bounds is up to you. You are recommended to disable the engine (action group 6) once you\u0027ve finished making adjustments, just so you don\u0027t wreck the whole orbit by accidentally pressing \u0027shift\u0027 at the wrong moment; just remember to re-activate it later, should you come back to make further changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore leaving the satellite make sure it is oriented (WASDQE) so that the solar-panel catches the sunlight properly. If it is blocked by the body of the satellite or is edge-on to the sun it will be useless, your satellite will run out of power and cease functioning. If that happens your only option is to \u0027terminate\u0027 the satellite flight in the tracking centre and try again with another launch. Engage SAS (T) so that the satellite stays in this orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce all orbital and orientation adjustments are complete activate the SCANSat sensor (action group 7), press esc(ape) or mouse-over the altimeter and return to the Space Centre. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you have carried-out your first useful mission and mapping is underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/PEMmgJW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PEMmgJWl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PEMmgJWl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANSat Low 7.5km Over Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ev) Notes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload and launch-vehicle should be designed in that order.

Using radial decouplers instead of a stack decoupler allows us to build out rather than up, which can be useful.

Whether you prefer radial boosters to just placing them serially, with a bi-, tri- or quad- coupler as on Two-step is up to you.

The answer to most design problems is not solid fuel boosters (more commonly known as SRBs or Solid \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERocket\u003C/span\u003E Boosters). They are used in Sidestep to illustrate the differences between them and \u0027normal\u0027 liquid-fuel engines but, looking ahead, are not used in any other designs throughout this tutorial. Again, this is rather a matter of preference; SRBs give a lot of thrust for a relatively short duration and can be very cost-effective but are less controllable than liquid-fuel engines. They are, however, heavy so should only ever be used in a first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnable symmetry-2 (bottom-left of the VAB screen) and add the radial decouplers and SRBs to the upper-stage/core stack.

Let\u0027s face it, we really do want the Kerbal sat inside during launch and re-entry anyway. The Mk1 lander can is still lighter than the command pod but isn\u0027t intended for atmospheric re-entry so isn\u0027t realistic to use either. You may well decide to use it anyway in your more complex missions but this design, based on a Mk1 command pod, is still light enough to be easy to launch and \u0027looks right\u0027. Safety redundancy is also a feature of this design; the parachute alone should be enough for landing safely, the legs make the vehicle more robust and the engine can use any residual fuel to make touchdown even more gentle. Three landing-legs are used because 3-legged stools don\u0027t wobble! More legs are likely to just add unwanted mass without making the landing more stable so aren\u0027t worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelop the habit of always putting solar panels and ladders on things.

Below, you will also see that a ladder is useful just to hang on to. There is no additional battery on this design; the only charge it can store is in the command pod (50). Keep this in mind and make sure the solar-panel is facing the sun after every manoeuvre. In as much as the Orbiter has any ongoing use it is in investigating anomalies on Kerbin (below). For this you will need the SCANSat BTDT sensor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat just leaves the propulsion.

That means that although the basic core \u002B 2-boosters design is similar it needs more powerful engines and considerably more fuel. Complete with the Orbiter payload LV-2-O masses just under 18t which represents a payload ratio of 9.55% - barely adequate. An adequate launch-vehicle should provide a payload-ratio of at least 10% (9 tonnes or less of launch-vehicle per tonne of payload) but this design does a lot better than the 4.49% of Quickstep in the previous chapter! It can be difficult to make an efficient launcher for small payloads, and 2 tonnes is very small, because there are few options available for fuel tanks and engines. Nevertheless 15% payload ratio is a reasonable target and 20% (9 tonnes of launch-vehicle for every 2 tonnes of payload) is sometimes obtainable. The vehicles in this tutorial are intended to illustrate design methods rather than efficiency but are getting better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel-lines on this design must be attached first on the booster tanks and then on the core. There are arrows on the lines themselves that indicate this is the way fuel will flow. Using this arrangement the core engine will first take fuel from the booster tanks, as will the booster engines themselves. When these tanks are exhausted they can be jettisoned and the core uses its own, still full, tanks for the rest of the flight. This is known as \u0027onion\u0027 staging because the outer layers are used/peeled-off completely before the inner one(s) are touched. In section 9 is an example of symmetry-3 onion staging with two outer layers. Fuel-lines are the difference between parallel and onion staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing-up and jettisoning as many tanks/engines as possible using fuel-lines is the key to improved staging efficiency. You should note, however, that no rockets have used fuel-lines like this in real life, even though the concept of drop-tanks and side-boosters is common. For this reason some people on the forums consider KSP fuel-lines \u0027wrong\u0027.

This is relatively expensive but is cheaper the slower you\u0027re moving because there\u0027s less orbital speed to counter/change.

You may want to use the helmet lights (L) as well. There are no instruments displayed while you\u0027re controlling a Kerbal on EVA so you\u0027ll have to do everything by eye. Use fine controls (caps-lock) and very light taps of the keys to keep the speed slow and don\u0027t go too far from the pod while you\u0027re learning.

While floating in space if you are ever close enough to grab hold of the pod (or ladder, if you extended it) you will be prompted to press F to do so. Re-boarding the pod (not just grabbing it) will refuel your RCS pack infinitely and without affecting the pod\u0027s own supply.

Changing orbital altitude is relatively cheap, changing planes (inclination) isn\u0027t but gets cheaper the higher your orbit. You have infinite EVA fuel if you keep re-boarding the command pod but if it runs out in space your Kerbal is stuck \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 be careful! Use very short taps and keep your (relative) speed down. After re-entry, drag will make you fall short of your initially-predicted landing site. If you haven\u0027t GOT a predicted landing-site because your periapsis is above-ground it will still be reduced by drag as long as you are flying through the atmosphere. This \u0027aerobraking\u0027 is an efficient way of reducing your orbit without using (much) fuel, but it may take several orbits before the periapsis finally reaches the ground. Not to be confused with \u0027lithobreaking\u0027, a common forum phrase. Atmosphere is where the air is, the \u0027lithosphere\u0027 of a body is where the rocks are (i.e.; stopping by hitting the ground \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 not generally recommended!). If you don\u0027t have enough fuel to lower your periapsis into the atmosphere at all... you\u0027re stuck until you can launch a rescue mission. One, very Kerbal, solution is to \u0027get out and push\u0027 - you have infinite EVA fuel so get the Kerbal to push the pod retrograde using the suit RCS, slowing the vehicle and lowering its periapsis. Re-board the pod to refuel the suit, repeat as required until the periapsis is in the atmosphere and aerobraking will do the rest for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESECTION 4: PROJECT ADDENDUM (Back To The Hanger)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIdentity;Persistence Addendum 1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Orbiter Mk2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBackground;The engineers and ground-crew in the Spaceplane Hanger (SPH) are a bit annoyed that they haven\u0027t been asked to contribute to the space program at all.

To dock it\u0027ll need the clamp-o-tron and the rocket fuel fuselage includes oxidiser for in-space work. During ascent and landing the engine takes oxygen from the atmosphere instead and the nacelles just contain liquid fuel. They and the intakes on them provide this oxygen that the engine uses. Tweak the control-surfaces (canards and elevons) as indicated in the table above. There is one crafty trick to building this spaceplane \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 in order to put the nacelles in the middle of the wings, as shown, you will first need to put them on the top or bottom of them. Then use the \u0027offset\u0027 button at the top-left of the SPH screen and \u0027pull\u0027 the nacelles into the correct position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines are very fuel-efficient compared to rockets in KSP but can only work in an oxygen atmosphere. In space spaceplanes need a rocket-engine for thrust, just like any other vehicle. Generally they have turbojet engines for in-atmosphere work and normal rockets for orbital manoeuvres but this design uses a rapier engine instead. The rapier engine can work like a jet in atmosphere and a rocket the rest of the time, so it is simpler. The drawback is that it doesn\u0027t offer the same thrust or efficiency as the specialised engines, so it is a matter of taste whether you want to use it in your own designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the prologue the balance of aircraft was skipped and for rockets it rarely matters as long as they are symmetrical. Aircraft rely much more on their aerodynamics though and the relative positions of the Centre Of Mass (CoM) and Centre of Lift (CoL) is vital \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 as is the placement of the rear landing-gear in relation to the CoM. The Centre of Mass is the \u0027balance point\u0027 of a vehicle \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 if a model were suspended on a string from this point it would stay level. All forces acting on the plane are, in effect, pushing or rotating this point. The engine will turn the plane as it burns, for instance, unless its Centre of Thrust (CoT) is directly in line with the CoM. (Technically, the \u003Cem\u003Eaxis\u003C/em\u003E of thrust, opposite to the arrow shown in the SPH, has to run through the CoM). Similarly, if the CoL is in front of the CoM the plane will tend to flip nose-up and, if it is behind, it will tend to flip nose-down. A plane that wants to nose-up sounds good but, in practice, will tend to \u0027back flip\u0027 and become uncontrollable. In practice you should adjust the wings and control-surfaces backwards and forwards so that the CoL is just behind the CoM. Pitch-up controls and trim (S, alt-S) should be able to counter the tendency you then build-in for the plane to nose-down. If you move the CoL too far back you\u0027ll have a plane that won\u0027t nose-up and climb at all, but at least then you don\u0027t get off the runway! The canards help with takeoff by adding extra pitch-authority (strength of the controls) ahead of the CoM and, especially, lift the nose during launch. Another thing that may stop your aircraft taking-off at all is the position of the rear landing-gear. If these are in front of the CoM (or very close to it) the plane will tip back onto the engine on the runway, which isn\u0027t good. If they are too far back, however, the wing-lift won\u0027t be able to rotate the plane\u0027s body around them so, again, you\u0027ll never climb. Ideally they should be as close behind the CoM as you can put them without the plane tipping-up on the runway. There are some very good spaceplane tutorials on the forums and you will probably need to read several of them before becoming proficient at designing your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first vehicle in this campaign tutorial to feature RCS fuel and thrusters. These are low-velocity jets rather like spray-cans that are used to gently \u0027nudge\u0027 a vehicle\u0027s attitude and position, normally during docking. Mainly, these are the only easy propulsion tools for moving your vehicle \u0027sideways\u0027 to align with another docking-port. They give much better low-speed fine control but also need to be placed in a balanced arrangement. The most flexible setup is to have 4 thrusters around the nose of a vehicle and 4 around the tail, placed at an equal distance from the CoM so they rotate the vehicle smoothly around it. The arrangement shown is somewhat simpler in that there is only one set of 4 thrusters, arranged around the CoM itself. If you do not balance the thrusters around or on the CoM you will get translation while trying to rotate and vice-versa. Stock KSP doesn\u0027t show you the CoT for thrusters but the RCS Balancer mod will, should you install it. RCS uses monopropellant instead of liquid fuel, it is included in all command pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VNjlcK2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VNjlcK2l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VNjlcK2l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiters Mk2 Rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gear, lights and brakes are all standard, apply to the landing-gear and are set by KSP automatically.

Ascent is split into three main phases, instead of a single gravity turn: get above high-drag air, get speed in low-drag air, complete ascent using closed-cycle when the air runs out. Launch, on the runway, toggle fine-controls (caps lock), chase-mode camera and the engine. Engage SAS, throttle to full, rotate to a 50-degree climb at 60m/s, retract gear, maintain climb to 20km then pitch-down to 10-degrees for the \u0027speed run\u0027. Your objective through the middle phase is to build as much \u003Cstrong\u003Ehorizontal\u003C/strong\u003E speed as possible with the air-breathing (jet) mode and because the air gets thinner (lower drag, higher terminal velocity) as you go up, the higher you go the faster you can go. Because the air gets thinner though, the higher you go the faster you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehave\u003C/span\u003E to go to get enough intake air for air-breathing to work. Climb too slowly and drag will keep your speed down. Climb too fast and the rapier will get insufficient air and switch to closed-cycle (rocket) mode. The initial climb is just to get to the relatively-thin air above 20km, from here it\u0027s a balancing-act to regulate your vertical speed so that your horizontal speed continues to increase as fast as possible. With this design you should be able to get to 36km and 2,100m/s before the engine switches to closed-cycle. Then press 2 to close the air-intakes and reduce drag. The final push to orbit in closed-cycle is similar to any launch but let your apoapsis go to 80km or so because you\u0027re still relatively low in the atmosphere and will lose more height to drag than with a normal rocket ascent. Circularise at 75km as usual. All this final phase should only take a very small amount of fuel and oxidiser and even with the fuel used in air-breathing mode is much more cost-effective than a pure rocket \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 plus you haven\u0027t had to jettison any expensive components.

Once back in the thick air below 10km open the air-intakes (2) again and toggle the engine (3) to air-breathing. Throttle-up to 30-50% and slowly bring the nose up (S and alt-S for trim) so that you are flying more-or-less level and back in control around 4km above and from your landing-site, ideally the KSC runway. You may want to dive some more to get on your preferred approach-path and can then reduce throttle to follow the glide-slope to a normal landing. Good luck, remember to lower your landing gear. (Assuming you are aiming for the KSC runway be aware that the mountains to the West of KSC reach around 4km themselves \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you don\u0027t need to come down that far West anyway, 20km from the runway is more than enough).

As you will have seen in previous rocket launches, a decoupler stays attached to one stage, it is the part to which the arrows on it point that is decoupled. Usually that means the decoupler stays attached to a depleted lower-stage and the whole thing returns to the atmosphere and is destroyed.

At the very least we don\u0027t want any of them to have to carry the mass of a decoupler with them, but in addition it is often impossible to place a decoupler without fouling an engine or instrument. Separators, such as the TR-2C used here, are different in that they detach from both sides. When you \u0027stage\u0027 the top satellite, for instance, not only does it detach from the separator, leaving its engine clear, but the separator also detaches from the satellite beneath it, leaving the instrument and solar-panel clear.

The first question then is, what does it take to get to the moons, then what does it take to establish orbits around them? What, in fact, is it that we need to know in order to design for such a mission? The answer is very simple \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to get to the moons all you need to know is the deltaV to match orbital plane around Kerbin with your target then raise your orbit to match it. Plane-changes and Hohmann transfers to higher orbits are both manoeuvres you should have become familiar with so, for Mun at least, the only other thing you need to know is given by a deltaV map, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECartographer Light will be launched into Low Kerbin Orbit (LKO: a standard 75km, equatorial orbit) so add-up the numbers shown from there (bottom of the diagram) to Low Mun Orbit. That is; 680 \u002B 180 \u002B 80 = 940m/s to get to Mun (a fly-by) plus 230 = 1,170m/s to establish orbit around it. In the next chapter we\u0027ll talk about landing (the last 580m/s) and coming back but these satellites will do neither; so 1,170m/s is our requirement for Mun. The individual satellites will need to transfer from Low Mun Orbit to their operating altitudes but they have plenty of their own propulsion for that, as you will have seen. Going to Minmus is similar but slightly more complex in that it is not on an equatorial orbit around Kerbin. To get there Cartographer Light will need to perform a plane-change first of 340m/s, less if you launch into a more compatible orbit. The trick here is that you not only need to get the right inclination (6 degrees) but at the right time, or you could end-up 6 degrees in the wrong direction, for a total miss of 12 degrees; check the tutorials on this. Once you are orbiting in the correct plane the Hohmann transfer is as for Mun and will total; 340 (plane-change) \u002B 680 \u002B 180 (as Mun) \u002B 70 \u002B 90 = 1,360m/s (flyby) \u002B 70 = 1,430m/s (orbit). Note that the Orbiter described at the beginning of this chapter has enough deltaV for a fly-by of Mun but not Minmus. It doesn\u0027t quite have enough to orbit even Mun (and wouldn\u0027t be able to get back if it did).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor such space-only operations there is no need to worry about TWR as we don\u0027t have to fight out of the gravity-well, any thrust will adjust our orbit. Having a high TWR means a vehicle can accelerate (apply the deltaV) more quickly and therefore you won\u0027t need to burn the engines for so long but, although helpful, it is usually not worth adding engine mass just to achieve it. My patience tends to run out with a TWR below about 0.2 and I try to design for at least 0.4 but you may prefer a lower figure with lighter engines and consequently lower overall mass to launch in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur transfer vehicle therefore needs at least 1,430m/s deltaV to deliver the satellite stack. We\u0027re meant to be \u0022halfway to anywhere\u0022 once we\u0027re in orbit though so it\u0027s worth asking how much harder would it be to go, well, anywhere? Ike, Duna\u0027s moon, is the next easiest (lowest deltaV requirement) place to orbit, followed by Duna itself (without using atmospheric braking). They only need 1,550m/s and 1,700m/s respectively, including plane-change and, given that the plane-change is so much less than for Minmus, are in some ways easier. Interplanetary takes less than half the deltaV required to get to orbit! In fact, for the 4,500m/s it took to get to Kerbin orbit we can transfer to low orbits around all but Eeloo (4,790m/s), Jool, Bop, Moho and Kerbol (the sun) itself. The hardest of the planets, Moho, only requires 6,640m/s, so not wildly more than we\u0027re used to building. That, however, is from LKO so we\u0027ll soon be launching payloads (the transfer vehicles plus \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E payloads) bigger than the total launch-vehicles we\u0027ve so-far seen. Low-orbit around Kerbol itself requires 33,680m/s deltaV according to the map and is outside the scope of this tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022How hard is it to transfer to and orbit (from Kerbin LKO, m/s)?\u0022 table\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMun;1,170\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMinmus;1,430\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIke;1,550\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDuna;1,700\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEve;2,880\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGilly;2,950\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDres;3,860\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETylo;3,860\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVall;3,890\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPol;4,040\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELaythe; 4,360 \u0026lt;- Kerbin orbit 4,500m/s \u0022Halfway to anywhere\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEeloo;4,790\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJool;5,170\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBop;5,920\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoho;6,640\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbol;33,680\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eii) Construction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENB: The TT18-A launch stability enhancer (launch clamp) in the illustration is only there to hold the rocket up for the screenshot; you don\u0027t need or want one for the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we were designing for lunar then we wouldn\u0027t need very much at all \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 just a 90-unit FL-T200 fuel tank and another LV-1 engine, as used on the satellites themselves, gives 1,831m/s deltaV and a just-about acceptable 0.19 TWR.

Four, with the necessary fuel to reach orbit, give a good launch TWR of 1.74, so the most sensible \u0027onion\u0027 arrangement is core \u002B 3 boosters, unlike the 2 boosters used in previous designs. Most people would consider that this results in a fairly slim, aerodynamic and aesthetically pleasing rocket (not illustrated but similar to the 2nd Stage picture). There is a lot of fuel to carry in the core and each of the boosters, however, and we can improve the efficiency by moving this to a second, outer, onion \u0027layer\u0027 (as illustrated in the launch picture). Note that the fuel-lines run from the outer layer to the inner and from the inner to the core. At launch, then, all the engines will take their fuel from the outer tanks until they are depleted and jettisoned. This means those tanks are jettisoned as soon as possible, the rest of the vehicle therefore doesn\u0027t need to carry their extra mass for long and, overall, needs less fuel and is thus lighter for the same payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo extra thrust is required so the outer layer consists of fuel tanks without engines, known as \u0027drop\u0027 or \u0027slack\u0027 tanks. In other circumstances it may be useful to also add additional early-jettison engines for initial launch thrust. In general, radial, parallel and onion staging can be taken to as many layers as you wish and more is, roughly, more efficient but there are several problems. First, you may just find your rocket falling apart on the launch pad because the joints between layers are not strong enough to support the outer ones. If it survives that the \u0027shear\u0027 force between layers/stages that have different TWRs may tear the rocket apart during launch. Thirdly, while drop tanks have been a common feature of long-range aircraft for many decades, the use of fuel-lines in this way is generally unrealistic and multiple layers is unaerodynamic. Finally, and for some people fatally, your vehicles start to take on an ugly \u0027pancake\u0027 aspect. EAS-4 struts can help with the first two of these issues; how important the other two are is up to you. As a rule I try to keep my designs to core \u002B 1 layer, although that layer may contain more than 3 boosters, as will be shown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn additional problem with symmetry 3 has nothing to do with structural integrity, realism or aesthetics but is, unfortunately, an artefact of computers and, in particular, the Unity engine used by KSP. Rotation (pitch and yaw) are worked-out in 2-dimensions by the game itself and it sometimes has trouble with symmetry-3, which it can\u0027t apportion equally. This can lead to unwanted spin (roll) in the third dimension due to rounding and other errors. In practice this is not something I\u0027ve had trouble with but have been warned about by Vanamonde and other people who have played KSP for a number of years. (Both the lunar-landers in the next chapter use symmetry-3, if only slightly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/DuZT5up\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DuZT5upl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DuZT5upl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-6-O \u002B Cartographer Light 3rd Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with all vehicles; abort shuts-down the engines while Custom03 (3) toggles them.

Perform a Hohmann transfer to a 250km orbit (at apoapsis burn retrograde to lower your periapsis to 250km then circularise at that, new, periapsis), stage, place and activate SCANSat Mid.

This is easiest after launching to a normal equatorial orbit, before the transfer burn. On the other hand it is most efficient to launch into the correct plane in the first place, if you can. Plane-changes are most efficient with a high apoapsis, as you may have tested, so intermediate between a perfect launch and plane-change in LKO you might try raising your apoapsis very high (to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI), plane-changing there, dropping apoapsis to get a Minmus encounter and then circularising into orbit as before. You can also include the plane-change in your transfer burn with a bit of fiddling-around.

Rendezvous and docking are not required for the other missions in this chapter but now is the time to practice these skills; they will be necessary for the future and are not things most people learn easily. Landing on the moons is also likely to require practice, as you can\u0027t just parachute the pods down as on Kerbin itself.

A \u0027better\u0027 lander, Fat Sally, is presented below (section 5) and is even capable of landing on and returning from Ike, Duna\u0027s moon. Such a mission is not detailed here because it seems unrealistic to send a single Kerbal unsupported on such a long voyage. It shows how capable small vehicles can be though (and we\u0027re still in the realm of \u0027small\u0027 here) and you should have the necessary interplanetary skills as well, from using Cartographer Light. Should you be feeling cruel and don\u0027t care about getting your Kerbals back Long Tom and Fat Sally can both get manned missions to Duna.

Cartographer Light had that many but three of them were the virtually-identical satellites. Here, each stage has a distinct purpose and must be considered separately, from top to bottom as they will appear in the final design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Kerbin Recovery Stage: All that needs to return to Kerbin is the command pod. For that to happen safely, it\u0027ll need a parachute. I\u0027ve also put the solar panel and BTDT sensor on this stage as they look a bit more aerodynamic here than on the lower stages. Ah well, every design is a compromise in practice. As with Orbiter you can tweak the monopropellant out of the command pod to save a little mass, as this vehicle will not dock. Done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Return Stage: To get the recovery stage from the surface of Minmus back to Kerbin will need 1,610m/s deltaV, 1,750m/s from Mun (from table above). The payload mass (recovery stage) is 0.935t plus a decoupler, ladder so our Kerbal can reach the surface and return while we\u0027re landed on the moons and a battery to supplement the pod\u0027s power. Using the trusty 48-7S engine we need a bit less than 90 units of fuel for this so I have used an FL-T100 and three ROUND-8 toroidal tanks (you may just use an FL-T200 tank if you prefer). Done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Landing Stage: Actually landing on Minmus/Mun will require 180/580m/s. An FL-T100 and (another) 48-7S is sufficient, even with the decoupler and landing-legs, to give 643m/s. Although this is more than we \u0027should\u0027 need it provides a margin-for-error so I do not recommend reducing it. Done. You can use a more conventional-looking 4 legs if you prefer but the extra one will add mass. While it is possible to land without legs it\u0027s important to keep the vehicle upright after landing so you can lift-off again! Some people prefer to build a stable base for landers using cubic octagonal struts \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it\u0027s up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Transfer Stage: Before any of that can happen Long Tom has to get everything from LKO to the moon and, for an easier landing, into orbit around it. From the Cartographer Light flights we already know that\u0027ll take 1,430m/s for Minmus and, with yet another decoupler and 48-7S engine, that\u0027ll take an FL-T100 and an FL-T200 fuel tank. Finally done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll-up Long Tom is 0.8t lighter than Cartographer Light, with comparable payloads (0.94t command pod \u002B parachute versus 0.774t satellites \u002B fairings). It could be made lighter still by reducing the margin-for-error on each stage and, possibly, by splitting the return stage even more. In some ways though Long Tom takes the idea of designing a vehicle-stage for each mission-stage too far. Fat Sally, later, is both simpler and more capable.

As Long Tom is not as heavy as either launch-vehicles\u0027 designed payloads they will have enough fuel left to perform the required plane-change, saving fuel in the later stages. You may even use them to start the transfer burn (they won\u0027t have enough fuel to complete it) but that probably means leaving them as space-debris, unless you terminate them in the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike Cartographer Light and the SCANSat satellites you want to place Long Tom in an equatorial, preferably Eastward (anti-clockwise), orbit around Minmus. This is because that is the way the moons rotate and, just as on Kerbin, you can use the surface rotation-speed to your advantage; a slightly reduced deltaV requirement. Your target altitude should be 7-10km, although you may prefer to circularise higher than that initially and then Hohmann transfer to the lower orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that Long Tom only has a single fixed solar panel, not the multiple 6x1 sun-tracking ones of Cartographer Light/satellites.

If possible, aim for one of the large, flat \u0027frozen lakes\u0027. Quicksave before starting to land. Read-up on landing tutorials; the easiest way is to keep your navball heading indicator on the retrograde marker. Aim to touch down at less than 10m/s vertical speed and with almost no horizontal movement. Note that Minmus\u0027s gravity is so low it is quite easy to accidentally start ascending again, use low throttle! Jettison the transfer stage when it\u0027s spent or before touching-down in any case. Extend the landing legs! If you aren\u0027t using SAS already, engage it once you touch-down so that the vehicle doesn\u0027t tip over.

Press R to activate the spacesuit RCS pack and have a fly around. It is even possible for your Kerbal to reach orbit again, just on RCS.

Critically, the important features of a lander should be low CoM and wide leg-base, neither of which Long Tom has. At the same time it was decided to see what design optimisation was possible in order to remain under 5t while including more fuel, either as a greater margin-for-error or to allow Fat Sally to carry-out more complex missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe recovery stage of Fat Sally is essentially the same as Long Tom\u0027s except that the ladder has been moved up onto the pod itself. This is because the TR-18A decoupler has been replaced with a TR-2V, saving 35kg. The TR-2V works perfectly well even if it is the \u0027wrong\u0027 size so why waste the mass. Remember, every 100kg saved on the payload is potentially 1 tonne saved from the launch-vehicle. Little changes like this can seem silly but they add up and their knock-on effects can be enormous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, Fat Sally\u0027s return (centre) stage is the same as Long Tom\u0027s but with one more ROUND-8, which is a consequence on dividing-up the fuel later. Using onion-staging for the rest of the vehicle keeps the CoM low, gives the necessary wide base to the landing legs and, as a bonus, keeps the core 48-7S engine clear so we don\u0027t need to add any others (saving another 0.2t over Long Tom). When considering lander engine(s) it is important that their TWR is greater than 1 for their target body, otherwise they won\u0027t be able to brake to a halt during landing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 which means lithobraking (i.e.; crashing)! Landers are usually required to be able to take-off again as well, of course, so if they are intended to land on a body with an atmosphere they will ideally be able to reach the local terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drop-tanks attached radially share the fuel-load with the core and feed it with the fuel-lines, hence it is onion, not radial, staged. The nosecones are just for aesthetics/aerodynamics and a bit more mission-mass has been saved by attaching them with decouplers and jettisoning them out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little more mass is also shaved off by not using radial decouplers (0.025t each). Cubic octagonal struts are instead placed on the core stage, with more TR-2V decouplers on them. This saves 0.01t each (the struts are massless in flight) and whether it is worth it or not is up to you.

By using radial staging rather than serial we can have more engines working at once, by making them parallel we can use the \u0027core\u0027 centre engines as well, right from launch. The core then needs more fuel than the booster stages so that it can continue to burn after they are jettisoned. Adding fuel lines from the booster tanks to the core in an onion-staging strategy both uses the outer-layer fuel faster and keeps the core stage fully-fuelled. This takes us as far as LV-2-O in the previous chapter and this core \u002B 2-booster design is very flexible and efficient over a wide range of payload mass (with different engines and amounts of fuel). With LV-6-O, however, we needed the thrust from 4 engines rather than the 3 the core\u002B2 allows and so I simply made it core\u002B3. For heavier designs you can, of course, proceed to core\u002B4, 5 or 6 (more will probably not fit around the core). The drawback with core\u002B6 is that all 6 outer-layer tanks have to be used before any are jettisoned, so the extra mass has to be carried for longer. Core\u002B3\u002B3, as in LV-6-O means the outermost 3 are used and discarded much earlier, with improved efficiency. Multiple onion-layers introduce their own problems though \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 not least of which are the physical ones of having tanks attached to tanks, attached to tanks and the wide, pancake, appearance of the rocket. A convenient solution to this is attach all the outer tanks to the core (core\u002B6) so the rocket is thinner and more robust but to run the fuel-lines as if they were core\u002B3, as in the diagram below. The logical, fuel, connections are the same as core\u002B3\u002B3 with its efficiency advantages but the physical, decoupler, connections are the same as core\u002B6, with its structural ones \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the best of both worlds. If the core is a 2.5m tank, 8 1.25m ones will fit around it and can be connected as core\u002B4\u002B4 in a very similar way. Thus onion is all about arranging tanks and fuel-lines with symmetry in order to maximise staging efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus staging is the special-case of onion-staging using symmetry-2. Since the whole point is to use stages as quickly as possible, and it is quicker to use and jettison 2 tanks instead of 3 (or more), this is the optimal staging strategy for mass-optimisation. We can\u0027t just use and jettison 1 tank at a time, except in the core, because it would unbalance our rocket to drop a tank from just one side; that\u0027s why symmetry-2 is the minimum and optimum. The physical arrangement maintains the robust design of 6 tanks around the core but optimises staging by linking them in an asparagus core\u002B2\u002B2\u002B2 arrangement with fuel-lines. While it is possible to extend staging to additional \u0027layers\u0027, as in LV-6-O, just by spiralling-out it is rarely worthwhile unless you are chasing the best payload-ratio possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice it can be fiddly to attach the necessary decouplers, fuel-lines and possibly struts for asparagus staging and it uses a lot of parts. While optimal for mass-efficiency (payload ratio) you may prefer to stick with the simpler construction of serial or parallel staging. Asparagus is usually no harder to build than other onion-staging strategies though as it is only the fuel-lines and staging of decouplers that is different. The other great advantage of onion, and especially asparagus, staging is that each stage may have different, or no, engines to \u0027tune\u0027 the TWR in a very simple way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Ms4zFVN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ms4zFVNl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ms4zFVNl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an 8 tonne payload plus decoupler and RGU the core can be formed with an FL-T800 fuel tank and aerospike engine for a TWR of 1.26. While this is low it will only be used alone for the last burn into orbit and circularisation, where raw power is not so important. Adding the first booster-stage with its 2 aerospike engines increases the TWR to 2.04 for the \u0027race to space\u0027 after the gravity-turn, when terminal velocity is no longer a limiting factor. For the second booster stage more thrust from more engines is not necessary and even with more fuel the TWR only drops to 1.42 so this stage is left as \u0027slack\u0027 or drop tanks. Finally, for the third booster stage (first to be jettisoned) more engines are again required, leaving the final launch TWR as 1.79. This is only one of several valid tank/engine-arrangements that will deliver the required deltaV to reach orbit; you may care to experiment with different combinations and different engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eiii) Staging And Action Groups\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/3KZK6xp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3KZK6xpl.png\u0022 alt=\u00223KZK6xpl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFat Sally Lander Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups are the usual shutdown and toggle for all engines.

Amusingly perhaps, with a longer, thinner payload like the Cartographer vehicles those same people will see no problem. Yet other people object to asparagus not on aesthetic grounds but because the idea of infinite-flow fuel-lines passing through several layers of tank is just not realistic. Possibly that\u0027s just a difference in Kerbal and human technology but, much more plausibly, were all that fuel really spiralling-around the core (as in the robust design) in real life it would cause the whole rocket to spin an equal and opposite amount \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 much like a helicopter that doesn\u0027t have a tail-rotor to stabilise it.

Well, you could be launching at any time; morning, noon or night. In the morning the sun will be in the East \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to the right \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 so the solar panel will be blocked during its vertical ascent until far enough through the gravity turn to get sunlight from almost directly ahead. That should be enough to keep things powered and, initially the battery/pod will be fully charged so early exposure isn\u0027t important. At noon the sun will be directly overhead so the panel should end-up getting maximum exposure after the gravity turn and in the afternoon you still get shallow-angle exposure, opposite to a morning launch. At night you\u0027re not going to get any sunlight wherever you put the panel (duh!) but once in orbit you have plenty of time to roll the vehicle before dawn. For any daytime launch the sun will be be above you and with a standard gravity turn leaves the left of the ship pointing up; a simple little consideration, but one that can be very important, considering how critical electricity is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s a bit of totally-useless real-life trivia about mission 28: When Apollo 11 landed on the moon the winning entry in a competition to name a newly-built pub was \u0027The Conquered Moon\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-10T21:28:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2015 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Himynameisjake","CreatedById":101602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T01:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty legit work, though I would re-size your imgur embeds to fit on page, that was the most distracting part for me anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T16:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree - any idea how?

In this case the two small ports under the crew cabins are intended for scooters (similar to last chapter) or other small personnel transports so the monopropellant tanks are kept out of the way, on top of the cabins. The four ports around the cupola are for other small ancillary vehicles such as RCS/Ion tugs, lander drones or satellites-in-transit. The large docking port at the bottom is for a tractor vehicle (next section) and the two at the sides for fuel modules (later in the chapter). The two standard ports on the crew cabins are for landers appropriate to wherever the station is placed.

Now, Custom09 (9) will toggle the station\u0027s engines and Custom10 (0) all its instruments and solar panels. The reason these are given their different groups to other vehicles is that when two or more ships are docked together they act as one.

Primarily, it is intended for a heavy/long 2.5m payload attached under the central core. Light vehicles, satellites, etc. may be attached to the outrigger ports.

Fit a short liquid fuel (only) fuselage behind this and then a short liquid fuel \u002B oxidiser fuselage. With this arrangement fuel is first taken from the forward tank, making the CoM move back slightly. Once you ignite the rockets, however, the oxidiser has to come from the rear tank so the CoM moves forward again. If you burn all the fuel the CoM comes back to only just in front of the CoL at worst but never moves very far. There is no Mk2-shaped decoupler but the mk16 parachutes are enough to save the crew cabin, if not the rest of the vehicle. Monopropellant is provided by a roundified tank tucked under the stabiliser (use WASD so it doesn\u0027t hit the ground on take-off and landing) and thrusters around the CoM. Otherwise, wings, tailfin and control-surfaces as normal for any plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are eight ram air-intakes on this design; four around the fuselage near the tailfin and four on the wings (two each side). This gives a huge amount of air for the jet engine, enabling it to be run right to the edge of space (69km) and leaving only 30-50m/s deltaV from the rockets to circularise a 75-80km orbit. This is abusing KSP physics somewhat and it is a little bit \u0027cheaty\u0027 to use so many intakes, especially as you have to fake attachment-points for them.

Rotate to 50-degrees at 60m/s and climb-out to 10km for the first phase. Reduce pitch to 30-degrees and start to build horizontal speed while climbing to 20km, then reduce pitch further; to 10-degrees. Up to 30km, and especially above 25km, try to adjust your climb-rate so that your horizontal speed is at least 1,000m/s plus 100m/s for every km above 20km \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 so 1,100m/s at 21km, 1,200m/s at 22km, etc. Unlike the rapier the jet is entirely dependent on intake air, so you must go fast enough to feed it. Using this approach, or something close to it, you should be able to exceed 2km/s at or around 30km. Above approximately 33km there will be insufficient air for the jet and it will \u0027flame-out\u0027, but don\u0027t switch to rockets yet. Instead reduce throttle a little until the jet re-ignites. Although providing less thrust there is so little drag at this altitude that it will still be able to accelerate you, or at least assist your speed, as long as you keep throttling-back as you get higher. Pitch flat (0-degrees) or even down so your apoapsis climbs to 75km\u002B while the rest of the thrust increases your periapsis. You should be able to get a horizontal speed over 2,100m/s with an apoapsis at orbital altitude and periapsis already above 30km \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 my best being 58km \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 by running just the jet all the way to the edge of the atmosphere (69km) where it will finally give up. Close the throttle (X), deactivate the jet (1), close the intakes (2) and switch to rockets (3) while cruising to apoapsis, where you can circularise as normal, probably requiring less than 50m/s deltaV from the tiny 48-7S engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION 36: Home From Home\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the Crew Shuttle Mk2 to ferry the crew to the space-station.

Instead of sending the tractor all the way to Mun, landing and coming all the way back just to visit one location at a time, it\u0027s time for another station. Placing a second space-station around Mun (50km orbit is fine) means the tractor can land, re-orbit, refuel and land again as required. You will probably want to use a second tractor as well \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to bring another fuel module across from LKO if the Mun station starts to run low.

At the destination station the only remaining task is to land and re-orbit/dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to how to get the station to Mun in the first place \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 there are two main approaches. Dock station and fuel modules in LKO then use the tractor to tow the whole thing to Mun in one go. This works, but it\u0027s a bit of a load for the tractor so you\u0027ll have long burn-times. Alternatively, tow one or both fuel-modules first, come back and take the station to them, docking it all together in LMuO.

These are constructed of multiple small \u0027wing strakes\u0027 instead of using the usual single-piece delta or swept wings. Even more unusually, while the wing strake against the fuselage is placed as normal the second, attached to the first, is rotate backwards to make a squarer structure. The two outer strakes are then added facing forwards as expected. In KSP wing segments produce their rated lift at 0 or 180 degrees to the airflow but no lift if placed sideways.

On those occasions when I do use rovers they are either very tiny probes or landers fitted with instead of landing-gear. Bases are simply vehicles that are parked on the surface so there\u0027s nothing special in their design. They can become complicated if you want to build them out of several sections, however, because it can be difficult to move them together and align docking ports.

I\u0027m having all sorts of problems with LibreOffice when I try to embed the pictures - it just doesn\u0027t like the size - but I\u0027m getting there. Your .PDF format would be great if you don\u0027t mind, apart from anything else I don\u0027t think I have any software that can write .PDFs!

Proof-reading still ongoing, I\u0027m considering alternatives for Crew Shuttle SP; or at least a discussion on air-hogging and intake placement. In the mean time I\u0027ve messed-up a Moho-station refuelling transfer (tractor medium with 12 orange tubes!) and need to get the crew back somewhere - anywhere! Anyway, I\u0027m also still thinking about a reusable launch-vehicle and getting good results with \u0022LV-40-L\u0022 which is basically 4 LV-10-1 SSTOs strutted together plus landing legs so it can make (drogue-assisted) powered landings after launching a 40t fuel-module, or any other payload, separating and de-orbiting. Finally, I\u0027m considering re-writing Chapters 4 and 5 to separate the manned/docking and unmanned projects more logically. At the moment Chapter 4 is almost twice as long as the others whereas \u0022Cartographer Heavy\u0022 in Chapter 5 is little more than \u0022This has more fuel and a better engine\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat differently, I\u0027ve been asked if I would make the (stock) .craft files for all these available, as I have with the rover and \u0027plane in Chapter 2.

Lots more spelling and grammar errors fixed and the text has been updated where necessary for 0.24 but I have not yet updated the stats (mass, cost, TWR, deltaV) in the individual data sheets. Since cost is now a thing the total for each ship is likely to be different, as are the others where using parts Squad have rebalanced.
