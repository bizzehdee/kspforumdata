Looks like you\u0027ve bested be my friend, keep it up.\n\nThe split tail is inspired by Sukhoi jets.\n\nI like to keep things simple. One very wise man once said \u0022simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u0022\n\nI hate designing wings (I have *killer* OCD,) so I kept them minimized by making the second, high(er) aspect ratio section of the wings all-moving so I wouldn\u0027t have to place elevons. They\u0027re like giant canards. That said, I enjoy making things a bit detailed. Each of the three rotors have eight Hellfire missiles in them; a total of 24 AGMs.\n\nThis thing totally destroys ground units. I pitted one of these jets against a huge Goalkeeper sea-whiz and the jet *wrecked*. The jet has some very good low-speed characteristics.\n\nThe center of lift being off because of the two vertical stabilizers is weird but has very little (but some) effect on the flight of the jet. I\u0027d contact B9 or some of the devs about it but they\u0027re all too busy for this. No idea how to solve this aside from having only one vertical stabilizer but that\u0027d drive me nucking futs."},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T02:27:46Z","Content":"Robzylla Requested cfg files for Spanners solid axle\n\nI can\u0027t find my cfg files for Rollkage at the moment.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E PART{\n\u003E name = BeamAxleAlphaIR2\n\u003E \n\u003E module = Part\n\u003E \n\u003E author = Spanner\n\u003E \n\u003E mesh = model.mu\n\u003E \n\u003E scale = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E rescaleFactor = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E node\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, 0.0, 0.219179, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0\n\u003E \n\u003E node\\_attach = 0.0, 0.0, 0.219179, -0.0, 0.0, 1.0\n\u003E \n\u003E TechRequired = advancedMotors\n\u003E \n\u003E entryCost = 6000\n\u003E \n\u003E cost = 580\n\u003E \n\u003E category = none\n\u003E \n\u003E subcategory = 0\n\u003E \n\u003E title = Beam Axle\n\u003E \n\u003E manufacturer = SMSE Power Products Ltd.

I love scale builds like that. Just sucks you need some substantial hardware when you need a couple hundred parts to pull it off. But it looks like you did a nice job of keeping the part count down as well. What is the part count on the P38 and the Corsair? Also do the wings work on your F14"},{"CreatedByName":"cobbman11","CreatedById":76711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T01:15:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh wow! The p-38 looks great!

I\u0027m not near my computer, but I believe both the P-38 and Corsair are under 100 parts.\n\nThe Tomcat\u0027s wings work but I built it back when I didn\u0027t know much about Infernal Robotics. I\u0027ll probably redo the sweep mechanism in the future."},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T01:23:12Z","Content":"If you run into symmetry issues hit me up.
