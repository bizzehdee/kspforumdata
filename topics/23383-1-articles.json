The oldest OS I can remember used was like Win 4.2 I think. I remember it as my friends upstairs computer, where windows was pretty much the My Computer window.

Sometime I\u0027ll ask my brother or parents what it was running, since I never used that one.

Next, they changed to a yearly release cycle and started hammering out massive improvements using what they learned to create what is essentially win 8.5 in less than half the time a normal release would take, they also decided to offer this for free to Win8 users. This is all at the same time as porting like 95% of the windows code to arm, optimising it for that, then porting all of that to be used on phones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not gone completely smoothly but there\u0027s very little precedent to this sort of company wide paradigm shift so overall I\u0027d say they did about as well as could reasonably be expected.
