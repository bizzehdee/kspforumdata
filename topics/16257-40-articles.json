To launch a relay satellite without a relay already in place, you\u0027ll have to either use a massive 3 kerbal launch stage, complete with its own antennae and remote command SPU (allowing it to function as a command center for your satellite) or use the CAPFLYER method of burning until you\u0027ve attained a high enough apoapsis, then plan the circularization burn with maneuver nodes and use the flight computer to set up the satellite to execute the burn at the correct time.
