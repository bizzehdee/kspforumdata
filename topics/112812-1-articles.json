Steam tells me I have been playing KSP for 50\u002B hours (all of which in Career with different save files), but I\u0027ve not yet explored outside of Kerbins SOI. For my next mission I want to travel to Duna. I haven\u0027t tried docking in the game yet, but am more than happy to give it ago. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question to you all is: What is your prefered manned Duna ship build? Hopefully a few different designs will be posted below, so I can try out different stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also on a side note, a Mun/Minmus base sounds awesome, how do I even go about creating one??)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers for any suggestions,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a properly planned launch window (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz\u003C/a\u003E is a handy tool for that), it actually doesn\u0027t take much more dV to go to Duna than it does to the Mun, or higher tech.

May be worth parking your return stage in Duna orbit, so that the lander can be lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP community!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to Snark\u0027s good advice, I\u0027ll add that Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere means it takes too many parachutes. But one or two chutes augmented by a few seconds of rocket thrust works very well. If you like designing planes, giving your lander some kind of lift will help you control the landing site. Bring a scientist so that you can reuse one of each science experiment. Rovers work well on Duna, so try to land at an intersection of three biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
