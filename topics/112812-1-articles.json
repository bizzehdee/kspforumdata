Steam tells me I have been playing KSP for 50\u002B hours (all of which in Career with different save files), but I\u0027ve not yet explored outside of Kerbins SOI. For my next mission I want to travel to Duna. I haven\u0027t tried docking in the game yet, but am more than happy to give it ago. \n\nMy question to you all is: What is your prefered manned Duna ship build? Hopefully a few different designs will be posted below, so I can try out different stuff. \n\n(Also on a side note, a Mun/Minmus base sounds awesome, how do I even go about creating one??)\n\nCheers for any suggestions,\n\nScott"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:05:56Z","Content":"With a properly planned launch window ([http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz) is a handy tool for that), it actually doesn\u0027t take much more dV to go to Duna than it does to the Mun, or higher tech. So you have a lot of options. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSimplest is probably to make a slightly beefier Mun lander, with a couple of radial parachutes added. May be worth parking your return stage in Duna orbit, so that the lander can be lighter."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:18:30Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP community!\n\nIn addition to Snark\u0027s good advice, I\u0027ll add that Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere means it takes too many parachutes. But one or two chutes augmented by a few seconds of rocket thrust works very well. If you like designing planes, giving your lander some kind of lift will help you control the landing site. Bring a scientist so that you can reuse one of each science experiment. Rovers work well on Duna, so try to land at an intersection of three biomes."}]}
