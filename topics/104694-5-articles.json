A pile of ore isn\u0027t worth much. You need to refine it to get the valuable stuff out. Then you need to get it to market where someone will buy it. Refining ore in space is far beyond our current technological capability (here\u0027s a [link to a brief explanation on how rare earth metals are currently refined](http://www.kitco.com/ind/Kidela/may102011.html)). There is currently no market for rare earth metals in space. Returning unrefined ore from orbit so it can be processed on the ground presents its own problems.

Even with the current prices, it only costs around 33K/kg to return cargo from orbit, the current price of gold is at 38k, of course you have to mine it and stuff, but you only need to launch once. If we assume that within the next decade or so the price per kg to launch into orbit gets cut in half, we re looking at a very profitable business (but you\u0027d need a decent chunk of capital to get even remotely started). The price of gold could also go up a lot, as some people are predicting, which would also help boost the profitability. The most important part about the whole process is getting space ore processing and manufacturing working, there are many challenges to be overcome but its not unreasonable to think that within the next few decades it can be solved.\n\nEven current gold mining operations are unprofitable for the first couple of years, and they also require millons of dollars to set up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T16:46:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mardlamock**"}]}
