But I guess you can\u0027t make everyone happy, some people like it some way, other people like it other way, noobs might like it some crazy way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess SAS is some kind of PID controller, would be nice if you would let us modify the gains of each term (proportional, integral and derivative), something like a small window with 3 numbers. I guess that would make many experienced players very happy and it could have some default values for beginners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to see this in game and it would remove forever the annoyances that we get with SAS in every new patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAphobius\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
