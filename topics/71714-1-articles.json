The magic in this particular mod, the thing that\u0027s different from the existing resource converters, is the vessel is smart enough to convert kethane into other resources on demand, in response to usage.

Clearly the configuration of the generator needs some work; at an idle it seems to be burning fuel so slowly as to negate the meaning of burning fuel at all, and the way the throttle controller operates is not what I\u0027d like. In the long run I want to have a flywheel system where the mod has an RPM, and based on the RPM value, a draw value, and an engine mechanic; where the RPM defines the amount of energy available, the draw value pulls energy out of the flywheel at a certain rate, thus reducing the flywheel\u0027s RPM; and the engine mechanic then responds to keep the RPM\u0027s stable. I have no idea how I\u0027m going to go about that; or if. In more attainable goals I need to add a secondary throttle logic that will account for the battery capacity of the vessel and boost the throttle in order to rebuild the buffer; where currently it just produces slightly more than the ship needs to counter floating point inaccuracies and rounding errors. The buffer maintenance logic will make this unimportant by periodically boosting output when under a certain percentage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, posting this now~ *goes to play space engineers*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T06:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing happened, but here have a new version anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Greys0/Virgin-Kalactic/releases/tag/VK_v1.3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Greys0/Virgin-Kalactic/releases/tag/VK_v1.3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve typed this a few times already so just read the release notes and commit notes for more details, but basically I\u0027ve rearranged all the code, renamed files, separated things, now there\u0027s 3 times more dll than before, there\u0027s more goals and stuff so I\u0027ll probably be working on this more frequently again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the down side, we\u0027ve entered heatwave season here, so my productivity and moreso ability to play KSP for testing purposes has been largely restricted, we\u0027ll see how problematic this is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the big thing that changed is a change made specifically to support other modders.

I feel that any plugin which patches a bug in the base game and nothing else, or adds a very small feature, should be released under very open terms, MIT/BSD where possible. Because of potential legal conflicts I strongly suggest against bug patches being GPL; I feel that the terms that KSP is sold under may directly circumvent GPL being used in certain ways, but people will still try and that dispute over the base game being fixed is bad for everyone. GPL is fine for larger projects which are incredibly unlikely to be \u0027bought\u0027 by Squad, or \u0027inspire\u0027 similar features which sufficiently resemble the GPL content that it would be a problem. The smaller your feature is the fewer ways there are to achieve it, and I feel that also circumvents GPL claims in the same way you cannot trademark \u0022the\u0022. The one exception to being open is where openness potentially induces conflicts. BetterPart is All Rights Reserved because there can only be one BetterPart in play in a given instance of KSP at any given time, if there were a fork of BetterPart, the existence of 2 directly reduces both. I would however like to say that I have been working to rewrite BetterPart to be an event based system that any plugin can register with, and will in the long run be overhauling TrackResource with similar systems that will hopefully provide a lot of the base features that are generally wanted alongside in an event based system. I\u0027m rambling and I\u0027ve spent over an hour composing this. Just want to say that last time I worked on the update to BetterPart I got to a point where it looked like it worked, but then this happened\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://cdn.mediacru.sh/UFpfGXtHThwL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UFpfGXtHThwL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T18:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENodeToggle?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be big for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was building the stock Millenium Falcon I ran into a node problem tring to install a VTOL engine cluster inside.
