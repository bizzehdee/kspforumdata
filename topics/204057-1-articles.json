When would such a notional upper stage be available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. When would an SLS be available to put the stage in #1 on top of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Does this include the issues Europa Clipper has with the vibration environment WRT SLS (apparently it would add ~$1B to the spacecraft cost to deal with).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1\u002B2 would be some number of years relative to when the EC spacecraft is ready to fly. If that number equals 3, the shorter flight time doesn\u0027t matter, both are 6 years, since FH is already good to go the day the spacecraft is ready. If 1\u002B2\u0026gt;3, then the SLS launch actually takes longer to reach the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, WRT time, as soon as we are out more than a couple years into the future, SLS becomes completely obviated by Starship/Super Heavy. Musk has already said that an expendable upper stage is a possibility for outer solar system probes. A \u0022starship\u0022 that is just a cylinder with a conventional fairing could be made of thinner steel (3mm or less vs 4mm), and be low enough mass that it can easily exceed SLS throw. A 16 dry upper stage (a 3mm SS tank section is ~16t) ) has 13.46km/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E with a 16.6t EC with lander. That leaves ~6km/s for the transfer, still low. 2mm steel adds about 1km/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3 obviously adds cost, which might impact mission duration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding a lander, while that would be awesome, that\u0027s also a cost issue since presumably the lander is some hundreds of millions at the very least. Also, it looks like C3 for Europa limits EC to ~6t for SLS Block 1B, right? While a better upper stage can help, the same upper stage could be added as a third stage to SS/SH, and indeed a smaller once, since a stripped SS upper stage can do most of the work. Note that this assumes no refilling of the SS upper stage, if that capability exists at all... use SS, the tanks need not even be filled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-01T04:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the total spacecraft mass and \u003Cabbr
