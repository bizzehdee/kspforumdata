I have tried setting both the probe and the satelite to target eachother (probe target Kerbin, satelites target probe/ minimus) But no combination works! It\u0027s like I can only make short range transmissions using the diapole/antena! Just a heads up I have only tried using the static satelites (the really big one and 4 of the duna range ones) But As I have read previously I think the non tracking ones should work right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk I\u0027m running game version 2.02 and I\u0027ll list the mods that are in my gamedate folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9_Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobCatind\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECleverWalrus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrewManifest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadlyReentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDRobotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExsurgentEngineering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFASA_Asteroids\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerramAerospaceResearch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFireSpitter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGirder Pack 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJARFR_CRSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeramzit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbaltek\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKineTechAnimation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKWRocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagicSmokeIndustries\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModularFuelTanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModuelManagerSourcesxx\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enothke_DROMOMAN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartCatalog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceduralDynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResGen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERomfarer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStockImprovementProject\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esubassemblyloader\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk that\u0027s everything!!
