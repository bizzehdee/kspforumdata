Maybe not two full sized planets. Maybe a moon colliding with a planet that created a debris field in orbit. Of course, this is dependent on the \u0022fix\u0022 they have in place for binary planets and/or bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) A super fast orbiting body - whether around a star or a moon that is just grazing the atmosphere of its parent planet, this would give a unique challenge for sure. Would also make orbiting the planetary parent interesting as you would have to either maintain a high orbit or get into a synchronous orbit with the moon. Not to mention the havoc it would cause for gravity when you land on the planet. Low gravity when the moon is over head, high gravity when it\u0027s on the opposite side if the planet. Though, you would get a helping hand if you launched in the low grav effect the moon caused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Binary or Trinary star systems - Why not? Tatooine anyone? How about that planet from Riddick Pitch Black?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) A water world with changing tides - I know this might be hard to do in game, but having to build a colony to withstand tidal forces would be a fun challenge I feel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) A planet with a thick gaseous/dusty atmosphere - Think Venus, or Mars during its planet wide dust storm.\u00A0Low visibility, large rocks scattered around the landing site. Would be an interesting challenge. Not only landing, but taking off as well, thick atmosphere means lots of drag.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) A planet that has ravines everywhere - and I\u0027m talking ravines ranging in all sizes, from a few dozen meters to Grand Canyon deep, but not necessarily as wide. A ravine a few miles deep with just enough clearance for a landing rocket... you\u0027re going to scratch the paint alright, but the rewards might be worth it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) Seismically active planet - Rask and Rusk might have this, but it\u0027s to be expect. I mean a non lava world that is just earthquakes, or planet quakes if you prefer, every so often ranging from a simple shakey action, lander might move an inch or two, to massive quakes that will bounce or tip your lander over. Better bring some weights or grapple lines to tie down the lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) A planet or dwarf planet that had its core ripped out, leaving a giant hole straight through the planet - basically... donut world. Oh come on, you want the challenge of having to fall into the hole and then have enough power to break out of the gravity well... you don\u0027t? Why not? It\u0027s and interesting challenge and it would be funny to get your vessel trapped in the center of a hollow world, and then have to rescue them... some how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9) A world with a dormant\u00A0composite volcano - basically I want a funnel that I can land in. Think Mohole, but with an area to land in at the bottom. Try not to scratch the paint on the way down... or up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10) Dyson Sphere - gravity would be weird, yes, but that\u0027s the challenge. Having to deal with going from landing on the outside the planet surface to the inside of the planet\u0027s surface. Just, don\u0027t forget the barf bag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-14T00:35:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2019 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by GoldForest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-13T05:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-13T05:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223671371\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568339238\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277770\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoldForest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, GoldForest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are some planets or solar systems you would like to see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Colliding planets. - We have Rask and Rusk, and if KSP had real gravity and physics, those two may well collide with each other, so why not make a planet system that is colliding?
