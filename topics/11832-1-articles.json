And it actually runs good too, at speeds of KSP rockets it runs at 60fps even on 0 planet detail (the setting 0 is considered high, with negative values considered lower). Which is still far beyond the quality of many movies and Star Trek / Stargate episodes.\n\nKSP with similar achievements in the visual department would be my dream game of all time, no question. Not to mention the procedural galaxies (yes plural), infinite exploration potential.\n\nPerhaps not this iteration of KSP, but maybe a sequel or \u0027three-quel?\u0027 in the future.\n\nThe russians sure know how to code..\n\n[http://en.spaceengine.org/](http://en.spaceengine.org/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:38:47Z","Content":"Unfortunately all SpaceEngine ever looks like to me is a stream of errors flying across the screen and then a catastrophic crash to desktop."},{"CreatedByName":"Baleur","CreatedById":9954,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:41:04Z","Content":"Indeed, if moving at lightspeed.
