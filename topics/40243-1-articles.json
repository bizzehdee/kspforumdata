A 2D (for simplicity\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s sake) playing field with Kerbol at the center. Each player gets a \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Kerbin\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 and a certain amount of mass. The game goes in four (or so - i go, you go) turns in which the players toss either their \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Kerbin\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 or another planet, comprised from their \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4mass\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, into the system from the outside rim of it. All mass must be used up in the final turn. Aim is to get ones own Kerbin\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s orbit into the eco-zone of Kerbol during its entire orbit and keep it there by the end of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably needless to say on this forum, that the bodies already in the system are rotating around Kerbol and start to influence one another, when they get close to each other. In other words: (Simplified) Physics apply. The players toss their masses into the system by eyeballing - no numbers on the screen, please - direction and speed (and timing - the system is in constant motion after the first object has been inserted). If the other player already tossed his kerbin in the ecozone successfully, you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll want to steer it away from that by means of the gravity of one of your masses (- like try to toss a gas giant in a slightly lower orbit, wait till it passes the opponents Kerbin and have it pull it out of its orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot very fleshed out, this idea, i must admit, but still: Could be a little flashgame to further spread KSP\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s popularity across the web while at the same time serve as the creational myth of kerbalkind (name the two players, say, Kod and Kishnu, or something).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
