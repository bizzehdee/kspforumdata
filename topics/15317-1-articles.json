How big is your lander stage, # of engines and type? I haven\\\u0027t had any issues with the standard command module, short tank, 3 legs, ladder, and 3 radial engines.

I just posted it here so you could see what the TMI and Lander stage that I used looked like. I havent even tried to land with the 1 kerbal command pod, I like the new parts too much I think to even bother.
