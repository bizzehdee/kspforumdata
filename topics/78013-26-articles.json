Jets basically run on fumes, so the faster you can go before needing the rockets, the better off you will be. I try and sit close to the flameout ceiling and just fly level until speed caps out (you can move up a bit as you speed up, but not a huge amount). Light the rockets and slowly pitch up (unless you have some serious control authority, upper atmosphere is really good and making planes lose control at 1.5\u002Bkm/s), don\u0027t immediaely close the intakes (action group) the acceleration on rockets can give them a little more life (but remember to shgut them down when they do die), burn till apo leaves atmosphere and then follow prograde with the nose of the craft to reduce drag.
