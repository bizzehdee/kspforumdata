Thought about displaying the ribbons ingame on a space suit? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I still have to migrate FF from my internal SVN to an external version control system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t been feeling very well this week so sorry for late reply. Yes I have thought of putting the ribbons on suits but the space available is small or limited. I\u0027m sure we can work something out! I\u0027m sure you have lots to do but if / when you are ready let me know and we will talk further \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nereid","CreatedById":68815,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T10:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarstrider42 just told my about a bug of some kind in FF. Well it\u0027s not a bug in my opinion, but he is right in some way, so I just want to ask if I should change it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome ribbons replace others in FF. There is the 120 second to orbit ribbon, which replaces the 150 seconds to orbit ribbon for example. Well, thats not a problem for this kind of ribbon, but there are other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022planting flag\u0022 ribbon replacing the \u0022EVA on ground\u0022 ribbon, because you need to be on EVA to plant a flag. Fine too.... but there is a problem. What if somebody goes on a very low orbit around Minmus, does an EVA and accomplish to land his kerbal directly and is planting a flag then? He will get the plant flag ribbon with all the decorations for EVA on ground and landing on ground - but he has not really landed (a spacecraft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, another more simple example: If someone does an EVA directly before launch, he gets the \u0022EVA on ground\u0022 ribbon. Thats the same ribbon as the \u0022landing on kerbin\u0022 ribbon but with two orbs on the left, but technically he wasn\u0027t landed on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the way its supposed to be, because I don\u0027t wanted too many ribbons with very similar meanings (planting a flag is only a special EVA on ground most of the time). But sometimes you could get the subsequent ribbon without all conditions met for the preceding ribbon. Technically spoken the preceding ribbons are not awarded and if I would change this they wont magically appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion is now: Should I change this? This will create some more ribbons in the display for each kerbal. In real life some award will be given even without the preceeding first, so it\u0027s not a big issue in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonaly I prefer the way it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T15:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I don\u0027t think you should change the way ribbons replace others. Except maybe that flag planting ribbon - To me that feels like a separate action from just a simple EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could do both. On the main FF window you could show only the highest levels of each type of ribbon (ex: If a kerbal has both 150s to orbit and 120s to orbit, only show 120s to orbit). Then on the \u0022Decoration Board\u0022 show all of the ribbons, superseded, duplicate, whatever.
