I have been playing for 1 1/2 years. In that time I have landed and returned from Moho before I knew it was hard. Drove a rover into the Dres canyon. While it did not end well, the point is I am not a complete beginner. That said, I went from 0.90 to 1.04. Launched the Kerbal X stock ship for a test run. It went easily in 100k orbit. Then I tried to return to KSP with the lander stage. The ship did not attempt to slow at all. It just turned to toast before disintegrating. I slapped Mechjeb on it and tried again. Same result. So if Mechjeb can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t reenter a lander in 1.04, how do I? I tried lowering my Pe to 30k for a shallower angle. Still too hot.

The best and easiest way to do this is with airbrakes; they\u0027re cheap, light, and incredibly effective (way overpowered, IMHO). Even without airbrakes, you can help by angling your ship to the draggiest attitude possible, e.g. sideways, and hold that until you get down to 35-38 km before rotating to put your heat resistant parts forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T19:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst chance to respond since posting. The ship is the Kerbal X stock ship that came with the game. The lander portion is a poodle engine on a Rockomax X200-16 tank with landing gear, a decoupler and a MK1-2 command pod with chute. It weighs 16t. If I can\u0027t land this accurately without burning up on Kerbin, I\u0027m wasting my time trying to land on Laythe. Reentry with just the pod is out of the question. This morning I slapped 3 airbrakes on the tank. Mechjeb behaves oddly with airbrakes in upper atmosphere and never attempts to use them as the heat goes lethal. I manually braked and did slow down enough to land but fell short of the target by 22k. So yeah, I finally got down safely but lacked precision. With the tiny amount of landing area on Laythe I am going to have to do better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the new normal, there really needs to be a tutorial for successful reentry including help with the parts needed.
