This has gotten so bad that if I change buildings my game crashes. Someone once told me at what size the game is which caused trouble. I just wiped the entire save file and I am re-downloading now. How big does the game have to be to cause performance issues like mine? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Specs: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcta-Core i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.4 GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel \u00AE HD Graphics 4000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EACPl 64x Based PC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease tell me of any other specs you need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T16:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most common cause of crashes is exceeding the RAM limit. For 32-bit KSP on 64-bit Windows, there\u0027s a hard limit of about 3.5 GB. If other programs are using a lot of RAM (or you don\u0027t have much to begin with), then the limit is whatever you actually have available. Note that this is different than the size of the game data on your drive because the data (especially textures) are stored in different ways on disk and in RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow to Get Support\u003C/a\u003E sticky has general advice for dealing with memory-related crashes and also tells you what information we need to provide more help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
