Mission planners can tell any astronaut to pick up rocks on the Mun, for example, and the results will be the same. Where it differs is in the choice of rocks to pick. Regular astronauts can also run most experiments on orbit, but some might have a better chance of success with the actual scientist doing the work.

E skill would allow longer duration flights as the engineer would be tweaking/maintaining the CO2 scrubbers, etc. Not by vast amounts, but enough to matter on really long flights.
