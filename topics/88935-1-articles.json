An engineer kerbal could fix tires and landing gear, while a scientist kerbal can\u0027t fix things. The scientist kerbal CAN give more science though, but of course, the pilot can\u0027t do didly cause he isn\u0027t trained. Maybe I\u0027m biased to my own idea, but I think this would be the PERFECT way to make kerbals unique and keep you from wanting to kill them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice idea for me too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T18:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAutomation is a computer on board the spacecraft flying the spacecraft.

No. Most elements of the game are in fact abstracted, except spaceflight maneuvers (even those that would never have any control that was not done by a computer).

How, when the player is in fact the pilot? They could randomize control inputs, and even time warp without telling the player. So the most skilled pilot would be indistinguishable from what we have now. As their skill is below this value, when you exercise any control input, the game could alter time compression (lightly changing physics warp from 0.XX to 1.XX time compression to screw up burn times), how your craft is pointing (lag control inputs), and even lagging throttle commands. Note none of these would be constant, they\u0027d constantly change so you could not get used to it.
