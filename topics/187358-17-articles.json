Meaning that if a guy was mucking around at the Mun base, then you could launch another satelite in orbit around the Mun while he was active on the mun surface\u00A0at 1x time compression the whole time. However, in order to complete the mission with time compression, you jumped ahead of him on the timeline. When you had completed your mission, you could jump back to his time and the mission would unfold just like you performed it, meaning that the mission would complete itself sometime in the future. A sort of advanced mission planner that would unfold exactly as you did it unless something affects\u00A0it, erasing its future timeline. But the edge cases became too many and contrived and the end result would hardly be possible to utilize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince we have such a beautiful time sink as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I don\u0027t think it will be a problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-22T13:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/132821-habalabam/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022132821\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/132821-habalabam/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Habalabam\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I can\u0027t see how your timewarp system\u00A0could work and be fun. Think a bit about just how \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E you timewarp: my sandbox where I\u0027m tooling around Jool must be in year 60 by now. If I had spent the same amount of time tooling around the Kerbin system, I\u0027d most likely still be in year 1. I.e.

For example, there really aren\u2019t many spots \u00A0on Laythe that are (1) equatorial and (2) flat, and fewer still that have nice views of Jool. On Eve the best spot for a base is on a high peak near the equator: how many are there? \u00A0Minmus is pretty small and close by; how long do you think it\u2019d take before all the space on equatorial flats is claimed?\u00A0\u00A0Since resource extraction plays a significant part in the game too, I\u2019d imagine that further reduces the amount of desirable real estate.

After all they can still do that in my solution if they want to. There could even be a button in the sync UI to do that, if that\u0027s something players want \u2013 this effectively ends up in exactly the same place as your proposed solution, without much of the complexity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI contend that my solution is just plain better.
