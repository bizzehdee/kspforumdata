I\u0027m wondering if they will work for docking maneuvers on heavy ships or if they are only useful for keeping course alignment.\n\nDo BZ-52 Radial Attachment Points actually have any use in game? I thought they where like docking ports, but well there are ports so whats the point.\n\nOk, I guess that\u0027s it, while I was looking up part names I couldn\u0027t remember I found my other answers ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks,\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T21:48:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fenris**"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T17:43:53Z","Content":"The vernors are LF-O powered rcs, but they work exactly as the Place Anywhere 7\u0027s\n\nand the BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point is just a part to attaching stuff radially"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T18:00:48Z","Content":"1. yes\n\n2.

Just be aware that they do stop fuel flow, so you will need fuel pipes. I use one on my Fuel Bus so that I can attach a unmanned pod at the \u0022top\u0022. You can see it right above the SAS modules.\n\nVernors are also much more powerful than the Place-Anywhere\u0027s, btw.\n\n ![dhdRSEN.png](http://i.imgur.com/dhdRSEN.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T18:30:16Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t really built anything big enough to need the Vernors (normally I just add moar RCS blocks) so can\u0027t help you there. The radial attachment point is absolutely golden though, especially in early-mid career games or science games. Take one structural fuselage, add four symmetrically placed radial attachment points and presto - one reasonable facsimile of a Rockomax Hub, which otherwise only unlocks right at the end of the stock tech tree. Very useful for early space stations, chassis for launching multiple probes on the same booster or... well anything you\u0027d use a Rockomax Hub for really. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fenris","CreatedById":11162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T21:48:10Z","Content":"Thanks all"}]}
