The radial attachment point is absolutely golden though, especially in early-mid career games or science games. Take one structural fuselage, add four symmetrically placed radial attachment points and presto - one reasonable facsimile of a Rockomax Hub, which otherwise only unlocks right at the end of the stock tech tree. Very useful for early space stations, chassis for launching multiple probes on the same booster or... well anything you\u0027d use a Rockomax Hub for really. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fenris","CreatedById":11162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T21:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks all\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
