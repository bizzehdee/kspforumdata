The closest I\u0027ve been able to come up with so far is to add a custom PartModule to the specific parts that need the shader, so that the shader can be swapped during prefab creation.  My next thought was to keep a list of parts that should have the shader replaced and use a generic KSPAddon to replace the shaders in just those parts after the database was loaded; this unfortunately requires keeping a config-list of parts.  My last idea was to export the parts with the custom shader (so it is read in the .mu file), and go through -every single model- after models are loaded and replace the bad shader references with a proper one;  quite hacky and likely would take a few seconds to go through all those models/transforms/renderers.\n\nI noticed that GameDatabase has a list of shaders (the same way it keeps a list of models).  But.. as near as I can tell the stock mu-model loading code doesn\u0027t look there for shaders when it is constructing models.  I\u0027m tempted to bug a dev to see if they can also search that shader list when compiling models from .mu files so that custom shaders might be supported through the .mu model format.  I suppose the question is should I just file a bug report, or bug a dev directly?  Never really sure when it comes to features only used by mods/API-quality-of-life improvements.\n\nThe other bit that really needs cleaned up is the KSP asset bundle loading.  I put the shader in the bundle, flag it for \u0027auto-load\u0027, and... nothing?  I ended up loading my bundle manually through the Unity generic AssetBundle loading methods.  Seems like it is an API feature that was never fully implemented.  Sadly, the AssetBundles are loaded after the models anyway, so this wouldn\u0027t fix the shader being available when models are compiled.  Would still need to manually load the shader and insert it into the GameDatabase shaders list sometime prior to models loading (all assuming the above fix was in place and that .mu models searched the shader list for shaders).\n\nOther shader-related discoveries:\n\nUsing a second UV set is trivial.  It literally consists of changing one of your sampler definitions from \u0027uv\\_texName\u0027 to \u0027uv2\\_texName\u0027.  Now I need to decide if I need support for secondary UV\u0027s, and what exactly I would use them for. \n\nThere are -lots- of different options for texture sampling setups.  Not quite sure which route I\u0027m going to go (what channels in each texture).  Will be one of the things I\u0027ll be figuring out this week.  \n\nOn the testing note -- as mucking about with Unity shaders is entirely new to me, these things are going to need a bit of testing to make sure that they work on other platforms / GLs."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-12T15:23:45Z","Content":"BTW, seeing the Soyuz gets me thinking, as I have built rather a lot of them lately in SSTU.\n\nThe core and conical boosters are pretty straightforward, using the soyuz adapter on the Nose of the core (set to 1.25m).

Then, with the soyuz adapter on top, it makes the top diameter of the tank end up at 1.875m and it lines up perfectly with the spacecraft/1.875m upper stage.  The radial boosters should be 1.875m as well.\n\nThere is a reason I put in all of those diameter adjustment sliders ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Yes, I realize that 1.4375 is a bit of an odd size... but blame the Russians.  It was either 1.4375m core \u002B 1.875m boosters and pod, or 1.875m core w/ 2.5m boosters and pod; I chose the smaller/odd sized one as it was much closer to the proper scale and still capable of being done with the diameter-adjustment sliders.\n\nSolar panels -- yep, that is aliasing caused by the relatively small details on the panels (mostly the normals I think?).  Not much I can do about it if I want to retain the details.  Going to be upping the texture resolution on them already (from 512x to 1024x), which will help with some of the aliasing, but won\u0027t alleviate the aliasing between the high-contrast areas (the black panels vs. white structure).  May also see if removing the normal map entirely cleans up the aliasing.\n\nI would agree -- they look great up close, but from further off they... well.. don\u0027t.  We\u0027ll see if the texture-size update fixes any of those problems.  Who knows, I may have to remove the normals from the panels.

Those parts are all mapped onto a single 512x texture with a TON of shared UVs (of which only half is used by the COS parts, the other half is used by the HUB-COS);  any details added to the texture would repeat themselves all over the part and look rather bad and tacky.  Nor am I really trying to make replicas.  I honestly think they look just fine as-is, and they conform to the level of detail to which I\u0027ve done the rest of my parts.

Those parts are all mapped onto a single 512x texture with a TON of shared UVs (of which only half is used by the COS parts, the other half is used by the HUB-COS);  any details added to the texture would repeat themselves all over the part and look rather bad and tacky.

Either way I like these part.\n\u003E \n\nOn the COS texture, it is divided into 4 horizontal-spanning sections.  Each of those sections covers 4 \u0027panels\u0027 going around the tank, mirrored and repeated 4 times around the tank to make the 16 panels going around the diameter.  Would need a 2048x texture in order to get the full diameter of the tank.  Even at that size the texture would only cover less than 1/2 of the length of the \u0027long\u0027 parts -- still not good enough coverage for the type of detailing you are looking for.\n\nThe upper strip of panels contains the AO bake for the top/bottom strip of handrails.  It is only used for the upper and bottom row of panels on each part.\n\nThe second strip of panels contains the AO bake for -all other sections- of the COS parts, and is repeated 2-8 times depending on the part.  This is the bit that would end up\n\nThe third and fourth strip of panels contain the AO bake for the HUB, HUB-extensions, and a bit is used for the handrail AO and coloring.\n\nDecals -- yea, it could be done that way, but is 1.) Painful and slow as a workflow, requiring multiple materials and separate mesh objects.  2.) Looks terrible as the rendering setup is not intended for decal use; you need actual decal shaders for those, which KSP does not support (note how the decals on the HUB parts look... not so hot...but an unfortunate necessity for those parts).  As such I would prefer to only use decals where they are truly needed, such as the HUB parts for the port labeling (where -not- having labeling would be unacceptable).\n\nIf/when the Unity 5 Standard Shader is ever supported I can start using the new detail-texture workflow, which will allow for what you are suggesting without looking terrible (as decals are rendered as part of the albedo texture, at the same z-depth, so there is no z-fighting or false-shadows caused by them)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-12T21:01:02Z","Content":"Can we just port KSP into unreal engine and forget about all these limitation?\n\nHalf serious here..."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T01:32:01Z","Content":"While I\u0027m making new cylindrical fuel tanks....
