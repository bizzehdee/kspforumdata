More maneuverable sidewinder or the more damaging AMRAAM?\n\u003E We should decide on how many \u0027points\u0027 we get before we move ahead of our selves.\n\nFrom memory, if a missile hits it\u0027s goodnight Vienna, regardless. Iirc, the AMRAAMs get fired first, followed by the Sidewinders, and often its hard to tell which made the kill.\n\nPoints - let\u0027s say 10:\n\nBoth AtA missiles cost a point, as does the cannon and ammo box each, and each countermeasures pod.\n\nYou could have long distance loadout:\n\n1 cannon\n\n1 ammo\n\n4 AMRAAM\n\n2 Sidewinder\n\n2 countermeasures\n\nOr short range:\n\n2 cannon\n\n3 ammo\n\n2 Sidewinder\n\n3 Countermeasures\n\nAnd I\u0027m sure there are other viable loadouts too.

I seem to get a reasonable framerate recording at 720p with what I think was around 25 - 30 missiles in range (each plane had 8).

Definitely one for the designers to decide - lots of thrust and big wings to get altitude advantage, or manoeuvrable and do the limbo flying dangerously low around the KSC? Setting a really low minimum altitude gives first strike advantage, but crash probability goes up. Just the sort of risk/reward scenario you want in a contest of design skill.\n\nIt also produced a dogfight were one jet shot down his own wingman and both opposing jets in a single strafe!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T12:09:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**"},{"CreatedByName":"PixelStory","CreatedById":141149,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T12:30:52Z","Content":"I would like to help with this.

The diagram for that would look like either: ^VX^V or ^^XVV, with ^ being one team\u0027s aircraft (and the direction they are facing), V being the other team\u0027s aircraft, and X being a low-part count building to use as a center point for the battle. One aircraft would be switched to team B, then while everything is taking off the other aircraft from that team would be as well. Whichever team has the last aircraft remaining wins that round. Whoever wins the most rounds out of either 5 or 7 (I feel like 5 would be easier, but 7 is closer to playoff hockey, which is one of the only sports I enjoy watching) gets to move on, whilst the losing team is eliminated. Aircraft which exceed a set physics distance from X are eliminated, and the AI of aircraft cannot have its max altitude set higher than a certain number (I\u0027m thinking maybe 2000 to 3000m). This probably explained more than just that point.\n\nFor craft requirements and restrictions, I think we should prohibit the use of all engines except for the basic jets, turbojets, and RAPIERs set on air-breathing mode. I think a jet should not be able to exceed 100 parts with a full weapons loadout. All missile based weapons should be mounted on pylons (Certain parts being used to perform the same function as the BD pylons are allowed in this situation). A pylon can mount multiple missiles on it, but the missiles must not be overly clipped. There will be a set weapon point limit, and each allowed weapon, ammo box, and flare pod will be worth a set number of points.The Abrams turret, the Millennium turret, the 105mm howitzer and the Goalkeeper will be banned, along with all unguided bombs. Several ground attack or ground-based weapons may be banned if it is shown they cannot be air launched at another aircraft by the AI. Aircraft should be required to carry a minimum fuel load; this could either be done by requiring a certain amount of fuel per engine or setting a minimum delta-V. Craft cannot exceed a certain specified weight. Clipping is allowed except for fuel tanks, which cannot be massively clipped (I feel like minor clipping for looks should be allowed) unless one is drained or partially drained, depending on how much they are clipped.\n\nCrafts should be submitted on a page set up specifically for the contest to be judged by either 3 or 4 judges: Colmo, whoever is twitch streaming or recording (I am volunteering for part of this), and possibly someone else. Judges can participate in the competition, but their aircraft have to be approved by other judges. I think each team should get 4 aircraft and pick 2 to use for each series. These 4 aircraft could all be the same aircraft, could all be different aircraft, could all have the same weapon loadout or could have varying weapon loadouts. This allows the teams a player uses to vary a bit more, and possibly makes the game a bit more strategical as you have to figure out and pick which aircraft will most likely best your opponent\u0027s aircraft.\n\nStart settings would be easy to reproduce in my case. As I said before, the starting coordinates and starting directions of each aircraft would be pre-set, and they would be the same across all of the games. Whichever team gets flipped over to the B team first will be at first decided by a coin flip for the first series, and for later series it will be decided by which team had done better in the past series. Each consecutive round whoever is made the B-team will switch.\n\nI feel like the recording of the contests should be done by 2 twitch streamers, and be a multiple day event. If we do a 32-team event, then we do 4 days. If we do a 16 team event, we do 2 days. (We could possibly have a forum league and a reddit league of 16 teams each to get 32 total). On the first day, the two streamers would show four of the initial series games each. The second day, another 4 would be shown. The third day (Or first if we only get 16 people in total), the streamers would showcase the second set of series. On the fourth day, the third series set and finals would be shown.\n\nThis is just my 2 cents, I still need another twitch streamer to make this happen, but I feel like I have a really solid rule set here."},{"CreatedByName":"PixelStory","CreatedById":141149,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T17:50:56Z","Content":"Can I still host the page for The entries? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T18:09:55Z","Content":"This is mostly colmo\u0027s contest, so overall it would be his decision (I may be trying to hijack it a bit), but it would be fine with me if you do a good job (You\u0027re quite new to the forums, and thus lack a reputation, so I\u0027m mostly posting this to make sure you are up for the job).

It can launch, circle, engage enemies and evade missiles. \n\nThings it can\u0027t do is: \n\nRoute planning (BD is working on GPS type tools, though...),\n\nLanding, planes with no power (shot off engines, intakes or out of fuel) still deploy gear approaching 0m altitude and often land safely or ditch in the sea nonfatally, and,\n\nFormation flying (though see BurnTogether mod) and proximity alerts; they act independently and don\u0027t help wingmen unless by chance, which would be hugely more difficult to do,\n\nStop shooting at disabled planes which still have weapon managers but are obviously out of the fight and about to crash.
