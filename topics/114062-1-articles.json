Open your inventory. Then when you \u0026lt;G\u0026gt;rab a part, hold the mouse down and slide it right into your inventory. Not everything will go, but a surprising amount will. Otherwise, if you want to move a part from point A to point B, go float midway between them. Grab the part and then X-click to attach it at point B. If they\u0027re too far apart, attach it as far toward B as you can, then repeat the process. It\u0027s kind of painful, especially at first. One thing you can do is attach a bit of ladder where you want to be hovering, then grab onto it and move your part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I don\u0027t think the system is as well optimized for orbital work as it is for ground operations, but I\u0027ve had endless fun with it in orbit, nonetheless.

I had tried this with parts already on the station such as batteries, a mechjeb and illuminators but these would not go into the inventory. When I tried it with a small strut it worked.
