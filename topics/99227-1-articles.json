The new Kube has an antenna and a single 1U solar panel integrated into the probe body, so it\u0027s a fully functional satellite in one KSP probe part. I haven\u0027t used the KAS mod, but let me know if this helps those of you who do. The most major difference between this version and assembling your own is that this Kube can only support one single solar panel, as I haven\u0027t been able to figure out how to get a working solar system made of multiple panels facing in multiple directions to work properly. At least this one has RCS so you can point the single panel toward the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you not entertained by your assemblies acting unpredictably?

While these Kubes may not provide the most science compared to some other options, they\u0027re simple and inexpensive to make, costing between 160-500 Funds each depending on how you want to build it. Fly a swarm of 20 of them for less than 5000 Funds. They are very small and lightweight, having minimal weight impact on a rocket. You could even slap one on the side of another mission to get a little more from your launch. The experiments are designed to be repeated many times, so unless you want to spend a long time making one Kube do all the work, launching multiples is recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoteTech Upgrade:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncluded in the download is an additional folder that can be used to make NanoKube RemoteTech compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the latest version of NanoKube installed, all you should need is to install the RemoteTech_Upgrade folder according to the installation instructions.

The small one is a mere 10cm/side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese Kubes are meant to reflect the simpler design of nanosatellites compared to larger and more complex satellites, so you can start flying them at tech level 4.
