Well, it\u0027s a reliable place to get asteroids from. It would add a certain amount of extra danger to travelling to distant planets because travelling through the asteroid belt would put you in danger of your spacecraft being destroyed.

The next two largest, Vesta and Pallas make up about 5-10% each\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at the pie chart again, you can clearly see that this is wrong. Ceres is not 40% of the asteroid belt - its 31%. If you\u0027re going to round it to the nearest 10%, call it 30%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exceptional_asteroids#Most_massive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exceptional_asteroids#Most_massive\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get over 50% of the mass of the belt, you need the 4 or 5 biggest ones: 1 Ceres (31%) \u002B 4 Vesta (8.6%) \u002B 2 Pallas (6.7%) [sub total: 46.3%] \u002B 10 Hygiea (2.9) [sub total \u00A049.2] \u002B\u00A031 Euphrosyne (1.9) -\u0026gt; for a total of 51.1%... more or less (due to differences in mass estimates for the whole belt and each body)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, Ceres is by far the largest asteroid, and the next 10 largest asteroids combined would still be far smaller than it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3) \u0022the devs could borrow some of the code from the Near-Kerbin-Asteroids and apply it to the Dres solar orbit.\u0022\u00A0As I mentioned above, deploying the IR camera between duna and dres will allow you to start tracking Dres crossers. This is basically already implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the big 3 constitute nearly half the mass of the belt (~46.3%), and dres is a Ceres analogue, I modded in Vesta and Pallas analogues, with eccentricities and inclinations based on their real life analogues and the relation between Dres and its real life analogue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VD5drp7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VD5drp7.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI named them Vot (Vesta analogue), and Pact (Pallas analogue). Pact is the one in the center of the screen, and I\u0027m also mousing over Vot to highlight it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna is obscured because its a moon of mars based planet... although their relative masses make them more of a binary planet (something like a 1:3 mass ratio). Also I added a small body to the pseudo-L4 point of Kerbin, to represent the hypothetical \u0022Theia\u0022 that formed but got destabilized when it grew to \u0026gt;10% Earth\u0027s mass, and impacted the Earth and caused the Moon\u0027s formation...Anyway, that\u0027s the system that I play with (compatible with the OPM mod). It does have an asteroid belt of sorts, even if its just 3 asteroids, it still \u0022simulates\u0022 nearly half the mass of the asteroid belt. Note that Dres is proportionately\u00A0far too large and massive to be a proper Ceres analogue... so when I moved up to a 3x rescaled system, I didn\u0027t scale up Dres/Vot/Pact, and decreased their surface gravities (to more or less \u0022real\u0022 values)\u00A0to make them roughly proportional in mass to the real asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-10T08:20:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2017 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-10T08:40:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal asteroids are millions, maybe even billions of kilometers apart.
