Many of our suggestions have been implemented into the game, but some not. There\u0027re still a lot of new features yet to come, that have or haven\u0027t been confirmed by now. What would you like to see next (besides Unity 5 conversion and multiplayer those are obvious ones)? And please don\u0027t say things, that are not going to be in game for sure, like guns for example.\n\nThing, that would make me really happy would be life support, new visual effects, like clouds and maybeb more planets."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:16:28Z","Content":"The title mismatches the description. I would like to see (ordered by importance):\n\n \\* Science mode with upgrades (science to be the only ressource, but needed for upgrades of buildings; further kerbals to gain experience)\n\n \\* constant thrust trajectories\n\n \\* Performance optimizations\n\n \\* Energy production/consumption on inactive vessels\n\n \\* Life support\n\n \\* In situ constructions\n\n \\* Planetary constructions/Infrastructure\n\n \\* Mechanik parts\n\n \\* More planets\n\nOn the other hand, I do not see multiplayer being an obvious wish for everybody.\n\nBut the question asks for what will be in the game for sure. That I cannot answer, as I am no developer."},{"CreatedByName":"Ace_Of_Spades","CreatedById":63298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:57:04Z","Content":"More Wings\n\n1.25M Cupola module\n\nMore Runways at KSC\n\nBoat parts?\n\nThe List goes on and on."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T05:06:13Z","Content":"I\u0027d like some spicing up of the planets. Tylo is essentially a bigger version of the Mun. The planets are all way too similar. \n\nVolcanism, cryovolcanism, weird weather, more interesting surface features, etc."}]}
