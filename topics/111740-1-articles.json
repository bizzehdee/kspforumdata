Many of our suggestions have been implemented into the game, but some not. There\u0027re still a lot of new features yet to come, that have or haven\u0027t been confirmed by now. What would you like to see next (besides Unity 5 conversion and multiplayer those are obvious ones)? And please don\u0027t say things, that are not going to be in game for sure, like guns for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing, that would make me really happy would be life support, new visual effects, like clouds and maybeb more planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe title mismatches the description.
