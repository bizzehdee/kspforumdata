It flies well, having similar characteristics as an RL airliner (meaning it won\u0027t take off at 20 m/s and fly like a fighter). Its range is still very limited (some 100 kms, or so), but hey, it\u0027s still a kind of a prototype. It\u0027s capable of doing some hops to the island airport and back. It can take off at around 60m/s without tailstriking the ground, and needs at least this speed to land (though ~90-100 m/s is preferred for the smoothest landings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEach engine\u003C/strong\u003E - which is the most notable feature of this plane - is made out of 2 default jet engines (a basic, and a turbo jet) clipped into each other, capable of giving ~400kN of thrust combined. The base of the engine is an X200-16 fuel tank, sporting some decoration aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeight:\u003C/strong\u003E 40,41 tons (fully loaded)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart count:\u003C/strong\u003E 131\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterested?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/5i9y0datlaz204d/MAW%20Maxi.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload it here!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-27T10:25:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2014 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jmiki8\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-29T20:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot enough wingspan ... you\u0027ll burn more fuel that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
