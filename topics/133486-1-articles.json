Every time you attach, say, a decoupler to a fuel tank, the fuel tank is the parent, and the decoupler is the child. To complete a circle, the last part in the circle would need to have two parent parts. Theoretically, you could have a loop of child \u0026gt; parent \u0026gt; child \u0026gt; parent parts, but the editor doesn\u0027t allow this, as the first parent can\u0027t be attached to its children because moving the parent also moves the children. But\u00A0his is purely an in-editor constraint, so you can achieve this by docking the two parts\u00A0together outside. If you don\u0027t want to do that, you can strut them together in the editor, or use KIS/KAS or Quantum struts. There aren\u0027t any mods I know of that will allow you to do this in-editor, unfortunately, and I have no experience with hacking .craft files as stated by the person before me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion: Create the full circle, but at the point where it doesn\u0027t connect, strut it together. With a little finesse, you could make it look almost flawless, and it would still be structurally sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T21:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say that definitely not, no, not possible, not moddable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire API is based on the concept that a rocket is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etree\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and that closed loops are impossible.\u00A0 It\u0027s not just \u0022one little thing\u0022 to tweak that; changing that limitation would break \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eastounding\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E numbers of things.\u00A0 And \u0022fixing\u0022 them would be herculean.\u00A0 Not just that the entire game (and every mod that needs to examine ship contents) would have to be rewritten, but you\u0027d be introducing difficult computational problems that would require significantly more sophisticated logic to allow iterating over ship contents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the answer is no, really resoundingly no, and no mod is going to be able to change that, and I seriously doubt that any new KSP version any time soon would be able to change that.\u00A0 It\u0027s a fundamental limitation of the game\u0027s architecture and API design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, I feel your pain.\u00A0 As a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplayer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, I really wish I could build loops of parts.\u00A0 As a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emodder\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (i.e. programmer), I have the exact opposite reaction (\u0022oh, thank god there can\u0027t be loops of parts, please please let that never be possible.\u0022)\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-04T21:17:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2016 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Honimoura","CreatedById":190663,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-30T11:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you can\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/1250/ReCoupler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spacedock.info/mod/1250/ReCoupler\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
