Given that processing a single csv of 300MB takes about ten minutes, and also given resource limitations on my end (that is to say, I\u0027m running a powerful consumer desktop, not a super-computer or say, Mac Pro with all the trimmings), it\u0027ll probably take at least a few days to complete, say, a map of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we have raster maps in-hand, it should be relatively trivial to upload them somewhere for people to use. (The generated images will be \u003Cstrong\u003Emassive\u003C/strong\u003E, assuming we collect all possible data-points.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now I\u0027m going to say the initial target should be Kerbin (since we don\u0027t yet have a high-res data set for it). Just leave KSP running at 50x with your mapping satellite active, collecting raw data, and send it to me when it\u0027s reasonable (say, 300MB - 1GB? Ish?). If you *really* want to help me, then move the original out of the folder and send it to me, so that ISA MapSat creates a new file as it collects new data, then send me that second file later after it\u0027s grown. This will prevent me from having to reprocess the same data multiple times, and will save considerable effort on my end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m certainly willing to accept whatever data anyone wants to throw my way that conforms to the aforementioned standard (ISA MapSat 3.3.0\u002B, KSP 0.17\u002B).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just to put things in perspective, the max-res file would be about 15GB. At a data collection rate of ~767KB/s (which is what I got by watching the csv file size over three minutes), it\u0027ll take 41 days of constant data collection to finish it. That\u0027s not accounting for the time lost generating duplicate data and, removing it, and hoping for non-duplicate data to be recorded (the rate at which new data can be collected is roughly asymptotic, approaching zero new points per time as the file size reaches the maximum possible; this means that the estimate of 41 days is very, very conservative).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-04T09:31:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2012 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grand Lander","CreatedById":31521,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T10:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHa i aint ready any of that.
