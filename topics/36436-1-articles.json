If it is just a command pod-decopuler-asas/sas-rcs-fuel-engine, (so a station shuttle) I just put RCS in the middle using 4-way symmetry. If it is larger, like a long power station, I put (using 4-way) on set on the top, and one on the bottom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on velocities, it CAN be possible to get too much velocity with RCS.

(The part of the ship that will be docking.) Now turn on your Center of Mass icon. Now, turn the symmetry to 4, and put the 4-way thrusters EQUAL distances on each side of the Center of mass icon. Also try and keep your RCS tanks near the center of mass. This will help keep your ship balanced as you use RCS fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your docking question: After you make your intercept burn from stable orbit, go ahead and face retrograde, and turn on ASAS. Now time warp until your target is 2 minutes away(intercept point). Go to ship view and find your target ship. Now look at your target velocity in your nav ball. This value will vary depending on many factors, so if you\u0027re still facing retro, go ahead and make a small burn and see how much it decreases. This should give you a good indication of how much time you will need to bleed off the extra m/s to get it to read 0m/s or close to it. (Say your target is coming in at 150m/s, and it takes you 5 seconds to burn 50m/s, then it will take a 15 second burn to reach 0m/s.) Then face your target, pink circle with dot in center, and burn no more than 10m/s, then always cancel movements towards your target with YOUR retrograde. Hope this helps. If you\u0027re still confused, I show this exactly in my video.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-09T16:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2013 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Xiphos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T18:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother helpful tutorial (with explanatory text) might be \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35988-Launch-rendezvous-and-docking\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E done by myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T18:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBallancing RCS is done in relation to the center of mass.
