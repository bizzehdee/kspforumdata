I can model it, but I want to in one big piece, as it\u0027s hard to me to add in a bunch of objects and align them all. If I make it in one big mesh, I need to split it so its center of mass is not just the location of PartTools. Or is that the center of mass? Where is the center of mass? But anyways, if I did that, the drag would also be wacky, and nothing would work out. I\u0027m using Blender 3D, just FYI. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I\u0027ll split the mesh.

Then how do I reduce polys, decimate modifiers? Will this work? How come I\u0027ve seen people making mods, e.g. Skylon, and modelling it all at once in one solid mesh.

If I do now with the \u0022Y\u0022 key, both meshes won\u0027t have end caps where I split them, just as if I pulled and yanked until the thing split right in two. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Naten\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Any help would be appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T23:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to insert a set of points on each line of the mesh where you want to break it, with the idea of deleting the (short) lines between those inserted points.
