If you think they\u0027re too weak, clip them together. If you think they\u0027re good enough, then.. apply them to your designs. I don\u0027t give a single regard (Honestly) on how people build.

My justification runs: nasa/esa/whatever plan things out ahead, and play it cautious and this would be boring;\n\nI think the idea is that on craft in real life that use reaction wheels, after a while they have built up so much momentum that they cannot spin any faster and so become ineffective, so another form of attitude control (usually rcs) has to be used to \u0022dump\u0022 the momentum so reaction wheels can be used again.
