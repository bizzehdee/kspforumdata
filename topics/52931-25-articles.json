Parachutes are not phsyical objects, giving them a collider would literally break your craft when they deploy. KSP has no idea what a parachute is, it is just being told to orient this part of the model in that direction. The only way to prevent them to clip would be to either give them cloth and string physics, or to tell themn to repuls each other to a certain level. Since cloth and string physics would most likely kill everyone\u0027s comupter (they really would), I\u0027ll have to figure a way to make it work by having them repulse.
