Like certain features that should have been included before release, unity 5, continuing to improve 64bit version and that they would add features for quite some time in beta before moving towards full release and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal feeling is that dropping sales is what is pushing them towards rushing it towards release in the hope that will give them a influx of new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not even make sense for them to release it now as that will affect reviews and it makes even less sense that they are not doing at least a few more beta releases to make sure that the new features they are adding wont cause any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReleasing it now will for sure lead to quite a few new bugs with release version which WILL affect reviews negatively. It is also still unoptimized and have some serious bugs like memory leaks which is something that would make sense to fix before release since you wont get a second chance when it comes to reviews.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it was stated before that they wanted most of the game features to be frozen and finished by release so that things like game saves and mods would not break with future patches. If this is true then they wont really be adding any significant new features or changes and things like unity5 will probably never happen either. If this is not true then it will break peoples save games and mods which is something that players will be less forgiving about now that it is out of alpha/beta. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was only a few months ago that they stated on ksptv stream that they would pretty much cease all other development and concentrate fully on porting it to unity5 as soon as they got their hands on it which they said would mean they could add multicore support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither they are running out of money or they are really having some management issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T03:20:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 03:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by boxman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hanuman","CreatedById":116709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T20:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just don\u0027t understand it, at all. Have the guys at SQUAD ever been dishonest in the slightest bit? Even the tiniest portion of a reason to distrust anything that they say? No. They have been 100% honest and above board all the way, in all the time I\u0027ve played. How many times, and how many ways do they have to say that they are NOT stopping development, before it sinks in? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to name any names, but some of the biggest naysayers in this very thread are the same people I\u0027ve noticed going on and on about their own little personal grievances that they want changed for a while now. I can understand if you don\u0027t realize that is their thing, that you might think 1.0 is a bad thing. It simply is not the case, though. Neither am I saying that everyone with a complaint is just a naysayer and aren\u0027t legitimate. The reality, like it often is, is much more complicated, and there are people all across points in the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, you gotta figure out who it is that you can trust when they write something. All I\u0027m saying is that for me, I trust the guys at SQUAD to deliver. They\u0027ve earned that kind of faith about a hundred times over. Take a look around at the posts of people who think they haven\u0027t paid enough at full price, for the enjoyment they\u0027ve had. Take a look at the kinds of hours some guys have, or the tons of youtube video series from people, or the any of the hundred bajillion praises and positives. If it\u0027s a choice for me who to believe about the readiness of the 1.0 stock game between Forumgoer123 who never breaks stride in picking it apart and looking down on it, or SQUAD, then it\u0027s a pretty easy choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
