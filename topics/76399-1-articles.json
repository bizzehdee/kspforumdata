For example, a \u0027messageboard\u0027 screen in the space centre with contract bids from different companies. One company might be a little unreliable but cheap (lower max. heat on the engine?) or what have you. Since there\u0027s tweakables, it\u0027d just be a matter of adjusting the max. settings of everything by a constant per company. Say you need more power and you don\u0027t care about cost, you switch your engine contract to a company who provides that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have it so that when you initially develop a part, you pay more for having it built in-house until you farm it out to contractors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T10:12:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 10:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Winter Man\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Judgementus","CreatedById":103128,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T13:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this Idea, using different company branded parts giving different perks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only issue I can see if that revert to hanger button being exploited to avoid reliability issues costing a mission extra cash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I like the more power, less heat, better ISP, at higher cost or additional research or something...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindelle_Sunveam","CreatedById":70755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T13:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERevert to launch can be disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for now, it is just a line in the persistent.sfs, but I guess this statement could be made false during the flight, and brought back to true once the player goes back to the space center or fails critically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can easily understand if some contracts came with a warning such as \u0022this is an experimental component, so saves will be impossible during the initial flight\u0022.
