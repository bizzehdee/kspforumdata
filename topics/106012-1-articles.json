It either becomes unresponsive or self-terminates. So far it has only happened when I have been attaching parts to parts that themselves are radially attached to the ship, happened twice yesterday when I was putting nosecones on radially attached SRBs (on radial decouplers) and just now when I was putting an SRB on a radial decoupler. Is anyone else experiencing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, no player.log attached - I restarted the game already and it seems to start from blank at restart.
