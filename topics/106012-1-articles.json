It either becomes unresponsive or self-terminates. So far it has only happened when I have been attaching parts to parts that themselves are radially attached to the ship, happened twice yesterday when I was putting nosecones on radially attached SRBs (on radial decouplers) and just now when I was putting an SRB on a radial decoupler. Is anyone else experiencing this?\n\nSorry, no player.log attached - I restarted the game already and it seems to start from blank at restart. Anything else I could provide?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:58:16Z","Content":"Hi kurja, we really do need logs, also info on your system, the \u0022ldd KSP.x86\u0022 output and anything else you can gather that may help.\n\nAlso please make sure your graphics driver is up to date and that your copy of KSP is not corrupted by testing a fresh copy."},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:38:13Z","Content":"ldd [http://pastebin.com/zS3zMit3](http://pastebin.com/zS3zMit3)\n\neverything should be up to date.
