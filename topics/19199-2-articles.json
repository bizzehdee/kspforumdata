As it is now, you have the attach points and center of mass located midway between the front wheels and the leading trailing wheel. The real rover would have its center of mass much further aft, almost over the leading pair of rear wheels. The reason I bring this up is two-fold. 1) Controlability on launcher, 2) symmetry of attached parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I say this is that I tried putting a Kethane Miner on the back and a few fuel tanks under the windows (which had to be placed individually) and the cart was unbearably aft-loaded and tipped on its back.
