The lab modules are working, and the results dialog has been overhauled to allow you to make all science-related decisions through that one screen. Using the lab through its context menu is of course also possible. Working today on adding support for 3D Mouse devices. A 6DOF input device in a game like KSP can be a very useful thing indeed. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also taking the opportunity then to go over the flight camera code and work out some oddities there, stragglers from a time when everything was a placeholder and there was no way load games, so testing the camera code back then required launching and orbiting around. Camera control is just one thing we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to allow with a 3D mouse device. In flight, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll also have the option to use it to control RCS thrust, linear and rotation at the same time! On other news, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also reworked the logic behind the flow of resources like monopropellant and electricity, to allow containers to properly drain and top off completely, since the current version\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s implementation makes it impossible to drain those last dregs of charge on a battery, or pull that last whiff of intake air into your turbines. \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Chad (C7)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; *I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on upgrading some of the older modules, like the engines and landing gear. The landing gear can now raise and lower on command and do not require waiting for full deployment. The engines have been upgrade to run a bit faster, and have the ability to predict a flameout before it happens. With secondary propellants, the engines will be able to switch to another fuel before a flameout occurs. After that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been focusing my efforts and testing and implementing tweekables with Mike.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; *Last week I finished the Day of the Dead animation, and the images for that celebration and Halloween.
