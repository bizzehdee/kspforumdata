It\u0027d be nice to see you being able to focus your experiments to help gain specific advances, maybe using Kerbin desert science to advance rover wheel technology for travelling on the Mun, if you have any enjoyment of one specific area you want to focus on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Does altitude matter? It\u0027s my understanding that you can scan from orbit to get science. Is there a kind of 3D map around the planet in a similar fashion, so that if you were past geo-synchronous you could study the Kerbal equivalent of Van Allen belts, and if you were in LKO you would get science for atmospheric drag properties or somesuch? Obviously based on my first question, whether you gain just \u0027science\u0027 or specific aspects of science it could be more interesting to have the different aspects but an easier mechanic to have just a bulk science score..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T12:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I was curious about is Harv talked about being able to use Kerbals to take samples and return them to Kerbin.
