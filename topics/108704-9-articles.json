All aspects are subject to change.\n\nThe mod adds a toolbar button that opens KerbNet. It scans the vessel and assigns the appropriate KerbNet settings based on which scanners are found on-board.\n\nA number of settings are available in the in-game settings menu under the \u0022DMagic Mods\u0022 tab.

The default skill is \u0022RepairSkill\u0022, in both mods this is specified in the part config file under the field \u0022useSkill\u0022. You can delete the field to not require any skill, or replace the value with any of the skills available in stock KSP; most of these can be found in the GameData/Squad/Experience/Traits.cfg file under the EFFECT nodes. I believe Repair Skill is given to all Kerbals in sandbox and maybe science mode.\n\nA bug in EVA Struts that could have prevented struts from detaching or loading correctly when attaching two identical vehicles together has been fixed. And EVA Transfer tubes will disconnect if they are attached when two vessels dock together.\n\n[Flexible Docking Ports](http://spacedock.info/mod/838/Flexible%20Docking) has been updated; it natively supports recognizing the ports for contract objectives (without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E) and the ports are moved to the Coupling editor category.\n\nPortrait Stats, Celestial Body Science Editor, KerbNet Controller, and the new addon Science Relay all use the new stock Settings window. These can be found in the DMagic Mods (or DMagic Mods (2)) tab in the Difficulty Settings popup. Most aren\u0027t strictly related to difficulty and so allow for saving the values set in-game to a file on disk. This can be accomplished by setting the desired values, then checking the \u0022Use As Default\u0022 toggle. After applying the settings these values will be saved to disk and will be used as the defaults for all new games.\n\n![NOYq9Yg.png](http://i.imgur.com/NOYq9Yg.png)\n\n[Portrait Stats](http://spacedock.info/mod/133/Portrait%20Stats) can now show a Crew Transfer button when there is space available in the current vessel, selecting it will open the stock Crew Transfer popup. The old tooltips have been removed, but a new option is available to add additional information to the stock tooltips. This includes the Kerbal stats (stupidity, courage, baddassery, veteranness), the name of current part, the current amount of experience and the amount required for the next level, the current flight log, and an itinerary for tourists.\n\n![iFi6K5k.png](http://i.imgur.com/iFi6K5k.png) ![k7gruZ0.png](http://i.imgur.com/k7gruZ0.png) ![5VuMRFO.png](http://i.imgur.com/5VuMRFO.png)\n\n[KerbNet Controller](http://spacedock.info/mod/986/KerbNet%20Controller) has been updated since the pre-release with two new features, a toggle to switch the map orientation and a UI Scale slider, both of these are only available in KerbNet windows opened from the toolbar.\n\nThe Settings window for [Celestial Body Science Editor](http://spacedock.info/mod/136/Celestial%20Body%20Science%20Editor) has been replaced with the stock settings window, but it otherwise functions the same as before.\n\nThe two new modlets are [Science Relay](http://spacedock.info/mod/988/Science%20Relay) and [Basic Orbit](http://spacedock.info/mod/987/Basic%20Orbit).\n\nBasic Orbit is a kind of simplified version of Engineer; it displays the information that is generally available in stock KSP, or that stock KSP asks for (satellite contract orbit parameters for instance), but might not always be readily available. It puts this information into two HUD panels, one for Orbit info and one for Current Target info.\n\n![mcFcyxD.png](http://i.imgur.com/mcFcyxD.png)    ![GPDX9C2.png](http://i.imgur.com/GPDX9C2.png)\n\nThese panels can be customized and moved anywhere around the screen. The Toolbar button opens a settings window that allows for customizing the panels, settings their background transparency, dragging the panels, and setting the UI scale.\n\n![xpDuqAz.png](http://i.imgur.com/xpDuqAz.png)  ![x5Ol6nE.png](http://i.imgur.com/x5Ol6nE.png)  ![KektOCv.png](http://i.imgur.com/KektOCv.png)\n\nAll of the available readout modules can be toggled. Under the standard settings the readout modules are displayed or hidden based on your current situation and the need for each readout. For instance, orbital parameters don\u0027t really mean anything when you are landed, and terrain height or radar altitude are not so important in orbit. The target panel modules are displayed dependent on the type of target, celestial body or vessel. Some of the information is taken directly from the map view markers, and so can only be updated when the map is open. When the map is open the target panel will attempt to show the last known values for these readout modules (the closest approach distance and relative velocity at closest approach).\n\nThis mod is also meant to serve as an example and tutorial (which is forthcoming) for using the Unity 4.6 UI. It is built entirely with that system and uses none of the old OnGUI.\n\nScience Relay is a new addon that allows for the transmission of science data between two vessels. A new button has been added to the stock experiment results window that will open a popup with all vessels in contact with the current vessel (or all vessels if you aren\u0027t using CommNet).\n\n![VZ5AeZc.png](http://i.imgur.com/VZ5AeZc.png)   ![nJGbv6m.png](http://i.imgur.com/nJGbv6m.png)\n\nFor experiments with less than 100% data transmission a comm boost value will be calculated for each potential target vessel, this won\u0027t necessarily match the value shown in the stock window, which is for transmission to Kerbin. Also, this addon allows for direct communication between two vessels without relay antennas, something that stock KSP does not model to my knowledge. This means that the connections available won\u0027t match those shown in the map view; anything in direct contact with the current vessel, or any vessel connected to the current vessel through relays is a potential receiver. \n\nThe amount of data transmitted will be reduced to the transmission percentage level, so an experiment with 10 Data, such as the Goo experiment shown above, will only transmit 10 \\* transmission %, so 4.2 Data to the vessels in the list above. Once the data is received its transmission level is set to 100%, so if you want to transmit the data again or send it to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E you will get the proper value (52.9 science points for the Goo from Laythe).\n\nThere are options in the difficulty menu that allow for requiring a science lab (only stock science lab modules count) for transmission (otherwise only a ModuleScienceContainer is required), or just for the transmission boost. You can also turn off the transmission boost, or adjust its value down. Let me know if there are any errors in transmitting or receiving data, or if vessels show up in the connections list when you don\u0027t think they should."},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T22:24:01Z","Content":"Once again you you make some incredibly useful mods- Basic Orbit will be yet another DMagic mod that I will include as part of my stock set of mods.
