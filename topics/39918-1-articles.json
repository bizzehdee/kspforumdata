I really enjoy grappling stuff and using the cables as fuel lines in conjunction with Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this mod designed to work in micro-gravity situations also? I tried to winch a rover onto a larger craft in ordered to haul the rover to the Mun and later lower it down with the winch, but the rover seemed stuck in a particular orientation and wouldn\u0027t allow the main craft to change heading, even though the winch was fully retracted and in \u0022docked\u0022 mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter messing with the winch I managed to get the ship to ... explode. All things considered it was wildly entertaining, but I may have to redesign my operation if the winch is expected to act like this outside of atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running in 0.21, and I didn\u0027t really use KAS extensively in 0.20, so I wouldn\u0027t know if this is a bug or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
