It is likely that I would never have even tried the KSP trial version if it had not been available for Linux. As it has transpired I have been a dedicated fan of KSP since version 0.18. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that as that thread has been going for a long time it is long to read and search, contains many pages and in some cases out-of-date information. However, I realised today that the Linux compatibility thread was inaccessible because I saw a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-%28Version-1-01%29-%28KSP-24-2%29-%28More-Config-Options%29?p=1397955\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1397955\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epost\u003C/a\u003E in a mod thread asking if there might be a Linux compatibility issue with that mod and of course, that is possible. It does make me feel strongly that there should be a sticky and official thread in the Forum (probably under Support) for Linux users to discuss their \u0022compatibility\u0022 issues even if that is simply a place for long time Linux version users to post reassurances to new users that the problem they may be having is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E due to some Linux version compatibility issue. For example it seems clear that the Linux 64 bit version is currently more stable than the new Windows 64 bit version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is deservedly an international section on the Forum for discussion about KSP in languages other than English. I think there is equally a need for a place in the Forums for KSP discussion between players who speak languages different from Microsoft. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I would be happy and comfortable with the thread being restarted afresh provided the useful notes in the first post and the included links in that first post are retained (after vetting for continued relevance - some of these may indeed be out-of-date too).
