As I recall, the Klaw is NOT a good idea for long-term \u0022docking\u0022. It\u0027s meant for asteroids and temporarily joining two vessels together for either maneuvering or resource transfer. Beyond that, you should be using docking ports for anything long-term. You get proper connections that way. The way the Klaw joins vessels together is atypical from what I can tell. I wouldn\u0027t be surprise if reloading Klawed vessels back into physics range causes problems. Otherwise, the two Klaws attaching to one common vessel are fighting one another. Again, I don\u0027t think the Klaw uses the same type of joints that normal parts connections and docking ports use. Don\u0027t take my word on that, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo date, I think I\u0027ve used the Klaw exactly once; it was WAY back in 0.90 not long after I got KSP and wanted to rescue a ship stuck in orbit with a kerbal in it. I\u0027ve attempted to use the Klaw since, designing debris tugs, but I\u0027ve yet to put those to actual use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T19:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, make sure all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is disabled on the station except for one, sometimes they will work against each other\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thanny","CreatedById":110623,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T19:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I stated, the second save is not using claw docking, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is not enabled in either case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
