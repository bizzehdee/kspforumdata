I think I have called it \u0022Kerbin Space Station\u0022 everywhere? Did I miss one? You are right, it should be called Kerbin Space Station.\n\nTo answer your question: At this early point in time? It will just choose Kerbin, and yes there will only be one station. (although you can manipulate \u0022the failsafe\u0022 to get around that...)\n\nI absolutely agree about allowing one station per body, and that will be coming later, (as soon as I iron out the creases with the nice easy Kerbin missions.) Obviously crew rotations every 30-120 days (as it is now) would work fine for Mun, possibly even Minmus, but what about say, Duna?, I think it would be impractical, so I\u0027m working out the easy stuff, and then I\u0027ll work on missions for other bodies. \n\nTo be honest, although at the moment the modules do require your station to remain in orbit around kerbin, I could easily take that out, and you could then dump your station wherever you felt like and it would work. In fact I may put that into the patch I\u0027m working on at the moment.\n\nI\u0027m very close to finishing up the Kerbin missions though, then I will start work on other bodies.\n\nEdit: never mind, I see what you mean, I\u0027ve put it all over the first post.

As long as the core has a single free docking port that\u0027s enough (eg, Salyut, Spacelab)\n\nThe problem with this is, once the contract has been accepted, I look for a vessel in orbit of kerbin with 4 docking ports. I chose 4 ports because I figured that the chances of having a vessel up there with that many ports accidentally, was pretty slim. 1 port could easily be done by accident (and once the station is defined, I can\u0027t undefine it). Don\u0027t forget I\u0027m also working within the confines of Contract Configurator too.
