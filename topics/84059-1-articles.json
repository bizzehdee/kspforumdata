However, the big difference is that you do not do these calculations on board. The eggheads at NASA can use all the fancy equipment they like on Earth and then they will just beam the relevant data up. Some minor calculations might need doing on the fly, but the way a lot of people play KSP is actually very strange.

There\u0027s a reason we have symplectic integrators, and everything else is differentials that can be done easily with pen and paper. Really It would be pretty simple. All that\u0027s really necessary is a VERY long time. You\u0027d be doing an interplanetary network path after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless you are right, everything is done beforehand, rather than on the fly\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T22:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tutrakan4e\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tutrakan4e\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet\u0027s say we have a probe with an ION engine so it can make very suttle velocity changes and burn very little fuel.

The issue is that it\u0027s going to be a VERY complicated and difficult mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely we\u0027d start with a Venus flyby. Venus can actually give a decent gravity assist, and with repeated flybys can get a probe to Mercury or Jupiter (as was done with Cassini and MESSENGER). We\u0027d probably want to encounter Mercury and Mars early in the mission, before heading for the outer solar system, which would make the trajectory more complicated and take longer. This phase will probably take 5-10 years, with low dV requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point, we get Venus and Earth to throw the probe out to Jupiter. At this point, a gravity assist from Jupiter can send the probe to any of the other outer planets provided they\u0027re lined up properly. With a Voyager style trajectory, we could complete the mission very quickly, but launch windows would be more than a century apart. Otherwise, we\u0027d need to do a much slower outward transfer, because if we need to loop back around to encounter more planets we can\u0027t really do a super-fast solar escape trajectory. This also means the mission will take a VERY long time. I have no idea how long, but it could very well take 50-100 years. Even conventional RTGs will have trouble lasting that long, let alone other hardware. That will be quite the engineering challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
