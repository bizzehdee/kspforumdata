Without power, you have no more control over the craft, and without control you cannot throttle down, cannot shut down the engine, and cannot decouple the claw.

With a ship built from probe core, battery, xenon tank, and ion engine, with the clamp attached to the probe core, I retained control. It \u0022came and went\u0022 a bit, occasionally the throttle would stick, but more often than not it responded. Attaching the clamp directly to the ion engine, things seemed less responsive, so electricity source position may matter, but I was still able to kill the engines with X.\u003Cp\u003EWhen I built the ship in the reverse order, ion engine first, with the clamp attaches to the engine I could still kill the throttle with X but the engine kept running, but not forever. After a minute or two I noted my electric charge reserves refilling again and had control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built another craft powered by an ox-stat, and was able to get that to be uncontrollable for at least a few minutes once, but on a repeat test I retained control, so there may be some unpredictable factor at work. Throttle setting on the ion engine might be important as well; on the same craft I could reliable lose control only if I had the ion engine down so it just barely drained the battery, and remained in \u0022Status: Nominal\u0022. I suspect it\u0027s the engine \u0022flaming out\u0022 that allows the probe core to get some electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven then, there\u0027s another way to regain control. Right-click the xenon tanks and disable them. That\u0027s something you can always do, to all resource storing parts, even when you don\u0027t have control. The attack craft can make this difficult by using a large number of hidden xenon tanks, so they can\u0027t be clicked directly and not all show when clicking the resources pane, but even then appropriate camera manipulation might allow the rest to be right-clicked and disabled. (Clipping tanks on top of each other will prevent disabling them all, but if debug menu abuse is allowed the defender can simply enable infinite fuel.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T20:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like it would be easier to just attach a drive core to the rocket and give it a few thousand dV in some random direction that wont cause an imediate crash. particularly if you manage to accelerate it solar prograde it will very quickly reach a point where it will be years before it returns to a recoverable location.
