If science experiments transfer in a reasonable manner I can just leave the first flight in orbit and rendezvous on my way back from the Mun, no need to try reentry without a heat shield. It is entirely possible to land on the Mun or Minmus, or even Eeloo if you want, using the base set of parts (electricity might be an issue but most engines have alternators) so yeah, two flights (one to get the science, one with the new heatshield to return it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-20T17:27:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2023 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 20\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kdaviper","CreatedById":229094,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-20T17:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224349180\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022221315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703081992\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182121\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Urus28\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Urus28 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst tests for me... I run the game with a 3Gb 1060 GPU, so I was not expecting anything in terms of performances... But it was a happy surprise to see the game run with decent framerate for basic build. I still need to update my graphic card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy major complaint was the number of game crashes, 4 crashes in less than 2 hours. I hope this is related to my outdated graphic card (my CPU is more recent). I had the same start with KPS1 with some mods, so nothing to be crazy about on my side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy overall feeling is that the early part of the game is now far easier than in KSP 1, no part limit, no weight limit, good science rewards... I have the feeling that dev team is aiming to lead more gamers to a full discovery of the kerbol system and not limit it to a small batch of rocket scientists \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E.
