Thankfully, KSP already has one -- in the vessel description field, so I could use that and save a lot of effort. This field does get saved with the craft, but doesn\u0027t exist after launch, but that isn\u0027t a problem if a partmodule can get at it while the vessel is in the editor and save it to a KSPField so that I can use it later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it\u0027s getting at it that I have a problem with.
