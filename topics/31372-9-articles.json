I adore the characters, the writing, and the scenarios these characters are put in. It\u0027s a very good, well animated show that hearkens back to old saturday morning cartoons in some ways, and modern cartoons in others.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a fun show, with plenty of good moral lessons and excellent presentation. Anyone who\u0027s irate about the bronies breaking a gender boundary should check back into the 1950s. People will always like something you dislike, that\u0027s a fact of life, and the mature thing to do would be to simply accept it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn detail, Season 1 was a great start, 2 was extremely strong from start to finish (Especially finish! Dat finale, however d\u0027aw it was..!) and 3 was -okay-, and the coinciding film, \u0022Equestria Girls\u0022 was. Uh. Well. Extremely meh. Derpy or Fluttershy is also best pony. After months of waiting for ponies, here I am once again, every saturday afternoon, watching a show I genuinely enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are not many things that really, truly make me happy. This is one of those things, and no single force on earth could take that from me. None should. I enjoy science fiction of several types, transhumanism theory, cybernetic research and development, and advanced in medicine that make humanity a better, more worthwhile species to be a part of. I also enjoy space, and almost anything involving it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also happen to enjoy a fun, cute, enjoyable show about small pastel horses, and this unnerves a few people I know. It makes me sad, not for myself, but for them, that they\u0027re so hung up that they must ridicule someone for something they believe as childish and ridiculous, when they themselves have their own childish or ridiculous interests, because if there is one truth, being an adult doesn\u0027t take away with little bit of you is still a ten year old kid that just likes to have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth also, MLP:FiM has introduced me to several extremely nice people who are all but family to me at this point, has helped me be more comfortable in my identity, and has made me a generally happier, more open person. It came at a crucial point in my life, and it\u0027ll always have a special place in my heart for that. It\u0027s given me common interest with countless people I would call friends, perhaps to the end, and that alone is worth the ridicule of those around me in my personal life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not my final post on this matter. This is not me giving an ultimatum, or brokering a deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is me simply saying, I am who I am, any and all of us are, and nothing, noone, can change that.
