One thing has been bothering me though. I have been becoming increasingly more reliant on Antimatter for my vehicles. The problem is that my comp isn\u0027t that great anymore so I have to keep part counts down, and having another craft near the launch pad really affects my load times. It also makes testing new craft a lot harder since I have to dock my fuel rover up every time I want to launch with AM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a solution, I was thinking if it would be possible to collect the antimatter from recovered craft that have landed on Kerbin. A new resource (like science) would have to be made as a token for AM; any time you recover a landed craft the AM or He3 on your craft would get added to your persistent save file. That way, on ships you are launching, you could right click an antimatter tank (while the ship status is \u0022landed on Kerbin\u0022) and click a button to add some antimatter to that tank. I\u0027m thinking a similar mechanism to the \u0022retrofit\u0022 button that subtracts science from your total pool. I don\u0027t know if it would be possible to add AM from the VAB with this method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA workaround I am considering doing is modifying the AM containers to start with 10000 AM. This would let me use my spacecraft, but wouldn\u0027t really be enough to power the MW network.
