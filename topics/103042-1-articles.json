It\u0027s got suspension, you have a form of brakes, it steers and you can change direction. Fast? No. Large and heavy. I wanted to build a turboshaft vehicle but as long the smallest jet engine is 62.5 cm after using Tweakscale, you end up with a big baby.\n\nI recommend disabling the smoke effects of the basic jet engine. They\u0027re unrealistic anyway.\n\nComments, ideas ... I\u0027m all ears. Want more power and speed? Yeah, that can be arranged. But first try to drive this one like it is ... \n\nRequired mods:\n\nTweakscale\n\nInfernal Robotics\n\nProcedural Parts\n\n[Procedural Parts Extended](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/662/Procedural%20Parts%20Extended)\n\n[Download link](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/1536)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:24:36Z","Content":"Not bad man.\n\n If I sound a little underwhelmed its only because I know that using those mods its possible to make any shape you want. \n\nI like the fact its driven by a turbine though!
