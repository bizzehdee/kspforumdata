You can only take one surface sample in each biome for scientific results. In real-life, there\u0027s more than just sampling the surface. There\u0027s also studying the rocks, a very important thing done on all Martian rover missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m suggesting that eventually, rocks could be added to terrestrial planet surfaces, each of which provides different science results with thousands of variables. This could be achieved either with Kerbals on EVA or with drills and scanners like on the MER and Curiosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther science improvements I have in mind include launching weather satellites to track weather conditions on both Kerbin and other planets (even Jool), satellites tracking climate change and global warming, and space telescopes (already in mods, but how about we see Squad take a shot at it?) with which you can discover planets, moons, stars, nebulae, and other cosmic formations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
