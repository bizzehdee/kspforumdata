We already have two lines of an automatic metro already. Metros are good for a small radius around the city center but the system is saturated, and each line cost 1 billion euros.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA surface tram costs 20% of the price of the metro per kilometer. It has a lower capacity and is slower but because it\u0027s cheaper, it can cover a wider area. To maximise its efficiency, it needs to have its own lanes, otherwise it just gets stuck in the traffic like a bus. The infrastructure costs are still high, with a lot of surface area, rails, crossings, signs, stations, and power lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I hate about tramways is that it is implemented by city councils more as a way of bannishing cars from urban centers than as a genuine public transport solution. The more real estate a tram system uses, the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has some disadvantages: it\u0027s still expensive, the rails are a hazard for cyclists, the power lines are ugly, and it isn\u0027t any faster than a bus. Also, if one tram breaks down, or if there are roadworks or an obstacle blocking the line, then the whole line is interrupted. You also need a minimum distance between two trams, which limits the cadence, because of power constraints. They require especially trained drivers and maintenance workers and specialized depot facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that new high capacity bus systems are a much better solution. They have the same capacity as a modern tram. They use dedicated lanes, like a tram line but without rails or power lines, which can also be used by emergency vehicles. They can drive around obstacles or take alternate routes. They are also cheaper to maintain because they share most of their parts with the city\u0027s standard bus fleet and can use the same depot facilities and tooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tournefeuille-leguevin.eelv.fr/files/2013/01/exemple_BHNS_small.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exemple_BHNS_small.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T10:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the metro system more.

Even in peak times its pretty efficient, and it\u0027s also a nice way to do a little sight-seeing depending on which lines you take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrams are great for cities that already have the rails down in the first place. Toronto is a fine enough Canadian example of that. They\u0027ve got them, they might as well use them.

The only really annoying bit is that those connector thingamajigs do get derailed sometimes. It\u0027s infrequent, and the driver can fix it pretty easily, but it happens enough that if you use public transport to get around, you\u0027ll likely be on a bus where it happens at least once or twice a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrolley almost forgot about them, there are a few towns in Poland with trolleybus lines, but they are slowly being replaced by trams and city buses usual, never rode a trolley\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T20:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t live in the city, and the one I do live near (only half a million or so including the suburbs) there is no rail system at all. Unless you count Amtrak to go to Chicago - which takes longer and costs more than driving in your own vehicle anyway. We have a bus system that I know nothing about because, I would have to drive at least 5 miles (8km) to get to the nearest stop. If I am leaving my house it is probably to go get groceries or materials, and it would make zero sense to drive 5 miles to the bus stop when it\u0027s only another 3 miles to the places I most frequently go to anyway (not counting work - which is the opposite direction of the bus stop from my house.) Then I have to carry 6 bags of groceries on the bus back to my car, load them into my car, then drive home? Even taking a cab would be more expensive than driving - even counting insurance, maintenance, and acquisition cost.
