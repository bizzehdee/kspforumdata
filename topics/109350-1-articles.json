Here\u0027s where I get stuck: I get the correct inclination and set up a rendevouz at about 3km separation. Then, if I remember correctly, you are told to burn retrograde until your speed drops below 50 m/s. Until this point everything works but then you are told to use your RCS thrusters to make your speed drop to zero. But it says to start this when separated from the target at about 10km. Problem is that once your speed drops below 50 m/s your orbits don\u0027t intersect anymore. Meaning you don\u0027t get any closer than you currently are. In my case we are always at least 43 km apart. So either the instructions are wrong or there are important steps missing. I started everything EXACTLY when and how I was told by the training text.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T13:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eremoved dumb post...

Weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO it\u0027s not a very good tutorial. For one it gives you quite an unwieldy craft to pilot, it tells you to start matching velocities at 60km away(!) then come to a dead stop at 10km(!!!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would start matching velocities at a much closer distance, something like 10-5km and zero relative speed when you are under 2km. I think because it\u0027s telling you to slow down quite early, this is what\u0027s causing you to miss the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another bug! To advance the tutorial, you don\u0027t actually need to dock at all, just switch to the other craft using the [] keys.
