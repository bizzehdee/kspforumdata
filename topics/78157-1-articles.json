It\u0027s not much smaller than the Mk55 radial, although it only provides 20 thrust. Aesthetically it barely fits well on the largest monoprop tank. I think a rescaling is in order? What do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T10:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it a bit big, too. And they pretty clearly changed the default angle on it, the model looks better when placed at the 45 degree from vertical angle like it defaulted to in the preview videos. It has crazy TWR, but not nearly as much as the massless regular RCS thrusters (ERROR: DIVIDE BY ZERO). Seems like if you want a monoprop-only orbital ship you might as well stick with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
