Just like you do with an asteroid? Ok, I know the Mun is huge if you compare to a little asteroid, but, if you find enough time, pacience and determination\u00A0to put a lot of rockets in some side of the Mun, would anything happen? Like, would your rockets push the Mun? Is it possible to bring the Mun to Kerbal? The Mun can move to somewhere outside its orbit? It\u0027s probably not possible, I think the Mun wasn\u0027t programmed to move outside its orbit on the game, just like almost everything on the game, but I just want to kill the doubt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T07:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno, its \u0022on rails\u0022 and even if it wasn\u0027t, you\u0027d need a rocket about the same size as the Mun.
