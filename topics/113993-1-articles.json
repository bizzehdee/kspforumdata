But I can tell you how Apple does it, from observation. They don\u0027t QA your game, they QA it as a product - i.e, does it load on compatible systems and can the user play the game in the most basic definition of that term (i.e, load the first level, click a bunch of things, does it all work at least a little bit). I imagine Apple is a lot more strict with this than GoG would be. We\u0027ve had an instance where a release got rejected because a blue-tooth connected keyboard was not recognized by the game for entering a character\u0027s name (on a mobile phone!).\n\nGoG, I\u0027m guessing again, probably doesn\u0027t go so far with the process, but if the game is said to be compatible with Win XP/7/8.1 and Linux and OSX, then it must be tested on all those platforms. I imagine a large part of that process is automated to a degree, but still requires some human oversight.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It can have also advantages to be able to manually patch and not forced to. You can\u0027t start a Steam game before the actual patch isn\u0027t installed. I had already a few situations that made me hate Steam for this behavior.\n\nYeah, that\u0027s my number one reason I hate steam, and why I usually prefer to purchase games anywhere else when possible. That and that by default all downloaded games are set to \u0022automatically update\u0022 and there is no global setting to change this, you have to change it individually for each game. \n\nAs if bandwidth grows on trees!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You said you can\u0027t just get it up right away, I pointed out that steam managed it.

Usually it takes them at least a day to implement any recent updates. It\u0027s even more chaotic when a game gets a rapid-fire update like KSP just did, and sometimes they\u0027ll \u0022skip\u0022 an update (in this case that would mean going straight to 1.0.4).
