Because my current mission profile has the ship split into 4 pieces at one point to make the delta-v work out reasonably. They do all launch as one big ship.\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s currently a bit of a legal grey area with the current rules, but even my own 1.0.5 grand tour didn\u0027t stay in one piece for all the time in interplanetary space (smaller ship went to Moho).

If you decide to do this, you can separate parts to go to other planets, but they can\u0027t come back and help your Jool 5 part.\n\nAs an example, you send one ship from your starting \u0022bundle\u0022 in LKO to Eve and Moho, one to Duna and Dres, and one to do the Jool-5 and Eeloo.  All three go out, do their missions, and come back to LKO.  This would still count as a Jool 5 completion but not a grand tour because your Jool 5 ship only went to Jool and Eeloo, and didn\u0027t do a grand tour itself.
