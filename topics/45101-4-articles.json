Get yourself into orbit with your interplanetary ship then take the rocket pack to the surface and do your sciences, fly back up and dock to the mother ship and either transmit the results or leave them saved in the rocket packs memory banks for the return trip. It doesn\u0027t have enough power to send its own results and adding that would be a little more than OP, but having a fast, agile little lander with 3400m/s worth of fuel you can science with means you could literally do every moon besides Tylo in 1 mission with a 20t ship and 1 rocket pack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Even Laythe.
