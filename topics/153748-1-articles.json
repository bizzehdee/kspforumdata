The product of 20 years of obsessive labor by a hardcore aeronautics enthusiast who uses capslock a lot when talking about planes, it actually simulates the flow of air over every piece of an aircraft\u2019s body as it flies. This makes it a valuable research tool, since it can accurately simulate entirely new aircraft designs\u2014and new environments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn particular, if you change the X-Plane config file to reduce gravity, thin the atmosphere, and shrink the radius of the planet it can \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.x-plane.com/adventures/mars.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esimulate flight on Mars\u003C/a\u003E.

The tricky thing is that with so little atmosphere, to get any lift, you have to go \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E. You need to approach Mach 1 just to get off the ground, and once you get moving, you have so much inertia that it\u2019s hard to change course\u2014if you turn, your plane rotates, but keeps moving in the original direction. The X-Plane author compared piloting Martian aircraft to flying a supersonic ocean liner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur Cessna 172 isn\u2019t up to the challenge. Launched from 1 km, it doesn\u2019t build up enough speed to pull out of a dive, and plows into the Martian terrain at over 60 m/s (135 mph). If dropped from four or five kilometers, it could gain enough speed to pull up into a glide\u2014at over half the speed of sound. The landing would not be survivable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnluckily, the NASA reference seems to have been shut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dan Daly","CreatedById":172698,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-20T18:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for letting me know that my innocent skepticism when watching the Nat\u00A0Geo TV\u00A0presentation of a fictional Mars expedition was well founded.
