Essentially it was to add an in-editor color selection tool to the texture sets to allow for the player to recolor the parts sections as they desired.  This would mean needing to ship far fewer texture sets with the mod while simultaneously greatly expanding the range of texture colors available for tanks, mounts, etc.\n\nI have spent some time over the past weeks deliberating with [@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/) on how to best implement the feature, how to handle the UI, how to persist the data, and how to implement it in a reusable manner so that it could be used across all of SSTU\u0027s \u0027Modular Parts\u0027.  I am pleased to announce that I have a prototype implementation mostly working (all aside from data persistence).  Will likely spend the next week or so cleaning up the implementation and sorting through the last few unknowns.  Not sure when the feature will be merged into the main branch, but I would expect it to be available with the first SSTU-for-KSP-1.3\u002B releases (if it all works out well).\n\nWhat this will do is add a new button to the stock App Launcher in the editor scenes (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) (alternatively a hotkey could be setup to open the GUI).  When the app-launcher button (or hotkey) is pressed it will open a \u0027Craft Recoloring\u0027 GUI that will show a list of all of the recolorable segments on all parts on the current vessel -- MFT/MSRB/MSC parts have three recolorable sections, an MEC engine has one section (mount), MUS tanks have up to 5 (dome, upper, intertank, lower, mount).  A button will be available next to each \u0027section\u0027 to allow for opening the \u0027Section Recoloring\u0027 GUI; this GUI will contain RGB color sliders as well as a selection of preset color selection buttons.\n\nThis will allow for removal of all plain colored texture sets, leaving just the \u0027white\u0027 set available for use with the recoloring function.  Most of the \u0027unique\u0027 texture sets will stay in place, such as the selection of orange foam, gold foil, silver, and striped textures;  some of them may also have recolorable sections depending on the specific texture (e.g. the white intertank on one of the orange foam textures).\n\nStill quite a bit of work to do on the feature though.  Every single texture set will need a recoloring mask created for it.  The rest of the mount/nosecone/adapter textures and models will need to be reworked for the AO/specular shader setup.  A couple new shaders will need to be written (standard already written, new one for emissive, new one for transparency).  Lots of configs will need updated, and several new patches written.\n\nWill likely share a few more details (and screenshots) this evening after I get a few more bits fully working."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T19:09:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\* This would mean needing to ship far fewer texture sets with the mod while simultaneously greatly expanding the range of texture colors available for tanks, mounts, etc.\n\u003E \n\nAMAZING IDEA!

It might make an appearance in the other SSTU-texture-set enabled module(s), so there might also be easier ways to use it on parts.  It will also rely on custom shaders and a fairly custom texture setup, so they would pretty much need SSTU to be installed (along with its shaders and shader loading code).\n\nThe longer short answer:  Its all open source, anyone is free to implement any part(s) of the code that they want."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T20:26:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The short answer:  Not really.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The long answer:  Sure.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The longer short answer:  Its all open source, anyone is free to implement any part(s) of the code that they want.\n\u003E \n\nThat was exactly the answer I was expecting to be honest.

GUI is also quite primitive at the moment.  Persistence works though, which was a big unknown earlier today.  Code is all prototype-ey and a bit fragile at the moment, but it does clean up and unify all of my shader/texture set code to use a single interface, while adapting it to be much easier to use with custom shaders in the future (without code-side changes).\n\nAlso created a simpler to use set of tools for building the shader asset bundles in the Unity editor.  Now its a simple \u0027select shader files\u0027, \u0027hit export button for chosen platform\u0027, and finally \u0027input final name of compiled bundle into file save dialog window, and optionally choose a path to save to\u0027.  Much simpler than it was before, which required manual renaming and copying around of files, as well as a bit of in-editor setup work to get them assigned to bundles in the first place.\n\nAs can be seen from the screenshots this method allows for recoloring only specific portions of a texture through the use of a secondary grayscale mask texture.  This allows for non-recolorable bits to be present in the model, such as the fuel lines on the side of the tank or the stripes, to stay the original color used in the texture.

That means, using the above screenshot examples, that you can recolor the \u0027white\u0027 portion of the tank, but cannot recolor the \u0027stripes\u0027.\n\nWhat I would like to propose would be to use (up to) three recolorable sections per mask texture.  This would mean that the above examples could have a separate customizable color for the main \u0027white\u0027 portions of the tank, one for the \u0027stripes\u0027, and potentially a third for the \u0027intertank\u0027 area.  Not all masks would need or have more than one recolorable section.  Different mask setups could be used for various stripe patterns. \n\nEssentially this would mean I would only need to ship a single \u0027standard\u0027 white texture for the tanks and many other parts (though I would still include the non-standard textures such as orange foam, gold foil, etc), along with a few different masks to allow for the various stripes and pattern setups.  It would only require adding a few more persistence fields to each of the modules, adding two more buttons to the recolorable-part-selection GUI for each section, and a few other quite minor code and shader changes.\n\nAny interest in this \u0027advanced\u0027 version of the part-recoloring?

The below images were all generated using a single diffuse and mask texture for the tank and mount (each).  With a couple more masks, the recoloring possibilities are astounding.  Note, especially, the recolorable \u0027banding\u0027 on the mount section, exampling how one of the recolor channels can be dedicated to \u0027detail\u0027 recoloring (banding, hoses, fuel spheres).  The GUI really didn\u0027t become any more complex, merely had a couple extra buttons added per-section to control the extra mask areas.\n\nOverall I think I\u0027m quite pleased with the prospects for the \u0027advanced\u0027 recoloring setup.  Where one choice was good, three is definitely better.  I was hesitant at first because of the added complexity, but after playing with it for a few hours... I\u0027m sold.\n\nStandard Saturn texture, with red detail band on mount\n\n![nuAK1OR.png](http://i.imgur.com/nuAK1OR.png)\n\nInverted stripes, with blue detail band on mount\n\n![oJqYRzy.png](http://i.imgur.com/oJqYRzy.png)\n\nRandom browns/greens/almost camo colors, with green\u0027ish banding on the mount\n\n![CYM3m4w.png](http://i.imgur.com/CYM3m4w.png)\n\nFull Black\n\n![AeqGHJd.png](http://i.imgur.com/AeqGHJd.png)\n\nOrange/Gray\n\n![Kq8Gare.png](http://i.imgur.com/Kq8Gare.png)\n\nStock Colors w/stripes\n\n![FlJYThS.png](http://i.imgur.com/FlJYThS.png)\n\nFull Stock White(ish) with red banding on the mount\n\n![tHvgdYD.png](http://i.imgur.com/tHvgdYD.png)\n\nGood stuff...."},{"CreatedByName":"StickyScissors","CreatedById":144204,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T04:52:51Z","Content":"This is a fantastic idea!
