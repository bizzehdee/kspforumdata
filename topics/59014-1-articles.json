Make sure on the nav-ball, you are facing the pink circle in target mode, or any mode, then it should be directly in-front of you ship. You can select the other ship as target with the rendezvous tab in Kerbal Engineer. Sometimes, when i select some thing as target, nothing happens, so i un-select it, and select it again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"irongut","CreatedById":97315,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T01:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAha!
