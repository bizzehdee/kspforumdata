It was a type of bomb based on a old k bomb a few versions back. I dropped it, and realized that my ship was actually entering the atmosphere. Somehow I had forgotten to stabilize the orbit. This would be fine, except the ship in question was a top of the line battle cruiser. This also meant that it had no parachutes. Astonishingly, it\u0027s armor managed to survive the fall. The craft survived completely intact, only losing two engines. You\u0027re probably wondering how this is the worst way to die. Well turns out that bomb I dropped earlier landed a few meters away from the craft and unleashed a ball of kraken on the craft. There were no survivors.

I spend hours mostly playing with maneuver( Yes, that\u0027s how I spell it) nodes, but I had finally got to an aerobraking trajectory around Duna. I aerobrake until I reach about 20km. Then, as my nose tips down I realized my fatal mistake. I hadn\u0027t tested the aerodynamics of the craft for Duna. Or, you know, AT ALL. My nose was at a 35\u00A0degree angle and dropping, and I couldn\u0027t pull up. And I was going 800 m/s at 15km above the ground. The plane was about as aerodynamic as a brick, mind you. No matter what I did I couldn\u0027t slow down or pull up. Then, I remembered I had one tiny drogue chute. On the back engine. Only on one side. In a \u00A0maneuver I learned from War Thunder, I rotated 90 degrees to the left, spammed the S key, went into a spiral, hit the drouge chute, and I managed to get down to 100 m/s and keep the nose at a 45 degree angle. I was going to make it! 6km. 5km.\u00A0Misestimated and was actually 500m above the ground. BOOM! After 10 seconds I opened my eyes and saw the plane fully intact rolling down the hill! ... except for the cockpit. The\u00A0ENTIRE rest of the plane was intact.
