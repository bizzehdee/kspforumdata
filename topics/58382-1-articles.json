Can you do the science only once in a specific place regardless of data transfer you do??? and if so if I transmit then do I waste potential science or can I go back and re-do it again but this time physically return the data?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I go to the mun, orbit it, do unmanned science and transmit... I get reduced science. and then later I return for a manned mission in the same place, and redo it again, but this time actually return the data.

Just make small probes with the temperature or gravity sensor and send them to every feature on the target that looks important. If the experiment describes it as from a different name from what you\u0027ve seen before then you can mark the biome (by renaming the probe).
