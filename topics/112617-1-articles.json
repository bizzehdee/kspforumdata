I made a spaceplane, and wanted to launch. It has two turbojet engines and one jet engine. However, when I launch it, the fuel is half gone, and it has not flown at all! Why is this? Do I need more intakes?

What most people care about for jets is fuel efficiency for distance. The common approach to that is to fly high and fast. Flying high lowers drag and thus the thrust needed to maintain speed. Flying fast means that you consume less fuel per distance because you cover it faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single turbo jet super cruises at 1 km/s for .15-.25 fuel drain rate.
