detail and explain the limits of this point--but in a spoiler, because I don\u0027t want to derail anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022

not exactly \u0027size\u0027 but when you say \u0027bigger rockets\u0027, you\u0027re still referring to this more than engine efficiency).\u00A0 You can pick more efficient engines, but only to a point because KSP doesn\u0027t offer ways to design better engines:\u00A0 better \u003Cem\u003Erockets\u003C/em\u003E, yes, but better \u003Cem\u003Eengines\u003C/em\u003E, no.\u00A0\u00A0 The most efficient engine available in the game has a certain predetermined efficiency and it will only ever have\u00A0that efficiency, so that sets a limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass ratio is defined as the wet mass divided by the dry mass and refers to the amount of fuel available in the stage to push the rocket from place to place.\u00A0 The dry mass of the rocket is the mass of everything but the fuel for that stage (this dry mass can include fuel for upper stages that is not available to the lower stages), and the wet mass is the mass of everything, period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may not be obvious, but it is possible for a larger (that is, more massive) rocket stage to have the same capabilities as a smaller one, provided that the mass ratios and engine efficiencies are the same for each rocket.\u00A0 Identical efficiency\u00A0is easy to achieve:\u00A0 use the same engine on both rockets.\u00A0 Identical mass ratio\u00A0is more difficult, but the idea is that if, for example, you have a 3-tonne rocket made up of one tonne of hardware and two tonnes of fuel, then you will get identical delta-V from a three-hundred tonne rocket that is one hundred tonnes of hardware and two hundred tonnes of fuel, because the mass ratio of both rockets is 3.\u00A0 There are differences between the rockets, but raw capability in terms of available delta-V isn\u0027t one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason that \u0027better designed, more efficient\u0027 rockets get better performance is because every gram of payload that you remove improves the mass ratio for a given load of fuel.\u00A0 Imagine the\u00A0performance of that three-hundred-tonne rocket if you could reduce\u00A0the payload to that of the one-tonne rocket, but keep the two hundred tonnes of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, just as the fact that KSP doesn\u0027t let you improve engine performance sets a limit on engine efficiency, the fact that fuel is only available in predetermined fuel tank sizes\u00A0sets a limit on the mass ratio, too, because once the fuel is spent, you are left with the dry mass of the empty tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe cannot add fuel tanks without limit (computer memory capacity prevents it if nothing else does), but let\u0027s assume that we could.\u00A0 We cannot add fuel without also adding fuel tanks, so we have to account for the fuel tank mass ratio.\u00A0 However, if we add enough fuel tanks, then their mass dwarfs the mass of the rest of the rocket, so we can say that the theoretical limit of performance for the best possible rocket stage is one where the mass of the rocket is effectively nothing but\u00A0fuel tanks.\u00A0 In that case, we can simply use the mass ratio of the tank itself (one tank has a certain amount of fuel mass and\u00A0tank mass; two tanks have double the fuel but also double the tank and so the same mass ratio, and so on) and get the theoretical limit of performance for the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel tanks in KSP have a mass ratio of 9; that\u0027s eight parts fuel plus one part tank for a full fuel tank.\u00A0 The most efficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engine in KSP is the Poodle with 350 seconds of I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E.\u00A0 This gives, through the rocket equation, a\u00A0theoretical absolute best performance of 7,541.6 m/s of delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could go into detail about the Nerv and Dawn but it\u0027s not necessary to make the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is that for any\u00A0rocket you might build in KSP, its performance in terms of delta-V is going to fall within a range of possible values.\u00A0 For \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets, the range is, at most, between 0 m/s and 7,541.6 m/s.\u00A0 Practically, you can expect a well-designed, efficient rocket\u00A0(with a Poodle or similar-efficiency engine) to have about half of that--it is extremely difficult to get into the upper reaches of that range and impossible to get to the maximum.\u00A0 Thus, although you may want to try for the upper end of that range, the rocket\u00A0nevertheless has to stay in the range.\u00A0 The only way to improve the rocket\u0027s performance past that limit is to somehow convert payload mass into fuel--which is exactly what staging does--or to shed dry mass entirely.\u00A0 Staging does that, as well.\u00A0 By splitting the total delta-V into smaller pieces and shedding unneeded dry mass, a staged rocket can operate at close to its maximum mass ratio for longer, so even though stages add mass, the overall effect is more of an efficiency boost than a size boost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarise, there is a maximum amount that making a rocket bigger can help you.\u00A0 There is also a maximum that making a rocket more efficient can help you, but that is a higher limit and thus it is easier to see useful improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-08T15:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
