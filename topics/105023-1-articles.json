Feel free to modify the truck to any configuration you desire or use the chassis for other purposes.\n\n**2) Flatbed**\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/pandoraskitten/KMC-M2-Flatbed-Truck](http://kerbalx.com/pandoraskitten/KMC-M2-Flatbed-Truck)\n\n![ZNbOiKj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZNbOiKj.jpg)\n\n![eJhAtz5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eJhAtz5.jpg)\n\nThe flatbed can accommodate 5 meter payloads and is tested up to 8 tons with Tim Yam\u0027s [custom cat command module](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116405-Tim-Yam-s-Spaceliner-Habitats-Birds-of-Prey-Walmart-Galactic-and-Cats-in-Space%21)."},{"CreatedByName":"Nik_601","CreatedById":104747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:30:24Z","Content":"Nice job!

I do intend to build a semi truck with working 5th wheel hitch next, and that one will be much larger as I intend to follow the American sleeper cab template ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I am just wondering what to put inside the (huge) engine cowl as I am not using any internal combustion engine mods at the moment. \n\nMaybe a radial propeller engine to see a spinning fan inside, for lulz.\n\n@Nik\\_601 - really good designs! I will definitely take some inspiration and use more stock parts. Your O2 copters are great as well, simulating ducted fan appearance with the big SAS modules.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T02:18:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"}]}
