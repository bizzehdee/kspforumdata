I\u0027ve set up quite stable Keosynchronous Satellite Network with three satellites (COM 1, COM 2, COM3). Each one has three Comms DTS-M1 dishes (Two for neighbors and one for Mission control) moreover there\u0027s Reflecton KR-7 for whatever uses (active vessel for now). Ok don\u0027t ask me why I made this design I just felt it could work and it quite did. Then I\u0027ve launched and placed even one more satellite (POCOM 1) to \u0022polar orbit\u0022 90 degrees from \u0022keosynchronous\u0022 orbit - (three dishes Comms DTS-M1 are targeted to three satellites from Keosynchronous orbit \u002B Reflecton KR-7 for my unmmaned mun mission) =\u0026gt; \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConnected to KSP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E - even though I did not targeted the three Reflectons KR-7 from \u0022keosynchronous\u0022 orbit back to POCOM 1.

Then I tried to switch my target to POCOM 1, that I set up for these longer journeys, and immediately I lost my connection. So I tried to target the dish from POCOM 1 (so far targeted to active vessel) back to my Mun Probe and nothing - still no connection even though POCOM 1 was connected to KSP through COM 2; it just could not connect to my probe. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDon\u0027t get it! \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003ENever mind I load my save and went on with pointing at COM 1. The rest of the mission I had a connection but my target was constantly auto switching among COM 1, COM 2 and finaly even POCOM 1.

It will pick your target first, but if that target is blocked or doesn\u0027t provide a connection back to Kerbin, it will pick another within the cone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re at the Mun (or Minmus), you can just target \u0022Kerbin\u0022 and it will automatically pick a sat around Kerbin. Same for sats around Kerbin - you can target \u0022Mun\u0022 or \u0022Minmus\u0022 instead of specific ships, and then anything within that cone around the moon will get a connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Kerbin/Mun/Minmus, this works will with the DTS-M1 dish, which has a wide angle (45 degrees). The KR-7 has a 25 degree angle cone. The Comm 88-88 has a 0.06 degree angle, so needs to be really far away in order to have the cone surround a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW the DTS-M1 is significantly lighter than the KR-7 and reaches all the way to Minmus; aside from looks there\u0027s not a real good reason to use the KR-7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;even though POCOM 1 was connected to KSP through COM 2;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it was. COM2 was connected to COM1, COM3, Mission Control, and Active Vessel, right? That means POCOM1 will have a connection only while you\u0027re controlling POCOM1 (while POCOM1 is the active vessel), but when your Mun ship is the active vessel, POCOM1 won\u0027t have any connection because COM2\u0027s \u0022active vessel\u0022 dish is now pointing at your Mun ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOmni antennas will connect to everything within range automatically; it\u0027s a good way to keep your comm sats talking to each other without having to point individual dishes.
