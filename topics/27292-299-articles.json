There\u0027s a 4000 unit battery in there to keep the engines running on the dark side of the orbit, and everything separates from the capsule for the return to Kerbin.

I think there maybe a problem with me modding the probe cores to store science, although that should work flawlessly. Maybe I just moved the one set of data onto the other via ShipManifest, so possibly a layer 8 problem. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew pod of Capture One was lacking parachutes, but luckily the Kethane transport docked to the station carried boxes with contingency equipment, among them radial parachutes of which one was welded onto the pod in a sweaty EVA - jetpacks have real difficulties handling the off-balance of carrying such a heavy part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeorbiting went well, the docking port survived its role as heatshield with a soft reentry and so did the crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not get done very much lately - really should stop adding and reconfiguring mods and get on with my planned missions!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T08:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boa3532\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boa3532\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0060\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see the craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually super simple. The drop pod is designed to shed its outer protective layer of structural panels after the re-entry effects and hypersonic speed effects are gone (usually between 6000 and 2000m) and the only thing left after that is a Mk1 lander can with an octagonal hardpoint and 2x2 structural panel on the bottom to cushion the impact and 2 separatrons on the side of the lander can. Point straight down, ignite at 200m above ground level and the pod will survive impact.
