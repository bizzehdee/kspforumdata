My career mode is heavily modded to perfection. I have 40\u002B mods, and several of which I have personally modified. The goals of this career mode are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand once the tech tree is completed, to set up a fully independent MKS colony on every planet with a surface, and a fully independent OKS station in orbit of every planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, this will take some time. I will be sure to keep you updated. The first part will be posted soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack story: Kerbals had lived underground for hundreds of years, always curious of everything. They dug intricate tunnels and caves, but where prevented from going anywhere by an extremely hard layer of material, varying in color from green to brown. They soon found this material to be a living creature, and began using it for construction to make extremely solid buildings and tunnels. Then, one day, three brave kerbals finally broke through the layer, and what they found amazed them: A huge, flat ground they called the surface. There were no walls and no ceiling, nothing but emptiness leading to a bright blue sky, an apparently infinite distance away, covered by strange, white, floating objects. The three returned to their home to tell their family. By the time they returned, the surface had changed: The sky was pitch black, with only one or two pinpoints of light. The scientists where amazed by what they found: a cycle of light and dark, propagated by a bright white ball in the sky. They tracked it, and measured the day to be 6 hours long. They also traced the paths of the few stars, and and found that, under a telescope, they where circles, some with smaller dots around them. They also found a big, whitish-grey circle that changed it\u0027s shape over the days. The three kerbals who discovered the surface vowed their lives to explore this world: they found mountains, plains, and huge pools of water. They where most interested by the sky, though, and began construction of something to take them there: thus was the invention of the rocket. They left their home, never telling anyone their surface home\u0027s location, and refused to let anyone watch for an unknown reason. They where never heard from again, and the location of their facility was lost with them. Today, we found this Space Program in memory of Jebediah, Bill, and Bob, and look forward to our Voyage to the Stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here are my settings (DRE on hard):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yeKO487.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yeKO487.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T02:20:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 02:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xXIndestructibleEVAXx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T22:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe grand opening of the KSC was a huge success, and brought in 51,000 funds from donations.
