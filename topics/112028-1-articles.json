But I am also debating whether to use aero dynamic wings after aerobraking than using parachutes and possibly rockets, or use a mix of parachutes and rockets after aero braking with no wings involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is, how suitable is Duna\u0027s atmosphere for aerodynamic \u0022gliding\u0022 a large spacecraft after aero braking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I should try it myself, but I am still in the process of perfecting the transfer to Duna from Kerbin(lol). And testing similar systems on Kerbin does not provide me the confidence and data to come to a conclusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T04:36:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Likasombodee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T06:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGliding on Dune much better right now, you can easily land craft in 70-80 t with only 2 big delta wings (with small help from engines) on surface with 2 km altitude with some maneuvers before (include 180 degrees turn).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T09:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe real question would be if it is useful enough to warrant bringing those wings all the way to Duna in the first place.
