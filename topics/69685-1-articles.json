Try adjusting the angle of your node and tweaking your departure speed to compensate, and you should find that you can generate a proper encounter without much deviation from the expected delta-v requirements. Those small tweaks you make will mark the difference between Kerbin being on one side of its orbit or the other by the time you reach your closest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robbii6","CreatedById":69855,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T21:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh right ok, nice ill give it a try now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T21:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHope you make it work.
