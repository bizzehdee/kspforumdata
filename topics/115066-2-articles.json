Should I make shields last longer then, based on the above? Or would that just be less fun?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if you should make them last longer - I feel like I may have read / watched / heard something along the lines of what you\u0027re saying: that they are good for one re-entry and one skipout, but the reason was they were concerned about the stress (\u0026amp; strain) cycling of the heat shields due to the rapid heating and relative rapid cooling of the heat shields after they come out of the atmosphere. I could be making this up, but this would make sense - my experience / and recollection of other ablative materials is that they are very brittle and could see concern about the thermal stresses as well as just the re-entry aerodynamic stresses building up and compromising the integrity of the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the case, would it be possible to have two different \u0027criteria\u0027 for heat shields: one being the ablative material and the other being a damage accumulation that is some function of velocity and atmospheric density (so realistically, maybe just drag force) to account for these different performance criteria?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need to edit a bunch of Physics.cfg factors if you\u0027re playing with a rescale.
