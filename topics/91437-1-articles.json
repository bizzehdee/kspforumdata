The largest single part in the game weights 82 tonnes, so the game needs a relatively simple way of launching 100-tonne payloads. Add an upper stage that\u0027s powerful enough to push such payloads to orbit, and the total mass becomes around 200 tonnes. With the stock atmosphere, where drag is significant even in the upper atmosphere, upper stages need a relatively high TWR. For a 200-tonne upper stage/payload combination, the engine should produce at least 2000 kN of thrust. With a more reasonable atmosphere, the 3.75 m upper stage engine could work with just 1500 kN of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T23:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NBZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NBZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou may like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-0-25-WIP-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-2-1-%282014-11-25%29?p=1559291\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1559291\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENecroBone\u0027s SpaceY pack\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cp\u003ER1 engine 2 MN under a 2.5m stack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER5 cluster 10MN under a 5m stack\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know of this mod; but I\u0027m talking about \u003Cem\u003Estock\u003C/em\u003E parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T23:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, I don\u0027t see valid reasons behind the majority of these suggestions.
