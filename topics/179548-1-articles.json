The\u00A0Ryan XV-5A Vertifan\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0was just one of these, but I have no idea how to begin building one in KSP. I\u0027ve made a few false starts, but need help from people more experienced in building \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E aircraft (I fear I have little talent for that task).\u00A0The challenge is to build a flyable approximation, and/or then tell me how to do likewise.

The issue is I don\u0027t think you can really do the kind of fancy duct work and fan mechanisms and make it small enough to be practical. Also the aerodynamics isn\u0027t as advanced as you\u0027d need it to be for this to really work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9645819007\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160915-x-plane-of-the-day/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3107915\u0026amp;embedComment=3107915\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:313px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould be an interesting challenge though....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
