For example, I have logged something near 1500 hours of KSP time, from about version 0.12 right up until now, which is more than any other game I have ever played (including any one Civilization game). I felt that when Squad asked for money to have access to the \u0022full version\u0022, they did so in a responsible manner. When I bought the game at 0.14, I thought that the features they were had in the game were worth the asking price (I think it was about $10). This allowed Squad to get paid while the game was in progress and the fans to have a hand in debugging and directing the game. When more features would get added, the price would go up to match the amount of features in the game at the time, not what would eventually be added (as many games on steam early access would have you do). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe community surrounding this early game were dedicated fans who wanted to see KSP come to its full operational state. It was truly an amazing spectacle to behold. Then, KSP went onto the steam store, and opened the game to a wider audience, and more importantly, they did so when the game had enough working and implemented features to be fun and playable for the people who were just getting into the game at the time of the steam release. As such, the game community grew and was largely enriched by this and Squad was able to continue to make the game that most fit their vision and our desires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this did come at a small cost. A few sentences ago, I mentioned that I have played close to 1500 hours of KSP. No matter how great a game is, early access has one flaw, people can and do get burned out before the game is released. This is not me saying that the game is bad or that I wanted something else from Squad. Quite the opposite actually, I feel that KSP was shaped just as much by Squad as it was me and the other community members, both old and new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat all that was set up as was a method to convey this, Squad nailed the early access model on the head, but it comes with a small cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your feelings about this, am I way off base, or do you agree with me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T18:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice post!

The idea behind Kerbal Space Program is brilliant, but the actual game implementation leaves a LOT to be desired. Tons of bugs that went unfixed release after release as Squad prioritized adding new content over actually building a solid foundation. They also don\u0027t seem to really grasp the concept of software testing, the next release is slated to be 1.0 but in reality it will be more like 0.27, .90 was not really a beta in any meaningful sense and now they\u0027re jumping straight to release, all while adding new features at the last minute during the testing phase (go read the devnotes for this week).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, Squad really hasn\u0027t been very good at interacting with the community. I\u0027m very grateful for the weekly devnotes so we can at least have an idea of what they\u0027re working on, but they don\u0027t really listen to community feedback in any meaningful way and have made a lot of major decisions behind closed door (curse, .90, and now 1.0) and when the community objected, Squad basically said nothing (I got the impression that they really didn\u0027t know how to react and just kept quiet with the hope that things would eventually calm down) and kept on doing what they were doing.

With a solid initial plan and a disciplined approach to feature creep, the game will have an obvious point where it is ready to leave early access after the initial plan is complete and it has been extensively beta tested. After release, development can still continue (even with major new features) on a beta branch, but by staying focused on the initial plan the game will avoid getting stuck in development forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T18:20:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T18:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EtherDragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EtherDragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe also don\u0027t know what licenses KSP is bound to, for sure.
