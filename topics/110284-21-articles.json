Then I realized that If I link them ALL to water, which is used by the geothermal, then some of the processes run the risk of taking the whole plant offline by accident if a process consumes water faster than it could be brought up. That would mean that the water/steam/water cycle would be broken, and either the Geothermal, or the Solar Flare would be forced to go offline the moment that happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the model I\u0027ve come up with to differentiate ground water from steam cycle water is thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cooling Tower, which I have affectionately theme-named the Old Faithful Condenser Tower, has two processes. One is the cooling process, which for the price of pump operation electricity, turns Steam back into usable water, but instead of water, it turns it into \u0027Distilled Water\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second process, actually turns water into Distilled Water at the cost of a big chunk of ECs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistilled water, as you may or may not know, is water that, through one process or another, has been almost completely stripped of any mineral and salt deposits that would otherwise exist in solution in it. It is pure H2O. The reason I choose this, is because in industry, regular water is actually corrosive to pipes and machinery. That, and the process of distillation is almost exactly the process that occurs in a power generator cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeperating water from distilled water, I can now operate the various cycles I\u0027m adding like so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Water is extracted InSitu via core drill, Drill-O-Matic, or Claim Jumper and stored in a tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Old Faithful, using alternative energy supplies at the initial jumpstart, converts a small amount of this raw water into clean, distilled water. Minerals are also produced in tiny quantities as a byproduct of the process. They can either be used, or discharged from the system. (Alternately, the OF distillery process can produce steam and minerals, so the steam has to be condensed fist.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The distilled water can now be utilized by the Hot Spring to jump start the power cycle. The HS consumes the distilled water and Geothermal Energy as per before. Though I\u0027m planning to reduce the Absolute Minimum you included. (Seriously? 2000 units of water? One core drill right outside KSP took 6 realtime hours to extract 10 units! I know that\u0027s not the purpose of the core drill, but HOLY-) The HS produces steam and EC as the primary product. I may put a slight loss of conversion in with the steam to simulate it getting lost in the ground pump process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Steam returns to the Old Faithful, where the cooling process returns it to Distilled Water. When you figure out the thermal production part of the process, that will be integrated with the tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Refinery unit will utilize advanced fuel production processes to go with real fuels. Each process will require distilled water since heat is a very common byproduct, and produce steam. You know where the steam goes to at this point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distilled water becomes a mostly closed-cycle. Aside from the planned losses at geothermal, Distilled water pretty much stays in a loop like it should. Regular water is used to top it off, but can remain usable for electrolosis and gas shift processes as needed without the threat of one of these fuel production processes instantly shutting the whole facility down by accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick, however, is that I\u0027m planning for the Old Faithful to only be able to support a limited number of external processes. Like, one Old Faithful can support 3 Geothermals, OR one Solar Flare. Or One Geothermal and a collection of smaller processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal however, is that the water-steam cycle is somewhat simulated and made useful across the units. Really, it may seem more involved, but It feels like a waste to set up more templates to have them do ONE thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m even contemplating the cooling tower having a steam purge converter. (Input steam, output steam with \u0027dump excess\u0027 being true.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, if I make that, I\u0027ll need to create a secondary geothermal function that utilizes straight water, has a much higher chance of breakdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I think I WILL do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn open AND closed cycle geothermal process. The open cycle produces more power, but is bottlenecked by how much water you can draw into it, and because of the mineral content, is prone to much higher breakage. The closed cycle process operates at a lower EC production level, but the limitation is mainly because the cooling tower is actually cooling the steam instead of just dumping it off. However, it\u0027s FAR more reliable and separates the water cycle from fuel production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027mma\u0027 go work on these cfgs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T18:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat should\u0027ve been 500, it is a leftover from testing.
