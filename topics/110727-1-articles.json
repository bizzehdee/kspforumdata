Both should be able to make a cheaper version of a cargo bay, for aero occlusion. The stack separator should be cheaper, and create its own uneditable autofairing to the next comparable sized part; if none found within a few hops of its attachment point, it should fallback to a smaller size cone interstage.\n\nThe decoupler editable autofairings would be distinct from the fairing bases, due to the fact that they are only meant to enclose interstage parts. Fairing bases should be more of a \u0022enclose oversized parts in an aero shield\u0022 part (which can also functionally be an interstage.)"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T03:11:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m all for the interstage fairing change.

An argument could possibly be made that decouplers need to be larger to physically separate the fixed attachment point from the explosive decoupling (I admit I made that up, but it is a possible justification). That said, I\u0027m not convinced by the difference in weight, as separating both sides can still be as simple as blowing a single set of bolts (i.e. I\u0027m not convinced there is a good case for separators to be larger or heavier)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:00:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the staging menu, the separator would continue its current behavior, but in action groups, you would see \u0022separate top\u0022 and \u0022separate bottom\u0022.\n\nThat\u0027s a nice suggestion that should be relatively easy to implement and give some quick help to the issue raised.
