It is my user folder that I backup to multiple locations. I don\u0027t bother (and I admit this is my fault, but also a limitation of cloud storage backups) with backing up any other location. If my machine goes down, I can just reinstall my apps, no big deal, this machine in particular is not what I use to make my living.

Like suggested before, symlinks will work nicely for you (in OSX or Linux, even Windows but it\u0027s a little harder). Put your saves and screenshots folder in your user folder and link them into the KSP folder, then they\u0027ll get backed up and KSP won\u0027t know the difference.

It creates symlinks in the main KSP folder. You\u0027d run it, create a new instance and import the screenshots and saves folders (or copy them manually into the instance folder), then just activate the instance. You\u0027d never have to run it again if you didn\u0027t want to. You could even delete the .jar file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Though, DataSwitcher may have some problems if you don\u0027t have the user permissions to create symbolic links.

Install Bittorrent Sync and then set up your saves/mods/whatever folder as a synced folder. Then install BTSync on the other computer(s) and tell them to also sync those folders. Now your games will sync whenever at least two computers are turned on and have BTSync running in the background. In effect, it\u0027s just like Steam Cloud; there\u0027s an advantage however, in that BTSync tries to use your local network ~before~using an Internet connection. It\u0027s faster as a result and you never have to worry about Internet or service downtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso while it may use the Bittorrent protocol, BTSync uses a unique key system to make it completely private for your own use. No need to worry about prying eyes or someone stealing your stuff. :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree that official Steam Cloud support makes sense for this game, unfortunately it\u0027s not an active feature at the moment.
