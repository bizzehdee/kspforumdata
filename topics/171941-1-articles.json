(JAXA is apparently offering spots on the ISS for \u0027da people\u0027)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- [interpreted] space art is like, space on drugs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- we are probably going to screw up more life than colonize other planets (cause its hard to do and we are not very good at it).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is not a thing in as much as its a goal and the thing we try off planet is going to be really crude and at some point in the future they may be an environmental movement that tries to reform it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- not alot of women and minorities are in space. (What is a minority now-a-days?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- gravity (or lack there of) is not a confining principle, we can live 3 to 5 years without it, but hell to pay when we get back to Earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- solution to radiation and other problems may be bio-engineering of astronauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets see, the cause of slow space is the fact that public space tried to convince us it was really hard, therefore only they could do it (which is true, it fed technology into the private sector), but now the private sector is pooring technology into space science, which means that the public sector control of space is fading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe future of space belongs to those willing to study it and automate. There are unlimited amount of resources in space, just human physiology makes us very poor at utilizing it. Thus studying means finding ways to localize the materials we want and studying means find better automated ways of extracting what we want and placing it where we want it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
