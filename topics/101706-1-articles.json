I would like to suggest the following enhancements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- disableInFlight: if true, the animation cannot be toggled in the flight scene, otherwise defaults to false. Useful for components designed to be only configured before launch within the VAB/SPH scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- disableInEVA: if true, the animation cannot be toggled by a Kerbal on EVA, otherwise defaults to false. Useful for components design to be only operated when the vessel itself is being actively controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Submitted as Feature #3410 on the SQUAD KSP bugtracker)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
