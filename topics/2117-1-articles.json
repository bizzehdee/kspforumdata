Honestly, the reason those sorts of towers are associated with nuclear power in people\u0027s minds is all the images of the ones at Three Mile Island that were flashed all over the news in 1979, because they were more exciting than pictures of the actual reactor buildings, which look like... well, like big ugly industrial buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see what the reactor building at a nuke plant looks like, try looking up images of Fukushima Daiichi *before* the earthquake; that\u0027s pretty typical of the design of a reactor building for a boiling-water reactor (which is the most common type of power plant reactor out there).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CarolRawley","CreatedById":4627,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-06T07:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry about it being a cooling tower, but it is from a nuclear power plant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellome118","CreatedById":8124,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-06T11:06:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecan someone put this on youtube?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t veiw it on my mobile... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CarolRawley","CreatedById":4627,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-06T22:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits on liveleak, youtube, and i\u0027ll attach a downloaded copy to the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-06T22:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJesus, how the hell do they do that?
