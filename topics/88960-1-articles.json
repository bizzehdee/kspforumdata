In short, it\u0027s the ability to build factory equipment composed of very small machines that are able to perform automated tasks that manufacture components accurate to the individual atom.

The technology is limited in that a single assembly line is optimized to produce only a single output product. The assembly lines converge onto higher level lines that can combine the parts into subcomponents for machines, and eventually, after enough convergence steps, you get products that can be used. The actual robotic machinery on a given assembly line can be made using this same method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, in the real world, a true nanofactory might be about the size of a shipping container, perhaps a bit larger. The machine would contain 3 main parts : a machine that digests input materials into individual elements (probably using plasma and separation methods similar to how a mass spectrometer works), a feedstock plant that would chemically produce the actual feedstock the APM (nanofactory) can actually accept (it cannot accept individual elements, they have to be bound to other atoms to produce a molecule that is energetically favorable to give up a member of itself to form a covalent bond to a surface), and the factory itself. Physically, the factory itself is probably the smallest part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output of this factory would probably be 2 main things : sub-components that can be used to make more factories, and something that can be easily made into a large variety of machines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne generic product you\u0027d probably build nanofactories to make is a cube-shaped robot, probably about the size of a eukaryotic cell. This cube would have wheels on all faces and little power and data feelers that scrape over other cube robots. Internally, it would have a small battery, small computer of some type, and the motors to drive the wheels. A given cube-bot upon being manufactured would be told a destination coordinate to place itself. It would drive over previously installed cube bots, receiving power from them and sharing data. Eventually it would navigate to where it needs to be (the other cubebots would tell it their coordinates so it knows which way to drive) and set off some kind of chemical reaction to weld itself permanently into place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be other variants on these cube bots, enough to handle the subcomponents needed in any given machine. For instance, some cube bots would have a drive gear and a large motor to drive it on one face of the cube. Others would have a linear gear on one face - the linear gear cubes get installed in a line to make a track, while the motor cubes get installed in a place to drive themselves on that track. This lets a larger machine actually move. Some cubes would have a sensor on one face (like a single photon detector), and would install themselves in big flat arrays on the outside of robots. And so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing it this way, you could make an almost infinite variety of robots out of just a few dozen basic cubes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlan to Terraform Venus : \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now you have a factory, that fits into a shipping container. It can make sub modules that can self assemble themselves into other factories. It can also make a constant stream of small cubes that can self assemble themselves into robots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou load this factory onto a giant rocket. You also load in a few dozen tons of feedstock - especially for elements that might be rare on the crust of venus - and don\u0027t forget a nuclear reactor and some seriously heavy duty refrigeration equipment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket travels to Venus. Reentry vehicle soft lands it on the surface with the help of parachutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFactory goes to work. It makes robots that can prospect and shovel element rich crust into the factory\u0027s intake hopper. Factory makes the subcomponents for more of itself and more robots. About a month later, you have 2 factories and assorted robots to help them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fast forward. Let\u0027s say the factory is 5 meters x 5 meters. Then to completely cover venus in factories, we need to wait until we have 1.84 x 10^13 times as many factories as we started with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds impossible. That\u0027s about 10 trillion times as many! But the awesome power of exponential growth means we only need to wait for 44 growth cycles. Living cells can copy themselves in 1 hour, I\u0027m assuming factories are much much slower and take 720 times as long, or 1 month. That means we need to wait about 4 years. Ironically, the actual transit to Venus takes up a big chunk of the time needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ok, 4 years later the surface of Venus is covered in factories. Actually, it\u0027s probably covered in towers made of factories or bigger scale factories, and then there are towering mountains of waste everywhere. The surface is now a continuous warren of tunnels dug to find more ore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s just chemistry. All factories are ordered to build equipment able to process the atmosphere of Venus into other things. Since we have trillions of factories, the equipment is built very quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is 96% CO2. That can\u0027t stand. So we rip those carbons loose and convert all the CO2 into diamond. What do we do with the 92 atmospheres worth of oxygen, now? We need to bond it or trap it. Either we pump it all into diamond tanks and store it compressed, or we bond it to something else. If we could find enough hydrogen, we could convert it all into oceans of water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, one other nasty issue : realistic factories aren\u0027t going to operate very well at 740 kelvin. Too much of a gradient to overcome all the time to do anything. So a smart move would be to roll back a step and in step 1, conquer another planet with this same technology and use it to build \u003Cem\u003Emuch \u003C/em\u003Ebigger spacecraft. One obvious way would to conquer the Moon and launch the finished products using superconducting quench guns. In orbit, assemble the mega-spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mega-spacecraft would carry a gigantic set of mirrors. You\u0027d deploy them over Venus to reflect 99% or so of sunlight and IR from reaching the planet. This would allow Venus to cool to a more reasonable temperature. You might have to wait decades for it to cool, unfortunately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo once Venus has been cooled and all that nasty atmosphere packed away, it\u0027s almost habitable. Just gotta plant a whole ecosystem and you\u0027re ready to move in!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Everten P.","CreatedById":103089,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T21:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if we just had to deal with the carbon dioxide?
