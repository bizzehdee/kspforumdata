Sorry if I posted this in the wrong section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, on it I am playing KSP version 0.24.1, where Kerbin\u0027s landscape was completely reworked. Basically, there were cities everywhere. On the dream, I was driving a spaceplane that seemed to look like a BirdDog from Brotoro\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27552-Long-term-Laythe-Mission-%28pic-heavy%29-_-With-Part-20-_\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELong-term Laythe Mission\u003C/a\u003E across Kerbin\u0027s cities, containing Bill and Jebediah(even though the pod can only host one Kerbal). However, when I pressed M, I noticed that Kerbin, alongside M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus were now orbiting a large purple Gas Giant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s odd is that, in the Map screen, Kerbin was dangerously close to the Gas Giant\u0027s surface(in fact, it almost looked like a spacecraft could aerobrake in it at that height), yet in-game the unnamed Gas Giant looks even slightly further than how \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/8/83/Screenshot115.png/800px-Screenshot115.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJool is seen from Pol\u003C/a\u003E. Something odder is that the Gas Giant orbited the Sun faster than Kerbin did, which meant that it would overtake Kerbin, and after some time catch up with Kerbin again, possibly \u0027devouring\u0027 the planet in the process. Another incoherent thing is that, on the Map screen, it has no rings, where while I am controlling the BirdDog, white rings can be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, the dream got slightly less \u0027gamey\u0027 and slightly more livid, as I was seemingly in Jeb\u0027s point of view instead of just controlling the BirdDog. Me and Bill then flew the BirdDog towards Kerbal Space Center and went into a lab-like building(where it was suddently nighttime), where Wernher von Kerman was awaiting. Us three then began developing a large laser seemingly capable of destroying the Gas Giant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECut to several Kerbin days after, the Gas Giant had re-rendezvoused with Kerbin and was going to collide with it. Several Kerbals were panicking in the several cities from 0.24, while me and the rest of the KSC team were in the Kerbal Space Center(that now was oddly sitting on top of a mountain overlooking the cities instead of being in the flat that it used to be on). Wernher fired the laser pointing at the Gas Giant. We all watched in awe as the large orange beam made it\u0027s way towards the massive purple ball of gas looming above Kerbin, and as soon as it hit, the planet vanished in a puff of smoke. All Kerbals began to celebrate the fact that Kerbin gets to live once more, and the dream seemingly ended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit, it considerably made more sense than my previous dream, which only included Minmus breaking apart revealing a massive battleship that proceeded to destroy Kerbin. The concept of a Gas Giant destroying Kerbin is silly, but also a bit interesting.
