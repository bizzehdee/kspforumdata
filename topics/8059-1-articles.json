The other day my friend on an IRC channel told me about KSP, and I went and looked it up. The game looked -amazing-, so I downloaded the demo (.13). I instantly fell in love, and I pretty much played for like 7 hours straight. I finally got into a rather mediocre, crooked, and elliptical orbit after about 4 hours of gameplay. I eventually developed much more refined ship designs, and now I\\\u0027m up to using no solid fuel boosters, as they -do- make it a bit unwieldy. I bought the full version (currently .14) about 2 hours ago, and immediately began to enjoy all the added features. I currently have a pod in orbit, and I one day plan to orbit the sun with a satellite (from a mod?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little bit about myself, hm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\\\u0027m from Portland, Oregon in the USA.
