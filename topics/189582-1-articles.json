We\u0027ve established surface bases and space stations all over every planet and moon. Now, the time has come to launch our first interstellar colony ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there are a few problems in our way. We know that Kerbals can live and work just fine near Kerbol. However, how would they react to the endless void between the stars? The R\u0026amp;D team would like to find out, and naturally, that\u0027s where you come in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenge is to build a space station in orbit of Kerbol at a minimum altitude of 1 billion kilometers. You\u0027ll also need to develop a shuttle capable of ferrying researchers to and from the station. The station itself will need, at minimum, living space for four, a research lab, and a viewing cupola.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScoring will be as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n100 points for establishing a station with a Kerbolar periapse of at least 1,000,000,000,000 m.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B10 points for each lab on the station\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B5 points for each kerbal the station can support (or kerbal-year of time if playing with life support)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B5 points for each viewing cupola\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n100 points for creating a shuttle that can ferry kerbals and supplies to the station\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B10 points for each passenger seat\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B5 points for each ton of payload\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B100 points for a 20 year travel time or less from Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B100 points for a 10 year travel time or less from Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B100 points for a 5 year travel time or less from Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nx1.5 points for playing with Snacks!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nx2 points for playing with Kerbal Health\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nx3 points for playing with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nx4 points for playing with TAC LS\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nx5 points for playing with Kerbalism\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNB, I haven\u0027t actually tried this myself yet, so I don\u0027t know if the point system is very fair or not.
