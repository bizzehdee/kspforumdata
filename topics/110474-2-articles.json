The middle set of 4 girders was offset 45* from the ends, and I was using 2 sets of 8 struts in an X pattern to transfer the load between the ends and the middle.

In total frustration and because I was already hitting part count limits, I ripped out all the struts. I then put the 3 sets of 4 modular girders all aligned at the same angle on the rocket, and simply connected between the ends and the middle with 2 sets of 4 straight struts. The 8 struts now being aligned with the airflow totally got rid of the wobbles! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR I think the drag on the X version of struts was creating significant cross forces that greatly enhanced the SAS wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T20:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome quick testing indicates that nuFAR fixes this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T20:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think struts should behave this way.
