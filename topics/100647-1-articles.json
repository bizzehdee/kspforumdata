(I really don\u0027t go for intelli-guess programming)\n\nI\u0027ve also managed to compile both MechJeb and KSP using a Makefile in Linux\n\nany guidance/help would be most welcome\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts about how useful or not this mod might be or suggestions for it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T23:09:25Z","Content":"Have you looked at MKS pack by Roverdude (forgot the exact name) or Bobcat industries?
