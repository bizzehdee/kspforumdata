From this time I recall that I built a spaceplane using the C7 airplane parts mod and sent it straight into a collision course towards the mun. I recall that I have heard the sound of my vessel whizzing through air at high speeds (the old atmosphere flight sound from 0.12, those who are veterans like me will understand what I mean) just before impact. I also recall this sound from my early mun landings, and I also recall that KW rocketry or another mod at that time used to have a parachute designed for mun landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it true that the Mun had an atmosphere until 0.13 or 0.14?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T00:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t say; but in case no one else knows more here are some potentially relevant notes from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Version_history\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Version_history\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.10: Fixed a problem with the atmosphere, where it would fade in and out at specific points in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.18: Functional Air Intakes: Turbines now properly require air to run, and Intakes can provide it for them, as long as there is an atmosphere around you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind that the first note might refer to a purely visual bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quote the second one since it might be that the flight sfx played while atmospheric engines were running even if there was no atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-10T00:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2016 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T00:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re imagining things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDave","CreatedById":64401,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T02:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think Mun ever did, but IIRC, Moho did have an atmosphere early on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T04:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou must be thinking of Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentThacker","CreatedById":167430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T11:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun never had an atmosphere in any version, as far as I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T11:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun has never had an atmosphere as far as I can recall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
