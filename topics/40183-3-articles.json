The current Liquid Rocket engines are too cheap and it makes solid fuel rockets pointless again. In a previous version there was a much larger gap between solid fuel rockets and liquid fuel rockets and it made sense to me. Also I have noticed the Launch stability Enhancers are more expensive in this version and on my current small rocket account for 25% of its cost where as before it was minimal. According to the price list they cost more than my science parts and engine combined. That doesnt make sense to me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the mechjeb pricing I think a 25k-50k price would be fine. I dont use the autopilot because it has messed up from time to time but I love the customizable readouts, smart A.S.S, and the maneuver planner. I can easliy just do those things manually on cheaper simpler missions, but the more complex ones I like the have those as the in game maneuver node system in a pain. I dont mind paying for that on the more complex missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso can the windows save their position between game loads.

You have to consider both cost for liquid.. Liquid fuel. (which is always been cheap) and oxidizer together... Oxidizer is easy one of the most expensive fuels you will pay for way more expesnive then just solid fuel rockets.. At least by half... I will check it out some more though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch clamps.. Hmm never noticed this before... I will look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I should rephrase that when it comes to liquid fuel cost vs solid you have to consider 3 prices.. The price of Solid Fuel. The Price of Oxidizer and the price of liquid engines.. Or on the editor it shows up as Engines and cooling. You need all three of these to run liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut with solid fuel.. All the fuels and engine are part of 1 part... And the cost does end up being about 1/2 that of the three above.. And I think some might argue its too cheap... Maybe not? Whats everyones thoughts on that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit. Ok I tested the launch clamp stabalizers and they cost about 1400 each. Not sure where you got the prices you thought they were?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo test this just throw a probebody into editor and then add the stabilizers.

So far resources wise IonCross Works and calculates for you Oxygen cost, Modular Fuel Tank work with cost for the new fuels.. Pretty much all of them work in mission controller.. Believe it or not Mission Controller hardly interacts with KSP.. Only for Values and Info.. And sometimes to save the game.. Other then that Mission Controller is its own program running along side KSP. So not many mods I know of will mess with its functions.. They might make the missions harder for you though.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
