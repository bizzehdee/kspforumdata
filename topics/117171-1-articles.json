The resulting maneuver is actually a more efficient way to gain kinetic energy than applying the same impulse outside of a gravitational well. The gain in efficiency is explained by the \u003Cstrong\u003EOberth effect\u003C/strong\u003E, a phenomenon that allows employing kinetic energy to generate greater mechanical energy. In practical terms, this means that the most efficient time for a spacecraft to burn its engine is at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eorbital periapse\u003C/a\u003E, when its orbital velocity (and so, its kinetic energy) is greatest.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this also apply to a braking burn, when I want to lower my apoapsis, or is then the Oberth effect actually inverse, i.e. I expend more energy at this periapsis in order to loose kinetic energy?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T14:30:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T14:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Oberth Effect benefits burns in both the prograde and retrograde directions.
