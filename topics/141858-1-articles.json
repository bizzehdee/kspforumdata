Rovers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever to my knowledge there isn\u0027t a way to \u003Cem\u003Estore/keep\u003C/em\u003E experiments out of\u00A0a science\u00A0module to something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003Eas in manned science missions you would empty experiments that don\u0027t yield 100% transmission and store them in your capsule for bringing back to Kerbin later.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my dilemma is my unmanned rover will not be able to cover many biomes as a lot of the experiment will not yield 100% transmission and i\u0027l have to \u0027Keep\u0027 it in the science module thus effectively\u00A0disabling that experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know of a solution to this? a mod or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T01:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTarsierSpaceTelescope comes with a science storage part ( well, two different sized ones ) - I haven\u0027t tried using them on uncrewed rovers though.
