On launch, I hit that action, throttle up to max, and go nearly straight up, about 85 degrees. Eventually, once we\u0027re above 15km or so, I have to reopen the extra intakes and I start to pitch over to about 60 degrees. Later, I start to lose thrust for lack of airflow. Keep following the prograde marker to keep airflow as high as possible. You should be able to reach well over 30km by now, with about 400-500 m/s horizontal speed. The second before you start to lose altitude, fire up the rockets! Close all intakes and turn off the jet once you hit 700 m/s or so, which won\u0027t be but a few seconds.\n\nThe rescuers reach orbit, with a few hundred m/s deltaV to do the rendez-vous. The deep space probes add too much mass; I get up to about 80km but periapsis is still below the surface, so I end up landing clear on the other side of Kerbin. I show there the Munshot 2, which got that payload to sub-orbit (I had a contract to test the 24-77); unfortunately, that probe ran out of fuel on the descent to Mun. The Munshot 3 (not pictured) lightened up the probe and benefited from a contract to test the LV-1R, so it can get much further.\n\nWith the science from the Munshot 3 I got access to turbojets, so this line is about to get modified drastically.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
