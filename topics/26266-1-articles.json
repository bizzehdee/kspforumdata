However, my question is on the logic of this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I have learned and what I have been able to find, when discussing \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E particular thing, all observations are stated in present tense. The objects in the distance \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E moving away from us. Logically, this makes sense on the surface. We\u0027ve observed it, and as such it makes sense to say it is happening now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that is not the case. Due to the fact that light only travels so fast, we cannot see the present-day state of the whole universe. The farther out we look, the more ancient the images of stars we see. The light from recent events has not had time to reach us, so we see light from many thousands and sometimes millions of years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is thus: does it make logical sense to say that the universe is expanding at all? If the evidence for expansion of the universe comes (effectively) from looking at images of the past -- that is what one is doing when stargazing upon distant objects -- does it make any sense whatsoever to claim that the universe is \u003Cem\u003Ecurrently\u003C/em\u003E expanding. As far as I can see (mind, I\u0027m no astrophysicist or anything of the sort), the only conclusions we can possibly make about the expansion of the universe are about what happened \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E. We cannot see what is happening \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since the further out you look, the further back into the past you look, it only makes sense that the stars from further away are travelling away faster than those closer, \u003Cem\u003Esimply because the light we see from them is showing us an older state of the object in question\u003C/em\u003E, meaning that the further out you look, the closer you get to the time of the Big Bang. The closer you are to the time of the Big Bang, the faster the objects would appear to be moving, still being flung outwards by the energy of the Big Bang. If as you look closer to the present (i.e., at objects closer to us) the expansion seems to slow, is it not then logical to think that the expansion is not in fact \u003Cem\u003Espeeding up\u003C/em\u003E, as a great deal of scientists claim, but in fact \u003Cem\u003Eslowing down\u003C/em\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, yes I expect them to take account for the time difference, but nowhere have I ever seen evidence that they take into account the fact that the distant and faster-moving objects are being seen from further in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to use any amount of math necessary (if any) to explain why my logic is flawed (if indeed it is) or what bit of information I\u0027m missing that would make sense of this apparent oversight of the astronomers. I\u0027ve been looking for an answer for this for a while, and I haven\u0027t found one yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T15:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted that there are, as of yet, no direct observations of change in the rate of recession for specific objects in the distant Universe - we simply haven\u0027t been observing long enough with the type of precision needed to make those types of direct observations (although I\u0027ve heard a couple of people in the field tell me that we\u0027re getting close to the ability to do this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather, our inference that the Universe is accelerating is by looking at luminosity versus redshift of various standard candles - something known as the distance ladder - in order to get an idea of how far each object in the Universe is away from us (and therefore how old the light coming from that object is) and how fast that object is receding from us. Once we have that information for enough points over the specific range of distances we\u0027re interested in, we can curve fit to get an idea of how fast the Universe was expanding at each epoch. This is entirely the basis for the claim that the Universe is accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick arXiv search turned up \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0866.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E short review article by Robert Caldwell.
