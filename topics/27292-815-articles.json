The reason was, that I underestimated the the altitude of Duna\u0027s ice caps, so aerodynamic drag was not sufficient to slow down my lander far enough to deploy the chutes safely, and when I realized this, it was already too late...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter a quick load, I decided to retry, and this time I used the engines to slow down more. Worked perfectly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the full story: I have had a station in Duna equatorial orbit for some time now, and from that station I had visited all the non-glitch biomes at the equator. Then a friend had an awesome idea on how to reach the polar ice caps from there, although the lander itself doesn\u0027t have enough fuel for that: Just bring along the fuel depot of the station. And that\u0027s what I did. Decoupled both parts, docked them together, used the engine of the fuel depot (which is more efficient) to change inclination - not to a fully polar orbit, but to one that can reach the ice caps - land, dock to the fuel depot again, and return to the station. The original plan didn\u0027t include the return of the fuel depot, but given that it has a lot of solar panels, and the station has an active science lab, I changed my mind and also brought that back. Now it\u0027s nearly empty, and the lander won\u0027t go anywhere as well. But hey, I\u0027ve been to all regular biomes, and if I decide to bring new experiments to Duna, I can take along some fuel as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/OxAoN/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T13:19:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 01:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForum update\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T08:50:59Z","Content":"\nToday, after a prolonged absence from KSP, I decided to try out some ideas, and experiment with the new parts in the process. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wanted to make a new kind of reentry and landing system for single kerbonauts.
