One of my kids LOVES space, so he gets a kick out of the couple of times I\u0027ve played it. It will be a great teaching tool, in fact watching the spacex dragon launch today I actually knew a little bit of what was going on because of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m currently building a custom controller to make it easier for my youngest to play Minecraft. This was essentially practice for my long term goal of building a Kerbal controller (yes, I\u0027ve been wanting this game for a while). I just ordered all [hopefully most] of the parts I need. I\u0027m not worried about the soldering or the programming, what I really want to know from experienced KSP players is what buttons/controls/readouts would be good to have on a controller?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the controller posted here titled \u0022\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMy KSP Controller (SpaceX inspired)\u0022 [I don\u0027t know if I can post links yet, first post and all...]. I\u0027ll probably use the same buttons he does. but I want this to be the only thing you need to play, ideally. From the 3-4 flights I\u0027ve made I\u0027ll probably add warp up/down, quicksave and orbit view (whatever that\u0027s called) toggle. I don\u0027t know what the action buttons on his controller do, but I assume it\u0027s advanced stuff that I haven\u0027t seen yet (which is really why I\u0027m asking this). I don\u0027t know what parts/controls/modes... there are in this game yet, so it makes it really hard to plan a controller out when I don\u0027t know how many buttons I will need. So if there are any necessary/convenient things to have on a controller, please let me know. Preferably with a noob friendly description of what it does given I have 3-4 technologies unlocked and haven\u0027t been able to make it to orbit yet.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eworry, I\u0027ll post all the plans/code/later cut files/BOM... here and probably on instructables too. I have some cool ideas for some UI tweaks that I will happily share with the community (open source FTW!). Thanks in advance for your input, and I look forward to spending more time in the world of Kerbals (as free time allows).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-31T04:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not tried to make a controller, but until someone who has comes by, hello and welcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-31T04:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204979-generic0000/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204979\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204979-generic0000/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@generic0000\u003C/a\u003E, luckily we have an excellent thread full of helpful and knowledgeable engineers\u00A0of custom controllers.
