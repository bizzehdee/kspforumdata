Home to the sunrise of a season, as well as the sunset. The previous race here was an event of firsts\u2026 And lasts. The final race of 2036 was the last of a legend- Phil Kerman. However, this loss was not in vain. New safety innovations have been put into place, and that\u2019s not all. Sweeping regulation changes have made these cars the fastest\u2026 Ever. Lower wings, lower cars, faster engines- all combining to produce the greatest race car in the history of the sport.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201C2037 will also hope to answer the questions of the past. Following 5 years of OTech domination, the River City-based squad has brought on two young superstars ready to set the world of racing alight. Jebediah Kerman, after a massive crash last season, was questionable to race \u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003Eagain\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E. But after his recovery, the young champion has returned for his first race back. Also added onto the squad is Max Kerman, now in his sophomore season. The young driver is looking to add onto his 3-win season last year, and maybe contend for the championship. The circuits, cars, and drivers have gotten faster and safer. Now the only question is: Who will win it all? The 2037 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Opener is coming.

The team was working on messing with some suspension and brake settings as tires laid off to the side. The team had been working hard since Bradley, when we\u2019d set the fastest times of the test. Day 2 had been messed up with rain, but at least we got some good running in with the wet tires.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max was proving to be (so far) a good teammate. He\u2019d already found a house about 3 blocks away from mine and had learned his way around the city. In the team meetings, he did his best to stay quiet- except of course when I was in the room with him. Then, we worked together (inadvertently) to see how many headaches we could make in the hour-long meetings. So far, our record was at 3 while Andy and Claire discussed what they\u2019d done to the car in between the tests and the race. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Kim, on the other hand, had been insufferable. She could not stop talking about the game. I mean yeah, it was a good game, but her favorite thing to do was angle her ring so that it flashed into your eyes. It got so bad that I ended up getting my own ring (From the 2035 championship) and flashing light into her face.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I strapped the helmet on before stepping into the seat. The team got everything plugged in and put everything together as they finished up the last-second corrections, and I could feel the adrenaline ramping up. As soon as I was all buckled in, I put my gloves on and took the wheel from a mechanic. I went to P-0 and watched as the team fired the engine- its roar filling the concrete garage. The team dropped the car down onto the ground and I drove out of the stall.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Once out on the track, I flew around the first turn at max speed- feeling the outside wheels stand strong against the load. The car broke nicely for Turn 2, and I bounced over the high curbing. I ran all the way up to the exit curb before diving into Turn 3. \u201CCar\u2019s gripping beautifully,\u201D I said into the radio before slamming the brakes into Turn 4. \u201CCan\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the tires or what but it\u2019s so dang fast.\u201D The turn-in was sharp and precise- just like I remembered from Bradley. The car threw up sparks as I went through Turn 6- the left side losing a bit of grip but hanging on. Fans cheered and I dove into the braking zone of the tightening apex of Turns 7 and 8. The rears lost a bit of grip as they spun, but I kept it under control and blasted out of the corner hard and smooth. As I accelerated, I noticed that the shark fin was shaking in the turbulence. Andy had assured me this was all normal but it looked really weird.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I went through \u003Ci\u003ETempesta\u003C/i\u003E and felt the suspension handle the shifts perfectly. As I went down the straight, I noticed a spaghetti trail of black rubber lines along the face of the track where Phil had spun. \u003Ci\u003EDon\u2019t get distracted,\u003C/i\u003E I told myself sternly as I blasted down the straight. \u003Ci\u003EYou\u2019ve got a job to do. Now do it.\u003C/i\u003E The car flew through \u003Ci\u003EVelocidad\u003C/i\u003E and I held it full-throttle, only losing about 5 miles an hour with the turn. This car truly defied physics with each turn. I was in the fastest section of the track now, and I could feel that the car was in its element. The engine was yelling and howling as I flew down past the hangar before turning into Turn 15. I went wide on the apex and felt the rears start to try to get away from me before I hit the curbing for Turn 16. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGo to the grid,\u201D Andy told me as I went through 17. I obliged, and instead of hitting the pits in Turn 21, I kept on-track and drove to the pole spot. As I started getting unbuckled, Max pulled up in the second spot right behind me. I got out of the car and put my helmet in the seat and watched as the crew went to work- unscrewing wheel bolts, connecting wires to computers, and checking various sensors, dials, and settings to make sure everything was perfect. Max slid over to me and muttered, \u201CI\u2019ll give you 5 bucks if you tell me that setup you\u2019re running,\u201D Which made me laugh and put my hands up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAsk Andy,\u201D I said in reply, putting my hat on as the sun began to kiss the peaks of the mountains to the west. Max turned and looked Andy before turning to look at me. Me, Andy. Me, Andy. Finally, he cupped his hands around his mouth.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COi, Andy!\u201D He shouted, making Andy turn- a bit startled. \u201C5 bucks if you tell me your setup!\u201D Andy threw his hand forward in annoyance and turned back to the computer as data started flowing in. \u201CGuess that\u2019s a no,\u201D Max sighed as he walked alongside me as I tried not to laugh. We had both stormed the field in qualifying- locking out the front row by about 2 seconds. I, however, had bolted away from the rest of the field and gotten a 1.79-second gap out to Max, and a stunning 20 seconds away from last place. I had really dialed the car in on the short, fast runs, especially on newer tires. The car was able to handle the longer runs just as well, and so far the year was looking like OTech would remain on top for the season. I watched as everyone else went to their grid slots and waited. With only about 5 minutes until the scheduled start of the race, we went to the flagpole for the anthem. I hummed along and clapped as it finished with a triumphant tone- putting my hat back on and walking back to the car. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I gave Max a handshake along the way and went to the car- splitting the sea of reporters like a knife through butter (I\u2019m so poetic today, aren\u2019t I?). Flashes and shutter clicks followed me to the grid stall, where the crew was waiting for me. I grabbed my helmet and put it on- sealing out the noise. Alexis came up and gave me a big hug, and I had to tilt my head around awkwardly to not bonk her in the head with my helmet. I opened up my visor and heard a \u201CGood luck\u201D over the sound of the crowd before we separated a second later. Through the visor I could hear a flurry of reporters calling my name- which I ignored. \u003Ci\u003EHonestly, if I wanted to talk to you the race would never start,\u003C/i\u003E I thought a bit aggravated- standing up in the seat before plopping down. The team put the tires back on and started unplugging various tubes. The tire blankets were put over the rubber and I got myself buckled in as five lights came on above, signifying that we had only about 5 minutes until the formation lap would begin.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The engine was humming quietly as I put the wheel onto the mount and watched as the computer system booted up. Quicker than I realized, the lights had gone down to only one. The team set me down onto the ground and I held the clutch in- building the revs as the light went out. The car launched out of the spot and I felt myself get flung back from the G\u2019s. I stayed in line for the run down to Turn 1 (Pole gets outside for the first turn while second gets the inside). I turned down into the corner and saw Max\u2019s blue and white nose catching up on me before dropping back mid-corner as I tested the gas.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CReally good launch,\u201D I reported as I went into Turn 2. \u201CRears have a ton of grip out of the apex.\u201D I weaved around before going into Turn 3- gently brushing the exit curb as I got out. The bumps shook the cockpit for a second but I kept it under control as I pulled back down. The car flowed effortlessly over the curbing and apexes as I went through the lap- never losing traction through the lap. On the backstraight, I saw a bright blue #14 flag waving in the large stands next to the track. The fans were cheering as I passed, and as I looked back in my mirror I had a flashback to back in Owlia, 2035. I shook my head and hit the gas- shooting away down the straight. I blasted into \u003Ci\u003EVelocidad\u003C/i\u003E and felt the cars suspension bunch up underneath me as I took the corner flat-out. The track widened up on the exit of Turn 14 and I went as wide as I could- running up only a few inches from the wall as I held in the throttle. I went into Turn 15 and saw the sky beginning to glow with an orange tint as the sun had set behind the mountain peaks. Sparks flew up as the car bottomed out over the Turn 16 curbing and I blasted down the short straight before braking hard for 17. Fans cheered as I went past- the engine yelling over the chants and noise. I broke hard for Turn 18 and felt the front wheels teeter on the edge of grip before I turned in- brushing over the apex curbing softly and flying out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CEngine Mode 5. Good luck out there,\u201D Andy said as I pulled up to the grid that was one of the tightest in K1. I watched as the rest of the grid form up behind me. The engine seemed to wait anxiously in the spot, and I felt my heartbeat speed up a bit as the last couple cars got into their spots. I did a final check on all the systems before seeing a green flag waved behind in the mirrors. \u003Ci\u003EThis is it.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0One light came on the pylon and I went to the Launch mode. The engine started humming in a slightly higher tone and I felt the energy building up and down the grid.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Two lights. I pushed the clutch in and watched everyone behind.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Three. I pressed in on the gas and the engine started raising from a hum, to a rumble, to a yell. A roar. A scream.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Four. The car shook as the engine revved up. The crowd was getting louder, but I could hardly hear it as the noise of 20 engines.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Five. I exhaled and stared at the light as they stayed on- glowing bright as the sun painted the sky orange.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The lights went out and I released the clutch- feeling the car shoot forwards as it was freed. I couldn\u2019t feel a hint of wheelspin as the car got going, and I shifted up lightning fast as the engine hit the speed. I dove into Turn 1 and looked back as Max thought about a move before backing out. The move meant that he was quickly swarmed by third placed Micheal. Max kept the inside for the corner and defended nicely- just squeezing up to the outside and leaving Micheal no room to pass. Dirt flew up into the air as someone brushed the grass on the exit of the turn, but I had already turned into Turn 2.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I blasted down the short straight as the car lurched over bumps before I broke for the corner. Max was right behind me and I saw sparks fly up behind him as the car hit a particularly nasty bump that caught out many drivers. The car understeered out of the apex and the left sides buzzed over curbing before I quickly cut down back onto the track. Max darted down to the inside but I swiped across as we all turned into the tunnel. The lights turned to faded darkness as we blasted under the concrete top- sound echoing off the walls. I held my line and flew out of Turn 5 with Max in hot pursuit. I saw the sky glowing brightly orange, as if it were on fire before the buildings flew across it. The car accelerated up as it screamed through Turn 6, and I felt G-forces tug me against my belts. A quick fact about the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; the track is flat- almost as flat as a pancake besides a couple bumps. This meant that cars relied on mechanical and aero grip instead of banking, dips, or rises.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max locked up into Turn 7 and almost hit me, but I had turned down and he held right around my outside as the brakes unlocked. I jammed down hard on the EPB button as I pulled out of the Turn 8 hairpin, just narrowly getting clear of Max as I pulled up across his nose on exit. We flew down the canyon straight as spotlights flew past and the engine noises came at us from all angles. I took Turn 9 flat-out with Max just behind me, and the small crowd atop the roofs cheered as we passed. I broke in for the Turn 10 hairpin and felt the car almost dip off-course before coming back to me on corner exit. Max was right behind me and tried to get every advantage possible, but I made the car as wide as possible down the straight until \u003Ci\u003ETempesta\u003C/i\u003E. I took the curbing and flew out of the chicane. The car tilted as it went over the banked curbs- slamming me left and then right as the wheels caught air time before slamming back down. Max was right behind me as we blazed out of the corner, and he started gaining on me. The crowd yelled and roared as we passed them- our engines screaming above the noise as we pushed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max hadn\u2019t gotten up to me yet and I cut down into \u003Ci\u003EVelocidad\u003C/i\u003E. The car blasted over the Turn 13 curb and I almost lost it as the rears lifted up. I kept flat-out and felt the rears lose just a bit of traction before I turned back the other way for Turn 14. The body shifted its tilt as the cars inertia threw it to the outside. I kept turning the wheel in hard and Max was forced to stay behind as he fought a snap of oversteer on exit- almost hitting the wall with the right rear as dust flew up into the air. The small mistake allowed me to extend a slight gap. I used as much exit space as I possibly could and flew out of the turn before the grass attacked me on the outside. The car was in its element as it screamed through down the short straight in front of the hangar. The track widened up and I saw the red and black 2037 K1 banner out of the corner of my eye before it flashed out of view. Spotlights shined across my visor and sparks flew out of the rear as the car bottomed out. I hit the brakes for Turn 15 and the rears slipped as I flew over the curbing. I didn\u2019t react and felt the car slip through the turn. I didn\u2019t let the car get too out of control, though, and heard a crackle when the right-sides threw up brown dirt as I went just a bit past the Turn 16 curbing. Max had gotten in my dirty air and was forced to slow down heavily or else he\u2019d miss the corner. Now, I didn\u2019t have a threat before heading down the 17 Straight. There was a stand there that used to be home to all of Phil\u2019s most loyal fans. As I went down the straight, multiple shades of blue and white blurred out of the corner of my eye. I slammed the brakes for Turn 17 and hit the curb hard- feeling the rears now hold all the grip I needed through the high-speed corner. I flew out of the corner and down into Turn 18- watching Max lock up behind me with a puff of white smoke as he turned into the wide entry a second after me. The car trailed along the curbing before evening out for a split-second.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I went into the 19-20 chicane with a purpose and came out of it without even a hint of problems. I broke for Turn 21 and came out of the loop full-throttle. The car oversteered up to the deceptively close exit curb, but I pulled down and crossed the line to complete the first lap. The sound of engines echoed off the walls as the rest of the field came to end the lap, but I had already dived down into Turn 1 with as much speed as the car was going to give me. Max was right behind me and stayed right in my tracks- holding pace in the tight section that wasn\u2019t known for its overtakes. Even under the tunnel, he held right in line- watching and waiting for a slip-up or a slight mistake that would let him past. In Turn 8, \u003Ci\u003EI \u003C/i\u003Elocked up- throwing smoke into my visor but not giving room up the inside. The car understeered on the entry and I had to fight it all the way through the hairpin- just narrowly cutting Max off. On corner exit, Max got up to my inside and tried to hold it down the straight. He got next to me and with EPB we balanced out with his right-front just inches from my left-rear. The yell of engines echoed off the concrete buildings surrounding us, and as I dove into Turn 9 Max was forced to give way. Down into Turn 10, I had no threat from behind as Max had cut back into my line- racing right behind me as he broke just a bit earlier than me. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I was about to get free but yet again Max started to close up- losing a bit of ground on the exit of \u003Ci\u003ETempesta\u003C/i\u003E. The crowd roared as we passed and the engine yelled along with them as I shifted up through the gears. Max started dropping back and I blazed into \u003Ci\u003EVelocidad\u003C/i\u003E at full throttle- feeling the car bite through the collection of turns with ferocity. The car flew with the turns and the fronts kept the car on-line smoothy and fast as it flew over curbs. On Lap 5, I had made a good lead out to Max behind. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCar feels amazing,\u201D I told Andy as I passed the pit wall at the end of the lap. \u201CEverything\u2019s right. Aero and mechanical are working perfectly.\u201D The car flew through Turn 1 and I felt it just kiss the inside of the curbing before coming back down. The car was working perfectly- biting and screaming into corners and blasting down the straights. The new cars had done what they were promised- be faster and better than before. Our planned pit stop was on Lap 16, and by that point I had gotten an enormous 10-second lead out to Max. I crossed the line to start the lap and Andy called me in. The tires hadn\u2019t gone off badly, but now the fuel was reaching a critical point- about one lap left by a quick mental calculation before the display twisted with the wheel. Max had pulled in that lap, and I drove as hard as I could in some attempt to get out a gap. The rears slid through Turn 14 and I had to saw at the wheel to regain control- feeling my heart rate shoot up faster than\u2026 Well there\u2019s nothing fast enough to describe it to be honest. Let\u2019s just say really want fast and go from there.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I hit the pit limiter and the car slowed as I entered the pit lane. The tight road went to the left as I entered the area where all the pit stalls were. I went past the entrance to Lane 1 (The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was weird- you had two pit lanes right next to each other) and looked towards my stall where the crew were waiting. I mentally counted down as I turned in. \u003Ci\u003E5, 4, 3, 2, 1, brake.\u003C/i\u003E The wheels whined as they came to a halt and the team went to work. Tires came off lightning-fast and I waited as fuel was put in and the timer ticked down. Finally, the light turned green and I was dropped onto the ground- jamming the gas and peeling out of the pit stall with a scream from the tires and smoke from the rear. I went over the curbing in the pit turn (Still on the limiter might I add) and drove on until I hit the speed line. As soon as I crossed it, the limiter came off and I shifted up as the engine yelled with the building revs. I left the pit lane and turned through Turn 1 just as Max came up onto the front-stretch.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat stop was perfect,\u201D I told Andy happily as the car got through Turn 2. \u201CTell the guys I\u2019m buying dinner for them after the race.\u201D Andy chuckled and agreed. I flew through the tunnel and felt the new tires working wonders- turning the car through corners without a hint of a slide. \u201CMy gosh, car\u2019s on rails! Y\u2019all set it up perfectly, I\u2019m not going to lie.\u201D The car flew over curbs and held the traction perfectly. By Lap 25, I had set qualifying lap times and gotten a 20-second lead.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBring it home,\u201D Andy instructed as I set \u003Ci\u003Eanother\u003C/i\u003E fastest lap. I tried to slow down, I swear. I wasn\u2019t intending to set another fast lap. But as I crossed the line, I could hear Andy sigh. \u201CI thought I said don\u2019t push,\u201D He said, a bit annoyed. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI can\u2019t help it!\u201D I protested, attempting not to laugh myself off the track with only 4 laps to go. \u201CI swear I\u2019m not trying to go faster.\u201D I think I had a problem. See, I have really 2 speeds; All-out, and reverse. Oh well. I had gone max speed and thoroughly decimated the field. I came out of the final corner and I laughed as I stuck my first up in celebration.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHahahaha\u003Ci\u003EHA! \u003C/i\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EYES GUYS!!!\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u201D 100 meters away from the line and I saw the team celebrating on the wall. 75 away and I started weaving- cutting left right up next to the wall. At 50, I came back across to the right as the tires threw up a haze from rubber marbles off the line. 25. The flag started waving and I grinned underneath my helmet. I crossed the line and fireworks flew up into the air- bathing everything in a yellow glow. \u201C\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EYES! YES YES YES!\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u201D With every word, I punched at the air. \u201CWE DID IT!\u201D The crowd was as loud as a jet, and I felt like crying as I turned into the corner. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGod, you sound like you just won the whole championship,\u201D Max chuckled over the radio as he went through Turn 17. He crossed the line to more fireworks and a roar from the crowd. \u201CWe need a Mercy Rule,\u201D He sighed, making me laugh. I waited up for him on the Turn 3 exit and we drove along-side each other, waving to the crowd. I tore away through Turn 4 but waited up underneath the tunnel. Suddenly, I got an idea.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHey, get back, I don\u2019t want to hit you,\u201D I warned, making Max drop right back. As soon as I got clear, I raised both hands up into the air. My left hand pointed up to the sky, and my right held up four fingers. 14. Phil\u2019s number. I thought it was a fitting salute to the legend. The small assembled crowd applauded and whistled in acceptance. In my mirror, I saw Max was doing it too- two hands in the air, remembering Phil. I went through \u003Ci\u003ETempesta\u003C/i\u003E and drove down the straight- still holding my hands up in the air. The crowd gave their approval, and I raised my visor up. Cold air hit my face and light assaulted my eyes, but I didn\u2019t care. Finally, at the end of the straight (Where Phil\u2019s car had stopped), I pulled off to get to the podium. The car whined to a halt as I pulled onto the spot, and I listened to the crackling wave of claps from the crew. Micheal had already gotten to the podium and was stepping out- giving high fives to his team. I got unbuckled and took the wheel off before lifting myself up out of the cockpit. As soon as I stood up, I got onto the nose of the car and got down on one knee- pointing up to the sky. When I looked up, a single bright star seemed to stand out on the field of thousands- glinting and shimmering as I watched it. I grinned and got up- leaping off the car and running over to the team.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGreat job,\u201D Andy beamed as we got a quick hug over the barrier. I nodded and was going to reply something, but realized that my helmet was still on and would really mess with speaking. Alexis made her way through the crowd and gave me a hug.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat was awesome!\u201D She shouted to me, almost bouncing with excitement. I held on for a couple more seconds before breaking away. Max was listening to Claire and I went over to him- giving him a clap on the back and a handshake. We both went over to the lounge and I saw Micheal, drinking some water on the couch. I took my helmet off and put it on a small counter and grabbed my own water bottle.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHoly cow,\u201D I sighed, flopping down on the couch. Max walked in- holding his helmet and setting it down next to mine. He combed his fingers through his hair and some sweat flew off his head. The air was humid like you wouldn\u2019t believe, and I was amazed that I wasn\u2019t sweating more.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHow the heck are you so fast?\u201D He sat down next to me and I shrugged, before pointing my hands at him and waving my fingers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CMaaaagic,\u201D I said jokingly, making Micheal chuckle. We talked some more before it was time to go out to the podium. Micheal went out to cheers, and next was Max. He was met with slightly louder cheers and claps. Finally, I got out and was hit with a wave of noise. Cheers and shouts met me and I grinned as I stepped out onto the deck- jumping up into the air as I walked to the top step. I got up on the step and listened to the anthem playing- softly singing along before it ended with a triumphant lift. Next, the trophies were presented. I took the trophy and held it up above my head- getting a loud cheer from the assembled crowd. As the dignitaries and officials scattered, I grabbed the champagne bottle and started spraying the drink. I aimed some at Max (before getting a face-full as he sided his bottle at me) and drink sprayed over the podium. Micheal aimed his over the railing of the balcony area, and it scattered over the crew and cars. After about 30 seconds, the spray had turned to a tiny trickle of foam, and I set the bottle down as the interviewer came out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell, what a race!\u201D A voice said, and I turned to see who it was. Walking out to us, a big smile on his face, was Sebastian Kerman himself. The first 4-time series champion, Seb had captivated the world by winning each on back-to-back-to-back-to-back. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit awestruck to say the least. \u201CHow\u2019s everybody doing?\u201D There were cheers and whistles and he laughed. As soon as he reached me, I smiled.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSeb!\u201D I exclaimed, feeling almost like a little kid again. \u201CI can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s really you!\u201D Sebastian chuckled as we all sat down on the podium.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnd I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you,\u201D He replied with a massive grin. \u201CAll this time, I\u2019ve been waiting to talk with the driver who broke my record!

Amazing. First race back from the injury, it just felt good to know that I can still do this. The car was perfect- Andy got that car set up amazingly, and it just felt like it was on rails.\u201D Seb nodded, and I carried on. \u201CThis team, though.. They did it. Yeah, I drove the car, but without them I wouldn\u2019t have gotten anywhere close to here. We had a guardian angel tonight, too.

The Kafrica rounds were always dreadful, and we had three of them to start the season. As I woke up, I tried to figure out what had shaken me awake. Then, it happened again. Alexis mumbled something next to me and I raised the shutter to look out. The sound of the engine droned on as I peeked out the window. Raindrops streaked sideways across the plastic window, like the drops on the windows of a car on the highway. The wing was covered in a green flash of light for only a split second, and I saw buckets of rain falling down around the plane. Just as the light flashed off again, lightning illuminated everything in a bright white glow with a rumble. I shook my head and lowered the shade, leaning back in my chair.

The rain kept falling in sheets like bullets, and the wind howled as it whipped through the city streets. We had been waiting for about an hour for qualifying to get started, but the rain was so fierce that the series had red-flagged the session; not wanting to risk a crash.

The official rulebook said that if the session didn\u2019t start within 70 minutes from the scheduled start, then qualifying would be decided by practice times.

Off near the beach, white rolling waves washed up on the shores, and just beyond I could see the final retreating hints of the massive cell that was making news headlines around the world. According to the weather radars, the storm was steadily making its way southeast, towards the Kalbans. If the storm was what everyone predicted, it would end up scattering over the mountain ranges. Right now, the sky was turning orange and yellow, shifting from a sweet blue to a fire as small clouds hovered miles above. Cool coastal air whispered as it came through the city streets, and I felt a small bit of spray hit my face while I walked to the car.

A large cooling duct was pulled out of the main radiator and I felt its cold wind wash over me for a brief second before the team set me down. The cars engine roared to life and I watched behind as a tiny puff of steam came out of the main duct. For this race the team had outfitted the car with a T-wing modification, which would provide a bit more downforce at a Straight-line speed cost. Of course, considering that the track didn\u2019t have that many long straights, this shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The formation lap got underway and I practically leapt off of the grid slot.

Sounding good?\u201D I went through Turn 3 and hit the radio.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CPerfect. What\u2019s the weather looking like?\u201D The car seemed to float over the ground as I broke for Turn 4- trying to warm up the brakes and tires. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo chance of rain. Sunset\u2019s going to be beautiful over the water. Clear skies through the sunset all night long. I think the \u003Ci\u003EStella Compass\u003C/i\u003E will be out- I\u2019ll make sure to take a picture for you. Apparently there\u2019s supposed to be a full Mun that\u2019ll be getting some incredible light, so if we have a power outage we\u2019ll still be able to race likely. Temps at race start is at 72\u00BA, going to drop down to the mid-60\u2019s by the end of the race. 40% humidity right now, which is looking to stay stable throughout the race. Wind coming out of the South at around 4 miles per hour, which will not change at all.\u201D By the end of the report I had gone all the way into Turns 6 and 7, preparing to go into Hammerhead. \u201CThat enough info?\u201D I chuckled as I turned into the double-apex.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYeah, I think that\u2019s good,\u201D I replied entering Turn 10. \u201CPlenty of info on hand here. Thanks.\u201D I flew through the technical city complex and saw fans waving at us from the tops of the roofs. Some held flags, and I saw the red of Owlia, the blue of Tekkia, and of course the solid colors of race teams. I dove into the Turn 14-15 hairpin, and clipped the curbing. I jammed the throttle and felt the wheels skitter as I warmed them up. The sun was glowing over the tops of buildings, and out of Turn 18 I saw it in all its glory. Thankfully, I had a couple of tinted tear-offs on the visor that would help me to not get blinded. Still, it was beautiful.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGod, that\u2019s amazing,\u201D Max sighed over my radio behind me. \u201CI got you just perfect with the sun- I can see the rays going off your car.\u201D As I went down the straight, I saw the waves cresting with a white foam as they washed up on the beach. I dove down into Turn 19 and felt the track tilt away before coming back to me. Then it was down the second-longest straight on the track. The crowd cheered as we passed, and I shifted down. The engine yelled, and I got an equal response from the fans.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLaunch Mode 1, Engine to P-3. Rich revs.\u201D I did what I was instructed to do and pulled down into the first grid slot as I came out of Turn 20. \u201CGood luck, bud.\u201D The car settled into the stall and I watched as the rest of the field filed into their spots. In my mirror, I saw the T-wing modification and its second layer. Just underneath it. The sunlight glinted off the ocean water behind me as well as off the cars themselves- being especially bright against the lighter cars. Finally, a green flag waved in the back.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0A single light came on above me and\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EFelt my heart rate speed up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Two lights. I revved up and the engine hummed as the tension built.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Three. I pushed the clutch in and pushed down further. The revs were now free to go up as high as they wanted, and they rose from a hum to a scream.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Four. The crowd roared and I saw the spotlights flicker on as the sky began to darken.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Five. My middle finger rested on the clutch as my left thumb hovered over the bright green EPB button.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The lights went out and I dumped the clutch out. The car leaped out of the starting spot and I waved the wheel as I fought a tiny amount of wheelspin. Max got a similar start but it was way better than the cars behind us, and we held our spots. The car yelled as it revved up through the gears, and with the power boost I managed to get out fast. The car got up about 50 meters per second before I went into the tunnel and blasted through Turn 1. The car slid a bit, but I kept the throttle in- hitting the curb and flying out of the corner. Max stayed in my line and I saw his car spark off the ground on the exit of the corner and threw yellow into the face of Louie- the replacement driver for Max at Monster. I broke hard and flew over the Turn 2 curbing. I heard a tiny buzz as I went over it at the high speeds, and the car stuck into the ground perfectly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Through Turn 3, the car seemed to float over the apex. I took the car wide up the track and got up about a couple feet from the wall before coming back down the track to get set up for Turn 4. Max came up and looked down my inside, which would turn into the outside for 4. I left him the room and he utilized the power boost to get right up next to me. We went side-by-side for the entry and I got past up the inside as Max backed off. We blasted down the straight and Max held right behind me- waiting for a mistake that I wasn\u2019t planning to give. The city buildings blurred as they passed, and our engines echoed off the concrete and steel walls. As I broke into Turn 5, I looked back and saw Max hang right with me. We both clipped the curbing and I heard a deep rumble as I passed over. Behind both of us I heard a squeal as someone locked up, and I saw a white cloud of smoke fly up into the air as Max\u2019s car covered whoever made the mistake.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The buildings opened up to a wide area as the city skyscrapers were replaced with grandstands of fans. The track widened out and I went up to the outside to get a good line for Turn 6. Max held in the slipstream but didn\u2019t make a lunge into the heavy braking zone. The left-sides went over the curbing for the chicane and I snapped back to the right. The tires just missed the curb and I went up the track on the exit as I tried my best to get back out of the corner. Max was trying to get an advantage, but he took the curb a bit too aggressively and fought a snap of oversteer on corner exit. I used this to my advantage and flew out of the corner with the help of a bit of power boost. I broke into Turn 8 and felt the car hold the grip as it went through the high-speed corner. Max was right behind me and I saw a camera crane raise up and follow the field as I went through Turn 9. The shots through there were always amazing, as the buildings created a kind of canyon where the cars seemed to pop out of nowhere and blast past. I kept off the tiny curb through 9 and flew out of the corner before letting off the gas for Turn 10 and 11. The car coasted through the high-speed double-apex, and I weaved in and out around the corners at full-speed. I hit the brakes for Turn 14 and the left-front spat a tiny whip of smoke into my face before releasing and turning in. I got insanely close to the inside barrier at Turn 15 and almost hit it, but I knew I had some room and kept turning in. The car rocketed out of the Turn 16 curve (It\u2019s not really a turn, but more like a continuation of Turn 15) before I broke for Turn 17. I ran up to the exit curb, trying to make the car as wide as possible as I came down- dust shooting up as the aero literally sucked it up like the worlds fastest vacuum cleaner. The car got off the curb and I went down the track to enter Turn 18. I clipped the curb right on-target, and flew through the apex and down the straight. The car hit its max speeds down here, and I saw the speedometer top out at about 180 before I hit the brakes. Down the longest straight on the track, the sunset went into my face as it set across the water. The tint was doing its job well, but I still had to squint a bit to see down the track. Rays of light shined across the apex of Turn 19, and I found my braking mark and turned in.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The car screamed as it flew through Turn 19, and I almost lost the car as the track dipped down away from me and the car got light. I held the throttle in and kept the speed as I flew out of the corner. I felt the tires connect back into the track and heard a scratch as it bottomed out off a bump down the straight. I hit the brakes for Turn 20 and the car slowed down hard and fast, allowing me to shoot through the corner off the apex. After the corner, I crossed the start/finish line to start the second lap. In my mirror, Max was about a second or two back; just out of the effective DRS range that came on Lap 3.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The gap slowly grew out each lap off of minuscule gains around the track. A smooth corner there, a fast entry here, a fast fun into Turn 19- small tenth or hundredth gains that all accumulating into a cool 7-second lead by the first pit stop on Lap 15.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I crossed the line to start the lap and I heard Andy call me in. I didn\u2019t respond and instead dove down into Turn 1 at max speed. I buzzed over the sweeping curb of the first turn and felt the car gently slide up the track; the cars way of quietly and passively warning me that I was teetering on the limit. The sun had gone down beyond the horizon, but you could still see the dim amber glow of sunlight against the inky sky. The spotlights shone bright on the track as I blasted around Turn 3 and the car just barely yelped on the rev limiter before I shifted up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The car was driving wonderfully in the corners, and I could feel that it was supreme over everyone else. The tires still had a lot of life left in them, but I knew there was still a lot more time to be found around the track. I blasted over curbs and temporarily leapt up into the air before sitting down on the ground. This years cars were so much faster than prior. The engines made the cars a lot more powerful, and the aero allowed for insane levels of grip. OTech definitely had the upper hand over the course of the races, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel like we\u2019d sweep the championship this year. I saw the sunset\u2019s final hurrah as I went down Christen Street- the massive straight between Turns 18 and 19. Before I went in, I tore off the tinted wrap- my vision now changing from smokey grey to a kind of yellow to help combat the spotlights of the night.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Finally, I pulled into the pit lane- activating the limiter and listening to the engine change from a quiet hum to a loud buzz as the revs leveled out. I went around the pit boxes and pulled right into OTech\u2019s- stopping right on the mark and watching the red light intently. The team got 4 tires off, and put 4 right back on seemingly a second later. I waited as the fuel went into the car, and finally the light went green as the car dropped. I hit the gas and the car blasted out of the pit stall- smoke trailing off of the wheels as they spun out of the box. I got out onto the \u201Cfast lane,\u201D and finally got out onto the track. Max had already flown past, and I got back on track fast as I tried to regain the position lost. Micheal was closing, but I held the inside line through Turn 1 and kept ahead of him- though just barely. With fresher tires, a full tank of fuel, and a much faster car, I was gone by Turn 3. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Micheal slowly shrunk away in the mirrors. The car flew through the tight corners, and I was finally able to punch it down the 18-19 straight. I utilized DRS down the straight and blasted into Turn 19.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Now quick thing on DRS. The rules are that you can use DRS when you\u2019re behind someone. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re half a second behind or half a minute. However, the best time to use DRS is when you\u2019re less than a second behind. That way, you get both slipstream and DRS to make the car incredibly slippery through the air. However, if you were in first place, you couldn\u2019t use DRS, which is why I both loved and hated being in the lead. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The left side skid plate sparked as the suspension swayed and making the edge scrape the ground with a tiny spark. The car floated up to the outside and I carried the speed onto the exit curbing. I heard a loud rumble as the entire left side of the car shook on the bumpy strip. I came back down and looked at the steering wheel, which was showing I was going at about 170. I flew into Turn 20 and slammed over the curbing- launching the right-sides up briefly before they came back down. The tires gripped into the track and even though it was made of smooth concrete, they bit into the surface.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I blasted past the pit exit and saw Max pulling out towards the track well behind me. As I blazed through Turn 1, the car felt perfect. Just enough oversteer to make the corner fun but enough understeer to make the car feel settled. Above, the sky was a dark inky black with stars scattered around and sparkling like diamonds. I downshifted into Turn 2 and felt the turbo give a tiny pop before I accelerated out of the corner. I stretched out a lead to Max- setting fastest laps as I blazed around the track. The wider cars had proved to be a great change for the season, and I\u2019d never felt as much grip. However, with all this speed, I was pushing the engine really hard. On Lap 26 of 30, Andy came over the radio to give me the warning.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb, the factory\u2019s warning us that you might be pushing too hard. The engine hasn\u2019t been tested this hard yet, and we can\u2019t afford a retirement. Turn down to Lean, please.\u201D I tried to protest, but it was no use and I complied. \u201CMax is 20 seconds back. No pressure.\u201D I still pushed hard down the straights and ended up running a bit wider than usual out of Turn 19 with just two laps to go. \u201CJeb,\u201D Andy said in a warning tone.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI know, I know,\u201D I replied as I collected the slide from going over the curb. \u201CNo more going crazy.\u201D On the final Lap, Max had closed in to 18 seconds, but it was pointless. I pulled out of the Turn 15 hairpin and the crowd was roaring. I flew into 19 and slid the car through the apex- laying down four faintly black lines on the tarmac. Halfway down the straight, I let off the gas and coasted into the corner. I hit the curb and came up the track before going back down.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0100 meters. The team was waving and cheering. I started weaving up and down the track.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A075. I stuck my hand up into the air and felt the wind grab at it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A050. The cars engine whined as it revved down and lost speed from the weaving.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A025. The checkered flag started waving above, and I could see its waving black and white surrounded by a blinding white-light as it crossed over a spotlight.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A00. Blue and white fireworks blasted up into the air and yellow flares shot up as I passed them. The crowd roared louder than I\u2019d ever heard them; their yells mixing with the booming thunder of fireworks.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Cb\u003EWOOOOOOOO\u003Ci\u003EHOOOOOOOOO!!! YES! \u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003EAHH YES GUYS! THANK YOU!\u201D I finally stopped weaving before Turn 1 (No use wrecking the car after all), and waved to the fans. \u201CAmazing car, you guys. Awesome race.\u201D I slowed down and held my hands up to make the number 14 again. This time, along with cheers and applause, the fans returned the salute.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGreat job, Jeb. Superb drive, perfect run. You had us all going there on that last corner- I\u2019m pretty sure Matty had a heart attack back in Owlia.\u201D I chuckled and was about to reply when a loud victorious scream came over the radio- cutting me off and deafening me at the same time.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EYEEEEEEHHAW!!! \u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003Ci\u003EYES GUYS! \u003C/i\u003EWhat a fight. I swear, Micheal looked like he was going to pass me there out of the corner, but I somehow held on. Woo boy!\u201D I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a bit and turned in for 2. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGuys, that was an amazing race there. I want to think that somewhere, Phil was smiling down on us.\u201D The fans returned the salute as I went through Turn 3, and Andy came over the radio.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI agree, buddy,\u201D He replied warmly. \u201CPhil would have been proud.\u201D The crowd at the Sand Straight was the loudest and most encouraging, and I saw almost everyone holding up their hands. Max got up behind me and started the salute, where he stayed up behind the whole cool-down lap. At the end of the lap, I pulled down into the podium and stopped right on the P1 mark. I shut off the engine and started getting out as Max and Micheal pulled in. The team was cheering and yelling as I stepped out of the cockpit, and I went over to give some high-fives. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou killed us,\u201D Max sighed as he got up behind me. I laughed and turned- giving him a handshake and hug. We walked inside the lounge and I saw a painted mural on the wall. Blue and white paint was still drying, but I chuckled as I saw my face, triumphant as I lifted up the trophy.

The engines volume rose up louder and louder as the throttle rose higher and higher. The lights started flashing and the plane pulled away from the gate as lightning forked through the sky with a rumble. I caught one last glimpse of the airport terminal with the last loyal fans looking out the window before I felt my head get knocked back. The plane launched forward with a yell and I watched the lights go past faster and faster- turning into a blur. The plane lifted up and off into the air with water trailing off the wings as it accelerated.

One thing about Alexis; it\u2019s 9\u002B hours of sleep or what I\u2019ve affectionately dubbed as \u201CSloth Mode-\u201C really slow and groggy. I opened up the shade and gasped. The typical Owlian landscape looked like a post-apocalyptic hellscape. We were flying over Green Bay on the approach for River City International, but the peaceful coastal town was\u2026 \u003Ci\u003Egone\u003C/i\u003E. In its place, destroyed roads snaked between indistinguishable piles of timber and concrete. Farther south, the water levels had risen drastically, and entire towns were underwater. Eastwater- one of my favorite places to hang out when I wasn\u2019t racing- was half-drowned. I could see small boats carving their way through the water and leaving a wake in their path. \u201CWell?\u201D She asked as the plane turned for what I assumed to be the runway approach.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201D I replied, letting Alexis look out the window. I heard a quick gasp before the covered her mouth in shock. Her eyes grew to the size of plates, and I could see them dart around trying to see of this were all actually true. She sat back into her seat, still stunned and scared. We came down onto the runway and wheeled to the gate over damp tarmac. As soon as the plane pulled to a stop, I stood up and grabbed my bag from the overhead bin and started going to the front of the plane.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0We all quickly got down through the tunnel and out into the terminal, where there were numerous fans and reporters waiting. Cameras flashes clicked and rustled as we walked back to the baggage claim. We quickly got our bags and all of us (Even Alexis, who was in heels) ran to the parking garage. Despite the destruction we\u2019d seen from above, the airport appeared to be relatively undamaged. I found my car and let out a tiny sigh of relief as I got in it. The engine fired up with a yowl that echoed throughout the garage, and Alexis covered her ears as she opened up her car. We all pulled out and got onto the road to leave, bracing for the worst.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Only a mile in, we hit it. River City is split up into two parts- River City East and River City West. River City East was mainly industrial, with major apartment districts mixed in. This was also where the airport was located, but only because the terrain of the West was too hilly for an airport. The East is significantly lower in elevation than the West, which makes it significantly easier to flood or get damaged from flooding. We saw that right away.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The roads were damaged with numerous pot holes, bumps, and total losses of roads all together. Debris crunched under our wheels, and more than once I had to rely on a push from Max to keep from getting stuck on a bump. Finally, we were forced to stop as we saw the closed road ahead. As we got out of the cars, water splashed up into the air with each step.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201D Alexis called, looking out her window. I went up to the barrier and looked at the flooded road and the bridge to River City West. Behind us, Stars Stadium stood strong and resilient on the horizon. The road ahead was flooded at least 5, maybe 10 feet down. Less than 50 feet away, the River City Bridge rose out of the water and reached up to the other side. I walked back through the water to the rest of the line, where everyone was waiting. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CRoad\u2019s useless,\u201D I said, looking at the map. \u201CIf we go north up near Riverdale, there might be an open bridge somewhere. What do y\u2019all think?\u201D After consulting everyone, we decided to go around to another bridge. I got in my car and started driving.

Rescue efforts are still on-going at this time, with the Army and National Guard working with thousands more volunteers. Across the city, Stars Stadium- the stadium used by the River City Stars football and women\u0027s soccer teams- has opened its doors as a shelter. Across the river, the RiverBowl international competition has been halted temporarily as the Owlian National Team joins in relief efforts.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2026\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I clicked off the TV and walked out of the Stars dressing room through crushing silence. It had been just 2 days since the storm hit, and now Harey was going east at a stunning rate- nearing closer and closer to Erusea, Delras, and Alecton. Just last night, the storm had pummeled Aquaria, and the images were devastating. To the north, Ira had crushed the Southern cities of Arcadia and the northern cities of Basil, KSKM, and portions of Eradica. Port Gorodsky had been practically wiped out, but the dry terrain had made the storm stall out before doing too much damage to cities like Arcovy or Stihlgrad.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I walked out of the tunnel and sucked in a breath of warm, stale air. The arena with room for at least 100,000 was dead-silent. There were a few whispers from somewhere, but besides that, the air was dead still. A baby\u2019s cry echoed through the stadium as its wail bounced off the huge walls. Someone coughed quietly, and that too echoed. I looked up and saw the stadium with its blue and white walls ringing the ginormous interior. Names of famous players stood proud and bold on the banners, and flags rustled quietly as they blew in a faint wind. I\u2019ve never felt so\u2026 \u003Ci\u003Esmall\u003C/i\u003E.

I walked onto the empty field and heard as my name kept getting whispered louder and louder- spreading through the crowd like a wild fire. Soon, the once silent crowd was an ocean of noises- 102,000 voices roaring and rumbling together. I stepped onto the blue and silver Stars logo and the crowd started to hush. I noticed there was a hole in the roof and sunlight shined down on a spot just to my left. I looked around and saw that the rest of the team had come out- holding everything from food to water to blankets.

I got my helmet strapped on and sat down into the tub-like shape of the cockpit. After I got my gloves pulled on tight, I grabbed my steering wheel from the top of the nose. The car was set down and the engine roared to life.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CComm check,\u201D Andy said into my radio as the light went out for the start of the Formation Lap. I leapt away from the mark and the car responded perfectly- biting into the brand-new tarmac and getting away fast. I waited a few seconds before responding as I weaved across the racetrack to get some heat in the tires.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLoud and clear, Andy,\u201D I responded, looking back in the mirror at the Shark Fin. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I\u2019ve learned that this is a fairly recurring theme of reviewing the tech changes we\u2019d made for the race weekend, so I\u2019m proud to introduce a new segment; Tech Updates! This week we\u2019d gone for the regular T-wing instead of the wing we used in Tekkia- now opting for a faster, more streamlined setup. And that\u2019s all for Tech Updates. Tune in next race where we\u2019ll be heading to Owlia. Anyways, back to your regularly scheduled programming.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I went into the Turn 1 hairpin and watched as Max reveled in the clear air. \u003Ci\u003EThat one stupid slip\u003C/i\u003E, I thought angrily as I went up the small hill to Turn 2. I tried to clear my mind of the mistake, but it was extremely difficult. As a race driver, you\u2019ve got to keep from rehashing the past mistakes. I got up into Turn 2 and went up the hill to Turn 3- a long uphill loop with some nice banking. The new course was absolutely stunning, and as I passed the Solari Stadium, fans cheered and waved flags at us. No Solarian driver had won a K1 grand prix, but the fans didn\u2019t seem to care. They were still passionate, supportive, and \u003Ci\u003Eloud\u003C/i\u003E. I went into the fast downhill Turn 4 and let off the throttle through the extreme downhill Turns 5 and 6 as the Stadium tapered off. Max hit the throttle down the wide 6-7 Straight, and I weaved around to get heat. I let off the throttle for Turn 7 and then sped up- feeling the left-side tires reaching the edge of the grip limit before the corner straightened out for Turn 8. Turn 7 was a fast, long, sweeping right-hander that tested aero grip and stability, while 8 was the opposite. Straight out of 7, you\u2019ve got to hit the brakes for the tightening left loop, which has a little runoff but not much. It was down a small straight before we went into the 9-10-11 right-left-right hairpin complex that tested the brakes and reaction times. I came out of the corner and blasted down a straight that we\u2019d be able to use DRS on. The straight went uphill and I remembered Turn 12 was a blind braking zone up until about 300 meters away. Sure enough, the track leveled out and I hit the brakes for the right-handed hairpin before turning into another hairpin; the left Turn 13. I pulled out of the corner and powered out- blasting full-throttle over curbing through the 14-15 left-right chicane. Then it was on to what the drivers all called \u201CBradley Loop.\u201D 16 and 17 were flat-out corners that mimicked the 10-11-12 section of Bradley, just going the other way. The car flew through the apexes of the flat-out turns, and even through the slight downhill Turn 17, it never lost balance. I went over the exit rumble strip in Turn 17 and got up to max speed at the end of the straight. The speeds top 200 down into the Turn 18 braking zone, and then it\u2019s a double apex back onto another straight that runs parallel to the main. A good exit of Turn 19 is critical in order to get a good run down the 19-20 straight, and then it\u2019s onto the dreaded Turn 20 hairpin. The hairpin is wickedly tight- like Owlia\u2019s Turn 14- and is off-camber, meaning the inside of the track tilts up to force you wide. You have to brake really hard for that turn and then fly out onto the main straight. I went up to launch mode and pulled to a stop in the second position- right on the inside of Max for Turn 1. The rest of the field filed into line and I could see Max look in his mirrors for a final check before the lights came on.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0One light came on above us and I pushed in the clutch. The field behind us looked hungry and anxious, and I could tell that everyone on the pit wall was feeling the same way. This was a whole new track, whole new race, and whole new strategy. This would be a race of unknowns for sure.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Two lights. I felt my heart rate start to pick up as I pushed down on the gas quickly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Three. I pushed the pedal down all the way and heard the engine starting its yell.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Four. The grid was filled with roaring and screaming engines all growing in tune with each other.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Five. I watched the lights carefully as we waited. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Suddenly, the lights went out and I released the clutch quickly. The car bit into the track as the revs dropped and the rear tires caught traction. My car got an incredible launch and I got by Max, who had gotten a poor start compared to me. I quickly shifted up through the gears and pulled away down the long straight to Turn 1. Max tried a look on my outside but I came up the track to end an attacking threat before the braking zone. Everyone behind us was close entering Turn 1, and I saw a lockup on the inside of a 3-wide move in my mirror. Max and I turned down just before a car ran up and off the nose of Micheal and jumped into the air with only 3 wheels. Smoke covered the racing line as the car (A 77International) spun around across backwards and Micheal came through the smoke without a front wing. We couldn\u0027t focus on the spin, however, as Max had gotten along-side me in Turn 2. I tried to hold it around the inside but Max had gotten a good Turn 1 exit and held alongside me. We were side-by-side in Turn 3 and the Stadium crowd roared as we passed them- our engines yelling off the stands. Max got past down Turn 4 but I wasn\u2019t going to let him get away that easily. I dove down into Turn 5 but locked up, sending up a trail of smoke as I ran up the track. Max was forced to take evasive action and ran wide- cutting Turn 6 and hopping over the curb with me. The rest of the field was a bit farther back, and I managed to get alongside down the straight. Max got away and I caught into his slipstream in a vain and desperate attempt to go past. Max sliced down through Turn 7- cutting me off and gaining a bit through the flat-out turn. I flew out of the exit of 7 and flew up the inside in the Turn 8 loop. I got past and held up the racing line that quickly turned into the outside for Turn 9. I turned down but Max lunged up my inside and I had to give him the line. Fortunately, I had the inside for Turn 10 and got clear off the apex. We both came out of Turn 11 with almost nothing separating us, and I flew down to the inside to defend down the long straight. We went up the hill and Max got his wing just on my left rear corner to keep me from coming up as the shark fin shook in the air. The straight leveled out and we put on one last burst of speed before the braking zone- the engine yelping before I broke into the turn. Max was right on top of me before I went into the corner- going over the rumble strip curb and getting clear through the hairpin. I came right back across over the Turn 13 curb and came out of the corner with the yelling of the engine as I shifted up through the gears. I blasted through the 14-15 chicane before going onto Bradley- still going up the gears.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A04th, Left-right, hit the curb on the apex of the chicane. 5th, light up the Turn 16 curb, full-throttle. 6th, 7th, over the curbing for 17 down the hill. I came out of the corner still full-throttle- collecting a small slide on the exit before dropping down the hill. The car felt perfect through the tight corners of the middle sector, and now it was the mostly flat-out final sector left in the lap. Max had lost a little bit of ground in the loop, and I now had a clear run down into the double-apex of 18 and 19 as the track leveled out. I flew over the curbs and heard the loud buzz as the tires ran on top of the strip at high speed. I got out of Turn 19 and got right up on the exit curb- carrying as much speed as I could through the exit. I blasted down the straight and Max tucked into my slipstream- gaining on me as we blasted down the .75 kilometer-long straight. He got up on me and I darted left to defend my line into Turn 20- not wanting to give him anything. Max got alongside me but as we broke for Turn 20 he fell back. I ran wide as the track tilted away from me- throwing the car up the track. I did my best to carry the speed, but Max performed a textbook switchback move on me and was now up my inside down the even longer front-straight. I didn\u2019t have very much speed, and we were side-by-side down the straight. Max got right up next to me on my left and I cursed myself as Max got past in the Turn 1 apex- easily flying past on the inside of the hairpin. I went back down and got on the inside for Turn 2, but he again got past in Turn 3- holding the inside with a roar from the Stadium crowd.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I tucked in behind Max and attempted a lunge into Turn 4- bouncing over the curbing as Max slammed the door shut. This one small error allowed Max to leap forward, and I had to wait to get back up on him. In Turn 7, I gained a tun as he ran a tad wide- opening the door and allowing me to stick my nose in the small gap. The turbulent air made Max oversteer just a bit and forced him to make a fast correction- allowing me to get right up on the inside. As we straightened out, Max was throwing his right hand up in the air at me before grabbing the steering wheel to get into 8 on my inside. He got past me but couldn\u2019t get clear as we broke for Turn 9. I flew over the hairpin apex and fought up the inside to prevent an overtake around the outside. Now Max had the inside for Turn 10 and he got a nose past me before we went right for Turn 11. Still side-by-side, we blasted down the straight- neither one of us wanting to give up an inch for the other. We battled right next to each other with about 2 inches of space between us. We went down the straight and I watched as my speedometer topped 190 before I slammed on the brakes on the inside.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max overshot his marker trying to get around me, but instead he flew up around the outside- allowing me to get past up the inside and clear a line through Turn 13. Behind both of us, Louie had fallen back about 3 seconds- still suffering behind our cars that were frankly very overpowered. We flew through the chicane and I felt the car briefly bottom out before going through Turn 16. Max was preparing a move similar to what he\u2019d done last lap, and down the hill I could feel him closing. On the next lap, DRS would be able to activate and I\u2019d be a sitting duck. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I went defensive into Turn 18 and Max got up on my outside briefly before falling back- the defending work doing its job. I came out of Turn 19 and Max was trying a look around my outside that would quickly turn to the inside for the hairpin. I held my line and jammed EPB, but the boost wasn\u2019t helping as Max too deployed the electrical advantage. He was right up along-side but I braked early in an attempt to recreate the move Max had made on me last lap. True to historical events, Max locked up the left-front and went straight on, allowing me to slip up the inside and power past. The engine yelled at me as I went up through the gears and pulled away from Max. We passed the start/finish line and I saw Max stay in whatever slipstream was left to gain. I flew up to 201 before slamming the brakes into Turn 1 without any pressure at all from Max behind.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I flowed through the corners and felt the car doing its magic- twisting and turning with each curve and dip in the track. The car felt really dialed in, but despite how perfect I drove, Max was still there. He didn\u2019t lose any ground over the course of the laps, but he didn\u2019t gain any either- setting about the same times as me. On Lap 16, the tires were starting to fall off just a bit but to my surprise, Andy asked me to stay out another lap after I radioed in the status. And, to my frustration, Max went straight-on into the pit lane on Lap 17- the optimal pit window.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAre you kidding me?!\u201D I exclaimed as I went down the long front-straight. \u201CI said I was having tire trouble and you let him pit first? I\u2019m leading, don\u2019t I get the strategy calls?!\u201D I broke into Turn 1 and got over the curbing on the apex before Andy responded.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNothing we can do about it now. Bare down and stay focused. You\u2019re boxing this lap.\u201D I went through the lap as hard as I could and at the end of the back straight I pulled off the corner and down to the Pit Lane. I tapped the pit limiter and the engine started humming in monotone as the revs evened out. I went down the lane and pulled into the pit stall- stopping right on the mark as the team got everything changed. 4 tires on, 4 off, fuel added. I waited the 10 seconds and peeled out of the pit stall with the scream of tires and a cloud of smoke. I got back out onto the pit lane and went down- kicking myself forward to try to get that extra tenth. \u003Ci\u003ECome on\u2026 Come on!!\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I got out of the pit lane and released the limiter- flying out of the lane and bringing the speed up. Max was right behind me and was gaining impossibly fast, and he blasted by on the inside before the braking zone. I tried to hold it around the outside but the cold tires still had to get up to temperature, and I lost the spot as I fought a 4-wheel skid.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDAMNIT\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E,\u201D I shouted in frustration as Max got by. I got up to him but I couldn\u2019t get by- forced behind in the Stadium. I went around the long, sweeping corner and felt the car trying to understeer in the wake of Max. I tried to get up to him through the flat-out chicane and closed in a little bit down the straight. I hovered in the slipstream of Max and abruptly cut out down to the inside. I was right alongside and Max started coming down- squeezing me to give me the bad line into 7. We almost collided and a tiny puff of smoke came out of the left front- signifying that we had indeed hit. Max flew off to the left and I ricocheted right before coming back up the racetrack to line up for Turn 7.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTell Max, that was \u003Ci\u003Eway\u003C/i\u003E too close!

I went up the inside of the hairpin and got past smoothly- cutting back down into Turn 10 as I got clear. Out of Turn 11, Max got right behind me and activated DRS as we went up the hill. I cut to the inside just as Max got a peek- making him brake and close the DRS as he tried a switchback move to my outside.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb, both of you are driving dangerously. Keep it clean.\u201D The warning made me furious but I couldn\u2019t respond yet as I broke for Turn 12. Max couldn\u2019t hold around the outside and I got past and performed the same move of cutting back across the apex. As soon as I got out of Turn 17, I keyed the mic.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAndy, Max squeezed me down! How could I avoid that, it\u2019s either let him hit me or go down into the grass!\u201D I broke for 18 and 19 before Andy responded.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat move on the straight there was a little risky. Just play it safe- we don\u2019t want retirements here. You\u2019re 20 seconds clear of third; don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201D Max held in my slipstream and went down to the inside entering the Turn 20 hairpin. I went well wide and watched as the camber threw him back up the track, allowing me to come right back. We crossed the line to start Lap 20 and Max was coming back with the help of the DRS. I could feel the pressure as I went down the straight to the roaring of fans. At least we were providing a good show. I held in front of Max for the majority of the lap- defending feints and getting the good launches out of corners that I desperately needed. Max held behind me for the next ten or so laps, and with only 3 to go he made his move.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max got an incredible launch out of the Turn 13 hairpin and got up my inside in Turn 14, giving me a bad run for 15. He mounted the chicane curbs and bounced into the air- leaving the ground entirely before coming back down in a bright cloud of sparks. He somehow held it around the outside of my car in Turn 16 but I got clear in 17- just barely passing him as we got onto the fastest straight on the track. Max got into my slipstream and used the DRS to blaze past- clearing me halfway down the straight and coming back up the track to cut me off. I tried a lunge into the braking zone but he anticipated it perfectly and came across- hitting the apex perfectly and flying out of Turn 19. I kept in his line and didn\u2019t attempt a move in Turn 20, knowing it would mess up my run down the straight. Instead, I waited patiently (and painfully) through the hairpin and used a good run off the camber to fly out on exit. I used EPB and closed on Max as I opened DRS. I practically floated as the car got up to speed and blasted around Max- leaving him in the dust down the longest straight on the track. Max was too far behind for a Turn 1 lunge, and with two laps left I could feel that victory was in my grasp. The car felt perfect around the Stadium corners, and I could take so much speed through the loops it was unbelievable. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max had started to reel me in little by little around the track but I told myself to stay focused as I crossed the line to start the final lap. Using the DRS, Max was right on top of me entering Turn 1- almost running into my rear wing as he locked up a little bit. I pulled away out of the corner but Max\u2019s lunge had actually helped him a little bit- allowing him to catch up. He was practically on top of me in the long, looping Turn 3 as the stands came to life- 50,000 fans in this one section alone cheering us on in the thrilling fight for the lead. I pulled the car through Turn 4 but on the exit I ran a touch wide- losing a bit of control and giving Max an edge. He tried an outside look through Turn 5 but couldn\u2019t make it work, electing to fall into line for 6. I got out of the corner and Max was right on me for the straight- trying to get a run. He looked inside and I went down, forcing him up the track and giving him the poor line in Turn 7. He got alongside but fell back as we went into 7. I tried to hold the speed but ended up going wide- opening a massive chasm on the inside that Max took with pleasure.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I was up the inside for 8 but Max squeezed me down the track- slowing both of us down as we went through the loop. I was right on top of him in Turn 9- forcing him far down the track and giving him a poor exit that I attempted to utilize in Turn 10. However, Max was still alongside me, and he forced \u003Ci\u003Eme\u003C/i\u003E down as well in the hairpin- slowing both of us down even more. He got up my inside in Turn 11 and I let him past as I elected to use DRS instead of fight too hard. I opened up DRS and got on his right side before the braking zone.

The tires were a lot wider as well, and the entire front looked more open and airy than in years past. As soon as the cars turned into the corner though, I saw the real big changes. The rear end had been changed completely, and was open. Instead of a large shark fin, the rear was flat. Also, the Air Inlet had been moved down slightly, making the cars even more slippery in a straight line. The rear wing had been almost 100% changed- now just a simple but stylish little wing plate instead of a massive cluster of various downforce-generating bits and pieces.

I jammed the gas and the car leaped forward with a yelp before evening out the revs. The crowd cheered as the blue flag whipped in the wind behind me, and as I raised the flag up I saw the crowd all returning the salute.

The rules were testing the idea of different shark fins, and now the rules were 100% open. Andy had been shut in his office for about 3 days after that announcement. Also, the cars would be a lot different in terms of weight. A new rules regulation that was really controversial was the prospect of no refueling in a race. This would save time on the pit stops, as well as make fuel saving even more crucial over the course of a race. Andy was shut in his office for about 3 \u003Ci\u003Emore\u003C/i\u003E days after that announcement. On the tire compound front, K1 had struck down the idea\u2026 For now. It was still on the table for \u201939, but many (including myself) think that they\u2019ll bring it in for 2040 for the new decade. Another proposition that was proposed was a singular front wing for 2038- removing the double-decker design that we had now.

We\u2019d lightened the small bottom wing beneath the Shark Fin base, and we\u2019d beefed up the T-Wing from the Tekkia package. Instead of one or two wings, we had three- giving us a ton more downforce than before. The rear wing got a working over as well- now it was a bit angled to provide both speed and grip.

I got a good start and put my nose up the inside of Max, but Max out broke me into Turn 1. I tried to get up the inside but he was past- already streaking off out of the corner as I put the power down on corner exit. The rest of the field trailed out of Turn 1 but I couldn\u2019t look as I got right on the tail of Max. I was behind Max, and I could see every little detail of the blue and white car. We bounced over little bumps in the road and sparks flew out from under both Max\u2019s and my car. I was so close that Max\u2019s sparks just barely glinted off my nose but never really flew up into my face.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0We broke for Turn 3 and Max got a tiny gap out to me as I wrestled the front tires through the sweeping turn. The car blasted through Turn 4, and I shot over the curbs mere inches from the wall in an attempt to get back on Max. I spared a brief glance back, and saw everyone else weaving through the turn like a multicolored snake before diving into Turn 5. The track tightened up drastically, and I couldn\u2019t get a look into the corner.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0After the impossibly tight hairpin and a turn underneath a bridge, we went into the Tunnel. Max and I flew through the tunnel as our cars echoed off the concrete walls. Just when we were about to top out, the braking zone for the Chicane came up. I had to fight to keep the car under control in the corner, but there was just enough grip to stay behind Max and hold the line. The car had plenty of acceleration available, and I flew up behind Max on the corner exit.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0We flew through the Swimming Pool Section and bounced over the curbing- flying over the bumps with such force that the wing started shaking as I landed.

As I turned into the corner I heard a loud shout from the crowd, followed by a squealing of tires and a loud crash when I exited the turn. I looked in my mirror and saw a Monster car flying into the air on top of the tire barrier. As the yellow flag came out, I hit the radio.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHoly cow!\u201D I started slowing down as the red flag was put out, and shut down the engine to conserve. \u201CThat was a big crash.

I took off my helmet and set it down as everyone got to work. I saw a big screen on the straight, which was showing a replay of the crash. Louie, who had darted to the inside of a Regal, broke late entering Turn 1. The left-rear clipped the front of the Regal and the car leapt into the air sideways. The car tilted in a cloud of smoke before hitting the wall right-side first. Suddenly, the car violently crashed into the barrier- hitting with such a force that the car flipped up into the air before barrel-rolling over the wall onto the top of the barrier.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COoh,\u201D Max groaned, looking at the screen. \u201COuch.\u201D The screen changed and we saw the replay from the TV shot.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat\u2019s gonna leave a mark,\u201D I replied, nodding. As the replay ended, we saw Louie in the car- nodding his head with the safety crews. Behind us, Claire was looking smug as she scribbled down notes. I looked back and saw a distinctive (and damaged) SL/FR flap on the side of the car.

Just for fun, Kim had invited us to the Week 3 game- Stars at Dolphins. The game was bound to be a blowout, despite the trade of the Stars Goalkeeper to the cross-town Royals. Kim had scored about 5 goals so far \u003Ci\u003Ethis season\u003C/i\u003E, including a dominant 3-goal performance against the Royals on opening day. Alexis and I walked down to the field, where Kim was warming up.

The first goal, which came in the 15th minute, was caused off a beautiful cross from Kim- straight to the feet of Tori who pounded the ball into the back of the net. The Stars were cheering as Tori slid onto the turf on her knees and extended her arms to the crowd.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The game was fairly uneventful until about 10 minutes left until halftime. Kim got the ball and started cutting through the defense like they weren\u2019t even there. Everyone stood up as Kim faced off against the goalkeeper one-on-one. Kim pulled her foot back and kicked the ball with tremendous force- slamming it into the back of the net straight past the goalkeeper.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYes!\u201D Kim ran to the edge of the field and yelled in celebration. With that score, Kim had broken the River City Stars record for most points scored by a single player by the fourth game of the season- breaking the old record with a week to spare.

Kim started off a beautiful attack, and crossed it to the center. Amy, a midfielder, kicked the ball hard to the top-right corner, but was just a tad off as it harmlessly bounced off the post. She kicked the ground before running back- readying for defense.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Before the Dolphins even got past the midfield line, Kim made a stunning dive to get the ball back- taking it away before getting it from a pass. She started running to the goal, but a defender- Number 10- dove for the ball. I stood up. It wasn\u2019t a dive to challenge for the ball- it was of desperation, of frustration. The ball flew underneath the defenders arm, and, almost in slow-motion, Kim leapt up into the air.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0She tried to hurdle the defender, and it looked like it would work. However, at the very last second, Kim\u2019s foot hit the defender\u2019s shoulder. She was tossed forward in mid-air and without anything to stabilize her, Kim careened wildly out of control before slamming into the ground head-first. Grass flew up into the air as Kim rolled once on the ground before landing belly-up. The crowd gasped in shock as whistles started coming in and players converged on the scene. Kim was motionless as teammates and doctors came around in a circle around her. I saw a Stars player waving for a stretcher, and covered my mouth. \u201CThis is bad,\u201D I muttered to myself nervously. The crowd was silent in shock as the Dolphins players also came out- trying to help however they could. I saw the coach stomping out onto the field- worry and fury painted on her face.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat the heck was that?!\u201D\u003C/i\u003E The coach lit up at the defender holding her shoulder, and it was hard to turn my attention away.

She looked around before grabbing her head as the stretcher came out. Kim was about to get up, but before she could, she grabbed her leg and collapsed to the ground again- holding her knee and rolling on the ground in obvious pain. As Kim was carried back to the bench on the stretcher, she waved to the crowd- drawing cheers and whistles. Everyone separated, and I stood up as the game got back underway.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019m going down there,\u201D I told Alexis, who nodded and joined me.

Maybe speak lou-\u201C She was cut off by a yell from the crowd, making all three of us turn. A Stars player was running past the sideline in a flash, and we watched as she went uncontested up the line before crossing it inside. The ball wobbled in the air as Ason dove for the ball- \u003Ci\u003Ejust\u003C/i\u003E missing it as the ball rolled out of bounds. Kim shouted, \u201CFocus, guys!\u201D The team reset for the restart. \u201COne play at a time!\u201D She gave a thumbs-up before turning back to us.

The loud drone of the propellers drowned out pretty much everything, but because this was a shorter flight than normal, I didn\u2019t mind too much. The plane was one of the older ones that served in an old war far beyond my time, but it had been refitted for short-distance transport.

The track surface had just been finished a week ago, and according to some WEC drivers I talked to, the type of surface (A new, smoother asphalt seen at the Baikerbanur endurance race) was incredibly grippy.

The diffusers were going to be a lot smaller but just as effective- reducing weight and drag but possibly aimed at minimizing air effects. Also, rear wings had been lowered for the cars, and less aerodynamic stability parts would be allowed than before- reducing the \u201CDirty Air\u201D effect and hopefully allowing for closer racing. The cars were meant to be thinner in the side-pods, but lower to the ground. In the power-plant aspect, not much was different- 100 extra units of electricity would be granted for the cars to use for EPB (Electric Power Boost) or EED (Emergency Electric Drive). The cars were meant to be lighter, but again, nothing was finalized yet. On the schedule front, a couple changes were being made and finalized. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0First, two new Pre-Season Testing venues were on the calendar- A trip to a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E layout and to Dell, Delras on a brand-new circuit.

Also, a contract for the Basilian Grand Prix went down in flames, and the K1 World Championship was en route to the brand-new Feguesean Grand Prix. Max loved the circuit, and went into a day of mourning when he heard the news. Oh, and also on the schedule front, the commercial deal fell through. However, Alexis had gotten something better. Formula K was looking for a guest driver commentator for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E pre-season test, and Alexis had ended up getting me the deal.

(The cars were\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Egoing to be a lot less stable though, so I\u2019d imagine it was the former option instead of the latter.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I looked out the window at the beautiful ocean, and exhaled. \u003Ci\u003EI wonder how long this water has been here.

I turned to the odd shape and saw a small fighter jet (a fraction of the size of ours) trailing off the right wing. I could see through the clear canopy and looked at the pilot, whose head rested underneath a glowing yellow ball of the reflecting sun. The pilot was looking up at our plane and smiling- giving us a quick wave. As I waved back, the pilot grinned and did a quick roll before speeding up to get on our wingtip.

The pilot seemed to be having a lot of fun as he bobbed and weaved around the wingtip- performing tricks for us. I turned to the aisle and saw both Claire and Andy watching the plane on their side earnestly. Probably trying to take some designs. Max, on the other hand, was very intently staring out of his window. I was about to get up and walk over to him, but as soon as I unbuckled, the pilot came over the intercom.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAll pilots, prepare for landing.\u201D The engines made it so I couldn\u2019t yell without looking like a doofus, and as we lurched down I realized that I\u2019d probably get killed if I didn\u2019t sit down. The landing was uneventful, and I watched as the blue water changed to white sand to brilliant green grass. The engines roared as the ground changed to grey tarmac, and we set down with a lurch before coming to a fast stop on the runway. Everyone was forced forward against the seatbelts, but we finally stopped. The small jets flew ahead of us before landing just in front- parachutes billowing in the wind as they came to a stop.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWelcome to Nomlas, Aquaria, home to Round 6 of the K1 World Championship, as well as the OFL \u003Ci\u003Eand\u003C/i\u003E WSL team: The Nomlas Dolphins.

We\u2019ll be arriving at the gate shortly.\u201D The electric motors of the wheels whined as we drove out to the gate area, and as we pulled to a stop, the other planes- AS-1 Vultures according to the internet- pulled up beside us.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI wonder why we got an escort,\u201D I thought out loud as we got our bags from the compartment above us.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI heard that the GPS transponders were knocked out in the storm,\u201D Andy replied with a grunt as he got his bag down. \u201CThey probably escorted us.\u201D He pulled and knocked into me- forcing me forward.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGeez, what\u2019s in there?\u201D I asked with a laugh. \u201CA bowling ball?\u201D Andy didn\u2019t answer and we walked to the front. Max was still looking out his window, but as soon as the door opened he was out like a bullet. I walked down the platform and followed Max, who was waiting behind the front landing gear as the left pilot got out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Ci\u003EHo\u003Cu\u003Ela\u003C/u\u003E,\u003C/i\u003E\u201D Max muttered as the pilot got out. As the pilot took off the helmet, long, sandy brown hair tumbled down to her shoulders. Max sucked in a breath as the pilot turned, revealing a face that looked like it had spent a long time on the many beaches of Aquaria. She bunched her hair up into a bun and Max\u2019s mouth dropped open. She didn\u2019t look much older than Max and I- maybe a year or two at most. Max inhaled, seemed to give himself a mental pep-talk, and began walking to the plane with a confident look on his face. I walked up to the front landing gear to watch.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHi there,\u201D Max said happily as the pilot stepped down off the ladder.

It\u2019s like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201D It was Max\u2019s turn to fade away with a thoughtful smile.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt sounds great,\u201D Maria said, thinking. \u201CI\u2019ve never really been able to watch a race- being a pilot tends to get in the way of that.

Max had tried to ask every single one of Kim\u2019s teammates, as well as a few of their friends. He was shot down by every single one. Maria thought for a couple more moments before answering. \u201COkay,\u201D She nodded with a smile. \u201CWhen does the race start?\u201D Max smiled and seemed to bob on his feet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAwesome!

The engine gently rose in volume as the plane started departing back towards the hangar. Max started walking over, and Alexis and I struck up a quick, \u201CLook natural\u201D pose that had us leaning on the nose gear. As soon as Max saw my (admittedly failed) attempt to cover up a smile, he pointed menacingly at me with a scowl.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CShut it,\u201D He growled, making me laugh and extend my hands out in protest.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat?!\u201D I asked in a defensive tone- still trying (in vain) not to smile. \u201CI didn\u2019t say anything!

She was wearing a T-shirt with some kind of foreign writing on it (I didn\u2019t understand it), with some jeans.

During the early years of high school, that range was extended to around 3- giving him the nickname \u201CRadar\u201D (for his ability to find anyone). But right now, instead of the confident, devil-may-care Max, a shy and timid Max was on display. \u003Ci\u003EWhat the heck?\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Ci\u003ESi,\u003C/i\u003E\u201D Maria replied with an almost relieved smile. \u201CI must admit, for a second I thought you would forget me.\u201D Max looked surprised.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhy would I do that?\u201D Maria shrugged, looking doubtful.

A waitress came over and Maria started up a conversation. I tried to follow along, but I just couldn\u2019t keep up with the rapid-fire language that was Aquarian. At one point, I heard, \u201CMax and Jebediah Kerman,\u201D and \u201COTech,\u201D and the waitress looked at us. She then asked something, and Maria turned to us. \u201CWhat would you like to drink?\u201D Maria asked, relaying the information. We all asked for water, and Maria repeated the response back to the waitress who nodded, scribbled something down on a notepad, and walked off. Max was looking at the menu and considering what to eat- pointing at something and asking Maria what it was. Maria looked at the menu. Then at Max. And then back to the menu- almost like she was watching an invisible tennis match.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u201CReally?\u201D Maria asked, looking cautious. \u201CIt\u2019s a bit hot- even for me\u2026\u201D Max shrugged.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI can handle it,\u201D Max replied confidently. Maria smirked in a, \u201CJust you wait,\u201D look as Max continued. \u201CI love spicy food- eat it all the time back home.\u201D I sighed and began eyeing a tasty-looking taco. As the waitress came back, we all ordered. When Maria said Max\u2019s order, the waitress looked at Max- an eyebrow raised. Then, she leaned down and muttered something to Maria. Maria just shook her head- a confused yet interested look on her face. As the waitress departed, I could see her shaking her head.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSo, Maria,\u201D I started after sipping my water. \u201CWhat\u2019s Aquaria like?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COh, it is just beautiful,\u201D She answered with a smile. \u201CIn the summer, when the birds come in, the trees are just filled with colors. And the beaches- they are all just so\u2026 perfect. It\u2019s just amazing to lay down on the sand for hours and hours and just listen to the waves. You almost lose yourself in the beauty of it all.\u201D She sighed wistfully. \u201CSo what is Owlia like? I have heard the west is amazing.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell,\u201D Alexis said, smirking. \u201CIn the summer, the weather\u2019s hot but kind of tolerable. In the winter, it\u2019s \u003Ci\u003Eimpossibly\u003C/i\u003E cold. We typically get 2 or 3 inches of snow thanks to the North Lake. But the city life is just amazing. There\u2019s so much to do everywhere, and everyone is just so amazingly nice.

I must admit, I am kind of what you call a \u2018Couch Potato.\u2019\u201D Max looked surprised. Maria saw him and laughed. \u201CYes, yes, I know. I\u2019m just a massive \u003Ci\u003ERenegades\u003C/i\u003E fan though. If I am not careful, I end up watching the show all the way until the next day.\u201D She chuckled. \u201CI know that it sounds silly, but my friends always joke that if being a fighter pilot does not work out, I could become a professional TV watcher.\u201D We all laughed and Max smiled.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI love that show,\u201D He exclaimed, smiling. \u201CWhat season are you on?\u201D Maria thought for a moment before answering.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSeason\u2026 three, I think,\u201D She replied. \u201CAnna almos-\u201C She was cut off as Max covered his ears.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSpoilers,\u201D He yelled, making Maria smile.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COkay,\u201D She smirked. \u201CNo spoilers; just for you.\u201D The waitress finally came with our food and Max cautiously uncovered his ears.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COh, finally,\u201D I said- preparing to bite into my taco. \u201CThis looks so good.\u201D I was about to bite in, but Maria gave me a stern look that just oozed,\u201DTry it.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFirst,\u201D She said, grabbing Max\u2019s hand. \u201CWe should give a prayer.\u201D I was a bit confused, but went along with it and held Alexis\u2019s hand. The prayer was in Aquarian, so I couldn\u2019t understand it very well, but I got the feeling that goodness was being thrown our way instead of bad vibes. It sounded pretty, though.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I bit into my taco and (I\u2019m not ashamed to admit) melted a little bit inside. Alexis was seeming to enjoy her fish, and Max\u2026 Max coughed and I looked up mid-bite to see that his face was bright red. Maria looked over and he nodded- giving a pained smile that reminded me of the time he accidentally swallowed a bee in the 6th grade.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTastes good,\u201D He choked. I tried not to chuckle as I kept eating. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Maria smirking as she bit into her food. When I looked up a couple minutes later, Max\u2019s face was even redder, and I could see a couple of beads of sweat on his forehead as he sipped down some water. He took one more bite, but his mouth couldn\u2019t take any more.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Ci\u003EHOT!\u003C/i\u003E\u201D Max\u2019s eyes bugged out as he bent over and spat a pepper back onto his plate and grabbing his water glass. He started chugging it down- ice cubes and all. Maria couldn\u2019t help but laugh and patted Max\u2019s back as he panted for air. I slowly finished chewing, and, in a very calm voice, attempted to hide the fact I was rolling on the ground inside.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFeeling okay?\u201D Max didn\u2019t have the energy to answer as he picked the rest of the apparent death peppers out of his food. Maria gladly took them as she gave him a sad smile.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt is okay,\u201D she said in a soft tone as Alexis looked like she was trying really hard not to laugh- grinning down at her food. \u201CIt \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E one of the hottest foods on the order. Max looked like he was blushing, but I couldn\u2019t really tell any difference from his already red face. We kept on eating a little while longer, before we were all done. Maria took the check before I or Max could get a grab at it, and when I tried to get it back, she shook her head.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI insist,\u201D She protested. \u201CYou all have been so kind to me, it is the least I can do.\u201D I looked at Alexis for help, and she shrugged.

My mind went into overdrive, and I took a quick peek at the check to figure out what the heck I was doing. Finally, after figuring out a number that worked, we all got up and I slipped some extra bills in the folder. \u201C\u003Ci\u003EGracias,\u003C/i\u003E\u201D Maria waved to the hostess, who said something back as we stepped out. The sky was already dark, and cars honked on the streets as they drove past.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell that was fun,\u201D Alexis said as we went out to the curb. We got out to the curb and a valet went out to get Maria\u2019s car. (What a funny word; Valet. Kind of just rolls off the tongue.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYeah,\u201D I agreed, smiling. \u201CWe got to eat some new food, introduce ourselves to a new culture, and watch Max go up like a volcano.\u201D Max fixed me an angry death glare. \u201COverall, pretty good day.\u201D Maria smiled and held Max\u2019s hand- making Alexis smile and Max blush. I raised an eyebrow with a smirk, but Max didn\u2019t respond. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt is getting a little bit late,\u201D Maria said as the car pulled up. \u201CWould you mind joining me at my apartment, Max? Maybe we could catch up on \u003Ci\u003ERenegades\u003C/i\u003E.\u201D Max looked to be incapable of speech as the car came to a stop in front of us- either still being affected by the jalape\u00F1os or by Maria\u2019s question.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUh\u2026\u201D Max\u2019s mind seemed to go blank. He looked to me and Alexis. I just shrugged, and out of the corner of my eye I saw Alexis give an almost imperceptible nod. He turned to Maria and shifted on his feet as he stepped up to the curb. \u201CYeah, sure,\u201D he replied, watching the street. Despite the coastal setting, the air was crisp and cool. Alexis gave an almost silent squeal- similar to the noise you hear whenever someone says, \u201CYou like someone,\u201D in high school.

Then, into the underpass, the light can mess with your eyes a bit, but it ends fast. Going through 4, keep the throttle planted- flying up to brake for Turn 5. Don\u2019t slow down too hard, but snap back and sacrifice the exit to get the chicane right. It\u2019s almost a carbon-copy of the Temple- mount the curbs and fly through. Attack the curbing to get a good run down the straight into the Turn 9 hairpin. You can take Turns 10 and 11 flat-out\u2026 We think. The car\u2019s going to get really light on the direction change, but don\u2019t let the car get the best of you. Worst-case, you get a tank slapper and get onto the runoff. You go up a tiny hill, and the next turn is 12- a real pain. The corner is kind of like a hairpin, but it\u2019s got a kink right after. Don\u2019t take the curbing in 13 but you can take a little bit in 12.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFly into 14 at max speed, and run over the curbing to get max speed. DRS right on exit as you start heading uphill just a little bit- really high speeds in 15 and 16. Huge hill in the middle of 16- the cars are going to bottom out, but not enough to do real damage to the floor. Brake hard for 17 to make 18 and 19. The car can definitely take on the curbing at low speeds, so get right on top of them in the technical section.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTight apex at 22 before the downhill Turn 23 and 24. On 24\u2019s exit, you get DRS again on the second-longest straight. Walls right next to the track, but it\u2019s wide enough to not be a problem. Then over the bridge, you\u2019ve got to be brave on the Turn 25 braking zone. Get on the curbing around the stands, and then don\u2019t lose the traction.\u201D The sim passed the start/finish line, and went dark. \u201CSound good?\u201D We nodded and Claire unplugged her laptop- sitting down next to me, across from Max. Andy stood up to start talking about the car setup and the car design for the race.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThis week, we experimented around with a more open setup in terms of aerodynamics.

So, of course, we did. You shouldn\u2019t feel too much loss of downforce, but don\u2019t be surprised if the car catches you out just a bit.\u201D Claire looked like she was trying to focus, but couldn\u2019t handle it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CExcuse me,\u201D She whispered as she picked up her laptop and papers. She quickly wiped her eye before opening the sliding glass door- closing it with such a force that the fogged glass cracked with a loud slam.

Max sighed and closed his eyes- resting in the back of the chair. About five minutes later, Andy popped his head in.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHey guys, Claire\u2019s not feeling too good.

I planned to get here on-time, I promise.\u201D Alexis smirked before grabbing his shirt and turning him- looking at a spot around his cheek and grinning. \u201CHey!\u201D Max tried to wriggle his way out, but I looked. There was a faint red outline that looked suspiciously like lipstick. I chuckled and Max broke away- whirling around. I backed off and laughed while taking a defensive stance in case he threw punches. Just then, someone got up behind Max and covered his eyes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Ci\u003EHola, \u003C/i\u003EMax,\u201D Maria said with a smile as Max turned around and gave her a kiss.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHey babe,\u201D He smirked as they parted. \u201CYou were right, the taxi\u2019s faster.\u201D He wrapped his arm around her shoulder as we walked out to a grassy hill next to the track.

We all sat down on a park bench and I looked out at the track. The officials hadn\u2019t allowed \u003Ci\u003Eanything\u003C/i\u003E out on track yet- no recon vehicles, no safety crews- no-one could even \u003Ci\u003Ewalk\u003C/i\u003E on the track yet. It bugged me to no end. I walked up to the fence and sighed at the perfectly smooth surface. I felt Max walk up behind me.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt looks so perfect,\u201D I whispered, staring at the Turn 10 and 11 section. \u201CSo grippy and smooth\u2026 I wish we could get some laps in- just get a feel for it, you know?\u201D Max nodded and seemed to be studying the track for a moment or two.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHow fast do you think we can go,\u201D Max asked in an equally quiet whisper. \u201COne-forty? Two-flat? I\u2019d say under two-ten for sure.\u201D I nodded.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CForty or fifty. All depends on that technical section, I\u2019d say. Turn one\u2019s going to be awful- downhill, off-camber\u2026\u201D We talked for a few more moments, and watched while planes and birds flew overhead. I felt a buzz in my pocket, and pulled out my phone to check the message. \u201CHey, Andy just texted- we\u2019ve got to head to the garage and suit up.\u201D Those two hours had gone by fast, and we rushed back to the garage. As Max and I slipped on the firesuit, Maria pulled up a chair in the garage. The garage was set up in a standard way, except for a large blue tarp covering where the cars would normally be. The garage was empty (Except for Maria and Alexis), and I got on my hands and knees to get a peek under the tarp to see my car.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COooh gosh,\u201D I sighed- getting up and putting the tarp back. \u201CThat\u2019s quite possibly the best livery we\u2019ve ever had,\u201D I said- sitting at the telemetry desk. Max, with a raised eyebrow, went over to his car and tried to look under. However, just as he pulled up the sheet just a little bit, Claire burst in and shouted, \u201CHey!\u201D Max turned.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat?!\u201D He extended his hands out like he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong- resting on his knees as Claire snapped the tarp back down into place.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CQuit,\u201D She snapped- throwing as much hatred as she could into the single word. Max looked like he was about to protest, but the death glare made him kind of shrink back. Max sighed and got up as Claire went over to her laptop.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CClaire, I\u2019m sorry for being late this morning,\u201D he said, as Claire turned. \u201CIt was extremely rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional. I apologize.\u201D Claire looked surprised, and Max coughed a little bit before going on. \u201CAlso, I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you in any way. It wasn\u2019t my intention at all. I promise that from now, I\u2019ll keep my personal life out of my driving.\u201D He extended a hand. \u201CDeal?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUh\u2026 sure,\u201D she replied, shaking Max\u2019s hand. \u201CI apologize for storming out of the briefing. It was childish, stupid, and idiotic. I hope that this doesn\u2019t affect our relationship.\u201D She turned and saw Maria, before walking over. Max looked like he was bracing for an explosion as Claire went over. \u201CHi there,\u201D she said as Maria stood up. \u201CI\u2019m Claire- Max\u2019s engineer. You must be Maria, I\u2019ve heard so much already.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAh, so you\u2019re Claire!

It\u2019s probably the best seat in the house if I\u2019m honest with you.\u201D Maria smiled and nodded.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI hope so,\u201D She said- watching as the rest of the team started to file in. \u201CMax promised that it would be a great race.\u201D Andy came in and closed up the garage door- whistling sharply for attention.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright, listen up!\u201D The call made everyone look up from their job. \u201CPractice starts in \u003Ci\u003E15 minutes\u003C/i\u003E, so let\u2019s get set. Go ahead and uncover the cars and let\u2019s get started.\u201D The team got all set up around the car, and Max and I got in front of the cars. In unison, Andy and Claire pulled the dark blue tarp off the cars.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I was stunned as I saw the beautiful livery for the first time in full. The cars body was a wonderful midnight blue, which glowed in the spotlights above us. On the shark fin, a pearly white paint gleamed- light reflecting off the bright, almost Crome finish. My number was the same midnight blue as the rest of the car, which stood out boldly and sharp against the fin.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201D Max whispered as he rubbed his number 33 softly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSpent a full week working on it,\u201D Andy said, smiling admiringly at the cars. \u201CWe were thinking about a throwback livery, but with 500 coming up next season, we decided to leave it for Basil onward. You\u2019ll take the classic from Basil through to next season to OTech\u2019s 50th season in K1. I\u2019m thinking maybe running the full classic in practice only, but that\u2019s for Matty to decide.\u201D Max turned, and Andy sighed- holding up a photo and handing it to Max. He looked for a few moments- in absolute awe at the picture in front of him.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHoly crud,\u201D Max sighed, running his fingers over the paper. I went over to take my own look. The car was a light sky blue, with white accents that rendered it near-invisible on the white background. I noticed that the rear of the car and the front wing was marked out with scribbles and notes as Andy dealt with the rule change proposals. Near the edge of the shark fin (which was basically just a dashed line with various design proposals), there was a yellow number 50- with Golden SL/FR flaps on the barge-boards.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNot too shabby,\u201D I said, nodding at the picture. I was about to ask what our design was going to be, but my watch went off. 5 minutes until practice. The team got the tires onto the car, and everything was set. \u201CWell, that was fun and all,\u201D I sighed. \u201CBut it\u2019s go-time.\u201D I put on the gloves and got up into the car- laying down in the cockpit and getting set up. \u201CI\u2019d really like to be the first one out,\u201D I told Andy over the radio as the timer ticked down. \u201CJust saying.\u201D The doors opened up and I got set down while Andy waited out at the entrance to give me the go command.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Finally, I got out, and went down the pit lane to the end of the line. The lights were pure red, and I stopped where I was- waiting for the timer to tick down. The engine hummed, and my radio crackled to life with a chuckle. \u201CLook behind you,\u201D Max laughed from behind me. I checked my mirror and couldn\u2019t help but laugh as I saw the train of cars behind us. Everyone wanted to get out on the new track, as seen by all 20 cars out in the pit lane waiting for the session to start. I chuckled as the lights went green and I peeled out of the pit lane.

After victory in Baskay, Max Kerman and OTech are looking to start where they left off- on top. However, after a blistering qualifying lap yesterday, fellow OTech driver Jebediah is looking to end those chances. As the stars of K1- and the world- prepare for the start of this race, so do we. This incredible 3.7-kilometer circuit has seen the lap-times go from fast to even faster, and now it\u2019s time for the start. So, as the teams get ready for the start, we ask you to sit back, relax, and enjoy!

There was barely a cloud in the sky, and I looked around at the teams all getting set up with various reporters around the place. I walked to the car and talked with Andy for a few moments before the national anthem started playing. As it finished with a little bounce, fighter jets blasted overhead- shrieking through the sky with blue, yellow, and white smoke. The crowd roared with approval, and the cameras clicked and rustled as we got prepared for the start of the race. I could feel the anticipation in the air- everyone waiting to see the cars out on track again after the impossibly long summer break. Max and Claire were talking about something over in their second-place grid slot, and I walked up to Andy.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnything I should know about,\u201D I asked, sipping water.

Just before I put it on, I heard Alexis shout, \u201CGood luck,\u201D making me smile and wave back before stepping up into the car. The car was quiet as the team worked on last-minute checks- monitoring telemetry and tire pressures before I got buckled in.

Finally, we were released onto the formation lap, and I leaped out of my spot. The rears gripped into the track, and I got a perfect launch on the run down to Turn 1. The crowd roared as we drove past, and I tried to keep my focus. I weaved down the straight to get some heat up, and went up through the gears to save the engine wear.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I went down to Turn 1 and darted to the inside- laying down a rubber stripe on the track right next to the grass. I opened up the visor just a bit and got hit by a wall of cold air. I started going through a mental pre-race warmup throughout the lap- waving my hands inside the cockpit and weaving around. After my warmup, the car dropped through 23 before leveling out in 24. I watched the track ahead of me and dove into the final turn at max speed- testing the limit of the tires. I went into Launch mode and waited in my grid spot. The rest of the field pulled in behind me.

There was a tiny puff of smoke as the wheels spun just a bit, but I kept the car under control as I got away fairly clean. Max was getting a good launch, and I cut down to cover the inside down into Turn 1. He tried to look around the outside, but slotted in before we started going through the fade. I went into Turn 1 at maximum speed, and felt the car bounce over the track before 2. I heard a shout from the crowd as we passed, but I ignored them- flying over the curb at Turn 2. The car felt light as I went over the crest, but stayed planted to the ground on corner exit and on the run down the hill. Max was right in line with me, and we both stayed right with each other through Turn 3. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I flew into the tunnel and through Turn 4- wiggling the car a bit as the rear lost grip on the tarmac. The car gripped amazingly into Turn 5, and I went just a little wide over the white line before cutting down. We went through the chicane, and Max was still right on top of me down the straight to Turn 9. Max darted to the inside, and I dove down to block off the attack. He feinted left before going back to the right- getting up my inside. I squeezed him all the way down right next to the grass, and the crowd roared. I looked in my mirror and saw a Monster fast approaching on my outside, and I went up the track to give Max space as we broke for the hairpin. The Monster behind us tried to look up my inside, but was too far back as we pulled around the apex.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max was through up the inside, but I held behind him through the quick Turns 10 and 11. The tires were on the absolute limit of grip in the mid-corner, and we both seemed to scream through the turn. Max got a stellar run over the Turn 12 apex, which sent him flying away from me. I got up just a little bit out of Turn 14, and used the slipstream to get right up close to him. He went over the grass just a little bit in Turn 15, and I followed- spitting up a couple blades with a puff of dust. The cars bottomed out at the bottom of the hill, but I kept the car together as we crested over the top of the hill. The car got light before I hit the brakes- the tires regaining the grip as I slowed right behind Max. We got down to a near-crawl as we drove over the tight double-apexes of Turns 17 and 18. The crowd roared as we went through the stadium that surrounded us on both sides. The right rear slid over the Turn 21 hairpin\u2019s curb, and I saw Max struggle to put down the power. I tried to catch up, but I had to spend the time re-connecting the car- leaving us about level where we were. We went down a small hill before braking again for Turn 22- a tight 90\u00BA right-hander. We flew down the Turn 23 hill and Max\u2019s car sparked on the ground as we went down the straight. Micheal was still hovering at around a second back- looking anxious as we fought.

I held in the slipstream down the long straight- keeping within the little window and closing in. I darted to the inside of Max and he came down to block- making me go up the track to attempt a move around the outside. I got right next to him into Turn 1, and out broke him into 2. I swooped around the outside and ran clean over the curbing- keeping the car under control without a lockup. The crowd roared as we passed, but Micheal was still right in our mirrors. We blasted down the hill at maximum speed down into Turn 3- the car throwing sparks into the air as it bottomed out. Max looked up my inside, but I dove onto the curb. The car bounced a little bit as I sliced him off, and we flew out of the turn. We went under the tunnel and Micheal tried a run up the inside of Max- getting his nose in through Turn 4.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max gave space on the exit, but Micheal locked up into 5- running into the side of Max with a puff of smoke. A chunk of debris blasted up into the air with a spark as Micheal\u2019s car hit the left-rear and Max flew wide with a hop, while the Monster spun off the track backward in a cloud of smoke. Max went way off track but just got back before the chicane. His line was heavily compromised entering the corner, and I took advantage. The left sidepod had a nasty mark on it, with a huge scrape along the back edge. The tire markings were faded on the left-rear, and the entire left-rear looked pretty scuffed up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CMax has some damage on the left-rear,\u201D I said into the radio as I got onto the straight. \u201CSL/FR flap might have some damage- something flew up when they hit.

The car felt like it was on rails, and I could throw it into the corners like the car was glued to the ground. The rears stayed planted in Turns 10 and 11, despite me not slowing down.

The speed climbed- 150. 160. 170. 180. 190. We flew into Turn 1 and flowed straight into 2- Max staying right behind me on exit. We stayed that way for the next 7 laps- Max right behind me until Lap 9, when I pulled in for my pit stop. I broke hard for the pit entry, and just managed to slow it down for the speed limiter. I drove past the rows of pit boxes, and went around the pit hairpin before heading to the OTech box. The team was perfectly on cue, and I was lifted up the millisecond I stopped. 4 tires on, 4 off- Fuel in. We waited for the 10-second timer to count down, and I blasted out of the stall in a trail of smoke. Louie blazed past on the track, and I got out of the pit lane- accelerating up to speed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGreat stop, guys,\u201D I said before braking for Turn 1- getting behind the black Monster and applying the pressure into 2. The cold tires made me skitter a bit into the corner, but I was able to keep in through the apex and get right on top of the car- scooting past up the inside of Turn 3. I flew into every corner and braking zone- trying to make sure Max didn\u2019t complete the over-cut to perfection. As I came through Turn 22, Max had just pulled into the pit lane and I pushed as hard as I could. The aero shoved the car down into the ground and I pushed like crazy- sparks flying off the rear in a beautiful trail. The car turned into the final corner with amazing ease while the crowd roared as I passed. Max had just gotten out of the pit lane, and I got right along-side him down the straight. As soon as the white line ended, Max started pushing me up the track- forcing me farther up the line as we neared Turn 1. I hit the brakes hard and switched over to the inside- sticking my nose in and forcing Max a little bit wide on the apex of the corner. I went for the gap and stormed up the inside into Turn 2- keeping ahead by a slim margin. I went down the hill to Turn 3, and Andy\u2019s voice came over the radio.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb, be careful,\u201D He warned as I went over the apex. \u201CWe don\u2019t want contact here- stay calm.\u201D I almost went wide over the exit curbing and popped over the grass- sending a tiny puff of brown dust into the air as Max closed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CDon\u2019t talk,\u201D I said before heading under the bridges. \u201CI almost wrecked in Turn 3 right there- no talking in the corners.\u201D There was silence from the other end and I kept on-track through Turn 4 with Max hanging with me. He gained a ton through Turn 5, and I was put under a ton of pressure in the chicane. With the slipstream down the straight, Max gained a ton. I went up into Rich mixture to defend, but there was no chance as he closed. I darted inside to defend and he followed me down almost to the grass before I swept up to get a run into the corner. I thought he was going to follow me, but Max stayed right on the track\u2019s border and shot up my inside. The outside car wavered with the intense braking and he flew up the track- almost hitting me as I avoided. I got back up the inside through 9, but he was along my left- the inside for Turn 10. I was grinning beneath my helmet as we dueled- Left and right practically glued together through the flat-out turns. Max got past in the tight Turn 12. I tried to catch up through the high-speed Turn 14 and down the back straight- DRS helping me get a run. I flew through 15 and 16 practically on the tail of Max as we blasted under the trees and past the fans with dirt getting thrown up from us being so close to the edge of the track.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0We went up the hill and I tried to get a hole into Turn 17, but the car felt too light and I didn\u2019t want to risk a spin. Max and I drove over a couple skid marks from past incidents (Practice likely) and went through the tight turns of the Stadium Section. I was still on top of him throughout the collection of corners, and rumbled over the curbing out of Turn 21. I kept up the pressure through 22, and the cars sparked as we dropped on the ground out of 24. I opened up DRS and darted to the inside down the straight. The car flew past Max on the inside of the track, and I managed to get it slowed down in time for the apex of Turn 25.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max tried to cut back to the inside, but I was there on the apex- defending the line to perfection. He had DRS down the front-straight again, though, and I was helpless as he flew past around the outside down the hill to Turn 1. The crowd was loving the fight, and yelled as we passed. I slotted into line with Max through the double-apex, and we raced through the turn. I could feel the energy as the laps ticked down.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I tried an attack throughout the lap- the chicane, the Stadium- everywhere. I put the pressure on Max into every braking zone and every apex on the track; trying to force a mistake. On Lap 15- 4 to go- we encountered traffic in the worst possible spot- the Stadium.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0 \u201CLap cars ahead,\u201D Andy called out to me in Turn 14 as I opened up DRS. The engine yelled as I gained the speed up the hill- sparking off the dip at over 160 miles per hour on the rubber tire tracks. I was about to cut to the inside, but saw a bright red car in the way. I had to dart back to behind Max before I hit, and we both drive around the outside in Turn 17 and 18.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat was close,\u201D I said as we went through 20 and 21. \u201CThat hill\u2019s just blind heading up; I almost ran right into the back of that car. Blue flags or something.\u201D Max was stuck behind a LakeFront through the tight hairpins, and I managed to close in to right on his diffuser before the slow car moved out of the way. Max waved his arm out at the orange and white car- expressing his anger as we got past.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0This little slow-down allowed me to resume the attack on Max throughout the next couple of laps. I was able to put the pressure on Max throughout the laps, and with just 2 to go, I was right there. I got in the slipstream down into Turn 1, and tried to dart outside. Max saw the move just as I made it, and closed the door into the braking zone. I shook my head and bared down. The cars dropped down the hill before lifting up, and I could feel the forces on my body as we went up and down. Max got a little bit of wheelspin on the exit, and I was right on top of him down the straight. I almost hit the diffuser, but we avoided contact.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I made a little hole up the inside into Turn 3, but Max didn\u2019t leave enough room for me to get there. Instead, we both missed the apex and backed each other up before I faked a move right. Max took the bait and blocked, before I swung around to the left. Max wasn\u2019t able to get there in time, and we went side-by-side through Turns 4 and 5. The crowd was loving it, and Max got by in Turn 6 at the chicane. I was still there in Turn 7, and we ended up about equal out of 8- going down the straight at max speed. Max had DRS but I had the better run out of the turn, and we were level down the entirety of the straight. I tried to get the braking down into Turn 9, but accidentally out-broke myself and ran a bit wide- allowing Max to get a window up the inside. I defended in Turn 10, but he swept up the inside through the high-speed Turn 11. I let him go and didn\u2019t risk a crash into Turn 12, but I was right back on top of him down the backstraight- aided by DRS and slipstream. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I cut inside but I did it too late as Max went into Turn 15 and 16, and I had to wait up the hill. We didn\u2019t dare risk anything too crazy as we went into Turns 17 or 18, and the circuit was too tight for a move in 19, 20, or 21. The crowd roared as we passed by them, and I could feel the energy with each passing second. I darted inside down the run to Turn 22 and got by clean around the inside, but Max blasted past on the straight with the help of some DRS. I tried an attack into Turn 25 but locked up just a bit- keeping me behind before the apex. We crossed the finish line to start the final lap.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAndy, don\u2019t talk,\u201D I asked as politely as I could as we blazed down the straight. I had DRS and slipstream down the straight, and Max started chasing me up the track to the left. By the braking zone, we had apparently decided the racing line didn\u2019t exist as we were practically on the grass. I slammed the brakes early, and Max flew past me on the inside with a massive lockup that obscured the racing line. The apex was covered in smoke, and I had to trust myself to turn in at the right moment. I flew through the massive cloud and ran over the curbing- whips of smoke trailing off the wings and wheels in a beautiful loop off the rear end of the car. I flew out of the corner and went into Turn 2- leaving Max high and dry on the outside into the tight hairpin-like corner. I simply held my line around the corner, and left Max to run himself wide on corner exit and into the runoff before turning back down behind me.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Max fought hard behind me, but I made the rear as wide as possible through Turns 4 and 5- stopping any kind of attack in the sweeping corners. Max flew wide on the exit of 5 and used the momentum to get up my inside into 6. He locked up the right-front (again), and we both missed the apex. I turned in a little too early and we collided. A tiny puff of smoke popped up into the air as the tires hit and a bang shook the entire car. The Shark Fin shook from the contact and we both tried to get each other through 7- neither wanting to give in. The crowd roared while we passed them down the 8-9 straight while we dueled for the lead. Max had DRS but had a horrible run out of 8, and only just managed to keep the hole open for Turn 9. I swung around the outside of the corner and managed to get a wheel past before Turn 10, and swooped past Max in the high-speed turn. He tried to lunge up the inside through 11, but I was far enough ahead that the challenge wasn\u2019t effective.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0I went into Turn 12 with Max right behind, and lost a little bit of time off of some nasty wheelspin off the curbing. Max caught up and I felt a bump from behind before the car lifted up a little bit. The engine yelped like a dog and I had to wheel the car around- managing the torque to keep it from spinning around. In my mirror, I saw Max\u2019s nose had a little bit of damage on the frontal intake without any real damage to the front wing assembly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0We went through Turn 14 and Max tried a move with DRS, but couldn\u2019t manage a look into Turns 15, 16, or 17. My heart was racing as we flew into the Stadium for the final time. The crowd screamed and yelled while Max looked everywhere- going as far as diving up the inside of Turn 20. We made more contact and the car jumped up into the air with a loud smash. I looked and saw a piece of aerodynamic sidepod fall down to the ground, while Max had a nasty black scuff on his car and a chunk of bargeboard missing from the right front.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI think I have left-side damage,\u201D I said as we flew down the hill out of Turn 24. \u201CI think the SL Flap is gone, but I\u2019m feeling okay at the moment.\u201D Max was far behind but was hell-bent on making an overtake- flying through the slipstream. I darted inside and he cut right, trying to sweep around the outside. I held the defensive all the way through the hairpin turn, and Max was stuck behind me on exit. I sighed as he fell back.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0100 meters.

The rest of the cars drove around the track, but we pulled off into the massive runoff space and stopped. I got myself unbuckled and stood up to a roar from the crowd. I got up onto the nose and leaped off the front with another cheer- air horns joining in the mix as the crowd celebrated with me. Max got up and dropped off of his car before running at me. He practically body-slammed me and I started trying to get free before he broke off- laughing under the helmet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat the heck, man,\u201D He grinned as we walked to the cooldown room- waving to the crowd on our way.

I\u2019ve got faith in my team, though, that an incident like last year won\u2019t happen again. Honestly, it was just an accident. Plain and simple.\u201D On the screen that showed the live feed, I saw my car from last year explode in a massive shower of carbon fiber before looping around and slamming into the wall with a cloud of dust. The camera shook from the force of the impact, and I swallowed a little bit. \u201CWe know a lot more about the car and the track this year over last, but it\u2019s still going to fall down to simple practice. We\u2019ve got to get confident in the car, get confident with the track, and just try to build it up all over again.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnd Max, what about you?
