I have tried this multiple times but nothing seemed to work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T23:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I just tried it and I don\u0027t know what\u0027s supposed to happen. On my run the docking ring was so far inside the other ship\u0027s shroud that I couldn\u0027t click on it to undock. The Agena blew up while I was still connected but did not harm my ship. I was able to click on the ring after the parts around it were blown up, de-orbited and landed safely. I didn\u0027t get a success message or a fail message. So what happens if you just go ahead and land?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
