The only one that needs to change any more is the attachNodeDiamterFactor, and that\u0027s only for RO, so that should be handled on RO\u0027s end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@illectro:\u003C/strong\u003E It detects when aerodynamic forces should be enough to start causing parts to tear themselves off, at least sort-of based on real-life data. The problem is that the new joints system uses jointDrives (like KJR did and does) to keep the parts from flexing, but the forces applied by jointDrives don\u0027t count towards the \u0022breakForce\u0022 and \u0022breakTorque\u0022 limits of the joint. So in essence, it\u0027s very hard to get a structural failure to occur due to anything other than a physics glitch as a result. So FAR works around it instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re worried about the strengths being too low, there are configs in FARAeroStress.cfg that can be modified to tweak how much parts can take. As it currently stands, if you get a rocket going at 1500 m/s at 5 km it\u0027ll be fine so long as it stays pointed prograde, though it falls apart if you go off by any significant amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@AndreyATGB: \u003C/strong\u003EI see why the wings and control surfaces aren\u0027t being affected by that setting; I\u0027ll upload a fixed version once I get a chance to look at ayana\u0027s issue. The control surfaces breaking, well, it depends on what forces are being applied to them and what AoA they\u0027re at, since I\u0027ve never seen that happen myself. Usually it takes getting to ~250 m/s before control surfaces start coming off, and that still only happens at full deflection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re concerned that they\u0027re too weak, go into the FARAeroStress.cfg and buff their template up drastically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@theSpeare: \u003C/strong\u003EThose first 3 items... that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-27T15:16:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2014 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"illectro","CreatedById":763,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T15:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to know, I\u0027m about to so something where that might make a difference, I should try and do a before and after comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T15:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExample of what I mean, not on takeoff but I still think it\u0027s too much:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWn_5nTBED0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T15:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExample of what I mean, not on takeoff but I still think it\u0027s too much:\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats pretty awesome right there.
