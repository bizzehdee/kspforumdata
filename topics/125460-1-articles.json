Everyone knows what happens when you are approaching a colony/station with over 100 parts in it; the lag an cpu load is monstrous making the whole thing unplayable IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that got me wondering, and by no means am I hindered by any knowlegde \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E Say I make a ship, find that it is what I want after a few test flights, but it\u0027s 40-50 parts in total which is starting to stress out KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to compile this ship into a 1 piece item that has all the functionality etc, but just one single part? Seeing as we often mirror things like solar panels, struts, landing gear, engines etc; part count will sky-rocket (pun intended). Would these things not combine into a single item with the same attributes?
