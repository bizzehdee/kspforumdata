I have the following circuit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GoH10Da.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GoH10Da.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a begginer in electronics and I coded this in python using a raspberry pi, it counts in binary to 7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works great, there is just some odd thing that makes me curious:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe red LED is much more brighter than the other 2 when counting, and if I happen to touch the red led when the circuit is off (Or even if I hold the positive side out of the breadboard while leaving the negative one going to the resistance and then ground) the led turns on very dimly. I replaced the red one with another and this behavior didn\u0027t occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T05:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPhoto is not clear enough to see what is connected where, so I\u0027ll just give you some generic responses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe red LED shines brighter because its forward voltage is lower than the yellow or the green ones, meaning there is more current flowing through it when using the same value resistors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt lights up when touched because you most likely have some 50/60Hz hum in the circuit that is coming though the power supply. Mains hum is notoriously hard to get rid of, so if that\u0027s the case I wouldn\u0027t even try to do much about it. Why you can do is to try using a different power supply, preferably a battery to see if it fixes the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy it stopped glowing once you replaced it? I don\u0027t know. When you return the glowing one does it shine? If no, I\u0027d say there is some other factor involved (you touching a grounded object like a PC case, central heating radiator...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tigermisu","CreatedById":58477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T05:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe photo is not very clear, but everything is connected to the power source, then a LED, then a 220ohm resistor, then to the -3v part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try and return the glowing one, see if it shines again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T06:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider posting a better picture should help with figuring out what\u0027s wrong by guys over the .net .
