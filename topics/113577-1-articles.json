I can\u0027t seem to get to Pol without burning WAY more DV than I find in the online charts. Like 4k to line up with it even upon approach to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the frustrating thing: I know what I\u0027m doing, sort of. I have Mechjeb, and I\u0027m not afraid to use it. But even with my own knowledge of rendezvous strategy, and using Mechjeb\u0027s \u0022fine tune to 20 KM to target\u0022 etc, etc, etc ....I STILL can\u0027t get lined up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are some good tactics for hitting Jool\u0027s moons, or any kinda thing in that realm?

What\u0027s the most DV efficient way to land on it\u0027s moons?
