It was well before the transition to Steam, but I can not recall exact date. Of course, I can see in my forum profile that I joined these forums in August 2014, though I am sure I acquired an old KSP build well before then directly through Squad (it was early enough that the build I bought entitled me to receiving the Steam version without cost).
