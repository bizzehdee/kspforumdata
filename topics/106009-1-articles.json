To clarify what I want to access; you used too access it by pressing \u0026lt;Delete\u0026gt; making sure \u0022LIN\u0022 was activated down in the left corner. When I do that now I still have the rotational(ROT) controls. I had to remap keys to make it work, but I\u0027d rather have it work as before. Also even if I change \u0022Control from Here\u0022 to another part which would translate in to the controls making different \u0022moves\u0022, but it always does the same \u0022movements\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried restarting the game and all, still doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MODS-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022- Completely revised Input Mapping system.\u0022 in the 1.0 notes at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/336-KSP-1-0-is-Released\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/336-KSP-1-0-is-Released\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this is what\u0027s happened, but seems like a weird change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould appreciate some clarification on this matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
