You have generously included your source code, however, I think I might have better luck figuring it out if I knew the ideas behind the algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from a \u0022clean sheet\u0022, I came up with the following method for aerodynamic modeling :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Game has fixed parts defined ahead of time. This is true both for this game and most games that allow user creations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Each predefined part has a high end aerodynamics solver run on it offline, essentially pre-baking the parts. I\u0027m aware that it\u0027s a huge and complex subject, and accurate solutions are very computationally expensive because essentially you are numerically approximating certain PDEs for thousands of volumetric subunits that represent the air (or fluid) interacting with the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The solver spits out the coefficients of lift and drag for either 6 or 18 possible orientations of the part. (the 6 solution you just solve for the Cd/Cl for each orthogonal direction, the 18 you include the 45 degree angles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Armed with these constants, you raytrace parallel to the vehicles current direction of airflow. These rays hit the parts on the surfaces of the vehicle exposed to airflow, and this lets you determine how much air (or fluid...) each part of the vehicle is actually exposed to. You have a Cd/Cl, so you just apply the corresponding lifts and drags from each part to the rigid body model for the entire vehicle, converting drag that is off of the center of mass to a vector that includes torque when appropriate, and you\u0027re done. KSP seems to treat each individual part as an independent rigid body so in this game you would apply the forces to the individual parts instead. You of course interpolate between the 6 or 18 Cd/Cl values for the angle each part is actually at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the simplest and obvious way to do it I can think. I recall reading somewhere in this very thread that you tried a similar method with poor results, and I\u0027m curious why it didn\u0027t work. My first thought is that perhaps this method is very unstable? Forces on the vehicle change the angle the vehicle is facing, so the next timestep the forces are different and perhaps the vehicle \u0022judders\u0022 around unrealistically?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T03:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo quick unrelated questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1, how can I make a taildragger with FAR?
