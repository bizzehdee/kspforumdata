It is a bit more maneuverable and is stable but extremely touchy without the sas enabled. Removing the reaction wheel in the front has not been tested yet for any adverse effects on maneuverability. The jet may also be naval capable, but not tested. The landing gear layout makes this jet capable of very rough landings, and it takes off the best when you turn on the brakes until the engines are at 120 kn and then release the wheel brakes. The back has also been covered with structural panels to make this airplane more stealthy.
