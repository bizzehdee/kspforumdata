Expecting a fast \u0022No\u0022 here but I could be surprised. I have some free time on my hands and am trying to work on a design for an ultra-heavy B9 rocket/carrier. Difficulty: on my laptop. I got the game files and it runs just like molasses in the winter. I just want to see how the parts would come together. Also, seeing the stats of the different parts (how much electric charge made per sec, fuel capacities, weights, max fuel required) would help greatly. Is there something that can help me or do I just need to wait till I get back to my gaming rig to continue the design process?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T19:52:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheAlmightyOS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T20:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the whole issue there is the game was programmed specifically to let you see that.
