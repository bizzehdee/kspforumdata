I think i have a simple solution to the micromanagment hell Firespitter textureswitching would bring. If I implemented it as-is, everyone would have had to cycle through every single wedge to customize its appearance or turn the structure off, and i\u0027d have to remake \u003Cem\u003Eeverything \u003C/em\u003Eto set it all up in Unity. The more options i make, the more convoluted the tweakable menu would become. If nodes break when you\u0027re building things, you have to start from scratch, reattach the wedges, and customize everything again. It\u0027s a ton of wasted time for the user fluffing around, and a ton of wasted time for me making it work. And if firespitter breaks, US would essentially be unusable as every part would corrupt or disappear from the parts list. So, why not offload the structural coverings to a single, non-essential part? Less work to update, and less pain when it comes to customizing your rocket. And if you don\u0027t want an external structure, don\u0027t use the part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to explain some kind of version earlier on, but i was probably not very clear as I was either tired or drunk, or both. Here\u0027s a second attempt (wrought with spelling mistakes, did this on break at work). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A8ThHsK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022A8ThHsK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will likely make the Science Bay wedge redundant, as the adapter will still have interior walls and surface attachment will be enabled. For example, what would have been a two-high quadcore stack of eight science bays, (10 parts), the new adapter will fill the same role, for three (two quadcores, and an extended adapter). Quad, Hex and Octo cores still work as normal with KAS (attaching wedges on EVA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wedges will no longer dictate the circumference of the stack either, so everything can be cylindrical instead of scalloped. And now that we have an interesting new cross section with the new MK2 parts (and impending MK3), making adapters that match those will be straight forward. And if you\u0027d like a structural covering higher than 4 cores tall, just flip an adapter upside down and have them meet in the middle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only issue i can see, is that you\u0027ll have to open the doors (all at once) to be able to interface with the parts (turning generators on, etc). There are a few ways around this I can think of, including making a Universal Storage toolbar interface that lists all generators on a vessel, and their usage state, runtime estimates, and on\\off switches.

Anywho, hello after several months of nothing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started revising the parts that I know i\u0027m going to keep for US2. For the concept to work they need to expand in the VAB with a right click menu; which essentially boils down to the Firespitter plugin requesting different versions of the model and hiding the unused ones as you cycle through the lengths. To save memory, every variant of these parts has to reference the same texture map; so i need to make sure the base texture map has enough information to serve four models with minimal stretching and UV duplication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cores work pretty well for this, being made to stack seamlessly in the first place.

With the wedges using the same system, a four-stack octo with a full set of wedges on all levels goes from a part count of 36 down to 9.
