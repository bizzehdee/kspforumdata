It carries a lander, for 2 crew members, and a nuclear rocket engine, with enough science to bring home, it would probably get me enough to finish off the tech tree. But, as I set up for aerobraking. and then just as I enter Duna\u0027s sphere of influence, the Periaps changes. From 25 kilometers, to 300 kilometers. So I get ready for a long retrograde burn. I end up running out of fuel in the Crew/service module, and am forced to use the lander to finish. I then undock the lander, at which point I soon discovered that I had run out of monopropelant in both craft, which meant that docking was not an option again. So I went ahead with the landing. This was my first successful attempt at landing on the surface, everything went great, parachutes opened, gear down, coming straight down, then we hit the ground and the lander tipped over, and broke off the lander c4n, and docking port, only getting half the required science of the mission. So I stayed near kerbin for a while, and got 550 science in order to get the really big rocket parts. I then built a new rocket and tried again. This time still had some fuel left and plenty of monopropelant. But as I came down I tried my best to burn off as much speed as possible, but ended up coming in to step, going in a retrograde orbit. The two crew members survived, and the science from duna, was nearly useless since duna has no biomes. So in a last ditch effort to get some science, I took the little fuel and monopropellant and attempted to go to the north pole of the duna. I didn\u0027t make it and the single crew member in the capsule smashed into the surface while waiting for his parachute to fully deploy. Can anyone give me any tips on how to better complete this mission before I try again. I would like to have the crew return. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you very much.

It is likely that if you waited to change your periapsis until you were close, you could have wasted fuel. It is also worth noting that there are multiple ways of changing your trajectory when entering a sphere of influence. Burning to the Radial In vector will use far less fuel to change you periapsis than will a retrograde burn. Although it is worth noting, that it seems likely that if you changed your velocity by a simple retrograde burn, and you expended the fuel in your craft, you probably didn\u0027t have enough to return in that craft to begin with. \u003C/em\u003EEDIT: Previous poster edited before I hit send. This information is now redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as your space navigation woes are concerned, I am assuming that you are not using any sort of Delta-V budget calculations, whether they be a mod, or manual calculations. I assume this because you have not made mention of any expected fuel expenditure at an earlier point in the mission, and felt until your unexpected trajectory, that everything was going to plan. As far as your landing is concerned, despite my best calculations, I can be pretty terrible at actually piloting landings, so I can not help you there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I am sure others will suggest, two mods that I have seen recommended, and use myself are Kerbal Alarm Clock, which can aid in SOI changes, among other things, and Kerbal Engineer, which will assist in planning your fuel and velocity requirements with reasonable accuracy.
