I expected a 3-4\u0022 die-cast model, Instead i got a 12\u0022 set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my question is, do you think I should keep this intact and un-opened?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought process, is that now the shuttle has been cancelled, Memorabilia of it will start becoming more rare. And given its iconic status, i think in 40 years, this Un-Opened toy could be worth a lot of money if its still in mint condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/83St4erl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002283St4erl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T11:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen it.
