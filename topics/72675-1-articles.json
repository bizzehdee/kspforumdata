ECLSS is still on hiatus. There have not been fixes, so it\u0027s probably best to use TAC in the interim; for the record, however, I have yet to personally encounter a bug with ECLSS.

May have been another mod conflict causing the UI lockups.. though I did some extensive trouble shooting back when I was having the problems. But its been a few months, so maybe it\u0027ll work now. Yea.. just because of Universal Storage am I even considering switching back to life support. Beautiful parts that I must find a use for.
