Although so far, KSP versions have come up and relegated each one to the scrap heap before I\u0027d actually got there ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) My 0.90 round lasted about 12 weeks before I finally filled out the tech tree and called it quits (10% science return, many science mods...).\n\nMy advice is to initially examine your mod loadout, and the things you actually *did* last time you played. I find it very easy to pick up a heavyweight mod because it *looks great*, and then not use it at all because I don\u0027t actually have any interest in what it *does* ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) If you\u0027re bailing out often, it\u0027s worth shuffling around and bringing in more of the things you do like, while abandoning the things you never actually used - and of course, check whether there\u0027s things you\u0027ve never *tried* doing.\n\nWhen you\u0027ve done that, it\u0027s important to determine your goal. It\u0027s easy to end up thrashing around aimlessly and giving up when you don\u0027t know what you were aiming for in the first place! Goals might be;\n\n- Return a surface sample from every landable body.\n\n- Return a surface sample from every biome of every landable body (best accompanied with very low science gain, and possibly some high tech engines for Eve)\n\n- Create a permanent surface base on every landable body (best accompanied by a life support mod)\n\n- Visit all bodies with an SSTO.\n\n- Max the tech tree (recommend very low science gain to make this one last)\n\n- Collect 1 million units of Karbonite in an orbital station around Kerbin.\n\n- Give Kerbin 5 new moons from class A-E asteroids.\n\n- Accomplish a grand tour.\n\n- Transport 100 colonists to Laythe and/or Duna.\n\n...I\u0027m sure this forum can supply more ideas ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAdding rules and restrictions can, perhaps counter-intuitively, help a lot too. E.g...\n\n- No manned landings without a manned orbital mission, and probe landing mission first.\n\n- No more than one probe lander on any given body. Subsequent missions must take a crew.\n\n- No nervas (makes you really rethink your designs for efficiency!)\n\n- No kerbal left behind!\n\n- If it would fit inside a cargo bay, it goes to orbit in an SSTO.\n\n- Never use the same vessel twice. Always design something new and shiny for the mission!\n\n- Always take a rover, just in case.\n\n- Accept every contract, unless blatantly impossible.\n\n...etc.\n\nThat, and... take breaks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s totally fine to wander off from KSP sometimes and play other things. In fact this may be a great time to do it - 1.0 doesn\u0027t feel so far away, and a few weeks break may bring you back with renewed vigor once it hits. Personally, I\u0027m into Cities Skylines at the mo, but I know full well I\u0027ll swing back to KSP at some point ^^"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T18:37:33Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never finished a game of KSP, hope I never do.

It\u0027s a combination of the terrible game balance in stock (ridiculous building limitations and upgrade costs, nonsense contracts, poor part placement in tech tree, among other things) making stock unplayable for me, and my favorite rebalance (SETI) being in a fluid state of development so I end up restarting frequently with the updates.\n\nOnce things stabilize after 1.0 (I still hate calling it that, realistically it\u0027s more like 0.27), I would like to sit down and do a proper career, there\u0027s some neat contract packs available now that give something to do in career beyond the tech tree before it just becomes a sandbox."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T19:26:51Z","Content":"End?

The game\u0027s only psychological reward system is unlocking the tech tree. Most of us play on for other reasons, and some even make the claim that that is when the game begins---which I think is wrong just from the standpoint of \u0022reward.\u0022 You\u0027d then have to set your own reward, unprompted (or tracked) by the game to \u0022get all science in the Kerbol system\u0022 or something.

KSP, unlike many games gets easier, not harder as you play. Landing on the Mun with part count/mass/cost constraints is considerably harder than landing on the Mun after you have unlocked the tech tree. The only possibility of \u0022failure\u0022 in a KSP career is in the very early game, in fact.

Mars is more difficult than the Moon only because of human issues (life support) or time delay (probes).

Sure, you can grind your way into having all the funds and science to go anywhere in the Kerbolar system through some non-immersive contracts, but why should you when there\u0027s no incentive to explore apart from \u0022haven\u0027t been to Dres yet, I should prolly plant a flag there\u0022. Why visit duna when it\u0027s pretty much like the Mun with an atmosphere a bit further away from Kerbin? In my opinion this is the most important thing lacking in KSP, and in all honesty this should\u0027ve have been addressed long before adding KSC building upgrades/kersplosions/MK3updates/Kerbal skills/cinematic clouds and definitely the barn. \n\nMaybe things will change slightly with ISRU, however, without any reason to stay longer on a planet (e.g. exploration, actual science, construction or other incentives), I\u0027m afraid career mode will almost be as boring as it is now.\n\nEDIT: In all honesty, I was looking forward to beta so we could advise Squad how to optimise career and make it more immersive/interesting.
