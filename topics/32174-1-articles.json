You have to set the other ship as a target (you can do that in map view). Then, make sure your nav ball is in Target mode, point your ship towards the yellow retrograde marker, and burn until the velocity is 0.0m/s. This is rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you can proceed with docking by just pointing both ships in the appropriate direction, switching on ASAS on both ships, and just translate towards the target with IJKLHN (don\u0027t use the WASD keys).
