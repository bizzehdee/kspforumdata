I have solar panels, rechargeable batteries etc and have never had this problem. The only mod I have is MechJeb 2.0. Electricty does regenerate, but it is is lost very quickly, I have disabled SAS and none of my science equipment is doing anything. Can anyone help?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T05:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMJ needs electrical power as well.
