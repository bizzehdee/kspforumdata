I believe that the hardest thing he has to do is to find just the right balance between fun and complexity. If he manages to succeed in that in my opinion he will turn KSPI from a complex and (new)user unfriendly mod which was difficult to coexist with other mods, to a fun and versatile one, trading complexity for gameplay depth. But the biggest trap here is realism. It is great to have things like reactors, engines and refineries work like their real life counterparts (or like we\u0027d expect them to) with the right resources and chemistry but only up to the point that all this is keeps being fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll make a simplified example. Let\u0027s say you want to extract Hydrogen from water and instead of just clicking \u0022start\u0022 and the refinery pumps water in and fills a tank with hydrogen, you have to turn the refinery on, then turn pumps on, then start electrolysis, then start the filter and so on. The first is realistic enough and fun, the second although it is super realistic and maybe makes you feel like an astronaut in Europa the first time you do that, it will soon become a chore and you won\u0027t even read the buttons after the third or forth time, just mindlessly click them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said more or less the only thing I didn\u0027t like is the removal of thorium. Thorium\u0027s molten salt reactor is probably the actual next step after enriched uranium\u0027s pressurized water reactor, which can even reprocess the waste fuel from the later one just like in the original KSPI. You could make it so the only thing you have to do is change the fuel type after some waste has produced (I know that this couldn\u0027t happen in the same reactor in real life but it is realism vs fun again, maybe Kerbals managed to put both of them in the same part!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that you can\u0027t make everyone happy so good luck again and thank you for not letting this great mod die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also by no means I don\u0027t try to degrade \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/63336-Fractal_UK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s work on the original KSP Interstellar mod.

I get that extra models cause memory issues, but having a different type of reactor for small sizes does add an extra touch of the future-realism KSPI is known for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
