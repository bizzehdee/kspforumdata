Due to what I call \u0022accidental high-energy re-docking\u0022 my Duna transfer ship Inspiration was practically destroyed, with the crew of 6 being stranded in their descent vehicle without parachutes and no way to get home or otherwise go anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened is that after I transferred the crew into the descent vehicle and undocked from the main ship, I accidentally hit the full throttle button before I would get any separation via RCS. So my descent vehicle slammed back into my ship and what followed was essentially as if the descent vehicle was purposely seeking out all the parts of my transfer ship that could have enabled the kerbals to be saved. It quite literally slammed into the transfer vehicle (causing the whole craft to spin) and started flying back towards the engine section taking every radiator and solar panel with it, along with the remaining half of the life support supplies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was quite funny, because the very high spin coupled with some other bits of debris made it so not a single panel or radiator survived, despite being on opposite sides of the ship. The last panel on the opposite side of where the descent vehicle started actually got slammed into it at the last second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd alas, because the ship lost its panels, its nuclear reactor is thus doomed to explode and likely take most of the rest of the ship with it. Meanwhile, the descent vehicle along with the crew are in an uncontrollable tumble, as its power supply was destroyed among other things. Not even my level 2 pilot \u002B RCS was able to actually stabilize it. The collision produced one heck of a debris field though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, long story short, I didn\u0027t go to Duna today \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I probably won\u0027t attempt to go again on this save, as I\u0027ve been itching to actually play career mode using some new mods I\u0027ve been looking at.
