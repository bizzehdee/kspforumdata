Also the observation that SRBs were tweaked to compensate.\n\nSo I figured this meant that solids had gotten (minorly?) nerfed.

BUFFED??\n\nRan off and tested a Kickback-heavy lifter with a station design that it has in the past been JUST BARELY capable of putting in orbit if I flew the launch trajectory \\*just right\\*. (As in: 400 tons on the pad, but with maybe a couple hundred units of LF/O left in the tanks after orbit-circ into a 75x75km orbit.)\n\nI was annoyed with myself for screwing up my test, as I really botched up the ascent and figured it would not make orbit at all and I\u0027d learn nothing. But...flew it at a slightly LOWER liquid-engine throttle on ascent than I\u0027m accustomed to, and wound up in a ~70x85km orbit with tanks still carrying something like 800-900 units of LF/O! OMG! If I tweak the design just a bit, and actually fly the ascent COMPETENTLY, I might even be able to send it on to Mun or Minmus without the hassle of a refueling run first! Woot!\n\nSo... what gives?

Mk1 cockpit, Mk16 parachute, and flea booster.\n\nASL thrust\n\n1.02: 179.2\n\n1.03: 162.9\n\nVac thrust\n\n1.02: 192\n\n1.03: 192\n\nSo they cut the thrust a little at sea level but kept it the same in vacuum.\n\nISP\n\n1.02: 140-150\n\n1.03: 140-165\n\nThey gave it a little better ISP in vacuum.\n\nFuel:\n\n1.02: 100\n\n1.03: 140\n\nWow, 40% more fuel. And with better ISP, too. It burned for substantially longer when I tested them.\n\nTest flights, straight up from the launch pad with SAS set at the default \u0022hold rotation\u0022 setting\n\n1.02: 4500 meters apogee.\n\n1.03: 9657 meters apogee.\n\nHuge difference. Lower drag and more fuel.\n\nSo what if I cut the fuel back a little? I went back to 1.03 and I only gave it 98 fuel (I couldn\u0027t tweak it to 100 exactly). How far up did it go? 6100 meters.\n\nSo with the same fuel, it went about 20% farther up.

Hope at least that behavior went the way of the dodo in 1.0.3, because it was really quite annoying.\n\nI just did a very simple test. I put a 2.5m controller on top of one of the \u00221/2 orange\u0022 2.5m fuel tanks and stuck a mainsail at the bottom. SAS on, engines 100% throttle, burn until no more fuel. It got red hot but didn\u0027t explode, and when I left the atmosphere (coasting) I had an apoapsis of 516680 meters. It started tumbling in the upper atmosphere, after I ran out of fuel.\n\nThen I did the exact same thing except I had the 2.5m nose cone on top. It got red hotter, but still didn\u0027t explode. Apoapsis of 854790 meters. There was just a little bit of tumbling, but it never flipped sideways like the first one did. So under this somewhat extreme test, the nose cone did improve the performance of the rocket.\n\nHow much of the improvement was due to drag when it was still burning fuel and how much was due to the lack of tumbling? I wasn\u0027t sure. So I tried again.\n\nSame two rockets, except I added a 2.5m monoprop tank just above the fuel tank, and stuck a boatload of 4-way rcs nozzles on there. WhenI launched, I not only had SAS turned on but I also had rcs.\n\nEither the slower speeds and/or changed c.g. (due to the weight of the monoprop tank) or the rcs itself solved the tumbling issue. Neither ship tumbled. When they got clear of the atmosphere, the ship with no nosecone had an apo of 201269. The ship with a nose cone? 283509.\n\nSo far it looks like the drag saved with the nose cone more than offsets the weight. Going at slower (saner) speeds might reduce this benefit, but making a gravity turn rather than just burning straight up would probably increase the benefit. It looks like the nosecones are still worth putting on the ship.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T08:36:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 08:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T08:24:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Much to my dismay I discovered earlier that fin stabilizing rockets seems to now be back to being a hindrance to rocket performance rather than a benefit, so I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s better ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E I\u0027m wondering if the drag may have been reduced so much where that might even be the case for adapters or even nosecones as well, but I think I\u0027m done with the testing for today and will look into that tomorrow.
