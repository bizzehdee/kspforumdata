Here it is (partially) recreated in KSP. I\u0027ve taken to using MechJeb for launches now just to make them easier to reproduce, so anyone should be able to fly the same mission as well!

Oh well, a regular screenshot will have to do. You\u0027ll notice I removed the external airlock: On STS-30 the airlock was still internal on the lower deck of the shuttle, they would not move the airlock external until the MIR missions in the late 90s.\n\nSTS-30 was launched into a 361x366km orbit at 28.8 degrees orbital inclination, so that\u0027s what we\u0027ll use to set MechJeb Ascent Guidance:\n\n    Orbit altitude: 360kmOrbit inclination: 28.8Limit acceleration to: 40m/s (3G limit, don\u0027t think it ever needs it)Force Roll climb: climb 180 turn 180 (STS-30 flew an older launch profile that did not roll to heads up at the end of SSME burn)Corrective Steering: onAutostage: on Delays: pre 0 post 0 Stop at stage: 4Ascent path:Start altitude: 1kmStart velocity: 100m/sEnd altitude: 35kmFinal flight path angle: 8 degreesTurn shape: 66% \n\nThese settings should ensure that you end up in an orbit that safely disposes both the ET and allows the SRBs to be recovered intact.

I still have to F5 on final in case I bork it up - OTOH even tho the final and flair was done by hand on the real shuttle, there were incredible amounts of guidance that KSP simply does not have.\n\nHere\u0027s my method, using MechJeb from a 100km x 100km orbit:\n\n1. Landing Autopilot: Set to \u0022KSC Pad\u0022, click land at target. Wait for the predicted landing to get \u003C 1km and hit abort. Check \u0022Show Landing Predictions\u0022 and turn retrograde. Now burn OMS for a 30Km difference (which means, were you in a capsule you\u0027d land 30km short of the VAB).\n2. Close Landing AP.\n3. Use Smart A.S.S.: SURF/SVEL\u002B and make sure ROL=0, PIT=0, YAW=0\n4. Preload your reentry angle into PIT by typing 40 in the box.\n5. At around 50km altitude you\u0027ll start seeing heating. Now hit the \u00220\u0022 button beside YAW or ROL and MJ will \u0022take\u0022 the 40 in PIT and nose up the shuttle.\n6. Watch pretty fire.\n7. You should be passing through ~1000m/s as you pass over the mountains west of KSC. Flip on the \u0022Spaceplane Guidance\u0022, set the Autoland Glideslope: to 20\\*, and check \u0022Show landing navball guidance\u0022 (DO NOT CLICK AUTOLAND).\n8. This is where I F5.\n9. As your speed drops below 300m/s switch Smart A.S.S. off.\n10. As your nose gets near the flight vector (Orange W overlays the green O) hit \u0022T\u0022 (SAS on). (NOTE: I fly with a keyboard, if you use a Joystick, you might do better with SAS off?)\n11. From here fly it like a glider to get it onto the runway.\n\nPossible helpful hints:\n\n- Click the nose hear and click \u0022Light On\u0022 it helps you judge your alt above the runway as it lights the tarmac.\n- Set the body flap (below the main engines) to the brake action group, and set \u0022Deploy\u0022 to inverted. You now have a speed brake, which I think is what that control surface mainly does (did) IRL.\n- This approach does NOT make use of S-turns, mostly because I found the MJ could not keep her steady if I programmed it to bank during reentry.\n- Download the demo at [http://www.space-shuttle-mission.com/](http://www.space-shuttle-mission.com/) and fly STS-1 (the only one you can in the demo), going through reentry is very educational.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T23:10:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tg626**"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T23:21:44Z","Content":"KSP-2 results. \n\nAttempts 2\n\nFailures 1\n\n2nd attempt only worked because I pulled a Split-S to get down to the runway.

For me, I aim for a 15-20km periapsis that\u0027s located a little past the island runway, then use S-turns to help slow down to make the runway. If I fly just 40 degrees straight nose up there\u0027s enough lift to bounce back into the atmosphere and I\u0027ll overshoot, but it can do S-Turns very well. Just make sure you\u0027re down to about 20% RCS fuel left or your CG will make the re-entry rather dicey!\n\nFunny you should mention space-shuttle-mission.com, I\u0027ve been playing with F-Sim and X-Plane Shuttle for years, honestly my landings in KSP are better than most of the ones I do in X-Plane =p\n\nOnce in a while I try to do a proper HAC turn with the landing and I NEVER make it (intact).
