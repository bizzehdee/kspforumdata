It\u0027s fairly stable whilst using the initial boosters to get off the ground though...until I fire up the main engine that is...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have tried many different setups using my brain to design them but to no avail, so I thought i\u0027d ask you guys for some help.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not asking for someone to design a rocket for me (i\u0027m not that lazy), however if what I am doing needs to be binned, then I will happily accept any help that is offered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy lander and command module is 13T in mass...which might be my first problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is a screenshot (not including AE-FF1 protective shell - is this needed?) without any of the many rocket designs I have tried below it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022R55fiSY.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R55fiSY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried both slim and fat launch vehicles, usually with 2/4 boosters at the bottom.

Either way, I have been trying all day to launch this to no avail. I can get to 80km\u002B but when I try to round off my orbit, the rocket spins out of control even on quite a low throttle. Redesigning my lander isn\u0027t out of the question either.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone have any tips, suggestions or help please?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Many thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T16:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif your landing can is upside down and if its your root part and controlling from there, itll mess up everytime.\u00A0 although usually at much lower altitude that you describe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, if it doesnt have struts to reinforce the joint between the docking ports, youll most likely get lots of wobble\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T16:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou likely have a few\u00A0things going on that are related...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe front end of your craft with all those bells and whistles will be very draggy, the rear much less so, which will contribute to the flip.
