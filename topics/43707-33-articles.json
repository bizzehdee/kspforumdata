Seems like the same problem, though less pronounced, as when I was trying to use V(?,?,?) the other day. Sometimes it seems to be more wobbly than others, and sometimes it completely spins around and then corrects itself just before reaching the altitude where i want the gravity turn to start. Once it\u0027s on the 45 it\u0027s good, though it does wobble a few degrees here and there. Also, it doesn\u0027t seem to do it until maybe 1000m give or take, possibly due to fuel movement. It\u0027s almost as if it\u0027s not fully locking in the coordinates, or similar to launching without SAS turned on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried adding/removing SAS units, including keeping an ASAS on the top of the rocket, and adding a SAS unit to the bottom of the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using this to set the orientation before launch, and in a loop after launch, if altitude is below 10000: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Elock steering to heading 90 by 90.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I shouldn\u0027t keep setting it in the loop? Though I think I had that originally and it didn\u0027t seem to make a difference. Oh, also I have tried having it set timewarp, sometimes it\u0027ll let physical warp happen, other times it won\u0027t, but when it does the wobbling/pitching over is much more pronounced (like usual I guess).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ll try setting steering to up next, and leave it at that until the gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E So I had a strange thing happen, now all of a sudden the launch clamps disappear, and the whole rocket shifts sideways towards the east (while still pointing up) as if it was teleported. A few launches like this resulted in the script module crashing into the water pipes, and rapid unplanned disassembly ensued. I thought this was because of the game running most of the day (mostly just sitting idle) so I restarted it. First launch (with locking steering to up) went mostly ok, though it still drifted. Next launch though (using lock steering to up \u002B R(0,0,180) ) the teleport happened again, but the rocket did seem to stay relatively straight this time, with maybe half a degree wobble/going off course.

A volume is similar to a music cd (people still know what those are right? lol), where the volume is the cd, and files are the songs on that volume. In the case of KSP/kOS, each rocket that has the kOS module is a separate volume (don\u0027t know if they\u0027re accessible from other rockets), if you notice when you right click on the kOS module, it has an ID. the archive volume is based in KSC so you have to be in range of KSC. Basically the idea is you can load up your archive with various files that you\u0027d reuse, like say a launch/orbit program, a docking program, a rover program etc. You copy the programs you need from the archive to the current volume/rocket so you don\u0027t have to worry about being in range of KSC. This way you can have different programs loaded up on different rockets. If you leave that rocket, or quick save those programs are saved in the persistent/quick save file I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t believe you can edit programs that are in the rockets volume outside of KSP/kOS, only the ones in the archive volume. So you can use notepad, or the kOS IDE someone has created (that does syntax highlighting based on kerboscript), to edit programs outside of KSP and then copy them to the rocket, or like I do, I just \u0022switch to archive\u0022 and run them from there. Though once I get back into actually playing KSP and not just testing things (whenever RT2 comes out of play testing) then I\u0027ll just put my programs in archive and copy them to the rocket(s) as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the archive folder, at least for now, is located in \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Space Program\\Plugins\\PluginData\\Archive\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
