You see I\u0027ve made a Code in VSCode to compile and a ready APU sound I\u0027ve recorded and modified (removed ambient sounds n wind) to be used, and I want it to work with DECQ\u0027s space shuttle system.\u00A0The problem is that I can\u0027t compile it due to Windows 7 not wanting to update to SP1 for drivers problems eventually making VS requiring it soooo whatever...\u00A0this made\u00A0me hit a dead end. Anyway, the only solution I\u0027ve got is by getting anyone who made a plugin before, and compile the code for me (Text or .cs file) to a .dll. Note that I\u0027ll only provide it in private not in public, but the mod itself will be released as soon as it\u0027s ready to, and the guy who made this possible will be mentionned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest Regards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBayou M.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-23T16:05:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2019 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Waffle Shuttle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-24T00:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Add-on discussions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
