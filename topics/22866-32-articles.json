What the move to water does is turn the ship collision off, and move it really fast to the water, where it then turns collision on and drops it nicely down into the water. If your computer lags during the launch process it could cause this to go wrong and basically be out of sync, hitting the land is possible when that happens. I would add 4 or 5 trusses to the bottom so it\u0027s sitting really high off the runway when it launches, this might increase the chances of getting over the water. Later you can move the ship into shallow water and break them off the bottom of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T21:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason this mod is making me lose a lot of fps?
