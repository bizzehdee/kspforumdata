Their confusion was heightened when Gene Kerman took to the stage instead of Walt, an event that only occurred when particularly significant announcements were going to be made. The room fell silent, so quiet that they could hear the faint hum from the sound system, until Gene spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs most of you are already aware, the Dynawing-class shuttle \u003Cem\u003EDauntless \u003C/em\u003Ewas launched in the early hours of this morning on DSM-82 to perform routine maintenance and upgrades on the Kerbble Space Telescope.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused for a moment, and some of the most experienced correspondents felt a sinking feeling in their stomachs as they began to work out the reason for the press conference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwo hours ago, \u003Cem\u003EDauntless \u003C/em\u003Ewas struck by a micrometeor shower whilst docked to the KST, resulting in catastrophic damage to both the shuttle and the telescope and depressurisation of the main crew cabin. Mission Specialists Mitrey and Billy-Bobny and Mission Pilot Gerzer were all struck directly or indirectly by debris, and killed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA collective gasp echoed through the room as cameras whirred and flashbulbs blinked like bursts of machine gun fire. The loss of three Kerbonauts in a single event was the worst accident the Space Program had faced since the Woomerang disaster over a decade earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene waited for a semblance of calm to return before continuing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMission Commander Valentina Kerman was on EVA when the micrometeoroids arrived and was struck by secondary debris from the shuttle, resulting in serious injuries and loss of communications.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room was utterly silent- the potential loss of one of the \u0027Big Four\u0027 was itself headline news, but the loss of an entire shuttle crew headed by possibly the most experienced veteran in the Program was unheard of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA private spaceplane, callsign \u003Cem\u003EFirebird\u003C/em\u003E, belonging to K.V. Roe and Company was already on site at the Space Centre and so was tasked with a rescue mission under Section 7 of the Space Program Charter. Its crew consisted of K.V. Roe test pilot Thombert Kerman and Cadet Second Class Martina Kerman, who attempted a powered EVA rescue of Commander Valentina.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a ripple of surprise at that; Cadets were normally forbidden from interacting with external agents during their training to prevent accusations of insider trading by suppliers or allegations of cheating by the Cadets themselves. In addition, it was only after graduating to First Class that a Cadet was given their first space flight, and some considerable time after that before they got their first EVA; for a Second Class Cadet to even consider performing an untethered EVA was unthinkable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis mission was able to successfully recover Commander Valentina and began its descent. However, shortly afterwards \u003Cem\u003EFirebird \u003C/em\u003Ereported being struck by debris before re-entering and suffered critical structural damage. McCauliffe tracking station detected multiple tracks diverging from the \u003Cem\u003EFirebird \u003C/em\u003Ebefore it broke up on re-entry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second collective gasp and more camera flashes greeted the latest revelation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe pilot of the \u003Cem\u003EFirebird \u003C/em\u003Eand former instructor at the Space Program, Thombert, was believed to be on board during re-entry and is presumed dead. Commander Valentina and Cadet Martina are believed to have boarded a prototype re-entry vessel being carried as a payload by the \u003Cem\u003EFirebird\u003C/em\u003E; Harvester station tracked their initial descent profile but observed an anomaly shortly before loss of signal due to terrain. No further contact has been made with this vessel and its current status is unknown. At this time, Commander Valentina and Cadet Martina are officially missing in action. Thank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene walked off the podium and out of the room, ignoring the chorus of questions from the press. He headed straight to his office where he closed the door, sat down at his desk and stared blankly at the opposite wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour dead, two more missing; three Kerbonauts doing their jobs on a routine mission, blasting off just a few hours ago from the launchpad at McAuliffe launch site with smiles and waves to the crowds and cameras, never to return; Commander Valentina, hero of many a child who dreamt of following in her illustrious footsteps, head of the outreach programme taking rocket science to schools, left floating in space after being crushed by the very spacecraft she had commanded; a private test pilot bravely responding to the call for help from the Space Program and paying the ultimate price for his efforts; and Cadet Martina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene could still remember reading the news article about the brilliant schoolgirl who had built an air-breathing rocket out of scrap parts in her garden shed, a tale reminiscent of the junkyard-built rocket which had ignited the world\u0027s imagination and kick-started the Space Program itself when it seemed space exploration was about to end. He also knew that K.V. Roe had spotted the device\u0027s potential and put considerable resources into developing it further, but only after ensuring that the young Martina had properly patented her invention and even fighting in court on her behalf when the patent was challenged. Now she had ridden into orbit thanks to a device she had played a pivotal role in making, conducted a daring EVA rescue mission- and quite possibly burned up in the upper atmosphere on the way back down again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix either dead or missing in the space of a single day; only the Woomerang disaster could top that grim figure, and just like on that day Gene felt like he had aged a decade since he woke up that morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone knocked on the door and opened it at the same time, and Gene looked round to see Wernher, as expected- for all his knowledge on matters scientific and mechanical, Wernher still hadn\u0027t mastered the art of knocking a door and then waiting to be invited in before entering it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGround stations Harvester, Nye and Musgrave just sent over their data on that \u0027micrometeor shower\u0027, and they confirm what we saw over in the Tracking Station. That debris was orbiting retrograde, and matched the \u003Cem\u003EDauntles\u003C/em\u003Es\u0027 trajectory almost exactly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene was speechless.

Someone deliberately launched that debris straight into their path to try and disable or destroy either \u003Cem\u003EDauntless \u003C/em\u003Eor the KST, or both. Wherever it was launched from was out of line of sight of any of the ground stations and the rocket managed to climb to orbit, circularise and scatter its payload before it reached \u003Cem\u003EDauntless\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COrbit?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CA sub-orbital shot would have dropped back into atmosphere long before \u003Cem\u003EFirebird \u003C/em\u003Egot there. Since they reported seeing a shower of debris, from the same direction and spread over a larger area, before they got hit and were closely matching \u003Cem\u003EDauntless\u0027 \u003C/em\u003Eoriginal trajectory, it\u0027s very likely to be the same event.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo we have any idea who is responsible?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, but when we find them I\u0027d be happy to strap them to the front of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and watch \u003Cem\u003Ethem \u003C/em\u003Ebreak apart on re-entry.\u201D Gene was surprised by the venom in Wernher\u0027s voice; while he had had some spectacular outbursts before when part tests hadn\u0027t gone to plan or rocket launches had failed, they paled in comparison to the cold fury Gene now saw in his eyes, and suspected was mirrored in his own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was another knock at the office door and Walt entered, looking unusually flustered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis just got flagged by one of the PR team.

When they boarded they found Natalia sitting in a rear-facing seat with her seatbelt fastened, staring at a fixed point far beyond the rear bulkhead of the plane\u0027s passenger cabin. She didn\u0027t react at all when Gene sat in the rear-facing seat directly opposite her, when the plane\u0027s engines started up or even when it accelerated down the runway and into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene noticed that the fingers of her left hand were moving, about the only movement he could see aside from her breathing.

The way the ends of her hair go all frizzy if it air dries after it gets wet.

I have to remember those little details because if I forget them, I forget her, and...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe closed her eyes for a few seconds, before opening them again in alarm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy are we turning?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene hadn\u0027t even noticed the plane banking, but when he looked out the window he saw the Space Centre go by and soon the plane banked again to perform a second U-turn. He looked over at Wernher, who had somehow managed to fall asleep in the few minutes of flight time and was now blinking in confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re landing already?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane began rumbling as its landing gear deployed and created turbulence underneath the fuselage. Seconds later they touched down again and taxied quickly towards the Spaceplane Hangar where a yellow transport truck was just arriving. Three people climbed out and began walking- no, running- towards the plane before it had even stopped rolling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stairs had barely unfolded when the first newcomer began running up them two at a time, barrelled past the startled technician who had just opened the cabin door and a moment later had grabbed Gene by his waistcoat lapels and nearly lifted him out of his seat; \u0027nearly\u0027 only because he was still wearing his seatbelt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWHERE IS SHE!?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene looked up at Jeanette\u2019s terrified, furious eyes and tried to formulate a response. What was he supposed to say- \u201CSorry for shooting your teenage daughter into space in a prototype nuclear spaceplane to perform an outrageously dangerous untethered EVA rescue despite her having no experience and no training for that task.\u201D?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJean, put the nice \u2018man down,\u201D Martin said from behind her, carrying a sleeping Sasha in a carry seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene felt her grip loosen, saw the anger drain from her face leaving only fear and more than a hint of anguish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EWhy\u003C/em\u003E, Gene?

We thought of as many possibilities as we could, but there was no other way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll this technology, all those shiny buildings, and in the end all you could do was throw an untrained teenager out an airlock and hope for the best?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree of my Kerbonauts died in space today; do you think for one moment that I would just sit there and watch our most experienced veteran- and a close personal friend- burn up in the upper atmosphere or suffocate when her life support failed, and do \u003Cem\u003Enothing at all\u003C/em\u003E to prevent it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth Kerbals looked at each other and saw their own emotional turmoil in the other\u2019s eyes. The argument ended and both took their seats as the door was closed and locked and the jet\u2019s engines started up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the second time in ten minutes the plane took off and began climbing as it flew east. Even at Mach 3 the flight would take hours and the sun would already have set by the time it landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EQuite possibly in more ways than one,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EGene thought to himself. \u003Cem\u003EPeople are already clamouring for investigations and inquests, and if it turns out we sent a child into space to her death, this might just be the last day of the entire crewed spaceflight programme.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAir.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCold, damp, beautiful air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClean, life-giving air flowed into her lungs, oxygen percolating into her bloodstream, and her body responded- heart rate rising, brain stuttering back into action. Instinct took over again and she gasped for air, but this time she found it and suddenly she was convulsing on the floor, spluttering up lungfuls of brine and replacing them with lovely fresh air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything was painfully bright and she flinched away from the light until a shadow moved in front of it. The image shifted slowly from black and white to monochrome to colour, a green shadow in front of a blue sky, then a face marked with concern looking down at her and speaking, the words eventually penetrating the fog in her brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...me? Come on, you can do it, wake up now...\u201D She tried to reply but her voice was an unintelligible croak. The face shifted slightly and suddenly cold, clear water trickled into her mouth, instantly becoming horribly salty and she spat it back out. More details came into view- the face resolved into that of an older teen with marks around it from where he had been wearing a diving mask; that same mask lay behind him attached to scuba gear. She was lying on the deck of a boat, the wooden planks stretching away towards the rail and the sea beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSea... That was important, why was it- Val. Val!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal!\u201D her voice was barely a whisper. She tried to sit up but was immediately hit by a wave of intense dizziness and her head flopped back down to the deck with a thud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, no, stay down, don\u0027t get up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal!\u201D she said again, her voice slightly stronger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, you fell right out of the sky,\u201D he responded, not understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, Val! In the, the,\u201D what was it called? \u201Cshuttle. Stuck.\u201D Why couldn\u0027t she put words together properly? She was an astronaut, not a baby! \u201CVal stuck!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last the teen understood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal? As in THE Val?\u201D He asked in amazement. Tina nodded, even that minor motion taking far too much effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDanton, quick! There\u0027s another one still inside!\u201D he shouted, strapping the scuba tank back on and securing the mask before jumping over the side. Another face appeared, a younger girl who picked up the water bottle and trickled a little more of it into Tina\u0027s mouth, which she managed to swallow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDid you really go into space?\u201D the girl asked, and again Tina nodded but felt slightly less dizzy than last time. \u201CWhat was it like? Floating up there, all of Kerbin stretched out below you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo time... to look.\u201D The girl seemed confused by that answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo time? But you were up there for hours! We saw the launch on TV. Are you just used to it because you\u0027ve been up so many times, Val?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina almost laughed, but the effort was too great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not Val, I\u0027m Tina. What\u0027s your name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCarley. You\u0027re really not Valentina? Because you look like her.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou think so?\u201D Tina felt inexplicably happy about that, probably due to all the endorphins still floating around her brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal is my hero- she broke through the highest glass ceiling of them all, right out into space, and proved that girls can be astronauts just as well as boys can.\u201D Carley\u0027s eyes flashed with steely determination. \u201COne day, I\u0027m going to be an astronaut just like her.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal is my hero too! She\u0027s why I joined the, um... Space Program.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReally!?\u201D Carley could barely contain her excitement. \u201CThat is so cool! Have you ever met her at the Space Program? What\u0027s she like? Have you flown to space with her?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnwanted memories crashed into Tina\u0027s mind and she started crying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t... I don\u0027t think she survived.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA loud splashing followed by shouting came from somewhere behind her, but she couldn\u0027t turn round to see its source. She saw Carley look, watched the colour drain from her face and then she started crying too. With immense effort, Tina turned her head just in time to see a third teenager- presumably Danton- stick his fingers down Val\u0027s throat, triggering a gag reflex and suddenly she coughed water all over the deck, but her eyes never opened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two boys very carefully began removing her spacesuit, struggling with the locking mechanisms on the gloves and waist. When they managed to remove the top half of the suit they both gasped in shock at the extent of her injuries, her under suit soaked with blood and stuck to her body in a strange shape that hinted at serious internal damage underneath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanton put his ear directly over Val\u0027s mouth, listened for a few seconds then said \u201CShe\u0027s breathing, at least. Not much and it sounds like there\u0027s a bag of popcorn going off in there, but breathing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u0027s alive?\u201D asked Carley, voice trembling with emotion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor now. Keep an eye on her, Carley,\u201D he replied, pointing at Tina, \u201CPatmon, get that first aid kit up here ASAP, Tomul, get us moving back to port as quickly and more importantly as smoothly as possible\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina saw the first diver- Tomul- move to the boat\u0027s controls, heard the engine throttle up and felt it begin to move, the sudden motion making her feel horribly seasick. Carley recognised the symptoms just in time and managed to move Tina\u0027s head out of the path of the putrid puddle as it slowly sloshed across the deck and over the side, then slowly moved her over to the side of the boat\u0027s cabin and got her propped up against it with a bucket. She went down into the cabin and came back with another bottle of cold water, condensation immediately forming on its sides in the warm sea air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy taking tiny sips spaced well apart, Tina managed to drink half the bottle without being sick again as her balance slowly recovered. Carley sat beside her, correctly reading her mood and staying silent despite clearly wanting to ask a lot of questions. Finally she couldn\u0027t stay quiet any longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat happened up there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EDauntless \u003C/em\u003Ewas on mission when it got hit by some kind of micrometeor shower and damaged.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina took a deep breath to steady herself before continuing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe got hit by something too, lost a wing and started re-entering. I got Val into that little shuttle but Thombert, the pilot, he... he tricked me! He made me leave him behind, even though he knew \u003Cem\u003EFirebird \u003C/em\u003Ecouldn\u0027t survive re-entry with that much damage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen why did he stay?\u201D Carley asked. \u201CWhy would he choose to die when he had a chance to live?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause he knew there was no way for him to get out. He had to stay to keep the Firebird stable enough for us to get out and to stop the engine from exploding and raining radioactive fallout across half a continent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarley turned pale. \u201CYour plane was nuclear!? What happened to the nuclear bit then?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe engine was designed to detach if there was a problem and come down on its own, then parachute to the ground safely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat still sounds pretty dangerous though. Why would anyone want to put nuclear reactors in space?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause until someone invents nuclear fusion or a warp drive, a nuclear thermal rocket is the most efficient way of getting around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut what about ion drives, or those new \u0027PIT\u0027 thingies?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIon thrusters and the like might have higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but they\u0027re either incredibly weak, incredibly power-hungry, or both. If we tried to power Trailblazer with an array of PITs, they\u0027d weigh nearly three hundred tons in total and would need about four square kilometres of solar panels to power them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you OK?\u201D Carley looked at her in alarm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CConsidering everything that just happened, I feel fantastic.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDanton, there\u0027s something really wrong with her!\u201D Carley shouted. \u201CShe\u0027s talking gibberish and her face is all lopsided!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe deck suddenly lurched ninety degrees and Tina fell onto her left side. As soon as her head hit the deck it felt like something red-hot had been stabbed into her left eye, blocking her vision in that eye and sending pulses of indescribable pain shooting straight into her skull. Her brain decided that enough was enough and she blacked out, but the last thing she saw with her right eye, was her left eye lying on the deck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seemed to happen in slow motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane was two hours into its flight, streaking across the afternoon sky at Mach 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha was crawling up and down the aisle of the plane, happily oblivious to the oppressive atmosphere around her\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, Natalia continued her incessant finger-twirling, the metal ring polished almost to a mirror shine after more than two hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason, most likely fatigue in the muscles controlling her fingers, Natalia dropped the ring; it fell to the floor and rolled under the seats before re-emerging into the aisle at the back of the cabin. Right in front of Sasha, who could scarcely believe her luck at having a SHINY NEW THING appear without warning and roll right into reach of her little fingers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo she did what any baby would do when confronted with a SHINY NEW THING: she picked it up and put it straight in her mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNatalia leapt to her feet with a cry of horror and rushed towards Sasha, but collided with Jeanette who had done the same thing and they both fell on top of a sleeping Wernher, who promptly woke up gasping for air from Natalia elbowing him in the stomach and a throbbing headache from Jeanette head-butting him in the face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha laughed at the chaos, until that made her start choking. With a speed he didn\u2019t know he still had, Martin swooped in and grabbed his younger daughter, slapping her back with one hand while sticking a finger of his other hand into her mouth until she vomited profusely across the floor. The no-longer-shiny metal ring was suddenly propelled out of Sasha\u2019s mouth, rolled back towards the front of the plane and straight under Jeanette\u2019s foot where it was instantly flattened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNoooo!\u201D Natalia wailed, picking up the flattened disc and trying desperately to bend it back into shape. It was no use: still lightly coated in baby sick, it was too slippery for her to grip onto it and she couldn\u2019t get any leverage.
