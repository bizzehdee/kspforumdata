I was impatient and wanted my next Kerbin approach within a year, so I spent about 300dv at that point to get a quick rendezvous but I could imagine waiting some more years and it would have come along naturally.

Are there any situations where it\u0027s worth going into the atmosphere from the left, and staying quite high, to get the benefit of both kinds of decelerations at once?

I can\u0027t give any hard data on this; by experience, I know that with mun you can gain beteen 50 and 100 m/s, with tylo/laythe you can gain around 500 m/s, with kerbin a bit more. Still, when I wanted to make a duna-kerbin-eve assist, one single kerbin flyby wasn\u0027t enough and I had to eject into resonant orbits and make, like, three assists. And I had to use mun in one of them to increase my velocity relative to kerbin, otherwise i didn\u0027t have enough speed to reach eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is great insight, thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224199182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210631\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668557746\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nof course i\u0027m talking here of going as close to the surface as you can. if you pass more distant, you get less change. if you could pass underground, you could get a huge deltaV even from a small moon, unfortunately there\u0027s that pesky surface along the way\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElon Musk owns SpaceX and the Boring Company.
