If a large market player with significant capital drops its prices very low in order to drive other competitors out of business, planning to increase those prices dramatically in order to recoup, then that can be actionable under the Clayton Act. However, that only happens if (a) the business is actually pricing\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebelow cost\u003C/em\u003E, and (b) the business has a substantial likelihood of being able to recoup. The launch services market is unique in this regard. Even though SpaceX can offer substantially lower-cost launch services than any competitor, without pricing below cost, the launch customer base still selects other companies. Even if SpaceX did lower its prices below cost, there\u2019s no evidence that this would actually hurt other launch providers any more than they are already being hurt. Which is probably one reason why SpaceX doesn\u2019t lower its launch prices any more than where they currently are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Starship, etc. DOES drive every other launch provider out of business, and THEN SpaceX jacks Starship launch costs up\u2026that\u2019s still not actionable because SpaceX acquired this monopoly simply by being the best. A natural monopolist can charge a monopoly price (the monopoly price being the price which maximizes both the number of sales and profit per sale). Amusingly, though, the Starship monopoly price is probably fairly low because SpaceX will make more money in the long run by maximizing the number of launches than by maximizing the profit per launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-09T14:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, in the context of this thread (BO) and adding in SpaceX, we have companies run by the 2 richest men on Earth.
