Ksp have been crashing since i started modding it (that was about 2 years ago). Around a year ago i got ATM because of which my ksp crashed rarely, but now ksp crashes in 5 mins! it crashes when i launch,revert or do anything that requires loading, and sometimes it crashes at anytime (like when i am building a craft or flying it). All i did recently was to delete earlier mods and install new ones (or new versions of earlier mods). I went through all forums and tried every solution but nothing seems to work.

In your case it appears that some of the updated mods have caused this. Alternatively it could be that some of the mods are not compatible with 1.0, or you may be getting an out of memory error. KSP is a 32-bit program so cannot use all the available RAM. You could try removing a few mods at a time until it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aditya","CreatedById":142676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt maybe conflicting mods or memory or both.
