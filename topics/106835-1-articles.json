Ksp have been crashing since i started modding it (that was about 2 years ago). Around a year ago i got ATM because of which my ksp crashed rarely, but now ksp crashes in 5 mins! it crashes when i launch,revert or do anything that requires loading, and sometimes it crashes at anytime (like when i am building a craft or flying it). All i did recently was to delete earlier mods and install new ones (or new versions of earlier mods). I went through all forums and tried every solution but nothing seems to work. Please somebody help me!\n\nThanks in advance.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:50:26Z","Content":"With such a large number of mods it is likely that there is some sort of conflict between two or plugins causing the game to crash. In your case it appears that some of the updated mods have caused this. Alternatively it could be that some of the mods are not compatible with 1.0, or you may be getting an out of memory error. KSP is a 32-bit program so cannot use all the available RAM. You could try removing a few mods at a time until it works."},{"CreatedByName":"Aditya","CreatedById":142676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:44:04Z","Content":"It maybe conflicting mods or memory or both. But when I checked the crash log, the memory usage was 68 %. And I specifically downloaded mods for my version ( that\u0027s 0.25) .
