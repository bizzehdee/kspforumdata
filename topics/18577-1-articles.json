No problem right? Well not quite... You see, all my missions go just like this: \u0022Lets see if THIS rocket design works!\u0022 \u0022It doesn\u0027t spontaneously combust, Lets orbit!\u0022 \u0022Time to make \u0027dat orbit perfect\u0022 \u0022You know what? This is an experimental rocket, and I\u0027ve never been NEAR Minmus, let alone orbit it... Let\u0027s Orbit it with this rocket that may or may not work!\u0022 and history was made... Kind of! You see I DID make a perfect (within a few hundred meters) orbit around Minmus and \u0022Landed\u0022 too. But I didn\u0027t. You see after I made the perfect orbit, I knew i wanted to keep it like that. So what I did was take Bill on a mission to land. Because of its 3-man pod, I could still control it without him. So out went bill after I made a 45,000 to 45,000 orbit to a 45,000 to 7,000 orbit. He jumped out, shoved on his jet-pack, and descended into the most unknown territory for me. Minmus. Everything went well and i was very close to landing. just as I landed I spammed the F1 button to make sure i got a picture. Turns out I took so many I could probably make a movie with them. Anyways I landed and explored the terrain. After exploring I decided to test out the gravity with my jet-pack. It was the most fun Bill has ever had! After a few \u0022minmutes\u0022 (get it like minmus minutes?) I decided I wanted to send a rescue pod for him. Unfortunately Bill decided to land in the worst possible spot; on top of a mountain extremely far away from any lakes for the pod to land in. So, I had to move. Far. And after a long time I got very greedy with my speed. Then, POOF! Bill was dead. Kind of? Yes! You see, the reason why the thread is called \u0022Minmus, kind of?\u0022 is because I never used my regular save to land on Minmus! So actually, I landed on Minmus on a copied save of my regular file. So on my regular file Bill is still there, and the orbit is still perfect... It\u0027s like nothing even happened...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you go, I hope I entertained you and I finally let out all the excitement of landing through this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Images open in a new tab) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy orbit, MINE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Qg2D.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/0Qg2D.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nob50.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Nob50.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill made it, kind of...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4TfFE.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/4TfFE.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-04T00:13:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2012 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Schweehog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T03:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was entertained. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schweehog","CreatedById":33783,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T04:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was entertained. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, I enjoy entertaining people and making them happy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"opticalshadow","CreatedById":31348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T05:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoddly enough, getting into minmums orbit, and landing on it, took me less time, and is still today far easier for me, then going to mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robly18","CreatedById":37651,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T15:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022opticalshadow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022opticalshadow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eoddly enough, getting into minmums orbit, and landing on it, took me less time, and is still today far easier for me, then going to mun.\u003Cp\u003Eno idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I did when I got the paid version was to land on minmus and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was 3 weeks ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil this day, I haven\u0027t yet been able to safely land on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tought minmus was to be harder?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T15:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGrats of the mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob says to Bill, \u0022Why are you screaming now?

It takes a little bit more fuel to get out there, but not a whole lot. The greater challenge is knowing how to maneuver your rocket to get a proper capture since Minmus is on the non parallel orbital trajectory. Plus the distance out makes it take a bit more planning to ensure an efficient interception. Moon gravity means you also need to keep a constant control burn to prevent an overspeed landing. Minmus can land with just the pulse thrusts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp_blazer","CreatedById":38958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T16:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you land your craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsakali","CreatedById":44351,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T16:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eminmus might be easier because of the weaker gravity, effectively turning the entire landing ordeal feel like it\u0027s in slow motion...in comparison to the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martonaut","CreatedById":26366,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T17:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat story\u002B this comment , lols! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Markus Reese\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Markus Reese\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGrats of the mission!\u003Cp\u003EBob says to Bill, \u0022Why are you screaming now?
