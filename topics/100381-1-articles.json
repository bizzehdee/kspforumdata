I\u0027ve noticed this on the KSC runway with full fuel tanks and also with reduced fuel landed on Laythe (pointed slightly downhill even). The plane is stable, but when I have a Kerbal go on an EVA, the nose lifts up in the air - as if that was a small enough difference in mass to cause the pivot. Do Kerbals actually have noticeable mass or is there some other explanation for what I\u0027m seeing here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/fEdaT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
