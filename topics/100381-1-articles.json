I\u0027ve noticed this on the KSC runway with full fuel tanks and also with reduced fuel landed on Laythe (pointed slightly downhill even). The plane is stable, but when I have a Kerbal go on an EVA, the nose lifts up in the air - as if that was a small enough difference in mass to cause the pivot. Do Kerbals actually have noticeable mass or is there some other explanation for what I\u0027m seeing here?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

That\u0027s probably what you\u0027re seeing.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T00:52:07Z","Content":"0.0937 tonnes outside of craft, 0 inside or on ladders.

When he climbs back up the ladder the nose lifts up into the air again until he boards the cockpit and then the nose drops back down again. This isn\u0027t really any sort of problem, but it\u0027s bizarre behavior that I just want to understand.\n\nEDIT: Oh and BTW, this was my first ever landing on Laythe with a space plane, yay me! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T12:19:27Z","Content":"If he\u0027s going up the ladder there is a chance he is somehow pushing the spaceplane up, similar and stranger things have happened ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T16:20:48Z","Content":"Probably phantom forces caused by the ladder"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T19:26:25Z","Content":"Opening and closing the ladder does not do anything to the plane.
