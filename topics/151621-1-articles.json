If you are in orbit and you can get them to zoom past each other reliably, then all you need to do is stop one of them while it\u0027s zooming past the other. Once it\u0027s come to a stop close by, you point it at the other one and give it a little thrust. When it drifts off-line, maybe you stop it, point again, and thrust again.

If the port you\u0027re trying to dock to is pointing away from the planet, for example, then your vessel\u0027s port needs to be pointing towards the planet. The rest of the docking can then be done almost entirely with translation and no rotation at all; simply translate your vehicle until the docking ports are facing each other, and then translate forward to dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T20:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI while back I put together this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/189763-illustrated-guide-to-docking/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eillustrated docking tutorial\u003C/a\u003E, which you may find useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this comment,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222840936\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478453344\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171262\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbal the Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/6/2016 at 9:29 AM, Kerbal the Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried docking my two ships, but they won\u0027t come together.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u00A0Ive also tried all the docking parts in the game, and none of them work for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...kinda makes me wonder whether it\u0027s possible that you\u0027re not using the parts correctly, or have some other sort of design problem.\u00A0 Could you describe exactly what you mean when you say \u0022won\u0027t come together\u0022?\u00A0 And can you post a screenshot of a docking attempt?\u00A0 (i.e. with your two ships close together and the docking ports about to connect, such that both docking ports are visible in the shot)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal the Kerbal","CreatedById":171262,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T03:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell by coming together i mean by docking together, sorry about that\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.
