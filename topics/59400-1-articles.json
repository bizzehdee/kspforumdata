A decoupler right below the lander pod lets you ditch the lander deadweight to push the pod home.

It doesn\u0027t matter where you are; G is the constant that you use because you are using metric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Total mass is of course total mass, but dry mass is simply the mass without the fuel that you have used for this particular stage (you have to work out the dV seperately for each stage). If you use no RCS fuel on that stage, you don\u0027t count it. If you do, then count it. Also, here\u0027s how to think of what ln means. ln is the same as log\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E, which means that for ln\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E x = y, e\u003Csup\u003Ey\u003C/sup\u003E = x. Basically, it gives you the exponent when you know the base and what the base raised to the exponent is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) First, it\u0027s usually best to limit the number of engines you use. Burns take longer, but it is much more efficient (because of less dry mass). Second, they average exactly 390, since that is what they all have. However, if you have different engines with different I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, it is sum(thrusts of all the engines) / sum(thrust / I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E of each engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: 2x Aerospike \u002B 1x Rockomax:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(175 \u002B 175 \u002B 1500) / ([175/390] \u002B [175/390] \u002B [1500/330]) = 1850 / 5.4429 = 339.892 s. Thus, the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E of all the engines combined is 339.892.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T04:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat math makes my brain hurt, so I tend to use a dV chart and this calculator, which is simpler than the first one linked in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot remember what dV it takes to re-orbit from Duna, but I know and unpowered descent is almost possible. You typically need to thrust a bit at the very last minute as Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere means chutes don\u0027t produce quite enough drag for safe landings. The tip about wheels earlier is partially invalidated by .23 as landing legs can now be repaired too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it takes roughly \u0026lt;1500dV to get to Duna as you can aerobrake into a nice orbit. 12-13km periapsis will capture you into a stable orbit. The lower, near 12 side can almost circularize you but you have to be careful, too much and you get eaten. I advise quicksaving before attempting the aerocapture maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, IIRC, it\u0027s \u0026lt;1000dV to return to Kerbin (assuming you are going for a direct landing, and still, aerocapture is possible with a periapsis \u0026lt;40-45km). Overall, I\u0027d say you need about 3500-4000dV on your transfer stage to be safe. That leaves a sizable margin for error and less than perfect lineups and maneuvers, which is good for any first mission. For your lander, I suggest an LV-909 engine. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thin so engines you typically reserve for vacuum use can work quite well there (save for nukes, then again, I roleplay and avoid irradiating my landing site). I can orbit a orange tank (~36 tons) with 8 LV-909 engines and another orange tank\u0027s worth of fuel. It makes quite an effective tanker lander. Again, I do not recall the ascent dV, my apologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vildar87","CreatedById":78846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T05:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) okay, so just keep it as 9.8 no matter what\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) hmm all right, I understand what you mean by stages and that, just not sure how to apply it specifically to my ship, but i can get to that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)All right, I followed along with that, and assuming I understood it correctly;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 LV 909 and 4 Aero spikes;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E([175*4]\u002B[50*4]) / ([(175/390)*4] \u002B[(50/390)*4]) = 900 / 2.3077 = 390? huh.....all the engines have the same ISP....so.....if all the engines have the same ISP, is the ISP for the entire craft the same regardless the thrust, as in this case? or was that just a fluke with these ones?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand Sierra; yeah I know there are delta v calculators and maps and such, but I want to be able to do this so I can figure out the delta V my ship has once its assembled in orbit, and from that, figure out other things, such as how much fuel I will need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T14:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epost deleted\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
