Once the tank is mostly empty we\u0027ll detach it with just enough fuel to deorbit itself, and let it parachute back to Kerbin, saving a few bucks that we can use to buy some more oranges. Then we\u0027ll do it all again, and again several more times. I don\u0027t know if we can afford to fill the entire reservoir...but that\u0027s what the asteroid muncher is for! We\u0027ll be off to Jool as soon as the planets align!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, various pilots have been taking joyrides in the new spaceplane, which turned out to be quite versatile. It can take a handful of Kerbals on a long trip, or a fast trip, or both. Maybe some other time we can make a bigger plane that can move some cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-05T18:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERefueling Ops\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022CLOUD ONE successfully completed another refueling mission with the Mega-Stage; the vehicle performed nominally with an observation noted at the very end of the flight involving the high-speed impact of the stage into the sea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00228efcHfE.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8efcHfE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223VmjuPa.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3VmjuPa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225a2E6M2.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5a2E6M2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-05T18:14:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2020 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-09T02:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMission-Critical\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Mega-Stage 2 Episode 1 was launched to CLOUD-ONE\u00A0 for another refueling operation. As CLOUD-ONE had already been fully fueled in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E monopropellant department, it was decided that the propellant transfer stage would not require the large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank from previous stages, and it was omitted. However, this resulted in the stage not having any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel to use in its own docking maneuvers - this error was realized halfway to the station. No matter, Mission Control said, we will just align the docking orientation and do the translation maneuvers with CLOUD-ONE. This did not go well because of the off-center location of CLOUD-ONE\u0027s centroid against the docking port, and the rotation maneuvers caused the propellant ship to be bumped away from the docking port. Using its limited rotation control, the stage was in the process of orienting itself to a new docking port when an error caused the engine to fire briefly, and CLOUD-ONE needed to rotate itself quickly to avoid an impact. Even still, one long-range antenna on the station was damaged, and CLOUD-ONE was no longer fully loaded with monopropellant. As soon as this event occurred, the docking attempt was aborted and the fuel tank was commanded to back away and\u00A0initiate return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022k8Pevki.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k8Pevki.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stage was very aerodynamic and was able to stay at a high enough speed to rip its parachutes apart even as it approached the ground.
