The landscape reminded me quite a lot of Kerbin!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve decided to do a mission I\u0027ve wanted to do a lot over the years but have never pulled it off, due to boredom - drive around Kerbin. I\u0027m sure we\u0027re all contemplated it, done some basic maths and decided there are better uses for 24h of your life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past I\u0027ve tried it with jet powered vehicles, on the basis that a true rover would take approximately forever to get around at 30m/s. These have never been that sucessful, with tipping and travelling too fast after lapses of concentration. The fuel has also made it rather cumbersome when it gets airborne.This meant driving was not very efficient with lots of loading quick saves. I never actually got far enough to run out of fuel and need to air drop a fuel tank (which was going to be the plan).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to make a much more manageable vehicle, even if it was slower. Instead of wasting half my miles by crashing and having to load and do them again, I would travel more slowly but not crash and waste miles!\u00A0I also wanted it to fly short stretches and be able to float and drive in the sea - be a boat basically.\u00A0I ended up with this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222p6VUqj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2p6VUqj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSlower and more manageable props (which can act as thrust or airbrakes) but faster than a pure rover\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLight(ish) due to zero fuel - just a load of generators. No need to stop at night or refuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ngood height / track ratio - it doesn\u0027t ever want to tip over\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe winglets that are used to achieve the slightly wide track are sufficient to fly reasonably for what is primarily a \u0022car\u0022. It can fly perpetually at 3,000m if I wanted to cheat!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne \u0022steering wheel\u0022 as the XL landing gear can\u0027t steer.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt drives very well for a what is quite a tall vehicle. Bounces and getting airbrone are controllable due to... the control surfaces and lack of weight I guess. It is quite happy flying at 120m/s without draining electricity and doesn\u0027t need to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to be relatively stable.

I\u0027ve done 3h of driving (and 2h of speeding up for the morning to arrive). A mix of flying and driving.

In my 644h of playing kerbal I\u0027ve never really explored Kerbin. I\u0027ll head to Woomerang airfield and then... I don\u0027t know really.
