However, the atmospheric gases do not differentiate completely either on Venus or Earth. In other words, the gases are not clearly stratified. As an example, while oxygen is heavier than nitrogen (barely), if you light a match near the ground at sea level, you will not ignite the lower portion of the air at that location. Conversely, you will not suffocate if you go to the rooftop of a skyscraper building. Granted, CO2 molecules are heavier than nitrogen, and that implies an upward drift of nitrogen, but that doesn\u0027t mean that there is a nitrogen pocket floating \u0022up there\u0022 at Venus. Also, if you go up to about 60 to 70 km (if I recall correctly), CO2 will sublimate into snow, which of course sublimates back into gas lower down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to some of these charts, the temperature is more like 0 C or lower at 1 bar pressure/ elevation. You\u0027d need to go down a little to have a non freezing temperature (and the pressure would be a little higher there). The winds at your target elevation range from about 60 to 125 m/s. These are gale force and above winds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the chemistry; what is needed is energy, which is available.

That\u0027s about 81F. This would be warm, but not terribly hot, yet the ambient pressure would be difficult but not impossible in terms of breathing. I\u0027d imagine habitats would need to be pressurized higher than the ambient outside; in part to keep slow leaks outward, otherwise CO2 would kill. If the source is correct (Wikipedia), this would of course not be the ideal 68F and 1 bar pressure which is often presented in discussions of this kind. Going lower would make it dangerously hot for human survival, not just comfort. Going higher would make it cold but require a sturdier pressurized environment. So as I\u0027ve indicated above: difficult but not impossible; also from a return on investment point of view, the Moon, NEAs and Mars are much more attractive destinations for industry and colonization efforts.

Pressure - that\u0027s actually not so bad. It\u0027s much easier to build in vacuum than in high pressure environment. If your station is built as a rotating self-suspended bridge, this is going to take the bulk of structural strength, with pressurization being handled by internal structure without any problems.
