KSP has built-in trim hotkeys, so any signal from the joystick would count as manual input and would disable the SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS has changed quite a bit over the last several releases. If you\u0027re relying on the cockpit alone, it almost certainly won\u0027t have enough torque on it\u0027s own for anything more than a smallish probe or very lightweight vessel. Try adding more reaction wheels (for space) or control surfaces/fins (for atmo). The SAS should take advantage of the resources you give it to increase it\u0027s steering power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, even a good amount of torque won\u0027t be enough in the face of a poor design with badly misaligned or unbalanced CoL, CoT and CoM.

This makes a vessel shaking less (or not at all) but on the other hand the SAS doesn\u0027t keep it pointed exactly where you told it to point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the specific issue or if this is just a question for clarification. I usually point a vessel (in orbit) to where I want it to be while the SAS is off, then (sometimes) I use time warp to stop the last bit of motion and then I activate SAS to hold that position. Depending on the time I have for the alignment, the torque from the probe body mostly is enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T22:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it stops working altogether you may have run out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T09:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I have been playing this game for years, I have not run out of power\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T15:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you holding orientation with an SAS module, an RCS System, fins or some combination of the three?
