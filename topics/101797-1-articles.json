According to the [KSP Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Oxidizer), Oxidizer costs \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A10.04 a kilogram (\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 meaning \u0022funds\u0022). NASA,[as stated in this site](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-NASA-pay-per-kg-for-hydrogen-and-oxygen-in-rocket-fuel), pays $0.16 for every kg of liquid oxygen. Based on this, the ratio would be \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A10.04/$0.16, or 1 fund for every 4 dollars. So, based on this, \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A150,000 would equal to $200,000. It would be better to have a more accurate estimate than this, however. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT: Looks like I got ninja\u0027d by you, but it\u0027s cool how close our estimates of the fund-to-dollar exchange rate are. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nAlso, some more stuff. NASA paid $0.16 for every kg of LOX in **2001**, so $0.16 in today\u0027s money would be $0.21, so adjusting for inflation the ratio would be \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A11:$5.25.

That would be why the shuttle had two SRB\u0027s instead of doubling the large fuel tank\u0027s capacity and strapping engines onto that.\n\nAs for fuel being so expensive, that can actually help economizing every drop of oxidizer and fuel throughout the mission. Whatever you don\u0027t use can easily be left behind on an orbital station to be used for a future mission. That can save you a few kilofunds.\n\nI actually have yet to worry too much about expenditures, even where fuel is concerned. But hints at what adjustments are going to come in 1.0 leave me to believe I may need to start considering such things. It has outright been stated that a lot of engines are going to get nerfed, and that is definitely going to change fuel requirements.\n\nBut there is bound to be more balance as far as parts and fuel cost to come, as well, so fuel may very well get cheaper in exchange.
