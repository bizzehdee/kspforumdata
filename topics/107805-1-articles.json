Optional steering and lights, as done for the original small gear bay, is an essential feature that needs to be on all gear. We also need some variations in height, so that you can do things like have the tail gear mounted to the wings, but the nose gear under a body section, using the same style of gear. I suspect that it\u0027s impractical to have tweakable height, so a short and tall version of each (the newly introduced gear probably qualifies for the tall case).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes steering and lights are needed! Maybe don\u0027t put steering on the heavy (LY-99) but definitely on the medium (LY-50). Would also like to see some level of suspension on these two.\n\nNo, both need steering. For a normal setup, with twin tail gear and a single nose gear, there\u0027s double the weight on the nose while taxying, and during takeoff and landing runs, so it doesn\u0027t make sense unless the heavy gear is also steerable, as a heavy plane needs the same gear on the nose as the tail. (Before anyone says that the main gear should be under the CoM, taking weight off the nose, that\u0027s incorrect for a classic delta wing design, main gear should be under or behind the CoL, closer to the back of the wings.)"},{"CreatedByName":"blackice504","CreatedById":75634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:28:42Z","Content":"Hi, all i was looking into this problem as well as you can see by the model it does have lights \u0022lamps\u0022 and it has a break indicator, but the config file has no mention of lamp, i did some more snooping by opening the model up in blender and looked at the original landing gear and seen how the light works there but one thing i noticed is its a different setup and some stuff missing.\n\nsomething else comes to mind the LY-10 Small Landing Gear gear status light does not work anymore it just stays green and config file has no mention of a status light.......\n\nPART\n\n{\n\n name = GearLarge\n\n module = Part\n\n author = Porkjet\n\n mesh = model.mu\n\n scale = 1.0\n\n rescaleFactor = 1.0\n\n node\\_attach = 0.00, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\n\n TechRequired = heavyLanding\n\n entryCost = 6400\n\n cost = 1200\n\n category = Utility\n\n subcategory = 0\n\n title = LY-99 Large Landing Gear\n\n manufacturer = LightYear Tire Company // it can\u0027t all be [C7 Aerospace Division]\n\n description = Heavy-duty retractable landing gear.
