Also, they have elevation data for Venus and Mercury and probably at least some moons, though I haven\u0027t spent much extra time looking.

I\u0027ve redone my conversion process so that it will output an image with much wider variation between high and low (the old one linked earlier by Ralathon was compressed towards the low end), but aside from Olympus Mons, which appears, but is quite hard to see (I guess thats what you get with a 600km wide mountain), I\u0027ve not been able to get....

My understanding of the way the heightmap deformity mod is probably supposed to work is that it is the difference between the highest and lowest points on the map, even if those points are only a few shades apart. So even though my previous heightmap was much darker and skewed towards the low levels, by virtue of the fact that there was no true white in it, it would mean that the lightest color would still be set to 29387m (highest point above ground when lowest point is shifted 0m), or am I just crazy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe example heightmaps so people know what I\u0027m talking about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/G8rIU#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve come to this conclusion because I\u0027ve been able to clearly see the boundaries of Olympus Mons (600km across) from multiple angles and distances, but placing myself in the thinnest part of Valles Marineris and Ophir Chasma where 10km elevation differences should at least be apparent, if not drastic, reveals only flat, rolling hills pitted by craters (which exist in the heightmap). Were it not for the crater generation and the big mountain, I would have thought the game was just not reading the heightmap correctly, but both of these are depicted in the heightmap, so something else is completely wiping out low level elevation variation.

My understanding of the way the heightmap deformity mod is probably supposed to work is that it is the difference between the highest and lowest points on the map, even if those points are only a few shades apart. So even though my previous heightmap was much darker and skewed towards the low levels, by virtue of the fact that there was no true white in it, it would mean that the lightest color would still be set to 29387m (highest point above ground when lowest point is shifted 0m), or am I just crazy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe example heightmaps so people know what I\u0027m talking about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/G8rIU#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/G8rIU#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you\u0027re crazy, I\u0027ve been thinking along those lines myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we need the maximum possible range of shades in the heightfield maps.

For cliff detection the map is only split in 2 segments: low areas and high areas. If the depressed region (like the caldera) happens to be in high up the algorithm won\u0027t catch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is then further destroyed by the Perlin noise scaling to height as opposed to something more sensible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgramming something that detects craters and calderas on high areas is going to be difficult. I\u0027m not saying its impossible, I certainly got some ideas on how to do it.
