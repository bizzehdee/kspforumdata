A dedicated mic \u0026amp; good earphones are way cheaper than a headset of the same quality since headsets are build for gamers who have money but dont know much about sound. My Superluxx HD 681 Evo were less than 30\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC and have better sound than most 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC headsets. As a mic i use the Zalman Mic 1, it was only 8\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC and offers good quality, you can attach it to the cable of the headphones or place it on top of your screen...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: I would use cablebased headphones since wireless are way more expensive for the same sound quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"L3GO","CreatedById":73633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T00:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading more reviews and comments about the Logitech headset above im going to look for another type.

(also you will be less likely to misplace it if it\u0027s plugged in). I\u0027ve been taking a look at some new headphones too, but I\u0027m mostly looking at the low end (under 50$) so I don\u0027t really have any good recommendations. I\u0027ll keep an eye out though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArchmageNydia","CreatedById":127038,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T03:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet away from turtle beach. They break extremely easily. I\u0027d recommend a pair of logitech G430s. Surround sound, completely over the ears, good design, good quality, and only one wire iirc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
