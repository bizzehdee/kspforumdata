It is somewhat realistic, (and by that I mean no warp drives or fusion power) and mainly focused on fun and aesthetics ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). \n\n**Existing Space Stations, Bases, and Rockets**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

They are...\n\n- Surface hab- this is where the crew will live and work during their stay on Duna. (No pictures, sorry)\n\n- Challenger Transfer Stage- A large transfer vehicle designed for taking to crew from Kerbin to Duna, as well as providing an orbital living space for the 1 kerbal who doesn\u0027t land.\n\n- Spacedock- A small structural station with several docking ports for arriving and departing CTVs and landers\n\n- Ares Lander- A powerful, two stage lander designed specifically for landing on Duna.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

On the third attempt to land the moon shuttle and its payload, Hab 2, The kraken struck, just as it had before. Mechjeb was landing because I can\u0027t see through the cloud of smoke from the engines and it reduces my fps to a crawl (Bye bye, Hotrockets!). But apparently It didn\u0027t realize that there was something underneath that was adding weight (Hab 2) and it was landing right on top of Hab 1 and before I corrected it, the moon shuttle and Hab 2 crashed into Hab 1, and killed everyone. thankfully I had quicksand so I reverted and landed. THEN, I encountered the undocking bug which had been the reason for failure in the first two missions, one of which killed two kerbals and the other of which was able to reach orbit around the moon and await rescue. However, when I quickloaded after landing, my shuttle glitched into hab 2 and destroyed itself (and, needless to say, the hab). Also, hab 1 glitched and never recovered from the first crash and remained destroyed. so all in all, 10 kerbals killed by the kraken. (See Edit) If I can recover the quicksave, I will continue the series but dear god, no more building bases.\n\nSmallFatFetus\n\nEDIT: Pretty much resolved this. Managed to separate the shuttle from the hab in a very controlled fashion, (nope) and land (crash) a totally flyable (crippled) Mun Shuttle. Rescued the crew and brought them home. Everyone is safe now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T04:47:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SmallFatFetus**\n  \nUpdate"},{"CreatedByName":"C1maCat","CreatedById":121247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T18:15:53Z","Content":"You should check out the mod Procedural Fuel Tanks! Not only does it let you make tanks with the size and shape you want (normal, cones, spheres etc) but even more relevant to your install it lets you pick what texture you want it to be. This way all your rockets can really look special, as you can choose between the many different textures, or import your own. Anyway, might want to give it a look, as it also saves tones of RAM allowing you to use better textures."}]}
