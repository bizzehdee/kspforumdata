On the third attempt to land the moon shuttle and its payload, Hab 2, The kraken struck, just as it had before. Mechjeb was landing because I can\u0027t see through the cloud of smoke from the engines and it reduces my fps to a crawl (Bye bye, Hotrockets!). But apparently It didn\u0027t realize that there was something underneath that was adding weight (Hab 2) and it was landing right on top of Hab 1 and before I corrected it, the moon shuttle and Hab 2 crashed into Hab 1, and killed everyone. thankfully I had quicksand so I reverted and landed. THEN, I encountered the undocking bug which had been the reason for failure in the first two missions, one of which killed two kerbals and the other of which was able to reach orbit around the moon and await rescue. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EHowever, when I quickloaded after landing, my shuttle glitched into hab 2 and destroyed itself (and, needless to say, the hab). Also, hab 1 glitched and never recovered from the first crash and remained destroyed. so all in all, 10 kerbals killed by the kraken.\u003C/span\u003E (See Edit) If I can recover the quicksave, I will continue the series but dear god, no more building bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmallFatFetus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Pretty much resolved this.

Not only does it let you make tanks with the size and shape you want (normal, cones, spheres etc) but even more relevant to your install it lets you pick what texture you want it to be. This way all your rockets can really look special, as you can choose between the many different textures, or import your own. Anyway, might want to give it a look, as it also saves tones of RAM allowing you to use better textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
