I also know that you personally think that placing the landing gear where you have makes the shuttles \u0022Look Cool\u0022, and that you have sworn to never break the \u0022Rule of Cool\u0022. And that\u0027s all fine, these excellent craft are your creations and you have every right to make them however you want. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, if you observe the \u0027real\u0027 Space Shuttles (may they R.I.P.), you will note that the rear gear is quite a bit farther to the rear of the ship, and there is one very simple, very LOGICAL reason for this: It is so that the Shuttle can come in nose-high, flaring into a \u0027wing in ground effect\u0027 state, and touch down on the runway without striking the tail surfaces. The farther forward the rear gear is located, the lower the possible angle-of-attack. The only other solution would be to make the landing gear taller, but first of all that would look silly, definitely violating your \u0027RoC\u0027, and also it would create strength, weight, and packaging issues inside the structure, so that\u0027s why they don\u0027t do it IRL. They make the gear a reasonable length, and they locate the wheels farther back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am actually a bit confused as to why you resist this reasoning, mainly because the only reason for such placement (aside from how it looks, I mean) would be to make the craft easier to rotate for takeoff, like a jetliner needs, which you\u0027ve clearly stated several times to several different posters that this shuttle, just like with all \u0027true\u0027 Shuttles, isn\u0027t designed to take off like an airplane, only to land like one. So, the question becomes, \u0022Why would it matter if the rear gear were located farther rearward, if the ship would and should never take off like an airplane?\u0022 If anything, it would make the thing a HELL of a lot easier to land, right? I have no idea how many people have posted on this thread about how hard this is to land, and I\u0027m betting that they don\u0027t mean \u0027it\u0027s really hard to find and line up with the runway\u0027, although I\u0027m sure that\u0027s part of it. No, I think the problem is more along the lines of \u0027everything is going great until I actually LAND, but whenever I do, the back end of the Shuttle breaks off and explodes, which in turn causes the rest of the plane to turn into a fiery pinwheel of death as it careens down the runway\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I may be using just a touch of poetic license there with that last part, but I think you get my point. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I still really dig everything you\u0027ve done for KSP, and the only reason I don\u0027t have the complete KSO installed right now is that I\u0027m having a severe problem with parts-bloat, mainly because I WANT ALL THE PARTS!!!

And, since the KSO Phase I couldn\u0027t handle full 2.5 meter parts, it was kind of a \u0027do I really REALLY need it?\u0027 question. But now that the Super 25 is out, I\u0027m pretty sure that it\u0027s going to stay in there permanently.

You fundamentally misunderstand the functionality of the main gear when you consider it the \u0022rear landing gear\u0022. The main gear holds the weight of the shuttle. Nose gear cannot hold that weight; main gear can. It\u0027s a *structural* thing. In KSP, you get used to the idea that all landing gear is about the same in weight capacity, but that\u0027s not even close to the truth - for instance, the real Space Shuttle nose gear can support under half the weight that either main gear can support, and less than a quarter of what the left and right gear together can support. Nose gear is mostly there to balance a craft; you don\u0027t use it for large loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen looking at the Shuttle landing gear, note that the center of mass is between 65% and 68% back from the front of the craft (the main gear must be behind here). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe claim that it came in at high flare is wrong; it had an angle of attack of around 15 degrees on touchdown, which is in line with commercial airliners.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
