For a suicide burn landing we need to counter orbital velocity and then counter velocity built up from falling under gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to use the SUVAT equations. Specifically: V^2 = U^2\u002B2as Where V is final vertical velocity, U is initial vertical velocity, a is acceleration due to gravity (9.81m/s/s) and s is distance (orbital height). From a stable orbit we can assume U to be 0m/s and so can be safely removed and the formula rearranged to give: 2as = V^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 1000km, we can calculate: 2*9.81*1000000m = V^2 = 19620000m/s.
