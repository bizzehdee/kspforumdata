Over the last few months since the inception of the new \u0027Community Team\u0027 things have changed a great deal, and for the better. So I thought I\\\u0027d take this time to throw some numbers, praises, and thanks at all of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Forums CMC*: 29,880\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Forums CAMC*: 541 or roughly 2% of CMC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Forums CPUC*: 4928 or roughly or 16% of CMC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does that all mean? Basically, roughly 18 to 19% of the \u0027Current Member Count\u0027 has posted at least once, if not more. That\\\u0027s not actually all that bad when you think about it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunity Team Stats:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Active Global Moderators: 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Global Moderators Total: 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Active Forum Moderators: 14\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunity Team Moderation Actions in last 30 Days: 1,080 or 36 Moderation actions per day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Reporting Timeline is from the 27th of May to the 27th of June)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do we define Moderation actions? Simple, everything we do from a ban, to a warning, to OP requested forum deletion, movement, etc. Anything we do on the team is cataloged by the Moderation Log software. This also includes things you guys do on your own, like deleting your own threads. I\\\u0027m also sure you\\\u0027re wondering why our activity count has increased, and it\\\u0027s simple really. As was stated earlier in this post, as the community grows so to does the Community Team have to grow. The increase in our actions, is directly linked to the increase in user count. From spammers, to problem users, to simple OP requests and the like our activity has to match that of the Communities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all in all, the amount of actions we have to take in regards to the actual number of users posting on the forums, is very very low and that\\\u0027s\\\u0027 a good thing. We want you all to remember that we are here to help make these forums a safe and fun place for all to enjoy KSP as a whole and maintain a level of connectivity with the Dev team in a safe environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all in all the forums are looking good. You now have an active, trained, and happy Community Team dedicated to keeping this community the great place that it is. We are also very proud of the entire user base for keeping our work load light, abiding the rules and conduct guidelines and generally being awesome people. Thank you all and keep on posting and having fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Damion Rayne\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmericas Team Lead\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraining and Recruitment Lead\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T19:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow we\\\u0027re good can we have RP back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoking, of course. :b\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T19:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we\\\u0027re good can we have RP back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoking, of course. :b\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short....\u003Cspan\u003ENO!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, I kid I kid. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T19:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdited - since the picture no longer links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA cake for you all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean... good you are here.
