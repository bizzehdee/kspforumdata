For one or 2 docking, you can do with only the RCS included in the command pod/can. Some docking rings even include a small RCS canister. Dedicated RCS tanks are only usefull for reserve or if you intend to do a lot of docking without refuelling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonnally, I use RCS on lander ships to let them dock with local space stations (I\u0027ve one around Mun, Minmus, Duna and projecting one for Eve and Vall). I never needed additionnl RCS tanks. 15 units of RCS is enough to dock a 20T lander once.

You\u0027d need six Vernors just to do complete translation, and even more if you need them to handle rotation as well. For a large ship though the extra thrust of the Vernors makes a difference, you\u0027d need to spam RCS blocks to get the same performance and that undoes the part count benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as a shuttle goes I think either can work.

That\u0027s actually not how they work. There are two differences from what you\u0027ve said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The usual purpose is not to work by gyroscopic stabilization, but to rotate a ship without expending reaction mass. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(They can be used as gyroscopic stabilizers for one axis, but then they\u0027re generally called \u0022momentum wheels\u0022.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Even if they did use gyroscopic stabilization, they wouldn\u0027t work the way you describe-- specifically, having two wheels at 90 degrees wouldn\u0027t hold the ship immobile. Instead, the two of them working together would act like a single wheel at 45 degrees between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn their normal \u0022rest\u0022 state, reaction wheels aren\u0027t spinning at all. Let\u0027s say you decide \u0022I\u0027m pointing in \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E direction, when I want to be pointing in \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E direction that\u0027s rotated by N degrees around the X axis.\u0022 In that case, you turn on your X-axis reaction wheel and start it spinning. While it\u0027s spinning, the ship rotates in the opposite direction (due to action-reaction). When you reach the desired orientation, you stop the wheel spinning, which also stops the ship at its new orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the above assumes that the ship has no angular momentum when the wheels are at rest (i.e. the ship isn\u0027t tumbling). If the ship \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E have a tumble to it, then the only way you can fix that is by expending reaction mass. (This is where KSP reaction wheels diverge from reality.) If the tumble is very slow, you could \u0022temporarily\u0022 eliminate it by spinning up your reaction wheels in the opposite direction to compensate... but then you\u0027d have to leave them permanently running (and drawing power) in order to maintain that state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is a \u0022real-life rocket physics\u0022 question rather than a gameplay one, so \u0027nuff said here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T21:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T20:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFunky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NFunky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027ve recently been messing with shuttle\u0027s, which has made me hyper aware of post-orbit delta-V.
