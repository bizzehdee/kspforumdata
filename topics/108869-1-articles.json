Nevertheless, this is my amateurish attempt at the Reaction Engines \u0022Skylon\u0022. This is the passenger variant, with possible cargo model in the future. I took a few liberties to get it to fly and actually make orbit. It\u0027s made with minimal mods (Custom Landing Gear and FAR. Stock aerodynamics still too draggy). Aerodynamic instability is...minimal and is primarily a problem only in the subsonic range. I\u0027m sure somebody else could have done a better job, but I\u0027m proud of it because FAR has destroyed just about everything else I\u0027ve tried to build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/t31.0-8/11206862_10153275990183166_8003019688485306402_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211206862_10153275990183166_8003019688485306402_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/l/t31.0-8/11147029_10153275990163166_4873061757437608345_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211147029_10153275990163166_4873061757437608345_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
