I need a mod that will allow me to switch between vessels in kerbin atmosphere and apply physics live to the previous section. Preferably with hot keys, but buttons can work too.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nsecondly, i\u0027ve\u00A0noticed than mods like TCA will stop working on a craft once that craft is no longer under your direct control; even if it\u0027s enabled and your settings remain unchanged. Is there a way to apply TCA settings to ALL operational vessels with thrusting engines, or on a vessel per-vessel basis and have it REMAIN operational?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot\u00A0specific to TCA necessarily, but any autopilot mods that can handle VTOL craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
