For some reason I can\u0027t manage to brake when landing. I\u0027ve got a plane I built out of MK2 parts, and I\u0027ll hit the runway doing about 60 m/s. I\u0027ll hit the brakes and slow down at the rate of about 1 m/s/s. I end up going off the runway quite a ways before finally coasting to a stop. My first thought is that somehow my brake action group got messed up by adding airbrakes, but it looks fine. Essentially there is no way to actually land the plane on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not remember ever having such an issue before. Usually the brakes were fairly effective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T23:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi AengorKerbow, there is a bug, if you right clicked the wheels the brakes lose their torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find a fix for this in Claws thread stickied above in the Support section, where this was moved to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
