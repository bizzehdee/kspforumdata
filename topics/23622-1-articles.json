Common sense would dictate that since Escape Speed is independent of direction, flying straight away would let you put the most energy into escaping Kerbin, rather than putting the horizontal energy, perpendicular to where you want to go, into making an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssume that you\u0027re not using a Munar/ Minmus assist, as that just complicates things further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malaugrym","CreatedById":57689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T01:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor ion powered devices, I generally make use of the Oberth effect and make several orbits, adding a little juice each time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your assumptions based on common sense, I would revisit them, and think hard (no offense intended).

By burning horizontally you can add velocity without fighting gravity at all. On Kerbin you have to get above the atmosphere, so you can\u0027t simply burn horizontally straight off of the launch pad, but on the Mun (or other small bodies with no atmosphere) this sort of approach is viable.

If you need to escape in a particular direction (very likely) then a very slightly less efficient method is to launch into a low altitude orbit (70-80km) and then finish your escape from that orbit. With a good ascent profile this is only a bit less efficient than a direct ascent, and it is far easier to get right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
