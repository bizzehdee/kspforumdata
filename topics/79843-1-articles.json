I have what I hope is a relatively straightforward question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say I launch a rocket that uses a pair of booster assemblies (one on each side). The boosters are to be used at launch and jettisoned in-atmo when their fuel is spent. With the recent addition of career mode, it\u0027d be nice to safely recover these boosters and get the money back. My question is: is there a way to have a booster deploy a parachute on it\u0027s own \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E separation? I know that I could technically fit each with a probe core and control them that way, but the reality is that there simply isn\u0027t enough time to switch to each, pop the chute on each, and then switch back to my mid-flight \u0022main\u0022 rocket without chancing a catastrophe. Anyone figured out a way to get the booster assemblies down safely?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBT85","CreatedById":114980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T14:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to get your main rocket high enough that you can use the probe core to \u0022control\u0022 your boosters on the way down before your rocket starts to fall back again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T14:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can activate the chutes in the same stage with the separators.

It depends on how high you drop your boosters, but this will allow it so that your chutes pre-deploy later, so this will work in some cases, although not all. I strongly suggest the DebRefund or StageRecovery mods, as they allow recovery of spent funds from dropped boosters and stages, and are necessary for reusable space programs in my opinion and should . These mods allow \u0022debris\u0022 that goes out of loading range, with parachutes on them deployed, to be recovered. Doing this completely stock is borderline impossible, and the cost of SRBs is dirt cheap, so if you are bent on completely stock, a solid only first stage is a good idea, as nothing else could feasibly be as cheap for the thrust you get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Russoft\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Russoft\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe issue isn\u0027t opening a chute.

The real world track record for reusable spacecraft is very bad so far, with the shuttle never having been cheaper than 1-shot rockets.

Their initial attempts to use parachutes on their boosters worked not better than those on the shuttle\u0027s SRBs, so now they\u0027re trying to fly the things down.
