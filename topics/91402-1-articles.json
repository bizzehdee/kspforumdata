I have made a KSP install with exactly the same parts as the demo, so to do much he\u0027ll have to get the full version. It is partly to see if he can run the latest version too.

Interestingly, I just looked, and there is no specific rule against it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd besides, the demo is good enough to demonstrate the game. My friend, who adamantly refused to try the game, insisting it was trash, played the demo last game, and bought it the day after. Anecdotal evidence is best evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WololoW","CreatedById":114478,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T17:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesnt sound legal, and also doesnt sound like you will be accomplishing what you want as the latest version runs differently than the demo Because there are more parts, not in spite of it. Taking out parts will make the game run completely differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T17:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cant condone it of course, but neither can I stop you, but it is supposed to be one copy per person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to have to close this, but I do hope your friend has fun and joins us here soon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
