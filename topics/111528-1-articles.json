I have it rigged so the bottom orange tank drains first, then to top. This keeps the weight in the front of the ship the entire flight and helps counteract the offset thrust from the skipper. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull throttle off the pad. Launch is the new standard, turn a few degrees right of the pad and it almost flies itself to space. Usually just minimal input is needed to keep it on course. The SRBs stage ~8km. From there its a gentle turn and climb to space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets a little unstable as the last of the fuel drains out of the orange tank and it isn\u0027t heavy enough to help keep the nose down. The last ~500 units of fuel in the orange tank the ship wants to pitch up. I put a vernor to help out that last bit, but its the only time you need it (along with some light throttling). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2.9k dV is enough to get to minmus, mun, or anywhere else in Kerbin\u0027s SOI and return. I\u0027ve rescued multiple kerbals in one go with this ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry is super easy. This thing has so much surface area you can come in a little \u0027belly up\u0027 and it slows down quickly. She glides to a gentle touchdown every time. I\u0027m rather proud of her balance. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle was built in the SPH then imported to VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the thrust right, the Skipper has been rotated 1 Shift-click notch on the rotation gizmo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the fuel flow right, it has a fuel line from the top tank to the shuttle, and from the bottom of the shuttle directly to the Skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can even replace a Mk2 fuel tank with a Mk2 cargo bay and it can carry a small payload to space. I\u0027ve found I can play around with the number of cockpits and cargo bays with some decent variation of ships and equally similar/easy launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even have a mini shuttle version using FL-T800 tanks with a Swivel as the core stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible and I hope this inspires you! Its super rewarding to build a shuttle-like craft.
