I\u0027ve built a very large \u0027tanker\u0027 ship to hold large amounts of Kethane, and act as a mobile space-station core for the other components, It took me awhile to get this into space, when I discovered it has a rather massive flaw, it\u0027s nearly uncontrollable in space. I am still rather new to the game, but I\u0027ve read up on the basics of design and I can\u0027t really figure out why this ship isn\u0027t working right, I\u0027ve posted a screenshot bellow. The CoM and CoT are aligned, but as soon as I throttle up in space the ship begins pitching harshly up or down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas? :\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0zHGISF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220zHGISF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T03:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Misaka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T23:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played with Kethane (Well, a week or 2.
