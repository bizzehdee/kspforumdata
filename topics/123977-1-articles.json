So I\u0027m now re-requesting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP should have a computer \u0022space race\u0022 option, where a computer player will automatically perform launches (based on preset settings)(Basically it would be like a DMP game where two players exist within the same universe but yet do not constantly interact). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe computer would be under its own science and funding. However with science, the rule is with every complete tier (in the normal tech tree)(a whole vertical row), the other player gets that tier auto unlocked as well, which is nice in the beginning but you have to manage your own science later on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for gaining money (funding), there would be a set of \u0022pool missions\u0022 where both players can take them on (such as satalite deployment, kerbal rescues, probe/rover deployment, etc etc)(compatible with ConteactPacks), however achievement missions (such as enter orbit, achieve X altitude/speed, etc) would remain for both players, and the other couldn\u0027t accept/complete the contract before the other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Victory\u0022, would also be preset. Victory can be anything, such as landing on the Mun, Duna or capturing an asteroid, or crashing into X body. It would also be set as to whether or not the game would end or continue after victory has been achieved or failed. It could also be possible to achieve several objectives, such as first on the moon then land on Duna, then whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be even more awesome if you could have more than 2 computers, you could have more than 1, you could have 8 (there will be a maximum). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be some form of a launch mechanic, I\u0027d say (if KerbalKonstructs/KerbinSide or KCT isn\u0027t installed) that when the computer wants to launch a vehicle, that for one Kerbin hour that the player must occupy their time, they can time warp or (what\u0027s preferred) switch over to another mission such as a rover or colony mission and collect science/funds by completing missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see ts idea mod compatible, with these mods-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKCT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalKonstructs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbinSide\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContractPacks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand more...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfc this is a major task for someone to take up, but it\u0027s an age old task which has been needed to be done since the days of old. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo who\u0027s up to it?
