On this point (on the interplanetary transfer) I saved the game and go on. Unfortunately Bill, Bob and Jeb where unsupervised in warp mode for a too long time and in the next moment the ship crashes into Duna\u0027s surface \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay then, load the save game I thought.
