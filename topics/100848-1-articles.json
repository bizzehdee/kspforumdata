On this point (on the interplanetary transfer) I saved the game and go on. Unfortunately Bill, Bob and Jeb where unsupervised in warp mode for a too long time and in the next moment the ship crashes into Duna\u0027s surface ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nOkay then, load the save game I thought. But it wasn\u0027t there anymore!\n\nIs this a bug or a feature? I would understand the logic, but now it\u0027s hard for me: I have to ascend three ships, do two dockings and the correct interplanetary burn again ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI\u0027m playing for about 100h now and till a few days with mechjeb for the liftoffs. Sadly I have not this much time I would like to play, so the mission took me about 2 or 3 weeks to this point...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T11:04:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 11:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by floyD**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:40:01Z","Content":"There are different ways to save your game. How did you save it?\n\nYou can save your game from the KSC scene by pressing ESC to get the menu.\n\nIf you press mod\u002BF5 (Alt\u002BF5 in windows) while in flight you can create a named save. You can load a named quicksave while in flight by pressing mod\u002BF9.\n\nIf you press F5 while in flight you create a quicksave. This can be loaded in flight by holding down F9.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!\n\nAnd welcome to the forums!"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:51:35Z","Content":"heres some more info on the save games....as you progress your career the save files gets massive and becomes over 100,000 lines of code.

You should try the mod [Kerbal Alarm Clock](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220289-kerbal-alarm-clock) which reminds you to set alarms like changing SOI or a a maneuver node.\n\nTo your question about saves must be mentioned that if you use quicksave F5 it will of course be overwritten by the next time you press F5. Same for just saving the \u0022persistent\u0022 file, which will be saved every time you leave the game and also from time to time while playing. The mod above will also make copies of your saves, so you have more choice to switch back to."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:08:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E heres some more info on the save games....as you progress your career the save files gets massive and becomes over 100,000 lines of code.

The modules are where it stores information such as science collected, where the craft has been, and how much fuel the part contains. It\u0027s a rather integral part of saving the actual state of the game. Pointers back to just the module name don\u0027t help the game know what state the module was in. Also, the module/part name actually *is* the pointer. As for parts, storing the part name is one tiny portion of the needed information. The game still needs to know rotations, what\u0027s connected to the part, and so on.\n\nPart of what makes the game files so big is that all of that information is stored as plain text. However, if it wasn\u0027t stored as plain text you\u0027d never be able to get in there to edit a line to save a kerbal. There definitely is some redundant information, but it might not be as much as one would think.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T00:33:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As a side note, KSP stores all those parts so that it can also hold those modules.

I actually overlooked that part of resource states in saves. Such as having 50% electric charge. Otherwise the game would always point to a generic electric charge module with 100% at all times. Ill take lines of code any day if that means I can edit saves ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"floyD","CreatedById":138714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T11:03:44Z","Content":"hey guys,\n\nI think I understand the logic now and in the meantime I fly the mission from the old savegame - the problem is that I save with F5 I think.\n\nThank you alle for helping."}]}
