Engines, more than you need. Gigantic wings, more than you need, preferably one-part wings to keep part count and flexibility to a minimum. Drain and fill your fuel tank(s) in the VAB and make sure the center of lift is behind it by a bit, even whilst empty. Then stick a gigantic tail-rudder on the back and some gigantor wings on the sides of the top of that. Fiddle a bit with the wings\u0027 exact location (you may or may not want them directly out from the sides of the craft,) stick some canards on the front and fiddle a bit with the rotation of the canards and the tail plane until your center of lift is behind and a little bit above your center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the procedural mods\u0027 procedurally-generated control surfaces to add whatever surfaces you need and make them gigantic, and then add some airbrakes (possibly from B9 Aerospace) to the tail plane and the rear fuselage/back of the wing roots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E get you airborne, and flyable, if not exactly perfectly stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an advanced tip I like to use, too, that\u0027s especially useful for takeoff. Assuming you\u0027re using a tricycle landing gear arrangement (two in the back, one in the front,) and have the gigantic landing gear from B9: use two long landing gears in the back, to the sides, and two different, one short and one long, the front. The long landing gear in the back should have its wheels farther from the plane\u0027s body. (The S2 Wide chassis from (I believe) B9 is ideal for this, but you can bodge something together, I\u0027m sure.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is take off with the front landing gear long, but land with it short. Taking off with the front gear longer than the rear gear will put the nose and the wings up, giving you bouncy, bouncy lift that will get you off the ground and flying. That\u0027s good on takeoff, but the exact opposite of what you want on landing, so when you come in for a landing, lower your gear and then retract the long gear, so it comes down on the short one. That puts the nose down, angles the wings down, and the same principle that was giving you lift when trying to take off is now giving you downforce, thus planting your wheels firmly on the ground. Toggling all those airbrakes briefly can also help you take off if your tail-plane is very high: that much drag at the back of what is essentially an enormous lever will pull the nose into the air, and away you go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T08:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne lesson that I learned: if it\u0027s hard to control, chances are your tailfin isn\u0027t big enough.
