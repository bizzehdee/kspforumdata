It looks like a great combination of the realism of Orbiter and the sandboxy/construction-oriented/game qualities of KSP. However, I am having some trouble opening the game. With the modpack installed, I have only gotten the game to open once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese same issues have occurred with both the modpack plus several of the recommended mods as well as just the modpack in an otherwise clean, isolated install of 32-bit KSP 0.25. When the game boots up, it gets past the initial loading bar and opens the menu screen where Realism Overhaul starts working its magic on the solar system. At this point one of two things happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe game crashes while the solar system is being rearranged\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe game hangs on a particular step in the solar system tranformation process (usually on the VertexColorMapBlend step for one of the bodies), where I have let it sit for over an hour with no change\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I can\u0027t post attachments, so I\u0027m not sure how to go about sharing the output log from one of the crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried searching for other instances of this problem, but haven\u0027t come up with anything.
