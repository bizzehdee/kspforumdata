I am unable to do this so I\u0027m trying to edit the part files of BDA so that i can do so. I\u0027ve looked and i cant find any tags that would possibly apply to the ability to attach parts radially or not, if anyone can help me here that would be much appreciated. I believe the ability to do so would help with making crafts based on a real life equivalent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-21T01:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t use that mod but took a quick look at one of the missiles and think your looking for\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EattachRules = 1,1,0,0,1     and  make it look something like attachRules = 1,1,0,1,1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EAttachment rules\nattachRules defines how this part attaches to or allows attachments from other parts.

The tags are: \nstack - Can your part be stacked on others? \nSrfAttach - Can your part be placed onto a surface? \nallowStack - Will you allow other parts to be stacked on your part? \nallowSrfAttach Can other parts be placed on the surface of yours? \nallowCollision - A special one: Can your part be placed if part of it is intersecting another part? \n\nNote that you can also force parts attached to this part to attach in a specific symmetry. \n// symmetry rules: 0=1x, 1=2x, 2=3x, 3=4x and so on...\nstackSymmetry = 3 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
