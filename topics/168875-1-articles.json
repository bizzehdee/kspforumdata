entry for the duna mobile base mission i had. 8 kerbals, 6k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0capacity. and wheels, which would be added later in duna orbit (i hadn\u0027t researched em yet)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto explain a bit more upon it: some science modules are located under the mk 1 plane cockpit. the part in the back is the transfer stage, then i also have a puddle connected to a docking port with fuel transfer allowed on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe back part with the\u00A0parachutes and aerodynamic cones is there to be replaced with a ore refinery after i research it and i collect my mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntransfer went quite fine. gathered some research for the wheels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

difficulties i managed to dock on the wheels (only took me about 4-8 hours :P)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think it looks pretty nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit might be not 100% super practical since its assymetry and stuff but i find it important to make my craft look a little nice and unique.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow for the hard part, which compared to the rest wasn\u0027t that hard but still pretty hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022d77a1609-ed20-496c-8986-8f37d8ea84b4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njust need to fuel it up and collect my rewards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\none slight problem however\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndue to its weight and assymetric nature stacked atop of the fact these honestly just idiotic rover wheels inability to turn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni can only turn one direction and cannot climb the slightest inclination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseriously who designed those wheels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow do i even use them if duna rejects them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyways this is what i have been up to the last few days in

will make the frame with wheels on one bit and the base i will stick ON TOP of it. like a tank and a
