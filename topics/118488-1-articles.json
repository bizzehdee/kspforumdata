In other words, when you reach orbit you should have very little extra fuel left (at most enough to deorbit the upper stage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for thrust, you want a lot of thrust in the lower stages to get the rocket up to speed until you\u0027ve done your gravity turn (this is what SRBs are for), at which point you just need enough thrust to keep pushing out the apoapsis so you don\u0027t fall back into the atmosphere.

However, to reach orbit you need high thrust engines since you don\u0027t have the time to wait for ions to push you over the period of several hours. You\u0027ll be reentering in matter of minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh thrust is also needed for lift off, since you want to spend as little time as possible fighting gravity and pointing up. The trouble is that high thrust engines usually don\u0027t have a particularly good ISP. You need to find the balance, which is not hard if you use a mod such as KER which automatically calculates your thrust to weight ratio, burn time for the given amount of fuel, dv, etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving that information, you can try different configuration. Small fuel tank with small, weak, but high ISP engine, or larger tank with more powerful, but less efficient engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the problems don\u0027t stop there. Let\u0027s assume that a larger tank with larger engine is more suitable for the final stage. You now have to make all the lower stages larger too. This means that for a small increase in payload (or final stage), your previously smallish rocket has now grown to be a monstrosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, like probably everybody else (right?), build the rockets in reverse, starting with the last stage. After building the payload (for example a probe with all the stuff it needs to accomplish the mission) I try to figure out the minimal dv required and try out different fuel tank/engine combinations to achieve that dv, while keeping the total mass as low as possible, while still keeping an eye at TWR if I need the probe to land somewhere. Overengineering is a sure way for a rocket to fail. Moar boosters!! applies only for the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T06:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBigger might be better... but efficient is always best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd welcome to the forums Nomial_Control! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T12:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I have an example where bigger isn\u0027t better, my space station shuttles.
