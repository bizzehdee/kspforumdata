The shorter time you take the less fuel you wasted on the climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for pitching, that depends on your intermediate engines. With nukes even 5 degrees may be too much at times. If you take a Rhino, just jump above the atmosphere at 45 degrees then circularize. Anything in between - angles in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, gain as much horizontal speed on jets as you can. You don\u0027t really need to switch them off, just let them sputter out - but start the rockets if you start losing speed. Even if the jets provide 0.1TWR at some 24km, that\u0027s still 0.1TWR extra on top of whatever the rockets provide. If you can get a 3% increase of thrust that\u0027s still 3% more than with jets off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the trajectory is always more or less flattened \u0022S\u0022 - steep climb, horizontal speedup, orbital transfer, circularization. Depending on your TWR it may be more or less flattened; with poor TWR you\u0027ll be going very flat, with excessive TWR the initial climb and the orbital climb will be quite steep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoSlash: Nice work with the Skipper. I\u0027d probably go with Mainsail, better TWR and ISP, but that\u0027s all personal preferences. My only actual criticism is aesthetics.
