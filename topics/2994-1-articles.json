Now I\\\u0027ve run into an issue now that I really can\\\u0027t figure out, so I might as well get some help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced SAS: In the previous version the worked fine when driving RCS and control fins (forgot the official name), but now, whenever I turn on the SAS it will try to make a minor correction by turning the fins as far as they can go, or continuously firing the RCS. Almost immediately the rocket passes the heading the SAS was trying to reach, and the fins or RCS flip full on in the other direction. This results in violent rocket-breaking vibrations in the atmosphere and emptying the RCS tank in a minute while out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the? Why is this happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA possibly unrelated issue, but also something I\\\u0027d like to ask about: space planes. They worked fine before, and in .11 they are incredibly unstable and extremely prone to flipping or stalling. Even outside of the atmosphere they slowly tumble. Was there a change in the aerodynamics code? Can this be easily fixed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-16T19:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ASAS got changed to use angular momentum, which means the gains are far too high for larger rockets. Try turning them down in the .cfg file (I\\\u0027d suggest cloning the standard ASAS module and work on the copy).
