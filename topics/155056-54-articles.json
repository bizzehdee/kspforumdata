It accepts a number of resources to convert any one of them at a time or in parallel into a pseudo resource \u0022_Cooler\u0022 and then ablates this resource to quickly dump its gathered heat. Instead of costing lots of EC, it costs you in payload capacity to bring along its accepted input resources if you choose to use this part.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn Thor Tech, my far future TCS (thermal control system, based on the real concept of EM shield ablator) adds the ablator module to nearly everything that doesn\u0027t have it already, with differing strengths depending on the use cases of each part, and feeds these ablators with the \u0022_Shieldnir\u0022 pseudo resource. The protected parts don\u0027t need to hold this resource themselves. Shieldnir, by nature, is \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E and is meant for use on landers and ascent craft on Eve and harder planets, not for use on Kerbin. The challenge of Shieldnir lies in: bringing along enough of the Shieldnir generators; dealing with their masses; avoiding exceeding their output capacities in the extreme phases of ascent and reentry; protecting your power sources from overheating while feeding the Shieldnir generators; protecting parts that get less protection as not all parts can be equally shielded.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn Rational Resources, my implementation of a thermonuclear turobjet is that it uses a converter with Core Heat to produce ThermalPower resource to be consumed by the engine module. The part is configured such that when it runs for a long time at high thrust (or extreme thrust in thick atmo like on Eve) the converter\u0027s core temperature will rise due to the radiators being saturated by both core heat and engine heat production. As this happens the ThermalPower production capacity goes down (loss of efficiency due to overheat). When the engine reaches a certain fraction of its heat tolerance the converter shuts off and the engine itself gets to run for up to 10 seconds on its ThermalPower buffer before \u0022cooling down rapidly\u0022 and having a flameout.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn Rational Resources, there is a \u0022blacksmith\u0022 system that simulates the science lab having a forge and its furnace inside, and the kerbals carrying motlen material with them on EVA (let\u0027s say, via industrial heat resistant hoses and spray guns) to refill Ablator on heatshields for interplanetary landers that try to use their heatshields more than once. The heatshields themselves receive a converter that accepts \u0022work,\u0022 ThermalPower and an input resource or two and generate Ablator within themselves for this since Ablator is non-transferable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn Rational Resources, not only the Blacksmith system... but the Restock MonoProp APU also uses CoreHeat primarily for its spooling effect.

I could take a 33 ton rover down the runway with the KF RBI Track - Mole without them breaking before the tower. Now I still find the tracks get too much speed on dirt land and hitting failure time too easily, like on the way to the water once I bounce off the end of the runway. Is it possible to make a bar pop up on screen, much like heat does, so that when failure time gets above half way, we have a visual reference without having to keep the wheels pinned? If not that, a sparking animation or sound effect to play?

Now it did pop up to a 35\u00A0on a steeper hill with just over 36, but is a bit high since 36 m/s is 80mph. Looking up tanks, I\u0027ve found that some can go 60mph, even 70mph, but 25mph is typical. That leads me to thinking maybe you are on the right track, but instead of adjusting maxMotorTorque, to lower maxRPM or have the default gear ratio start at 1.25.

Lowering that by 25 and raising max speed to 30 actually felt about right and realistic. But I know that\u0027s subjective to a lot of different people and others will weigh in with different opinions. It leaves the normal achievable speed on flat land at 20, but allows you to pick up some speed on hills without going boom, or needing to watch the speed like you are in a school zone.

other tagging system to have the vessel module grab references to the fields to be controlled right out of the sub-modules, and then dynamically construct the UI based on the available fields and any persistent data that was available regarding grouping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe technical aspects of the back-end were never too much of an issue for me, I think I already have a basic controller class in the repository that does most of this; my problem has always been designing a UI that made sense, in KSP.\u00A0 More so the difficulty of creating GUI\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ein\u003C/em\u003E KSP rather than creating a functional design; I could easily create something usable in WPF, Unity-GUI, or any other number of UI systems, none of which are available
