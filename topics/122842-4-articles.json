I\u0027d think getting the payload to 3,000 m/s velocity at 60 km would not be unreasonable... at which point the second stage should easily be able to achieve orbit (the space shuttle\u002B ET had about... what, 8,000 m/s of delta V? the remaining 1,000-1,500 m/s was supplied by the SRBs?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see no reason that the second stage couldn\u0027t be a smaller reusable craft too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T07:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESeems to me like what you described is a high altitude hypersonic stratolaunch...
