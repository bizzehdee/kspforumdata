A time of peace when the Thrillmaster kept balance between the Fuel tribes, Booster kingdom, LFE nation and Jet nomads. But that all changed with the LFEs attacked. Only the Thrillmaster could master all four rocket types. Only he could stop the ruthless LFEs. But when Kerbin needed him most, he vanished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA hundred years have passed and the LFE nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe left to fight against the LFE nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Thrillmaster was never born into the jet nomads and that the cycle was broken, but I haven\\\u0027t lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the Thrillmaster will be reborn, and will save Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I ripped this directly from the intro to a certain TV show and changed a few words.
