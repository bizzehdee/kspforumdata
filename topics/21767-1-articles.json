Think about firing a gun: the higher the velocity of the bullet, the higher the recoil, or, in our case, the thrust you get out of a given mass of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Americans don\u0027t like metric units, so in order to make the specific impulse globally comparable, the rocket scientists did something arbitrary: They divided the specific impulse by the gravitational acceleration g, and got a specific impulse that is now measured in seconds (for which one can also come up with some physical meaning as Harvester showed above). Of course, this only makes sense at the Earth\u0027s surface, because g is not a universal constant. But they don\u0027t care, they always divide by g, no matter if the rocket is on the Earth\u0027s surface or somewhere in outer space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, assuming that the Kerbals have made the same choice to scale with g as we here on Earth, we can extract the density of their fuel from the equation stated by Tamerlane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust = (fuel rate in kg/s) * g * Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich we can convert to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust = (fuel rate in L/s) * density * g * Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edensity = Thrust / ((fuel rate in L/s) * g * Isp) = 60,000N / ( 1.5L/s * 10m/s^2 * 800s ) = 60,000kg*m/s^2 / ( 1.5L/s * 10m/s^2 * 800s )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E= 5 kg/L\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich is five times the density of water.

The issue is the prediction of the trajectories, which are useful in itself, but become essential for time warp: For the patched conics, there are analytical solutions you can apply, while with the n-body problem you\u0027d have to run a complete numerical simulation over the whole trajectory at each frame to keep the trajectories up to date.
