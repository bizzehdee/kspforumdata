When i first got the game,. it was not very severe. But as i sent more and more ships up, it got to the point where if i sent up a ship, during the gravity turn, it would get so laggy my ship would literally break itsself. I think it may have something to do with overheating, but im not sure. I have a Lenovo Laptop with i5... but thats pretty much all I know about it.

It\u0027s important to check your debris count too. Also, one more test you should conduct. While launching, try not to look at the horizon at all and check your FPS. Then, launch again and watch the horizon of Kerbin the whole time you are going up. If the second proves to be the case, I believe it\u0027s your GPU bottlenecking itself, and you may need a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WPENG730","CreatedById":97260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T00:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a gaming noob, so this is my fault kinda.... so 2 questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 How do you check FPS? :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 How do you get rid of GPU bottleneck?
