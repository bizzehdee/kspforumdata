Since I use an Android phone, and already use its integrated Google Calendar for other stuff, I decided to start adding stuff there, then realized that this calendar can be shared and collaborated on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m here to ask you guys if you would like to see this thing happening? The idea is to have a few individuals that would have permissions set up so that they can add and edit events and the everybody can enjoy the timely reminders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stuff that would be included in this calendar are some interesting launches, possibly\u00A0the ones being streamed live, and any other interesting milestone or stage in an ongoing space mission, such as an interplanetary probe entering the orbit around its target planet or landing on it, an interesting experiment being conducted... anything interesting, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I\u0027ve started populating the calendar and got up to the end of the first week of February, listing only launches, nothing else.

If yes, I would certainly need help with population the calendar since there is a lot going on.
