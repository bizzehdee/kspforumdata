I tried organizing it in a similar manner as the B9 parts, where there is one or two textures in a folder, and then multiple .mu files and their corresponding .cfg. The parts don\u0027t load at all. I don\u0027t even see an error message in the debug menu.\n\nSo my question then is is there a specific standard that needs to be followed in order for this to function, or a specific file type or cfg setup?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T20:53:17Z","Content":"I do this for my FusTek Station Parts - basically, it\u0027s recommended that you put all the CFGs, models and the shared common textures in the same directory."},{"CreatedByName":"Shryq","CreatedById":130095,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T22:13:35Z","Content":"That\u0027s exactly what I said.

I think I figured it out. no .mu at the end of the file path and for whatever reason it didn\u0027t like my 0.2.0 in the file path either."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T23:59:28Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s probably the culprit.
