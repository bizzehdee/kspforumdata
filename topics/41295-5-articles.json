Even if warp drives are possible, the universe must have some way to prevent them from going FTL, otherwise, the basis of our physical reality- causality- breaks down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some relatively simple thought experiments you can perform that proves this to be the case. Imagine a flat bed train car. In the center of the car, there is a light source, a light detector, and a bomb. The light source sends out two beams of light at the same time, one towards the front of the train car, and the other towards the back of the train car. At each end of the train car is a mirror that reflects the light back towards the source/detector/bomb. As the source, detector, and bomb are in the center of the flatbed car, the two beams of light return to and strike the detector at the same time. The detector is configured so that if the return beams of light strike it a different time, the bomb detonates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that no matter your frame of reference, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethe speed of light is always measured to be the same\u003C/span\u003E. So, we put the flatbed car in motion down the train track, and set up two observers, one observer on a train that is running parallel to the flatbed car, and one observer who is standing on the ground and watching as the train flatbed car passes by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first experiment, we simply fire a beam of light in both directions. Let\u0027s say that the flatbed car is moving at 10 m/s down the track on a foggy morning where it is possible to actually see the beams of light as they travel through the air. The observer on the ground sees both beams of light travelling 3x10^8 m/s relative to the landscape upon which he is standing (his inertial reference frame) of course, but \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car above which they are travelling\u003C/span\u003E, the beam of light moving in the direction of the car\u0027s motion is going 3x10^8 m/s - 10 m/s, and the beam of light going in the opposite direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 3x10^8 m/s \u002B 10 m/s. Thus, the observer on the ground witnesses the beams of light strike the two mirrors at different times. However, on the return trip, the beams of light are now travelling the opposite directions, so the one that was going 10 m/s slower than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car is now going 10 m/s faster than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car, and vice versa. So they make up the \u0022time lost\u0022 on the return trip, and end up striking the detector in the center of the flatbed car at the same time. Thus, the bomb does not go off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this experiment, the observer travelling on the train that is paralleling the flatbed car and matching its speed sees exactly what you would expect- the beams of light both move at 3x10^8 m/s relative to the flatbed car (which shares his inertial reference frame), the beams of light strike the two mirrors at the same time, and return to strike the detector at the same time, preventing the bomb blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, let\u0027s say that instead of a mirror at each end of the train flatbed car, we have replaced each of the mirrors with a light detector and an instantaneous communicator. Instead of a beam of light returning to the central detector from each end of the flatbed car, an instantaneous signal will be sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the observer on the train paralleling the flatbed car, sharing the flatbed car\u0027s inertial frame of reference, witnesses the two beams of light leave the emitter, travelling at the same speed relative to the flatbed car, strike the detectors at the same time, which sends the instantaneous signals to the central detector at the exact same time, preventing the bomb from detonating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, what does the stationary observer on the ground see?

Even if warp drives are possible, the universe must have some way to prevent them from going FTL, otherwise, the basis of our physical reality- causality- breaks down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(LBB I say. LBB.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some relatively simple thought experiments you can perform that proves this to be the case. Imagine a flat bed train car. In the center of the car, there is a light source, a light detector, and a bomb. The light source sends out two beams of light at the same time, one towards the front of the train car, and the other towards the back of the train car. At each end of the train car is a mirror that reflects the light back towards the source/detector/bomb. As the source, detector, and bomb are in the center of the flatbed car, the two beams of light return to and strike the detector at the same time. The detector is configured so that if the return beams of light strike it a different time, the bomb detonates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that no matter your frame of reference, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethe speed of light is always measured to be the same\u003C/span\u003E. So, we put the flatbed car in motion down the train track, and set up two observers, one observer on a train that is running parallel to the flatbed car, and one observer who is standing on the ground and watching as the train flatbed car passes by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first experiment, we simply fire a beam of light in both directions. Let\u0027s say that the flatbed car is moving at 10 m/s down the track on a foggy morning where it is possible to actually see the beams of light as they travel through the air. The observer on the ground sees both beams of light travelling 3x10^8 m/s relative to the landscape upon which he is standing (his inertial reference frame) of course, but \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car above which they are travelling\u003C/span\u003E, the beam of light moving in the direction of the car\u0027s motion is going 3x10^8 m/s - 10 m/s, and the beam of light going in the opposite direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 3x10^8 m/s \u002B 10 m/s. Thus, the observer on the ground witnesses the beams of light strike the two mirrors at different times. However, on the return trip, the beams of light are now travelling the opposite directions, so the one that was going 10 m/s slower than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car is now going 10 m/s faster than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car, and vice versa. So they make up the \u0022time lost\u0022 on the return trip, and end up striking the detector in the center of the flatbed car at the same time. Thus, the bomb does not go off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this experiment, the observer travelling on the train that is paralleling the flatbed car and matching its speed sees exactly what you would expect- the beams of light both move at 3x10^8 m/s relative to the flatbed car (which shares his inertial reference frame), the beams of light strike the two mirrors at the same time, and return to strike the detector at the same time, preventing the bomb blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, let\u0027s say that instead of a mirror at each end of the train flatbed car, we have replaced each of the mirrors with a light detector and an instantaneous communicator. Instead of a beam of light returning to the central detector from each end of the flatbed car, an instantaneous signal will be sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the observer on the train paralleling the flatbed car, sharing the flatbed car\u0027s inertial frame of reference, witnesses the two beams of light leave the emitter, travelling at the same speed relative to the flatbed car, strike the detectors at the same time, which sends the instantaneous signals to the central detector at the exact same time, preventing the bomb from detonating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, what does the stationary observer on the ground see? As already stated, he sees the two beams of light travelling at different speeds \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car\u003C/span\u003E- the one going in the direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 10 m/s slower than the speed of light \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car\u003C/span\u003E, and the one going the opposite direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 10 m/s faster than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car.

For the beamed power propulsion method, you would need to construct the maser/laser facility in space, and probably some massive mirrors maybe 1000 km across to keep it focused on a distant spacecraft. That would be a fun, long-term project. Also, a big fusion or fission-powered spacecraft capable of going like 0.1c or maybe 0.2c would probably weigh many thousands of tons and need orbital assembly. Maybe it could require asteroid/Mun/Jool mining to get cheap helium 3 for the fusion pulse engines. It\u0027s just a much more serious, time-consuming, and realistic challenge than cheating with FTL, and would keep us occupied for a much longer time- in other words, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ebetter gameplay\u003C/em\u003E, as it gives players a long term, ultimate goal to shoot for. Instantly zipping around the procedurally generated galaxy visiting procedurally generated world after world would quickly get boring when there would be no aliens, no monuments, nothing really. You could set up a few colonies, then what? With realistic interstellar travel, it would be a monumental challenge to build your first colony, and that would probably be enough to keep you occupied for a year or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest issue with beamed-power propulsion, like a laser pushed light sail, is that your sail needs to be HUGE to be realistic- like 50, 100 km across. Currently we face the 2 km size limit on ships, IIRC. You also need giant focusing lenses/mirrors, maybe even on the scale of 1000 km across. And of course, maybe something like a gigawatt of laser energy. Such things are not necessarily impossible to create, if you manufacture vast amounts of very thin and strong reflective material in space (which you could use for both the sails and the mirrors), and have giant solar arrays to collect the power for the laser(s). Again, you would need a massive and well-funded space program to do such a thing, giving players a long-term goal that would keep them coming back to KSP for months. When you achieve the ultimate goal and send your first interstellar probe, you will enter the leagues of the elite few KSP players who managed to reach the stars.

Civilization at least had different starting conditions and opponents in your way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you still have not provided a causality violation case that I could not handily deconstruct. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, let\u0027s do a different experimental setup. Same setup actually, but we replace the bomb with a balloon, and hide the balloon under a box. If the instantaneous signals return at the same time, then the balloon is not popped. Otherwise, if the signals arrive out of time with each other, the balloon is popped. Neither the observer on the ground nor the observer on the train actually watch the experiment either, as they are both too busy wasting time posting on the KSP forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, so immediately after the experiment is performed, the guy on the train pulls the emergency brake. He gets off, and joins up with the guy on the ground. They do not know the state of the balloon, whether it was popped or not. Walking hand-in-hand, they walk up to the box where the balloon was hidden, and lift it up. What determines whether the balloon was popped or not? What selects whether the reference frame of the moving train was the correct one, or the reference frame of the guy on the ground was the correct one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour \u0022explanation\u0022 requires that there is a preferred frame of reference in the universe, or some mechanism exists to select a preferred reference frame. That goes against 100 years of scientific theory. The basis of Relativity is that there \u003Cstrong\u003Eno\u003C/strong\u003E preferred frame of reference. Relativity, and in particular, this concept of it, that all frames of reference are equally valid, is considered to be a fact by all modern, respected and peer-reviewed physicists. By saying you \u0022laugh\u0022 at this concept, you are saying you laugh at some of the greatest intellectual giants of the 20th and 21st centuries.

A decision can not be reached without one, but even without a conclusive decision the outcome is still definite, especially with a binary problem - in the existing case, if the system uses FTL communication to poll all existing observers and is unable to come to a conclusion, the balloon will remain unpopped. If the system takes a decision to pop the balloon as more important than to not pop it - i.e. if there \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E no system, and it just accepts the first kill signal it receives - then the balloon will pop, as at least one observer will see the system fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObservers don\u0027t go into different universes.
