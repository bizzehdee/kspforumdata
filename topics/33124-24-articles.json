I read a few of the earlier posts about is and I noticed the one saying that it was just a magnitude reading. Would it be hard to re-enable the read out with vectors? That is, with measurements for both fore/aft and dorsal/ventral offsets? (Port/Starboard seems a little redundant; most players usually have this axis in symmetry/balance, but maybe add that as well to be safe?) 3 numbers with arrows to indicate offset directions? (Hmm... Fore/Aft and Dorsal/Ventral might be hard since both sets would usually use UP/DN arrows...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a small request.
