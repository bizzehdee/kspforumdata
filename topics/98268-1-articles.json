I have a question. What mod do I need to make surface ships? I have heard from some through Facebook that all I needed was to use air intakes.

I also recommend for any vehicle that is in contact with a service you get a mod that either changes the stock UI, or offers an additional UI, which will dislay your speed in more common terms, specifically Kilometers per Hour or Miles per Hour, it\u0027s just very easy to not have a good grasp of how fast you\u0027re going when looking at meters per second, for example 60mph, highway speed in much of the USA, is 26.~m/s, it\u0027s pretty easy to make a rover that goes 20, with mods I\u0027ve made rovers that do 90m/s, throw a rocket on and you can make a rover do 300m/s, that\u0027s almost 700mph, more than ten times highway speed.

For the most part your boats will need to be driven by jets, maybe aircraft propellers from the handful of mods that offer them. The great thing about these is that water in KSP isn\u0027t actually water, it has this weird attribute of being full of air; jets, and air intakes, work just fine underwater. Because reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EFinally, I\u0027m not entirely sure, but my understanding of the stock behavior and mods in play says that your boat will have no real inclination to go.... forward. Boats don\u0027t normally go fast enough for normal aerodynamics effects to be powerful, and I\u0027m not aware of anything that would make hydrodynamic effects.... exist. Boats will be kinda like pucks skimming over the water, they\u0027ll just as readily go sideways as any other direction\u003C/span\u003E, and turning will be dangerous at any significant speed. turn slowly, and slow down when you want to turn. Probably a good idea to use MechJeb\u0027s Smart SAS to keep the ship pointing in the right direction for long trips as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I have discussed it with Ferram and keels should work just fine in water, they should behave not as if they\u0027re travelling through air, which would make them underpowered and useless; but as if they\u0027re travelling through a dense water like fluid; thusly they will have sufficient force available at boatly speeds to be useful. Because this is true, rudders will also work for steering, and hypothetically hydrofoils should work fine. You will require FAR for this though.
