The smell was reminiscent of the time he had spent up there, on the Mun, years ago, but it also had a strong touch of... something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb! he shouted. What the heck did you do to my suit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb turned around with an inquisitive look on his face, already in full attire - except the helmet. He seemed to try to remember something, and then burst out laughing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh well, he exclaimed, now THAT\u0027s a funny story. You remember that time I took the new guys \u0027up for a little test drive\u0027 of the Icarus rocket and got them up to 100 kilometers, spinning super fast, and then one of the guys couldn\u0027t stop screaming his face off, and when he came back we realized he had a little uh, \u0027accident\u0027? Well...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aw man...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill put a leg up his suit, with extreme precaution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d be putting it back on, Jeb justified. You should learn to have more fun in life.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If having more fun is making recruits pee in other people\u0027s flight suits, I\u0027ll pass.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It wasn\u0027t pee.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey stepped outside. Hundreds of cameras were rolling under the scorching heat of Kerbol, as all of Kerbin watched their heroes walking purposefully towards the revamped Poseidon IV shuttle, attempting what no Kerman had attempted before: a controlled, precise landing on the Mun surface to bring back one of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9I9qp.png\u0022 alt=\u00229I9qp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelman and Duncott, who had stepped out on the surface of the Mun to never come back, were assumed lost - no communication had been received from them, and their spacesuits could only hold oxygen for a few days at most. Their emergency remote EVA - which could be controlled from the capsule, and were implemented in case a Kerbonaut lost consciousness - were unresponsive. Of course in the official reports, only Tomson had gone to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is fishy, Bob had said at the time. And Bill, Jeb\u0027s craziness has clearly rubbed on you. No way I\u0027m restepping in that nightmare factory.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Bill and Jeb, after not so much deliberation, had been the ones chosen for this extremely delicate mission. On paper, their mission was simple: retrieve Tomson Kerman, escape the Mun orbit, and return to Kerbin. Unofficially, they were also to report on the mysterious phantom debris that were orbiting the sub-surface\u0027s satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomson had been communicating his findings on a daily basis. It seemed the number of PDs had been reduced to only two according to his readings. He seemed to get more unstable by the day, grumbling incoherences and often passing the time by banging his head against his helmet. The \u0022thud, thud\u0022 sound of it had soon became a sinister staple in the command control room: he was holding it together, but not for much longer. The Center\u0027s psychologist was attributing both Tomson\u0027s present behaviour and the missing Kerbonauts\u0027 to \u0022stress-related brain trauma\u0022, and training of new recruits had been adjusted to include seemingly impossible scenarios... such as encountering objects orbiting inside the Mun. Jeb was of the opinion that \u0022their minds just broke, it happens you know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the debris was moving inside the Mun quite independently from the surface, they had a very small window of time to make the trip, get Tomson, get all the info they could get their hands on about the PDs, and jet back to Kerbin. The good news was the debris\u0027 orbit had finally brought it under sunlight; it was actually going to stay there for a while, facilitating its study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb strapped himself in the pod with an elated smile on his face, and watched as Bill did the same, a little more begrudgingly. He patted his shoulderpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on man, this is going to be SWEET!\u0022 Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s how you call an absolutely dreadful flight with a borderline sociopath to a small lump of rock thousands of klicks away?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lighten up, Jeb scoffed. You could be in the monitoring room, sitting next to our half-brain dead friend here. Hi Bob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Screw you, Jeb, I hope you crash!\u0022 Bob said in a light-hearted tone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I love you too!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good luck you crazy bastards.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill had to admit, for all his reserve, that his blood hadn\u0027t pumped in his veins in this fashion for a long time. Even Bob, who, as Jeb gently stated, had been rather extinguished since they came back from the Mun - immediately requesting a transfer to another branch of the Space Program - , was showing hints of excitement towards the mission, planning courses, even devising a more precise back radar to study the debris\u0027 movement under the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All systems a go, Jeb said, verifying the controls for one last time. Command?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Command stand-by for launch in ten...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines started heating up, and soon roared. Around them, dust and smoke was forming and rapidly evaporating in a chaos of white flashes. The rocket lifted itself, ever so slowly at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were going to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aZg2m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aZg2m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the while they were travelling to the Mun, Jeb kept Tomson occupied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So man, what\u0027s new in your life?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uuuh...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m telling you there are ALL SORTS of freaky girls just waiting to jump on you when we go back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, ha ha. Ok. Cool.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, I don\u0027t think you understand. There was a SEA of sexy vixens at the launchpad, throwing us their panties and screaming \u0027Give this to Tomson!\u0027 It was pretty awesome.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb had neglected to mention that the panty throwing had been, first of all, mostly directed at him, and secondly, was the handiwork of two or three old grandmas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So we\u0027re going to have one hell of a party when we come back. Listen, have you ever been to Kerlifornia? It\u0027s beautiful out there. The sea, the babes, there are stands where you can buy sunglasses for like 3 kerbucks, and a literal infinity of surprising drinks like the Space Kraken, do you know what that is?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, no...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, see, they take this whole gallon of vodka and a big bag of Skerttles...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis went on for a few hours. The Mun was closing by. Bill piloted a textbook orbit around it and managed to get their landing point within two kilometers of Tomson\u0027s capsule.

No. Nononononono. Your wife\u0027s fat butt is a \u0022problem\u0022. Not having clean underwear when you\u0027re about to go on a date with Kerstina Aguilera is a \u0022problem\u0022.

They exploded and disappeared. But I\u0027m waging it beats ramming through the surface of the Mun repeatedly. If anything we OWE him the right to explode. Plus, this is an unknown phenomenon. It might not react the same way with organic tissue.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill pondered. Jeb was right. Considering all the unknowns, they had two choices: leave Tomson there, or try to go save him.

You\u0027ll be in the pod, controlling Tomson\u0027s jetpack, and I\u0027ll get as near to him as I can to guide you. Now go.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill put on his EVA suit, and stepped outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6sMZL.png\u0022 alt=\u00226sMZL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Should take me about a minute to get there,\u0022 Bob said, activating his jetpack. Jetting was a tricky business in general, and the uneven surface of the Mun made it all the more treacherous. The, shall we say, \u0022experimenting\u0022 nature of the average Kerman made the whole thing downright dangerous, but Bill, except from a brief period in college, had never really been the experimenting type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter their successful Mun landing, an inordinate amount of the time had been spent analyzing and re-analyzing their various personalities, to try and recreate the feeling of the \u0022Three Munketeers\u0022, as they had been called in the press. Jeb had been the fire, of course, and Bob the earth. Bill was the water, flowing through obstacles, never putting himself in an unsafe zone, always leaving a door open. Of course to Jeb, this was beyond infuriating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, trajectory please?\u0022 Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There is...

One, two, three... There you go. He\u0027s stable. Control, he\u0027s stable. I\u0027m taking this baby down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb slow burnt to the surface, passing Tomson on the way. His limp legs were jittering with every shot of jetpack. Lifelessly, Jeb thought. Jittering lifelessly. His heart sank, as he felt the landing gear bite into Mun dust. Hard as he tried, this wasn\u0027t a game anymore; it hadn\u0027t been since Duncott and Melman had disappeared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go on Bill. He\u0027s at two hundred, descending. Nice and slow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomson\u0027s body hit the ground softly. Jeb tried a half-hearted shout out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Tomson? You there, buddy? He\u0027s not responding, Control. Bill, I\u0027m gonna go check it out. Look out for those debris in the meantime, it seems we created one more when we let our lower stage go.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was good news to the monitoring room back home: it meant the phenomenon was probably repeatable. But it was of little comfort to Jeb at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gY5a0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gY5a0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s over man, it\u0027s over... Jeb said, to no one in particular. Let\u0027s get you outta here now...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe scooped the lifeless form in his arms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aren\u0027t you gonna buy a guy a drink first?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomson opened his eyes slightly. They were bloodshot, his skin was pale as a skinny top model. But he was alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Dude, Jeb said, a tear rolling down his cheek, we are SO going to have the party of a lifetime when we come back!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomson got agitated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No. No we can\u0027t go back. We can\u0027t go back. We can\u0027t.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe struggled with Jeb\u0027s grasp, escaping him. Jeb tried to laugh it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, we kinda have to, buddy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We can\u0027t. We can\u0027t.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay okay okay. We\u0027re not going back. Alright? We\u0027re not. I brought a few cases of beer, we got umbrellas, we got beach balls... You know what, we\u0027re good right here. Okay?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat seemed to calm him down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay,\u0022 Tomson said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But we have to get them from the pod, okay? I\u0027m gonna need your help. Bill, you joining us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uuuh sure. Gimme a minute. Checking out something here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomson started walking towards the capsule, mumbling to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The light... We can\u0027t go back... We have to be here... We HAVE to be here...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What the hell is going on, Jeb?\u0022 Bill\u0027s voice cracked in his headphone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I got no idea, but I think it\u0027s going to be an interesting flight back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey boarded the capsule. By that point, Jeb was honestly considering giving Tomson a taste of his own medicine, and knocking him out for at least long enough to de-orbit the Mun, and get on with their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that he didn\u0027t know how Tomson felt. Okay, he had NO idea how Tomson felt. Being the first Kerman in the Mun was totally something else, and the kid probably deserved a break from the multiple orbits he did right to the Mun\u0027s core. But he knew the feeling of wanting to stay, wanting to see, wanting to understand. And it seemed about the Mun like there was so much more to understand than they initially thought. Was it too much? Jeb had always asked himself the question. Going for \u0022too much\u0022 had always been his style though. That was why he had become a Kerbonaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hatch door opening made him jump. Bill\u0027s head popped in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dqwKh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dqwKh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe removed his helmet, his eyes glowing from a mixture of excitement and apprehension. He shot a quick nod at Tomson but, oddly, it seemed like there was more important matter at hand. He went to the screen and typed a few keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I uplinked a picture from Tomson\u0027s capsule. I started to go through the pictures they took from last mission, wondering if we missed something, I thought he had died, so...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe turned to Tomson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...Sorry.\u0022 He continued: \u0022Remember how we went over those pictures again and again back at Control?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb remembered vividly the countless nights spent perusing every pixel of every single of the hundreds of pictures from the PHADE mission. Both Bill and him had them committed to memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, Bill said, I found one picture that wasn\u0027t at Control.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dkmHs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dkmHs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When I saw it I just thought it was bizarre and out of order. But then I remembered what PHADE-1 told us, right before they entered the PD hot zone. That they saw something unusual...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...By the crater, cut Tomson, rocking himself. We have to be here. By the crater.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So check it out. It\u0027s right there.
