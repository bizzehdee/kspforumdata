I had trouble with my computer after upgrading my video card, it was intermittent and it was the power supply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the chinese made power supplies rate the power as if each circuit is pulling maximum load, while other circuits are at nominal load, in reallife situations their maximum power rating is between 75% and 90% of the stated wattage. To overcome this problem calculate all the load at a particular voltage, then get a supply that is at least 25% and make sure the power supply produces the wattage under all circumstances, not just ideal circumstances for that voltage. This will fix your voltage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue is that many cooling fans have step amperages depending on the temperature on the board, if the thermostat is broken this will cause the fans to run either all of the time or never. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you computer shuts down, don\u0027t necessarily blame the component that looks like is may have issues, the power supply is a first choice of many experts and also myself. Over the last 2 decades I\u0027ve seen alot of failures and my typical long-lived computer generally has been through 2 power supplies. This was not the case a decade ago, mainly because it was senseless to keep a computer over 5 years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cyrious","CreatedById":146131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T02:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brethern\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brethern\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah speaking of which I\u0027m using speed fan right now, are there any better ones?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpenHardwareMonitor when it works is pretty solid.
