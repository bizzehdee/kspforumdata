If you are you might want to look there. Also how old is the power supply?\n\nPower supply is composed of several components, frequently the voltages are produced off different wirings of the same transformer, but individual segments can short between two wirings producing inadequate voltage. I had trouble with my computer after upgrading my video card, it was intermittent and it was the power supply. \n\nMany of the chinese made power supplies rate the power as if each circuit is pulling maximum load, while other circuits are at nominal load, in reallife situations their maximum power rating is between 75% and 90% of the stated wattage. To overcome this problem calculate all the load at a particular voltage, then get a supply that is at least 25% and make sure the power supply produces the wattage under all circumstances, not just ideal circumstances for that voltage. This will fix your voltage. \n\nThe other issue is that many cooling fans have step amperages depending on the temperature on the board, if the thermostat is broken this will cause the fans to run either all of the time or never. \n\nIf you computer shuts down, don\u0027t necessarily blame the component that looks like is may have issues, the power supply is a first choice of many experts and also myself. Over the last 2 decades I\u0027ve seen alot of failures and my typical long-lived computer generally has been through 2 power supplies. This was not the case a decade ago, mainly because it was senseless to keep a computer over 5 years."},{"CreatedByName":"Cyrious","CreatedById":146131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T02:00:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah speaking of which I\u0027m using speed fan right now, are there any better ones?\n\nOpenHardwareMonitor when it works is pretty solid.
