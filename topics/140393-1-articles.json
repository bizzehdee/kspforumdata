However, I have a problem with procedural parts. Every part in the pack appears in the editor and performs as advertised with the exception of the Procedural RCS tank. The RCS tank will not even appear, in sandbox or career mode. I thought it might be because real fuels is blocking it? There is the file in Procedural Parts which gives the liquid fuel tank the parameters it needs for real fuels, but I didn\u0027t see anything for the RCS tank. Any ideas on why this is happening? Thanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torih","CreatedById":144304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T09:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it\u0027s caused when running real fuels, the rcs tank is there without it.
