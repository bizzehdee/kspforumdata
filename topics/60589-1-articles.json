Each engine you add increases the mass and thrust. So you have less dV but faster burns. If you want to do an optimal burn you need to burn retrograde while the mun is at apoapsis and then wait for it to come back around. If you just don\u0027t care and go for a spiral orbit you need twice the dV I calculated earlier, so about 700m/s. Unless you plaster half the mun in Nerva engines it is going to take a long ass time though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know your flightplan it isn\u0027t too hard to calculate it exactly, just calculate your acceleration as a function of time and integrate it to get your dV.

Continuous burn would actually cause you to gently spiral down, requiring a much longer delta-V. Of course, if you are only time-limited and not fuel-limited, then that doesn\u0027t matter.

A simpler explanation is that the gravitational constant in the KSP universe is higher and that rockets are made out of the same form of matter that makes up planets (as in real life). This second set of assumptions is simpler, but under it, we don\u0027t know what the masses of the objects in KSP are, as the estimated masses presented in the Wiki are from the objects\u0027 gravitational effects. Since the planets are on rails, it is impossible to determine what the actual gravitational constant is (as we can\u0027t apply a force to a gravitating body and determine how much it accelerates to determine its inertial mass), and as such, we cannot answer how much it would take to de-orbit the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another explanation though- if we take the \u0022planets are on rails\u0022 part of the engine as an actual physical trait of the KSP universe. Since no force we apply to the planets appears to change their courses, one could conclude that the masses of gravitating bodies in KSP is extremely high, so high that any delta-V we impart on them is below the measurement floor. This would mean that gravitating bodies (even Gilly) are nearly infinitely massive and gravity is nearly infinitely weak to compensate. So the amount of impulse it would take to de-orbit the Mun is nearly infinite.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T16:05:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
