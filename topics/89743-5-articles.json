For example, I think probes should be the first thing to use, then a manned flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, that science still is a click fest and grind. Science should be a sorta of investment (like the rep system) where we need to develop part to build for example, a engine. Also, it should be time related, I mean, instead of click, click, click, get 300 points, spend 280 points in engines and fuel tanks, it should be done in a way to investigate materials, making experiments with real application in the tech tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if we get a soil sample, lets say from the mun, we then put that soil sample in the lab and do several tests, which could result in other advances like new composites or something like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual science tech tree, should be called engineer tech tree, where the parts would be available after done x amount of experiments in the labs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this, crew reports, soil samples, go cans and so on, are not enough. Why research a solar panel for example, if we do not know if that panel will be strong and efficient enough in the cold vacuum of space? With the research of new materials, experiments could be done to test materials or a combination of materials the player could choose to see what materials would be best to construct a certain part that would be used in the assemble line together with other developed parts to construct the final part that would attach to a rocket or a space ship or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we need science labs both on the ground and in space (orbit), engineer division to manufacture those blueprints that we got after testing different materials and science data gathered by missions. A simple probe measuring pressure, temperature or other things, that data, could be used in the development of experiments in the science labs. A combination of procedural generated experiments would yield a certain result and a blueprint would be \u0022looted\u0022. The engineer team would build that item using a the \u0022looted\u0022 blueprint and then we could test it on a rocket. If that part works or not, it\u0027s anyone guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make the game more science oriented and with a procedural generation system, every game would be different adding new things to try and discover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA launch of a telescope for example, to scan other planets or other starts (if that will ever be implemented) could give valuable research to be applied in experiments in the science labs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, we would need several science branches to test different results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T16:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, Max just tweeted about the upcoming update.

This to represent Science inexorably progressing in other ways away from KSC, and also to give those who are struggling another option to help themselves out (ie: worst case, they could just fast forward through time to gain a few extra science points they need. The drawback would be that if they\u0027re playing career mode, some contracts may have expired). But that\u0027s just a thought, and one I\u0027m not too bothered about one way or the other. I am VERY much in favour of Cpt.Kipard\u0027s \u0027tech-star\u0027. On the subject of different tech trees, ISTR when I played with teh KSP Interstellar mod, it allowed the loading of different tech trees. I can imagine thet it might not be simple implementing a tech-star if the system is intended to deal with tech-tree\u0027s, but if the tech-progression system could be made flexible enough to allow for tech stars as well as tech trees, then that\u0027s the main problem sorted for everyone, I\u0027d think.

Basically our general scheme here gives you a lot of flexibility in what you research, but the limited number of \u0022slots\u0022 means you can\u0027t go *too* far in any particular area. Although to do that, I think you\u0027d want to have the \u0022slot\u0022 unlocks be across the board, rather than per-tech-type. Otherwise, as Kipard says, it\u0027s just a different name for spending science to get the next part you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact a pretty obvious idea would be to have one\u0027s general technology level -- whether implemented in slots or some other way -- tied to the R\u0026amp;D center building\u0027s upgrade level. (In in-game terms, once you upgrade your R\u0026amp;D generally, you now have better materials, design techniques, etc. that allow you to go beyond certain limits for all of your part types.) That\u0027s sort of what that building upgrade does today, but it makes a lot more sense with the techsplosion tree since the current tech tree sort of limits how far you can go in any area already by \u0022virtue\u0022 of its somewhat nonsensical groupings. With a fully flexible tree, having that limit on technology era makes more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
