I like career mode, and I like doing the science, but I found it too hard to design viable launch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after my restart, I managed to design a very solid launch vehicle for putting light comsats into GEO. Just last night I put a fourth one up into a 36km orbit completing my initial relay network. It is pretty stable, though they drift a little. Getting a precise geostationary orbit seems to be impossible in KSP, or if not impossible, very very very very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fun i\u0027ll post some pics/videos tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a lot of fun with this so far though so a big huge thanks to Nathan, Faeram, and everyone else who has contributed to the realism revolution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis weekend i\u0027m going to read up on building custom parts and see if I can maybe get some new engine models for making things a bit more real!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Russian 1021","CreatedById":101141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T21:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehello all, was wondering ifsomeone could post a download for there gamedata for ro, ive been having trouble getting it to work, and im not that paitient.
