Windows-only applications, so this excuse is not as valid today as it was 5-10 years ago. The extra expense of a Mac will never be worth it to me as long as they continue selling the same hardware for twice as much money, so the next new machine I buy will definitely be a Linux box, either from Zareason or System76, or I might put it together myself.

Having the desktop on one hand and the Metro UI on the other is like having two different operating systems that work in very different ways using very different graphical cues and functional pradigms. Every time you switch from one to the other, you have to mentally switch from one OS to another, it\u0027s like switching incessantly from a Mac desktop to an Android smartphone, or from one language to another, or switching from a driving a car to riding a bike. Although most computer-savvy folks can figure it out, it remains distracting and takes your mind off of what you were trying to do (the function) to force you to think about how you are going to do it (the form). In the long run, the lack of consistency and the fact that a lot of it is driven by hidden gestures is just time consuming and mentally exhausting. For example, on the desktop, moving the mouse wheel up and down typically scrolls the document you are working on up and down. In Metro, scrolling up and down scrolls left and right, which is confusing, illogical and breaks everything you\u0027ve learned since you have been using computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a tablet, it\u0027s not so bad, because that\u0027s what it was designed to run on, and you can ignore the desktop in most cases. Tablets are designed for consuming information somewhat passively. However, at work or at home, people use their computers for creating and entering information and actively. They are typically more concentrated on the content that they are working and don\u0027t want to bother about figuring out hidden gestures just to print or save their work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IT industry is still dominated by non-touchscreen desktops or laptops. One of the reasons Windows 8 is a flop is because corporations have no interest in replacing their current office PCs with touch-enabled devices. For professionals who work all day on Excel, Word, SAP, or any other professional software, leaving the keyboard/mouse to raise your hand up to the screen just for the Start menu is disruptive, tiring, and just slows you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it\u0027s probably the fastest and most stable version of Windows.

The UI is the main part that users see and interact with though, and as long as it\u0027s needlessly changing patterns users have gotten accustomed to, it will take ages to make headway in enterprise settings. Enterprises want things to work and be simple to use and support (and inexpensive to purchase), power users and developers care more about function than appearances so have better options. Windows is long extinct in servers and HPC (I\u0027m amazed there are still even 3 Windows systems in the Top500), and they are definitely not immune from competition in home and enterprise use...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T14:13:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
