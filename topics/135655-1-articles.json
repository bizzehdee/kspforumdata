This requires lots of fuel for the ascent to it and the window it has to hit is narrow. I wonder if there are Kerbal, or other, ideas about how a mars campaign could be designed to minimize those problems. The great thing with cyclers is the reusability. A cycler is a permanent asset, like a railroad, which will always be improved upon and expanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest the Mars cycler rescue vehicle. It would just be alot of fuel with a rocket engine. It would trail the real habitable\u00A0Mars cycle transfer vehicle by a few days or so. If the crewed ascent vehicle misses the cycler, the rescue vehicle would consume its fuel to pick up the crew and still dock it to the habitable cycler. The rescue vehicle\u00A0would only be consumed when it has to be used in an emergency, so it is economically semi-reusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuzz Aldrin\u0027s Mars cycler is the luxury cycler, getting to and from Mars at every conjunction. But it is expensive since it requires orbital shift each time and arrives at high speeds. 7-year cycles, every third conjunction, are cheaper that way. Now, three of them probably isn\u0027t a smaller investment,\u00A0but safer if one fails and the crew can stay an extra 26\u00A0months on Mars to await the next one. In the long run three 7-year cycles could be a better return on investment since it is cheaper to supply and has lower risk. In the beginning, crewed Mars missions probably won\u0027t be afforded\u00A0more often than at every third conjunction anyway, so it could be a cheaper way to get started. \u00A0Two 7-years cyclers would be enough to do a Mars mission once every conjunction. One there, one back then wait. With SEP, more exotic cyler-like orbits are possible, but I think that it\u0027s difficult\u00A0to calculate optimums for that so I just leave that out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrew launched from Earth should use a small capsule (like Orion, I think Dragon cannot sustain the crew for long enough in the following scenaria) on a super-heavy launcher to directly reach the relatively fast habitable cycler. When approaching Mars, a four stage vehicle should be used: Orion \u002B aerocapture stage \u002B\u00A0landing stage \u002B fully fueled ascent stage (might still need a approach speed braking chemical stage too). This vehicle would use aerocapture until in low Mars orbit. This would take almost as many days as the Orion can support the crew. When landing, it carries its ascent stage which makes it possible to abort back\u00A0to orbit at any time during and after landing. In low Mars orbit, a fueled rocket stage has been preplaced. It could have a long-term habitable module as a safe haven if Mars\u0027 surface has to be left early and the next cycler awaited. The fuel of the preplaced orbiting stage would take the Orion to the cycler going home to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore each mission, the two used cyclers are resupplied, the return fuel stage in low Mars orbit is replaced, as are any emergency vehicles consumed such as the cycler rescue vehicle or the habitat in low Mars orbit. All transported\u00A0with economic SEP since there\u0027s no hurry without any crews onboard. Other upgrades of the cyclers and on Mars\u0027 surface\u00A0are also ongoing during and between crewed missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do you kerbals think of these ideas? Cyclers, rescue cyclers as backup, smallest possible crew transfer vehicles Earth-cycler-Mars-cycler-Earth, backup habitation in low Mars orbit. Landing on Mars with fully fueled ascent stage is expensive, but gives very valuable abort options during the most dangerous phase of the entire mission, and\u00A0using aerocapture could cheaply shed\u00A0the speed of even such a massive multi-staged spacecraft, I would think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone tried any of these ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-01T10:48:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2016 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LocalFluff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixing my typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superstrijder15","CreatedById":155985,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T11:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome aboard Fluffy,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really know what you mean by your cyclers, but this is definetly now what you will do in ksp.\u00A0Challenges is a place where you post a suggest for something to do, often hard. do you want us to do this? say more explicitly. no? than it should be moved to science \u0026amp; spaceflight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nme\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T12:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222487202\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135655\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459508862\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155985\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022superstrijder15\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, superstrijder15 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome aboard Fluffy,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really know what you mean by your cyclers, but this is definetly now what you will do in ksp.\u00A0Challenges is a place where you post a suggest for something to do, often hard. do you want us to do this? say more explicitly. no? than it should be moved to science \u0026amp; spaceflight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nme\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair this section of the forums is called \u0022Challenges \u0026amp;\u00A0Mission ideas.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is most certainly a Mission idea, and quite an interesting one at that.

The reason is because you can have an enormous transfer vehicle containing enough supplies for decades (so you will only have to resupply it every couple of missions), and although putting it into the cycler orbit will take a lot of propellant, you only need to do that once (and with the ideal orbital configuration, correction burns should be minimal).
