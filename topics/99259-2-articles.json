One engine on one fuel tank is easy enough, but you start having things like different engine models active, parallel staging, Apollo style landers, and it gets complicated fast. That\u0027s why KER has been actively developed for so long, and justifies needing a trained engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T16:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs I cautioned against all those \u0022Here\u0027s how Squad should do drilling for fuel\u0022 posts when \u003Cem\u003ESquad\u003C/em\u003E merely posted that there would be a way to do deep space refueling, I will continue to caution against freaking out and assuming they\u0027ll only let Engineers named Herman Kerman do it if he\u0027s seated in a Mk1 pod that\u0027s landed on Eeloo at least once since it launched.\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I see consistent about \u003Cem\u003ESquad\u003C/em\u003E is that they tease vaguely and leave stuff open to interpretation.
