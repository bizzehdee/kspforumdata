And when you\u0027re on the trashcans, you lost all the strutted parts providing thrust, so that effect should stop. If it doesn\u0027t, check if it stops when you\u0027re on liquid fuel alone - ideally in orbit (try HyperEdit, it\u0027s great for testing). If your craft tilts sideways even then, you definitely have an imbalance in your spacecraft. Perhaps you accidentally clipped a part into it so that it has become invisible. Do you remember if during construction, you accidentally \u0022lost\u0022 a part while trying to attach it? It\u0027s probably sitting inside the rocket now.

They are fine in addition to a rocket, but replacing one pair of those with tanks and T-45 engines would be a significantly better option. Not to mention, you probably have far more thrust than you need already, and substituting that for a rocket with extra dv would make this a much better flying rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
