Your RAPIER won\u0027t be dependent on oxidizer to run that way - which means your plane will have greater overall endurance. She still won\u0027t be spaceworthy with just a single intake, but at least you\u0027ll be able to make touch-and-gos on the runway.

The CoM doesn\u0027t shift much (ever so slightly forward, actually) and the design handles reasonably well, though its atmospheric flight ceiling was a bit lower than I prefer (around 27,000) and its switchover speed was lower than I prefer (just less than 1800). Landing was rough - the handling became a bit slugglish once she was lower on fuel - so I might add an Inline Stabilizer to my list of recommended tweaks for the design.

Even having the remains of the ship drop in and land on Duna and Eve for some science should go well. Jool is a different story.
