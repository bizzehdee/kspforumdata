But it\u0027s still a pole. I don\u0027t think the biomes are split into north and south poles. It\u0027s just poles. That\u0027s probably why you got zero. You already did science at the poles biome.\n\n[Duna biome](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Biome#Duna) list."},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:46:55Z","Content":"That is actually expected in this case.

Once you\u0027ve gotten that science, you have milked that situation dry, and you can\u0027t get any more (other than a tiny dribble).\n\nSo I\u0027ll bet what happened on the Mun was that you landed in different locations, which happened to be in different biomes (e.g. Highlands, Midlands, Lowlands, Farside Crater, etc.) Since they were different biomes, each one gave you a full load of fresh science.\n\nHowever, when you landed on Duna, it was your bad luck that you landed in the same biome twice. (Duna doesn\u0027t have a \u0022north pole\u0022 and a \u0022south pole\u0022 biome, just a single \u0022poles\u0022 biome that applies to both). Therefore, your first landing milked the poles dry, so a second landing on the poles didn\u0027t provide any added value.\n\nNote that Duna has a lot fewer biomes than the Mun does-- only 5, compared with the Mun\u0027s 15. Therefore, if you just plop down at random on the Mun a few times, you\u0027ll likely end up in different biomes, but on Duna you\u0027re more likely to hit the same biome again unless you pay attention to where the boundaries are.\n\nThe Kerbal wiki has a pretty good map of Duna biomes:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Duna](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Duna)\n\nIncidentally, Duna\u0027s moon Ike has a more biomes than Duna itself does (8, compared with Duna\u0027s 5):\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Ike](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Ike)"}]}
