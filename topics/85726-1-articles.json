I\u0027ve come here in hopes of finding the answer as to what is going with this. A road crew near my house recently cut a bunch of pine trees along the road. Now, I went outside tonight and noticed that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were glowing! Well, some areas near the outer ring were, and that was about it (this was right where the trees had been sliced). Shining a light on it showed nothing strange; it looked like normal wood. The color was the standard green of bioluminescent things, so this seemed like it could be it. I hoped there is somebody here who has a bit of biology knowledge or knowledge of whatever this would pertain. Whelp... if anybody knows, that\u0027d be great.

The bluish-green glow is attributed to luciferase, an oxidative enzyme, which emits light as it reacts with luciferin. It is widely believed that the light attracts insects to spread spores, or acts as a warning to hungry animals, like the bright colors exhibited by some poisonous or unpalatable animal species. Although generally very dim, in some cases foxfire is bright enough to read by.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxfire\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxfire\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see some pictures.
