These can be on the same axis with one or two powered rotors or on two separate but parallel axes. For the start it is easiest to have them on one axis with an unpowered (remove the motor in the editor) rotor or serve acting as a bearing and a powered rotor with blades at both ends powering both propeller discs. When attaching the propeller-/helicopter-/fan-blades you need to turn the 90 degrees so that the front faces into the air. Then you need \u0022deploy\u0022 them and set the deploy direction so that they give thrust in the direction you want.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPropellers are complicated! Also have a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/developerarticles.html/173-design-notes-propellers-rotors-and-ec-usage-r210/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Edesign notes about propellers\u003C/a\u003E. I prefer to keep the rotor RPM constant and change thrust by changing the deploy direction the the blades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelicopters are even more complicated! In RL too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
