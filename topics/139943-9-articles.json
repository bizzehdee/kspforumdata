Once was with a probe to Mono that ran out of propellant trying to slow down into a stable orbit around Mono, the second was with a very large manned craft with an Alcubierre drive that FTL\u0027ed to Duna but could not slow down enough to keep from escaping the planet\u0027s gravity, again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince then I\u0027ve been trying to perfect a semi-permanent base on Minmus using Planetary Base mods and EPL. The idea is to construct interplanetary ships at a station around Minmus using rocketparts provided by the ground base which is a refinery and manufacturing center.

It\u0027s really a matter of what their target market actually\u00A0is. Most games, even highbrow ones like Civ, will\u00A0hold your hand so that even if you are essentially incapable of sustained, systematic reasoning you can muddle your way through. KSP just plain didn\u0027t do that, while at the same time offering a type and level of simulation experience that was beyond anything else available for this\u00A0sort of scenario. What made it my favorite game ever, a virtue that it shared with Nethack, still perhaps my second favorite game ever in spite of its most venerable age, is precisely its sheer difficulty. I had to think hard to make things work. I had to be creative! I had to genuinely push my own\u00A0envelope of reasoning and calculation, and consequently the feeling of reward I got when I finally achieved success was unique. When I first landed on Mun successfully, I was ecstatic, jumping up and down in front of my computer. I\u00A0honestly don\u0027t think I\u00A0ever experienced that level of gratification playing any other computer game, even including the first time I\u00A0escaped with the Amulet of Yendor without cheating.

I think it is because of two things - first, I like playing career so initally I spent a lot of time farming science from the moons... Second, and more important, going interplanetary is way harder than flying around in the Kerbin SOI, but for the wrong reasons. As a couple of people pointed out, the lack of tutorial is\u00A0most probably the \u0022why\u0022, and because of that a new player\u00A0will likely need to do quite a bit of research on\u00A0things they\u00A0initially\u00A0know next to nothing about on the Internet before they\u00A0can even\u00A0attempt it and have a remote chance of success.\u00A0At least I did. Sure it\u0027s rewarding, but it requires that a person is interested in actively looking for the information in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember the first time I tried going to Duna, I built a ship, got it into orbit and tried to set a transfer burn. I\u00A0had no idea when or where to do the interplanetary burn\u00A0or how long to wait around before trying to do it or how much deltaV i would need to push into orbit before I should even try that. So I had to find out first.\u00A0I did succeed, but all the research\u00A0took time \u0026amp; patience\u00A0and even with all the necessary information, the interplanetary transfer is pretty hard and time-consuming to accomplish without mods, especially for a new player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, at first I had no idea that nuclear engines are much better for interplanetary transfer than the regular ones. Not sure if this is covered in the tutorials, but I don\u0027t think it was at least at that time.\u00A0I just thought that bigger and more expensive is probably better.\u00A0I was just wasting time trying to get the biggest thing possible into space in order to satisfy the 5000m/s deltaV requirement that I got from testing maneuver nodes. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sad truth is that first a new player will\u00A0need to find out which mods they need to make something like this to happen in a convenient way.

The one major shortcoming is the inability to see where planets will be aligned when. It is also something that could be added quite simply, as a separate building. Basically it would just contain a planetarium with the possibility of dropping a single orbit somewhere and one or two manoeuvre nodes, and fast-forwarding and rewinding to any given date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, imho, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewould\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E be a useful and relatively easy addition to the game (since the planets\u0027 paths are all on rails, it doesn\u0027t need to interact with one\u0027s save at all). It would certainly cut traffic to that alexmoon web app overnight. And it wouldn\u0027t flood the new user with excessive information, just the basics to plot missions without having to have a bunch of vehicles already in orbit or switch to and fro between career and a separate sandbox savegame.

It would provide a nice visual tool for players to explore interplanetary trajectories in much the same way that the Map screen does so well for trajectories within Kerbin\u0027s SOI.

It\u0027s really a matter of what their target market actually\u00A0is. Most games, even highbrow ones like Civ, will\u00A0hold your hand so that even if you are essentially incapable of sustained, systematic reasoning you can muddle your way through. KSP just plain didn\u0027t do that, while at the same time offering a type and level of simulation experience that was beyond anything else available for this\u00A0sort of scenario. What made it my favorite game ever, a virtue that it shared with Nethack, still perhaps my second favorite game ever in spite of its most venerable age, is precisely its sheer difficulty. I had to think hard to make things work. I had to be creative! I had to genuinely push my own\u00A0envelope of reasoning and calculation, and consequently the feeling of reward I got when I finally achieved success was unique. When I first landed on Mun successfully, I was ecstatic, jumping up and down in front of my computer. I\u00A0honestly don\u0027t think I\u00A0ever experienced that level of gratification playing any other computer game, even including the first time I\u00A0escaped with the Amulet of Yendor without cheating. I really don\u0027t want KSP to lose that magical, singular\u00A0virtue, but I have to acknowledge that this level of obscurity and difficulty may just not play to the sort of audience you need to target in a really big-time, big-dollar\u00A0release.
