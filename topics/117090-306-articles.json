Should be included in the next release.\n\n**All** \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports have been modified to use the new ModularRCS part-module, to allow for scaling, structure and fuel switching.  A few new \u0027structure\u0027 variants have been added as well (2x and 3x truss segments).\n\nService module code is progressing well.  Most features work already, but still a few that need a bit more development (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E module updating).  And tons of config-based work to do for it -- so many configs to write -- model definitions, part configs, texture sets.  I think I might be able to pull off this part series without creating a single model specifically for it.  I have enough adapter and fuel tank models of various sizes and shapes that so far I\u0027ve been able to make up a decent selection of SM body variants strictly through config file.  If that is the case (not needing any new models), these parts might well be available much sooner.\n\n(The Probe-core/satellite core series of parts -will- need new models, as I would like something other than \u0027round\u0027 for my satellite buses, so these will likely be done at some point in the future).\n\nJust about time to start discussing the next bits to be developed -- pretty sure it will be a couple sets of landing legs for the MFT-LV tanks.  Going to try to resurrect the geometry from the old LC-LEG-HVY parts, with some adjustments for the new tank geometry (mounting points mostly).  Fairly certain these will be developed as a scalable \u0027leg quad\u0027 that can be mounted on the bottom node of the fuel tank (can add a specific lower-interstage node if needed).\n\nThe second leg concept that I\u0027m going to explore is actual a combination low-profile service/cargo bay \u002B landing leg combination.  The legs, when stowed, will be stored inside some of the compartments in the service bay (the other compartments will be empty, for arbitrary storage use).\n\nAnd as I\u0027ll be working on service bay type setups for the landing legs, I\u0027ll likely at least work out the geometry for the entire lineup of MFT-LV cargo/service bays at the same time.\n\nSo there you have it -- the next \u0027official\u0027 parts will be landing legs and service bays.  Certainly not going to promise any dates or give any time-frames; can only state that those will be the next focus for new part development."},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-29T17:06:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It does and it work.

Its about 10% density increase for LOX if I remember correctly. For other fuel I do not know, some gas would likely benefit more from this.  \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, if your sub cooled liquid is allowed to chill, it will expand. Kinda of a bad thing if your tank are full! \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-30T00:24:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2017 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-30T01:11:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Cheesecake said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to add more fuel to the tanks respectively multiply the content by 1.5 per .cfg?\n\u003E \n\nTwo choice:\n\n1: If you want a specific content to be smaller you can edit ResourceVolumes.cfg end reduce ressource volume.  \n\n2: The other option is to change tank type capacity, you can edit VolumeContainerData.cfg change a existing or create a new SSTU\\_CONTAINERTYPE. Keep in mind that if you create a new one you will have to edit the part config as well to add this type as a option.  \n\nI did that in the past, but not for greater volume. I added a lightweight heat resistant tank. Damage sensitive, super expensive but heat resistant while being somewhere between the Standard and light in term of mass. Basically the perfect tank of future reusable rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-30T01:13:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2017 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"}]}
