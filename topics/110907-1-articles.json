Then I did know better and I still stubbornly stuck with stock because didn\u0027t want to deal with mods in case the were too complicated (before I figured out it is pretty much just drag and drop into gamedata folder). Finally I broke down and got mechjeb and a couple others like chatterer. But since then I\u0027ve been grabbing up mods like candy. I just want to try them all and I\u0027ve only scraped the surface. So my question is are there people who play a completely stock game and why? Because there are certain mods I just can\u0027t do without.\n\nKerbal Engineer for deltaV and other useful info (I upgraded from mechjeb after I learned all the fancy maneuvers and such)\n\nKerbal alarm clock (seriously, how can you play without this?)\n\nKAS/KIS (very useful for all sorts of things)\n\nI have also started using TAC (life support) remote tech (more realistic antennas) outer planet mods, not to mention all of the parts mods I\u0027ve added.\n\nSo once again, not to say anything against anybody who plays stock but I do want to know how you do without a mod like kerbal engineer or kac? Also, what are some of your favorite mods to use, because I would love to add some more to my list."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T15:30:06Z","Content":"I have only one opinion about people that plays completely stock: they\u0027re scared from crashes.

Part of the reason is suppose is to reduce the clutter in the VAB and on screen. The main reason is that I want to be able to test things and if something goes wrong I want to be able to report a bug, not complain and wonder what mod is causing the issue. Im like this with every Early Access title I play. I also still consider Kerbal to be in Alpha since they are still adding features.\n\nOn the other hand, a game like Skyrim I mod like crazy to customize it to my desires.

I really don\u0027t need any help anymore estimating the deltaV of a particular ship or reaching a specific orbit. It\u0027s all become second-nature to me, and gaining those skills was a big part if the satisfaction of paying for me. As to the parts mods, those have often been out of balance with the stock game, giving you capabilities that are not in line with what the devs consider proper. You can basically bypass various engineering restrictions that they consider an integral part of the problem solving content of the game by using various OP modded parts. Of course if that\u0027s what makes the game fun for you, there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. But eventually you may find yourself hungry for more of a challenge.

There\u0027s no single mod I literally couldn\u0027t play the game without, but if I didn\u0027t have MechJeb to automate repetitive tasks and give me delta-v info, KAC to keep track of multiple flights, and Procedural Fairings to give me non-useless fairings (and probably one or two other mods I\u0027m forgetting as well), I\u0027d probably get bored and/or frustrated pretty quick. And of course there\u0027s a whole suite of cosmetic mods that I consider borderline-essential as well. \n\nThat said, I do find playing the game with only stock *parts* to be an interesting challenge. That\u0027s ultimately the way the developers envisioned the game being played, after all. Adding part mods makes it a lot harder to keep the game balanced, things can quickly get much too easy. Personally, I like to either keep my parts catalog mostly stock, or balance out part mods (which tend to make things easier) with realism mods like TAC LS (which tend to make things harder). The end result is a similar level of difficulty on the whole, but a challenge that feels more realistic and less arbitrary and video-gamey. I could definitely still enjoy the game even if I couldn\u0027t have part mods."},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:07:54Z","Content":"I do both.
