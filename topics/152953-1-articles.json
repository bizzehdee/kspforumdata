I am KspNerd, and this mod promises to [eventually]\u00A0add the Cloud 1 rocket, which will be manufactured by Cloud Aerospace, a company founded by forum user tristonwilson12. I will start by adding flags with the Cloud Aerospace logo, graciously provided by triston himself. I expect to have the first iteration of the mod up by the weekend. I have models and textures for the rocket.\u00A0(also provided by Triston) \u00A0However, I have no clue how to add them into the game. If you can help, or know someone who can, please PM me.
