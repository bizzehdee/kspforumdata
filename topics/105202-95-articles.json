They\u0027ve gone to a lot of time and effort to create their mods and share them with the community.  They\u0027re under no obligation to do so.  Honestly, any author that goes to the extra effort of providing configuration files and support for people to integrate their mods with others and allows them to be customized to support special cases like yours -- should be praised for the effort.  RD has gone to that extra effort, there\u0027s a config file, and he includes MM scripts to support a number of other mods as well.\n\n\\*You\\* are free to open up the settings config file and customize for whatever time-scale you want, Kerbal or Earth."},{"CreatedByName":"KocLobster","CreatedById":159324,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T17:47:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/27/2015 at 10:37 AM, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So you can do some very interesting things. Run a command pod to dock reviving supplies/snacks to a starved out colony ship. Use one of your orange-suits to lead a mission and conserve supplies. Note that Kerbals are pretty damn aggressive about getting their snacks - the only way to lock them out of the biscuit tin is to click that little feed button by the resource on a part (same way we reserve some battery power for a probe\n\u003E \n\nI did not realize this was possible. Anytime I\u0027ve ever tried this, it flicks over to the red circle with a line through it, and then immediately flicks back to the green arrow. I have always experienced this with all versions of MKS and USI-LS that I\u0027ve used. What have I done wrong to cause this? I have always been unable to stop a kerbals from eating the supplies. The only workarounds I know are putting the supplies in KIS containers, or sending the ship with an empty supply storage, and have an additional Probe sent along with it to its destination, and then transferring over the supplies when I actually need to use my kerbals.\n\nThis never felt right to me, but I assumed it was intended. After reading that on the front page, obviously i screwed something up. How can I fix this, and what additional information should I provide to make it easier to help me?\n\nI\u0027m using Win7 64bit, and KSP 1.1.2 64bit.

I didn\u0027t like having to reload my game to implement changes to the cfg, so I like how the GUI is instant. It\u0027s a great idea, I\u0027m surprised you hadn\u0027t thought of it/implemented it before now.\n\n[@VaPaL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150974-vapal/)\n\nThanks for your suggestion. I\u0027ve definitely looked at DF before and been interested, but just never ended up trying it out. I assume it\u0027s compatible with USI-LS?\n\n[@cantab](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104935-cantab/)\n\nI won\u0027t fight fire with fire, or add an additional and unnecessary bad attitude to the mix, but i would like to say that I definitely would recommend uninstalling these mods; this community would be better off without your poor attitude.\n\nRoverDude, and all mod makers for that matter, create mods in their spare time, free of charge. He doesn\u0027t owe you anything, and you shouldn\u0027t feel entitled to support. Mod makers also are free to design whatever they please, and are under no obligation to make mods tailored for Cantab\u0027s personal tastes and enjoyment.\n\nYou\u0027d really do well to try and remember that. Next time take a deep breath before getting angry at others who are only trying to enrich this already wonderful community."}]}
