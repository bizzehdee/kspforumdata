At high warp, that\u0027s what takes most of the time. I\u0027m actually not sure *why* it\u0027d be an issue snapping to 0; AFAIK, the way rails warp works is that KSP does no physics at all. In an orbit around one body, there\u0027s a closed-form expression for your location at a particular time, so all timewarp does is add some larger amount to the time each increment (this doesn\u0027t cause issues because no forces are being simulated and the orbit doesn\u0027t change, so floating-point errors have minimal effect). If that\u0027s how it\u0027s done, I don\u0027t see why dt can\u0027t go from 1000000 in one step to 1 in the next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T02:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Warp-To button should help in the next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I consider things like messing up SOI changes and missing the atmosphere / crashing into the planet to be bugs with the current implementation, and it\u0027s those things that really ought to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T22:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can indeed jump directly to one of the warp settings by clicking on the green triangles of the warp indicator.
