Whenever I end up feeling burned out in my Career Science save (I can\u0027t get the hang of funds just yet, so I\u0027ve gone to easy-career mode), I load up Sandbox and set a crazy challenge for myself. Sometimes it\u0027s making orbit with only SRB\u0027s, or flying to Kerbin\u0027s North Pole in an airplane. Other times, it\u0027s crazier, like flying to Kerbin\u0027s South Pole in an asymmetric aircraft (mind, I\u0027m a keyboard player, so just imagine the amount of rapid tapping of keys needed to fly that), or to get a Firespitter propeller plane to Laythe. Other times, it\u0027s to get an electric propeller plane to Eve and fly through the super-gravity and experience all of the purple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Career mode, probe-rovers would be a good starting point. Only thing you lose if you screw up is a computer and a few thousand credits worth of parts, not one of your Kerbals. Set up satellite networks around planets. Make a Mun Base. Land an exploration probe on Eve and return it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Solar System is cool, but the few times I\u0027ve messed with it (10x Kerbin System being my preferred), it adds to the mild tedium of building to get out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. Personally, I play KSP for the engineering challenge of it, and only partly for flying my creations. Lately, I\u0027ve found it difficult to want to leave Kerbin because the new atmosphere is a lot of fun to play in. Perhaps that\u0027s what you could do, if you\u0027ve got any science left to gather on Kerbin. Build, using Firespitter\u0027s electric propellers, a science-gathering airplane and collect as much Kerbin Science as you can. There\u0027s even some seaplane floats in there, so you could even land on the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, alternatively, get a probe-based propeller craft to Eve and gather the science there. Firespitter has a nice little folding electric prop that would be almost perfect for the application, and if you build small enough, you should be able to fit it in a reasonable fairing to send it to Eve, get it past atmospheric entry, and then deploy it in the air to gather some science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, propellers seem to be a recurring theme for me, but that\u0027s because lately I\u0027ve used KSP as Kerbal Flight Simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T10:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe absolutely must to have mod for me is Kerbal Engineer Redux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gives you (among other things) the values for TWR and dV for each stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout these building rockets is more or less guesswork\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T10:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse sandbox and try to build a small ssto, then a medium sized one.

For me, I don\u0027t get on with Career mode - I\u0027ve tried it in each of its incarnations, and still I return to Science mode. I like the freedom Science mode gives to my imagination, which inevitably results in me setting my own challenges. Back in 0.23, I had a nice little base set up on Minmus that could refuel ships, courtesy of the Kethane mod. I had intended to use Minmus as a kind of ready-made space station near which to assemble ships to go to Duna and places beyond, to set up little bases all over the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting that base up meant that I learnt how to either and pretty close to a given point or otherwise deal with the consequences, at least in low-G non-atmosphere circumstances. I also learnt how to create vehicles that could double as low-G rovers or even Kerbin-return vehicles if need be. I didn\u0027t get to Duna though. That came in 0.90, where I finally managed to get probes to both Duna and Eve - and even partial success at Jool! So I\u0027d learnt about interplanetary launch windows, and taking more care with how much dV my designs have. More recently, I\u0027ve been pootling around with TAC life support, finding my feet with havingto worry about whether my Kerbals supplies will last long enough. Currently, I have the MKS mod tucked away in a folder, which I really must put some time into learning soon, sa that will allow me to achieve my desire of planting self-sustaining colonies throughout the Kerbol system. And I\u0027m going to trythe Elcano challenge soon, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even thus far, I\u0027ve had so many adventures, generally as a result of some mistake of mine, occasionally as a result of a success, that I\u0027ve had a simply wonderful time playing KSP. IAnd that because KSP lets me play it my way. If, like a lot of games, it forced me to play a certain way, in a certain order, it\u0027d be merely a good game instead of a great one.

Land an exploration probe on Eve and return it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Solar System is cool, but the few times I\u0027ve messed with it (10x Kerbin System being my preferred), it adds to the mild tedium of building to get out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. Personally, I play KSP for the engineering challenge of it, and only partly for flying my creations. Lately, I\u0027ve found it difficult to want to leave Kerbin because the new atmosphere is a lot of fun to play in. Perhaps that\u0027s what you could do, if you\u0027ve got any science left to gather on Kerbin. Build, using Firespitter\u0027s electric propellers, a science-gathering airplane and collect as much Kerbin Science as you can. There\u0027s even some seaplane floats in there, so you could even land on the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, alternatively, get a probe-based propeller craft to Eve and gather the science there. Firespitter has a nice little folding electric prop that would be almost perfect for the application, and if you build small enough, you should be able to fit it in a reasonable fairing to send it to Eve, get it past atmospheric entry, and then deploy it in the air to gather some science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, propellers seem to be a recurring theme for me, but that\u0027s because lately I\u0027ve used KSP as Kerbal Flight Simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is one thing I realllly don\u0027t find interesting, it\u0027s planes. I guess maybe because I\u0027m so bad at piloting them compared to rockets or what but I guess if you\u0027re gonna play you gotta play it all huh? I\u0027ll give it a shot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Esme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Esme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESeems a bit of an odd question to me - there is no right or wrong way to play the game - do whatever you find engaging, is my advice. For me, I don\u0027t get on with Career mode - I\u0027ve tried it in each of its incarnations, and still I return to Science mode. I like the freedom Science mode gives to my imagination, which inevitably results in me setting my own challenges. Back in 0.23, I had a nice little base set up on Minmus that could refuel ships, courtesy of the Kethane mod. I had intended to use Minmus as a kind of ready-made space station near which to assemble ships to go to Duna and places beyond, to set up little bases all over the system. \u003Cp\u003ESetting that base up meant that I learnt how to either and pretty close to a given point or otherwise deal with the consequences, at least in low-G non-atmosphere circumstances. I also learnt how to create vehicles that could double as low-G rovers or even Kerbin-return vehicles if need be. I didn\u0027t get to Duna though. That came in 0.90, where I finally managed to get probes to both Duna and Eve - and even partial success at Jool! So I\u0027d learnt about interplanetary launch windows, and taking more care with how much dV my designs have. More recently, I\u0027ve been pootling around with TAC life support, finding my feet with havingto worry about whether my Kerbals supplies will last long enough. Currently, I have the MKS mod tucked away in a folder, which I really must put some time into learning soon, sa that will allow me to achieve my desire of planting self-sustaining colonies throughout the Kerbol system. And I\u0027m going to trythe Elcano challenge soon, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even thus far, I\u0027ve had so many adventures, generally as a result of some mistake of mine, occasionally as a result of a success, that I\u0027ve had a simply wonderful time playing KSP. IAnd that because KSP lets me play it my way. If, like a lot of games, it forced me to play a certain way, in a certain order, it\u0027d be merely a good game instead of a great one. So I think the answer lies within you - how do you WANT to play the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to google Science Mode before replying (That shows how little attention I\u0027ve paid to it). But that certainly sounds like something that could help. What I\u0027ve always dreamed of was a sandbox (Full part access) mixed with actually getting science from experiments. I can feel my inner rocket designed dying to get home and play already!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TicTacToe!\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TicTacToe!\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re just getting into things, then I recommend an \u0022install as you go\u0022 mentality. Start off with whatever you seem essential, and NO more. Then, when you feel you need something, then you download it. When you realise you need bucket loads of delta-v to get a base to Moho, install Near Future. When you realise you need more places to explore, install Outer Planets.\u003Cp\u003EI think if you\u0027re just at the point here you\u0027re INITIALLY trying to get into it, then installing everything all at once is too daunting and overpowering. A (somewhat poor) example are these minecraft mod pack launchers, I love modded minecraft, but these mod packs with a bajillion mods on them that I\u0027ve never played with before completely overpower me, even though I love the look of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Start off with nothing and add as you go when you realise you\u0027re missing something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith KSP, with nearly everything you can think of, \u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never thought of this way. Every time a new mod or KSP version is released, the first thing I do is go in and make sure I get all mods that I had been using in my previous version.

Play completely stock for some time. Calculate stuff (dV requirement and budget, phase angles,...) only using pen, paper, a calculator, Wikipedia and the KSP Wiki. Pilot your craft by hand, especially while landing and docking. Play with reverting and quickloading disabled. \u003Cp\u003EMy experience is that many mods reduce the challenge of the game, especially parts mods. By this they also take away some fun. The most rewarding moment I had in KSP was actually my first docking (in stock 0.23.5). It caused a rush of adrenaline that I never before experienced in any other game. Consider, how boring an automated docking maneuver using MechJeb would have been in comparison...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, there are a few mods that don\u0027t directly affect gameplay, but add features missing in Stock KSP. For instance Stock Bugfix Modules, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Precise Node,...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit to docking with Mechjeb... actually, I\u0027ve NEVER actually docked two ships legit. I\u0027ve got a rough idea of how to rendezvous though. And no parts pack?! I love my parts packs!
