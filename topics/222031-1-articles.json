Perhaps a picture-in-picture mode of\u00A0some kind where you could see the planet and orbit\u00A0where your maneuver node is created at (while also zoomed way out on the map). Maybe even allow you to open multiple picture-in-picture movable\u00A0windows of different bodies to see the orbital situation and results form maneuver node editing.
