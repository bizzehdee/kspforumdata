It is because the soyuz heatshield doesn\u0027t completely cover the pod according to the game. If you look at the heatshield there is a ring of line 1-2inches around the bottom that it doesn\u0027t cover(like in real life). The game assumes this means the heatshield is not protecting the pod at all. The pod then takes the full reentry temps. I just ran it with temp debug on and the pod quickly got to over 2000C and exploded while the heatshield barely got warm. Unless there is some way to make the game think the heatshield is bigger than the pod, you will just need to raise the max temp of the pod and parachute to something like 4000C\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T20:24:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE V1.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fixed Soyuz heatshield not protecting pod during reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fixed all pods CoL and CoP values, they now face the correct orientation during reentry, no SAS needed to hold attitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis update contains major fixes for capsule aerodynamics, it is required to properly have the capsule reenter without exploding or flipping around.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magnetom","CreatedById":144004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust out of curiosity, is there a way to unfold anything else apart from the solar panels?
