I want to create missions from the very first NASA Launch to today\u0027s ideas that NASA may have in mind\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThes missions will be designed to be fairly easy to harder as time goes by. I have run KSP in Career mode ever since I found out about it.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Want to create all or at least the most important NASA Missions. this mod should go thru the NASA story line and help advance the player via money and science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ever get stuck going thru the missions because you could not do them for whatever reason and then run out of money or science or both?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions will be gathered from multiple sources NASA,Wiki,and other space encyclopedias. From start to Current. The idea here is to make the missions as a story line of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso your actually kinda Following the real course that NASA took\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehere is a few things I will need. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking parts for Space Shuttle (mod/parts) that look authentic that works with .90 or better. (May use another mod for this and give the dev credit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts from FASA and KW as an add-on for the mod either in use with or separate. Eaither way this would be a great addition (Devs please contact me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellite parts \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome help creating the call in mod to display the contracts (like to help please contact me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this interest you? I\u0027d like to hear about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chezburgar7300","CreatedById":114873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T20:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this interests me. You could head over to Component SS to see if that\u0027s working. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is though, I think your saying that you want people to use \u003Cem\u003Especific\u003C/em\u003E rocket parts in a specific order when KSP can\u0027t give you a .craft file from a contract and the player probably won\u0027t want to use your craft but their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting concept and you have my attention, but I\u0027m saying it might be a bit too ambitious for a beginner modder (I assume, please correct me if I\u0027m wrong).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T21:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou maybe can\u0027t use the Stock Contract System, but you can use the Scenario thing. It at least let you create some kind off missions, but I\u0027m not sure how far you can go with it. Anyway, I\u0027ll keep an eye on this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cashaber","CreatedById":133429,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T21:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiyas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe components in FASA and KW are great.. no changes need there. mainly the parts needed would be for the Space shuttle and maybe a few that are not there but I can work with what is there with FASA and KW. Crafts or xxx.craft rockets can be done by the player ... this would give them the ability to come up with their own versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a beginner Modder however do have a bit of exp in the field not much though... my main concern is to get the missions or Contracts to come up and be able to edit them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally all that is needed is to be able to add the NASA missions to the Contracts as an Add-On. Sorry Sputnik is out for this one.. I may do a Russian mod for this if this goes well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main Concentration is to get the missions going at the moment. Using simple parts for now until the mod gets developed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for your interest \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
