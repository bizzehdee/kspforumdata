I\u0027ve read the Wikipedia article and I know it was tied to Almaz and so forth. But there seems to be little technical info around about its specifics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there were four uncrewed launches to Salyut stations (as I recall the Almaz stations were done with by the time the TKS was ready for flight). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are no pictures I can find. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe oddest thing is that it appears to have flown on its rocket (proton or energena) with the return capsule in the traditional orientation, but it appears that for docking and orbital maneuvers it flew \u0022backwards\u0022. Maybe even having to flip over to circularize it\u0027s orbit!!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m quite confused about how this worked and I\u0027d love to find more info on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T05:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like the plan for big gemini as well.

In space, nobody cares which end is the back and which is the front. Each end has its own purpose, and once its on orbit, it moves around with thrusters that are at both ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETKS itself was abandoned but the FGB section (the habitation and service module part) were used in the Salyut program, Mir (Kvant-2, Priroda, Spektr, Kristall) and the ISS (Zarya). The \u0022rear\u0022 section of all those FGB modules contains a docking port, habitation, and propulsion. The \u0022front\u0022 section of the TKS carried the VA capsule, which had a hatch in its heatshield (just like Gemini-MOL) for crew ingress/egress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this configuration, the VA capsule had most of its systems and propulsion, including a deorbit engine, in its \u0022nose\u0022 section that was jettisoned on reentry. It was really a small forward service module. It also had a beefy LAS on top that, which always makes it look a bit disproportionate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother similarity with Gemini-MOL was that a few VAs were reused, albeit unmanned, for test flights. Also noteworthy is that a couple of test flights were launched with two VA capsules, one above the other, on top of a Proton. These were to test reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 90\u0027s, a company called Excalibur Almaz, based on the Isle of Mann, purchased some of the old VAs and unused FGB shells with the idea of refurbishing them and selling rides for space tourists. The whole thing was part scam, part financial fiasco, and the capsules were recently auctioned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested, I strongly suggest that you download the KOSMOS mod for KSP, which has a TKS and VA capsule to play with. That way you can get a feel for how the configuration worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBedla","CreatedById":69025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the TKS is one of the more interesting concepts for orbital travel, and I find it really fascinating. I\u0027ve attempted reconstructions in KSP long before there was Tantares, but I was not very happy with it. Tantares makes it possible, and very gorgeous looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best basic info is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.russianspaceweb.com/tks.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. If you look at the diagram and the description, it should be clear how it operated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA TKS basically consisted of two parts - the VA return capsule with deorbit engines (the long pointy end) and the FGB cargo block, containing circularization and orbital engines, propellant, orbital module, docking port, solar panels and docking antennas (the bigger part of the spacecraft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was indeed launched with the capsule upwards, the escape tower was coupled to the \u0022nose\u0022 of the deorbit section of the VA capsule, and after the booster separation it had to flip in orbit, so that the docking port faced forward and the capsule backward, so that the FGB engines (in the diagram labelled as \u0022randezvous and correction engines\u0022) thrusted the correct way, past the VA capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter its mission was done, the VA capsule would separate from the FGB, and used the thrusters in the \u0022nose\u0022 to deorbit. The nose would then separate, burn in the atmosphere, and the VA capsule would land on parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this answer your question? If not, try to ask a little more specifically.
