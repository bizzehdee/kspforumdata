There are ways to simple avoid debris or later on attempt clearing the orbit missions with the advanced grabbing unit.\n\nI use this button extensively in every game I play: to remove debris that intersects the atmosphere. Such debris would decay naturally over time, except KSP doesn\u0027t model it. How would you suggest I deal with this if the button was gone? Launch an entire new throwaway vessel just so I can rendezvous with a discarded tank to keep it loaded in physics range while it coasts through the atmosphere? That\u0027s nonsense and you know it.\n\nAnd it\u0027s just one among a long list of good reasons to keep it around."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T13:24:37Z","Content":"While I agree with the people that are saying \u0022don\u0027t remove it\u0022 because it has some very handy and not particularly immersion-breaking uses, you don\u0027t need to launch to rendezvous with something in a decaying orbit to clean it up. Just switch to it from the tracking station and it will start decaying. You can only use physics warp (assuming the heating doesn\u0027t go mad but if it explodes then your goal is achieved anyway ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ) so it may take a little while."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T13:25:30Z","Content":"I understand where the OP is coming from, but limitations of the game make the delete function necessary. Surface debris that would naturally be cleaned up by workers is merely left on the ground. Debris that should de-orbit doesn\u0027t. Perhaps a recovery cost would make it feel more reasonable."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:18:19Z","Content":"I leave debris everywhere. If it is in space it stays. If it\u0027s on the surface and useless, it goes. \n\nI use the terminate function sensibly to deal with surface debris that can mess up my game, therefore I vote it should stay. \n\nThe moment ksp can deal with surface debris in a sane manner, then I vote for the terminate button to be user disabled. \n\nBut never to go away completely. Never, never, never. \n\nNever."}]}
