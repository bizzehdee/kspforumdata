It does not change the default or \u0027parent\u0027 command pod of your craft, so focus will stay with whatever craft has that parent pod if you undock or decouple the craft(s). You will have to use square brackets to switch over to the craft you have jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T13:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControl from here does not move the kerbal.

Great design, I hope it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion unrelated to yours: This seems like a perfect use for MechJeb\u0027s autopilot functions. Either to take the dropped craft into orbit while controlling the lift vehicle to land or vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this: Is MechJeb (or any other plugin) actually capable of doing that? That is, say you choose to control the spacecraft and set MechJeb to auto-land the lifter-plane. CAN MechJeb do that while you have the spacecraft active and are controlling it, or does MechJeb turn off when you\u0027ve switched away from the craft you want it to control?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
