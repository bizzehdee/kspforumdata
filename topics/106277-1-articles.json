Which in that case would take more than 1 minute. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Doesn\u0027t sound like we are getting a VAB readout which is what we need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can already tell what my vessel has left by checking fuel amounts. So the engineer thing won\u0027t be as useful as Vab Reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I didn\u0027t know that Squad was planning on NOT making it a VAB readout. I must have missed the memo where Squad said this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems silly that I\u0027d have to load the vessel on the launchpad with an Engineer to know the delta-v, when it should be visible as I\u0027m building it. Otherwise, what would stop me from loading each stage individually on the launchpad with the engineer to get the information I need? And in that case, it\u0027s just promoting completely pointless tedium. Reminds me of having to load a vessel on the launchpad to see its total mass (before the vessel info app was added to the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll cool my jets when it\u0027s actually in the game.

SQUAD was never against we having dV readouts ... they were and are against we having them from start without having to earn them in some way. Their position has not changed a bit.\u003Cp\u003EThat does not make their position less stupid IMHO ( it is like having a Sim City style game without a money reserve readout ), but atleast they are sticking to it :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, thanks for clearing up that misconception. I agree -- not having delta-v readouts from the beginning creates the exact same problem we have with many other career mode gameplay elements -- it makes the early game harder than the late game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
