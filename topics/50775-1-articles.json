Have got loads of science from the various biomes on kerbin via shirt hops into a low orbit to research the goo. Done enough to get batteries and basic solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next task was to put a satellite in low kerbin orbit less than 200k and the high kerbin orbit, not bring them home but to transmit science back. Firstly once you\u0027ve spammed the science in irbat via a sat to effectively zero is there any point leaving the sat in orbit? It\u0027s still got power but is no use as far as I can see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly i spam the science to zero via the science module but then take another module up and try to bring the science back to kerbin is that a valid strategy? I\u0027m concerned the next returnable sat won\u0027t be able to collect more science under 200k to bring back because my first sat has researched but lost 80% of the science transmitting it back??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPaul\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mephane","CreatedById":59884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T10:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53514-Doing-the-math-on-science-transmissions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E. The science reduction due to transmission is not forfeited, but simply remains in the pool of science points a given biome has. In other words, it just takes more transmissions than sample returns to receive all science from a specific place, but the total sum is the same if you exhaust the biome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T15:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you take another module up, you won\u0027t get any more science.
