Lol most of the updates i have seen have \u0022fixed the physics\u0022 and ruined the staging and firing of weapons. There is no reason that when you set a liquid engine and a decupeler that the engine should not fire off first or at least at the same time. Like the rockets. Or if you use a docking port to attach it. lol Oh well I\u0027ve fixed the problem in a very round about way. I have come to the same conclusion that my logistics ships will probably be more useful as well, not because my fleet of capitol ships or the fighter escorts are weak or anything but because fuel and rearmament are going to be an interracial part of any mission. This is true in real military life. 75% or more of the military is logistics and if you can never have to much. A constant flow of fuel will be crucial for missions to the outer rim and that can be problematic if your supply lines are ever intercepted. The best way to prevent a convoy\u0027s destruction will to equip them with light escort fighters. Cheap expendable craft that have a high delta V for intercepting incoming targets but enough firepower to take out a light capitol ship with medium armor. Normally id say an Isprit like fighter will do the trick but VTOL in this case is moot so you can save weight an fuel and exchange the standard thruster for the spike or a fission rocket. I\u0027ve also toyed with the concept of a drone fighter for this task but they are to small to pack any real punch for the part count and far to slow. Smart missiles are also a good concept but then you have the issue of how many do i put on and how will all that fuel and mass affect the DV. Escorting with a capitol ship can be tricky seeing as you can only use one ship t a time and one will have to waist fuel in an attempt to catch up to the other unless you time their departure well enough. I\u0027ve done this maneuver a few times and sent out two craft at almost the same time from orbit within 20km of each other then realized that i had to switch between them constantly while trying to make orbit round the target planet. I\u0027m sure fuel raiders will be a big problem in the daunting task of keeping our fleets fed. I have even designed a boarding pod that docks with a ship to take control, 5 Kerman marines and 3 support pilots that can also be armed for boarding. Probably not a practical way to take out an armed capitol ship but unarmed tankers and transports are fair game. I have a model for a Hanland boarding pod as well and a special drop pod that will be in my next video once my PC is fixed.

Just like the small ships are hoping they can release their weapons before being blasted. Or hope their craft are dismissed by the enemy pilots as not being worth that 18 ton missiles. And, of course, as I have found out from testing, missiles miss, plating sometimes holds up VERY well, and some designs look good but, as they say on the internet, are FAIL.

To do that, though, we\u0027ve had to cut a few corners. K-1 just isn\u0027t safe in it\u0027s current position. But we\u0027re going to fix that now.
