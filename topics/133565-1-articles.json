The tanks spin\u00A0into the main body and things get a little explody.

This takes some use of the offset tool, because (as I\u0027m sure you know) when you place something on the radial decouplers your mouse has to be pretty much right on it. So, put the decoupler higher up on the center stack, then place the boosters. Then use the offset tool to slide the booster lower on the decoupler.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond idea is less optimal, so I\u0027d only try it if the first doesn\u0027t work, because it increases your drag. What you do is take either a control surface (make sure to turn it off so it doesn\u0027t respond to any control input!) or a small wing section towards the top of the radial boosters. Place it so that the \u0022long\u0022 axis is horizontal and tangent to the booster so that it has 0 angle of attack. Then rotate it *just* a little to have an angle that, as it\u0027s moving through the air, it will want to pull the top of the boosters away from the center stack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T23:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect it\u0027s lift coming from those extra Big-S tailfins you have on the left and right sides of each of the boosters.\u00A0 Have you tried removing those?\u00A0 (i.e. so that each radial booster has just a single fin on it, pointing directly radially outward from the center stack)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if the answer is \u0022but if I do that then it\u0027s unstable and flips,\u0022 then the answer to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E would be some ship redesign so that that doesn\u0027t happen, but that\u0027s another discussion.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Just as an experiment, try taking off the extra fins and (if you have stability problems) just accelerate straight up and see what happens when you stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suggestion, mount the radial boosters much lower on the central stack, as low as they will go.\u00A0 When you decouple them, they\u0027ll start to slide backwards (since the center stack is still thrusting, and they\u0027re not.\u00A0 If they\u0027re mounted low on the stack, then your center stack doesn\u0027t have to travel very far to slide out from between them, and you\u0027ll be safe sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s another thought:\u00A0 Mount some drogue chutes on the radially outward side of the boosters, towards the top.\u00A0 Set them up so that they stage together with the decouplers.\u00A0 You\u0027re only going a bit over 300 m/s, so the drogues should be safe.\u00A0 They\u0027ll yank the boosters down and outwards \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehard\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 You\u0027ll need to adjust the \u0022full deploy\u0022 altitude upwards to its maximum of 5000m.\u00A0 Your screenshots are from slightly above 5000m, but it looks like your gravity turn is a bit slow-- if you turn just a bit more on the way up, I expect your boosters will drain out before you hit 5km, and the drogues will be able to have full effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-05T23:50:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2016 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T00:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222443801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457219940\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156531\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FullMetalMachinist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, FullMetalMachinist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first is to put your radial decouplers higher up on the main stack to give an extra kick outwards on the top of the radial boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI concur 100% with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222443829\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457221407\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect it\u0027s lift coming from those extra Big-S tailfins you have on the left and right sides of each of the boosters.\u00A0 Have you tried removing those?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso with this.

Higher-altutude separations will in general have more tolerance for misbehaving boosters. And you\u0027re just below the speed of sound, in the trans-sonic region where drag is highest and thus any aero effects will be at their most pronounced. I think most real-life applications either stage well before this speed (think RATO rather than rocket booster) or else quite a bit later where the air is very thin and the boosters\u0027 path is determined mostly by their momentum.

I\u0027m not sure how that would happen with single large fuel tanks as the attachment to the decoupler. But generally, I try to always make sure the center of mass for the \u003Cem\u003Eempty booster\u003C/em\u003E is below the center of the decoupler, so that the ejection charge always gives an outward kick to the upper portion of the booster. If you attach close to the engines, and then build upward by attaching more tanks etc on those strap-on boosters, you will frequently run into this problem since the bottom of the booster will kick outward, and any aerodynamic pressure (as CSE mentioned) will push the top back into you. So it\u0027s usually better to build both up and down from the attachment point, or just downward. As CSE also mentioned, the clipping mechanics can be a little weird since the collision-meshes aren\u0027t a perfect match to the visual models. And that\u0027s more of a problem with those really narrow decouplers. In this case though, I suspect it\u0027s a combination of aerodynamic forces, and the booster\u0027s center of mass being really close to the ejection charge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a good thing to keep in mind, even if you do use the SpaceY thruster-decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T00:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222444697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457282004\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145588\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CSE\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, CSE said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceY has a combined wider decoupler-sepatron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also has some very nifty sepratron-nosecones (in 1.25m and 2.5m, centered and slanted), which are both aerodynamic nosecones \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E sepratrons that thrust outward from center (and don\u0027t fry your center core with their exhaust).\u00A0 I love those things.\u00A0 I actually use them quite a bit more than I do the thruster-decouplers.\u00A0 (And I\u0027m a guy who practically never uses the stock sepratrons.\u00A0 I just don\u0027t like \u0027em.\u00A0 The SpaceY sepratron nosecones are just what the doctor ordered, as far as I\u0027m concerned.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-07T01:05:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2016 01:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T01:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a couple tests with the smallest decouplers and it was still smashing the center tank even with low center of mass and sepratrons. \u00A0I suspect there is some unseen clipping as mentioned before that is forcing the tanks to pop out on the bottom even though the decoupler is on top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
