Fortunately it\u0027s not necessary to use. I still bring everything back like I used to. I may lose some doing this but I like it more that way.\n\nNot quite the same thing. The idea behind it is to give bases a purpose, and provide a secondary, passive science stream where there\u0027s a bit more interactivity over the long haul (and I expect any mechanic can become un-fun with min-maxing). \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I like the science lab. I have three of them right now - at LKO, Mun and Minmus (All were conveninetly placed as contract stations). I just stuff them with data and do other stuff. Sometimes I check the labs to get some science or refill them with data gathered by landers (at the Mun/Minmus), dunno about LKO one.\n\nThat was pretty much the intent. It kicks in right about the time folks start getting tired of grinding biomes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a pretty tedious mechanic, but also overpowered. Once you put a lab and a hopper on Minmus you can complete the tech tree wihout going anywhere else.\n\u003E However, if you use a life support mod the lab becomes fairly balanced. Fast-forwarding becomes expensive when you have to resupply the base constantly.\n\nDepends on how you define tedious. It definitely is if you feel obligated to timewarp to each transmisison.

I load all the experiments into the lab, then transmit them home, then reset Science Jr and Goo and wait till the data are processed in the lab up to 500 science (max lab capacity), transmit the science from the lab, then wait and transmit again.

I do all the science \u0022high over Jool\u0022, transmit the experiments and load the data into the lab, reset ScJr and Goo, do course correction to set my periapsis to 300 km for insertion maneuver (is it the right word? I\u0027m not sure) and process the data.

The speedbump just feels artificial and contrived to me, better to have it balanced with other mechanics, even if only a return curve that nears zero given enough time.\n\nIt already has a return curve that nears zero given enough time: the science rate per day depends on the amount of data present, and the less there is, the slower it goes. But how does that solve your disappointment with the mechanic? It only causes the player to, again, feel like they must stop timewarp in order to refill data so they can get the maximum benefit. It\u0027s 100% identical to having to stop timewarp in order to transmit.\n\nBasically, *any* mechanic you give the player to use that will result in extra science will also result in the motivation to stop timewarp. The *only* way you can prevent this is to make the MPL a instant-result affair. You launch it to a destination, load data, and push a button to receive science. In other words, you make the MPL just another normal science experiment like the Science Jr. materials bay and other similar parts.\n\nExcept, oh wait, you still have to drop out of timewarp to use it, because at some point it will arrive at its mission destination and will require you to actually press the button. What an intolerable speed bump for your other mission!\n\n...okay, that was way overdramatized ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) I apologize. But the thing is - the MPL as it is now is no more and no less a speed bump than *any other* science collecting mission you fly in parallel. Perhaps you don\u0027t like flying missions in parallel, and that\u0027s perfectly fine. You don\u0027t actually have to use the MPL. There is still an unlimited amount of science available in KSP without it. And even without using any of the unlimited science options, of which there are multiple even without the MPL, there is so much science just from going to planets and moons with normal science experiments that you can unlock the whole tech tree at least eight times over. Might be even more than that, I\u0027ve never managed to collect it all.\n\nSo there is no reason you have to use the MPL if it gets in the way of your Eeloo mission timewarp. Or even better: you can use the MPL, but there\u0027s no need to stop your timewarp for it. Just check it after the timewarp is done. You could have gotten more science faster if you had stopped to manage it, but who cares? It doesn\u0027t give you anything you can\u0027t have in unlimited quantities elsewhere. The feeling that you need to stop for it is nothing but a self-imposed compulsion that you need to maximize everything. It has nothing to do with the game itself, or the MPL.\n\nIt adds nothing you don\u0027t already have - except an option for those who like it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T13:34:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpeedDaemon","CreatedById":38448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T13:43:02Z","Content":"What would make the labs a bit more interesting is if you weren\u0027t able to transmit all of the science you generate.

Processing requires a little amount of time and some power. After that you get \u0022Data\u0022 in the lab which can be turned into science at some slow rate.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Space low/high around kerbin, then space high/low around the Mun will be more than enough for a first load of 500 points.** And that\u0027s just with Goo / Science Jr. / Thermometer.
