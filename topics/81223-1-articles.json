Better just stick with primitives)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes bone relative parenting works but after importing to unity the mesh(plus an optional primitive! collider) has to actually be parented to the animated bone object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever bone constraints(inverse kinematics etc.) As far as i can see dont seem to be usable in unity so all armature animations should be done in blender prior to export. Or alternativly a poselibrary with each intended keyframe pose for the rig should be created in blender and the animation made in unity with the poses (unsure how to do this but i just observed that the poses got exported with the rig as an animation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-09T12:25:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2014 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T12:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would happen with animations which don\u0027t use armature, but instead just use objects, meshes and constraints?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan those animations also be exported and used?
