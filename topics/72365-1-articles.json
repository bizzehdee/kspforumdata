Buran itself had no main engines which fired at launch, only its equivalent of the OMS. However the shuttle was designed with both the main engines and the OMS in the orbiter and only the fuel tank and boosters not on the orbiter. Buran was more of a payload, while the shuttle was part of the actual launch vehicle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real differences to the shuttle I see on this concept would be a larger fuel tank with one more engine, larger boosters, letting the engines burn up instead of recovering them and even more structural forces and asymmetric thrust than the space shuttle already had. Needing to build completely new engines would result in higher launch cost(they already needed to be rebuilt partially, but the cost for that was still a lot less than building completely new ones). I don\u0027t see how this would get around the problems of the space shuttle program. Also the only advantage over the SLS that I see would be the ability to return something from orbit, but that ability of the space shuttle was rarely used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T18:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...
