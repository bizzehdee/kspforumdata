I recently installed a copy of KSP on a Linux machine. It runs smoothly, however, there are 2 weird rendering glitches/issues. One is that inside the VAB and SPH, it flicker continually between the proper rendering with the internals, and black. I was also flying to the Mun, until it dissapeared, but the reappeared once I was in close range to a small area. I am running Intel integrated graphics 4600.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T15:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat distro/version?
