I\u0027m not asking when, just asking the community if we feel there should be a set release date for 1.0.\n\nI\u0027d say yes. While I\u0027m a huge fan of the hype train, I feel like a set date would give reports time to cover the game, and mention when it\u0027s being fully released. I\u0027m afraid if SQUAD goes the normal route with this one they could miss out on a lot of free press."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T05:01:48Z","Content":"Yea.

With the great huge pile of new and/or completely-rewritten highly-visible core functionality they\u0027re stuffing into the next release (aero, atmospheric heating, fairings \u0026 cargo bays that work correctly with the new aero, presumably a major overhaul of plane-part functionality to go with aero, likely new parts to help deal with atmospheric heating, resources, new parts for that, the great rebalancing of the currencies and contract payouts, female kerbals, the associated revamp of the core kerbal movement animations, the engineer\u0027s report...and that\u0027s all just off the top of my head), I think they need at least one (probably two) bug-fix/re-rebalancing passess with NO new content before they claim victory and release 1.0. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re in a position to even announce the MONTH for THAT release.\n\nBut that\u0027s kind of off the original topic. Should they announce a release date for the upcoming aero/heat/rebalance/Valentina update? Nope. \n\nThis is a community with a large number of people who don\u0027t do spaceplanes because they take fifteen whole minutes at zero warp to get to orbit; who complain that the highest warp isn\u0027t high enough because it takes even longer to get to Eeloo than it does to launch a spaceplane, who think rovers are useless because they\u0027re restricted to OMG-too-slow speeds of only a few hundred kph, and with every releasee will spam the forum about how glacially-slow the overwhelmed servers are and how long it takes to get the download.\n\nDo you really think Squad wants to deal with the completely-predictable fallout that WE would inflict on them if they announced a release date ... and then missed it? Heck, even if they MADE the date, we\u0027d still have complaints when the update didn\u0027t show up right smack as the International Date Line crossed into Release Day. While many of us individually are understanding, collectively we are NOT a patient bunch.\n\nMe, I think the announcement that a release is in experimentals is good enough. That gives us several days to prepare (backup saves, complete any missions particularly likely to get clobbered with a parts revamp, clone the current install into a location that won\u0027t get automagically-updated by Steam, etc.), but doesn\u0027t give us any specific moment after which we\u0027re going to feel entitled to complain to/about them."},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T12:17:47Z","Content":"No. I don\u0027t care how long it takes, so long as the devs are diligent (and they are).
