I haven\u0027t bought or downloaded many games since, because this one, in my mind, is particularly enjoyable and I always come back to it after getting frustrated with something else. Amazing experience!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYears back I started reading these forums and watching YouTube videos by people who would \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to almost everywhere in one launch. I wanted to learn as much as I could from the community about building elegant, efficient, far-reaching vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have found my own attempts to explore the Kerbol system (correct term?) profoundly educational (I mean, they get \u0022Catastrophic Failure,\u0022 but not for the same reason twice.) Apollo-style missions to Duna are the bane of my existence and sanity but extemely addictive all the same (never have I planted a flag there AND returned safely.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love playing career mode on the \u0022hard\u0022 setting. Actually much of the gameplay that I do in sandbox is just testing new designs for wacky multiple-contract missions to be carried out in career mode. Right now working on a series of launch vehicles each limited by technology, part count and mass such that as a career game progresses more of these vehicles become feasible. The reasoning behind my having pre-designed launch vehicles is that this way I know not just how much fuel I need to reach orbit with a payload, but also how many parachutes it takes to splash down okay and how many parts I can put on the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso trying to figure out, in light of \u0022Moar Boosters,\u0022 what is more cost efficient (given a set of technology restrictions): a loose Space Shuttle replica, or an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the reason I decided to post here today is that after almost five years of Kerballing, I want to start sharing some of my in-game vehicle designs and maybe even some Kerbal fiction writing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and I am EXTREMELY EXCITED for Kerbal Space Program 2. I think it is going to exceed chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream in it\u0027s awesomeness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I thought I\u0027d say hello and ramble about myself for a minute to jump in here. I should add that this seems like a very nice, welcoming community based on what I\u0027ve read here, and I\u0027m excited to talk to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-03T02:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowdy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShuttles of any sort are not very efficient and mostly done as a design challenge.
