It\u0027s not really possible to leave things out because it doesn\u0027t provide that option. The game code itself and the texture and sound files are rather small.\n\nRegarding the delay, I\u0027d like to remove that as well, but I don\u0027t think it can be helped. On Android, the platform itself is inducing some kind of lag for audio playback as far as I know. The touch itself should be registered pretty instantaneously, so that\u0027s when the acceleration is applied. I\u0027m triggering the sound effect playback right when the acceleration is applied, and I\u0027ve also made sure that there is no \u0022silence\u0022 at the beginning of the original sound file. So yeah, that\u0027s pretty much the story about that ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI\u0027m glad you like it, though.
