I was mostly successful branching out then got rather far out and reached a point where I\u0027m not connecting how I expect it and I\u0027m terribly confused and need help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay there\u0027s different antennas of different strengths that can connect at different distances. I get that part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I started out with lots of the smallest antennas on small satellites attached to a probe core with batteries and solar panels. I\u0027ve put them in various orbits around kerbin at various heights. They work, I have about 5 or 7 of em orbiting Kerbin, and one laid down landed on kerbin on the opposite side from KSP as a relay. So far, this part works great. Anything I launch from KSP now has full ground control while within kerbin. The signal bounces across various antennas and they relay and sometimes go through multiple to talk back to KSP if it\u0027s like, on the other side of the mun or the back side of kerbin. So all this is fine. So then I unlocked the longer distance RA-15 antenna. I put that in orbit at 68,000 km from kerbin, almost right at the very edge of the kerbin system. Expecting in my mind that since this one can reach further into space, that it would mean if I put another RA-15 orbiting say, Duna, it would act as a direct uplink to the kerbin system. Then I could put multiple smaller short range ones orbiting Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, this kind of works. I put a small satellite with a RA-15 on it orbiting almost as high as possible around Duna. It makes a connection all the way to KSP, but.. it connects direct, and sometimes when kerbin orbits so that the KSP ground station is on the other side from where duna is, I get a drop in connection. The RA-15 \u0022uplink\u0022 from Duna never tries to bounce through the RA-15 I have orbiting kerbin. I don\u0027t understand why.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then tried putting another RA-15 in very high orbit around Dres. This one also connects direct to KSP. And if the sun or something is blocking direct line of sight, it drops connection. when it can still reach Duna.. it should be able to bounce through Duna\u0027s RA-15 -\u0026gt; Kerbin\u0027s RA-15 -\u0026gt; Kerbin local network. But it doesn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I doing wrong here? Why do these distant antennas connect direct instead of bounce through other systems? If they would relay through other systems then I would have more contact with KSP-Ground-Home a lot more often. I even tried putting a RA-15 in orbit very high around Jool system. That one\u0027s the worst.. it\u0027s only able to communicate with home when their orbits are close enough and half of the time it can\u0027t connect to home because it\u0027s too far away. But yet it\u0027s pleanty close enough to Dres.. it should be able to connect through like this: Jool -\u0026gt; Dres -\u0026gt; Duna -\u0026gt; Home. But again, it doesn\u0027t either.... scratching my head and about to abandon the game at this point thinking the antenna system is borked and doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: If the relays and bouncing and routing doesn\u0027t work like I think it should there... then what\u0027s the point of having any smaller antennas what so ever if they can\u0027t connect to anything? If this is how it works then all the ships I send in to deep space (Jool or beyond) will just have the largest antenna possible onboard and connect direct to KSP, and lose signal if it gets out of range or Kerbin\u0027s turned around. Seems stupid to me. I thought we could set up an extensive relay network and make it so we can always control all of our ships from anywhere in the system once setup right... but apparently not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-27T09:10:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2017 09:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kithylin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T09:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a general guideline, a satellite will contact \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E if its antenna is able to connect to it, even with minimum signal.
