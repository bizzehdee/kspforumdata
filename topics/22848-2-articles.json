I use the CBS for everything I build now ... in fact I hardly ever use decouplers for upper stages, replacing them instead with CBS ports. Used correctly it does the same job, only in a more flexible way. For example, in my current moon lander setup I attach the lander with a CBS port (to the orbital module), that is in turn attached to a very large skycrane by way of a similar port. On landing the lander gets rid of the skycrane and is then good to dock back with the orbital module using the now open port on top of the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again Fusty!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BananaDealer","CreatedById":60684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T23:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having this issue with your Common Berthing Mechanism, the Active variety.
