I\u0027ve been lurking quietly in the shadowy corners of these formers but I can no longer hide.\n\nLately I\u0027ve been having some troubles while designing SSTO\u0027s.

I was stuck for ages on a design that I knew should have no problem, turns out I was flying it wrong. I tried to climb too shallow, costing me time and fuel against the atmosphere. Instead I climbed at a constant 20degrees until the engines automatically cut over to rocket mode - and immediately went to 45degrees above horizon to get an Apoapsis.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T21:42:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:56:15Z","Content":"Sounds like you\u0027re some kind of monster. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWelcome to the forums, enjoy your stay. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T00:52:31Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYou mentioned having some trouble with designing SSTOs. Perhaps you could share some screenshots of your design in the VAB and \u0022in action\u0022? I\u0027m sure our resident experts might be able to diagnose the most likely causes of the issue and recommend a few fixes if they had a good view of the craft. Feel free to also take a look at some of the resources listed in the Drawing Board, which is conveniently linked in my signature; there\u0027s a fair bit of material about SSTO and spaceplane design, among other topics.\n\nHope this helps!"}]}
