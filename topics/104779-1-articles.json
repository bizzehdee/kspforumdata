I was stuck for ages on a design that I knew should have no problem, turns out I was flying it wrong. I tried to climb too shallow, costing me time and fuel against the atmosphere. Instead I climbed at a constant 20degrees until the engines automatically cut over to rocket mode - and immediately went to 45degrees above horizon to get an Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T21:42:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:56:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you\u0027re some kind of monster. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, enjoy your stay. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T00:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned having some trouble with designing SSTOs.

I\u0027m sure our resident experts might be able to diagnose the most likely causes of the issue and recommend a few fixes if they had a good view of the craft.
