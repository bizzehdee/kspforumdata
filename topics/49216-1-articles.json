Send up an unmanned capsule and have him EVA over to the empty capsule. This may be awhile, since you will have to rendezvous which is an art in of itself. (Or you can download Mechjeb for some help). The Stayputnik allows you to have missions without running the risk if stranding or killing your Kerbals!

How far up on the tech tree are you? I wouldn\u0027t attempt a rescue until you\u0027ve unlocked RCS at Tier 5 (RCS is helpful for close-in maneuvers after a rendezvous, whether you can dock or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Stayputnik is available at Tier 4. Of course, the only power supply you have at that level is the Z-100, but you can paste a hell of a lot of Z-100s on a Stayputnik; its big advantage is large surface area. Put it on a sub-orbital trajectory with the apoapsis over 100k (i.e. don\u0027t circularize), attach batt after batt to the booster, add an attenna, and run your experiments while the craft is still in flight. Transmit as you go. Better still, add a chute and you might be able to recover the craft on landing - it\u0027s light, a small chute can handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as your rescue goes, you cannot fly a command pod without a Kerbal in it I think, so you can add the Stayputnik to the ship so you have control over the vehicle while you fly your empty command pod to pick him up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stayputnik itself is a satellite core.
