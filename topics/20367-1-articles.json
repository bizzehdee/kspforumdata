Landing was out of the question aside from a few tests in and around KSC, which were... lackluster to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.17 came out and decided to give landing on Mun a shot. Stock parts only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral crashes later, 3 crews stranded from botched landings I finally managed to land. There was much rejoicing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecided I needed to redesign my landing craft and use large command pods in the process to allow for rescue of those stranded crew. (Extra crew were accidentally \u0027left\u0027 at the launchpad...) Also needed to work on reducing the craft being so dratted top-heavy and tipping over on landing. Another goal was to leave part of the lander on the surface of Mun as a sort of memorial. Further wanted to have a better fuel management system than just stacks of stages, and went with a drop-tank solution. Final goal was to get as much mass and fuel as possible to Mun without too severely adversely impacting performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the result, HeavyLander-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/41549957/HeavyLander3b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HeavyLander3b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig craft - for me at least. Central philosophy - fuel goes from the outside, inwards towards the core of each stage, allowing for stages to jettison empty tanks without having extra needless engines and decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging \u002B some pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELoose the large SRB\u0027s at about 6000m, with a vertical speed of 680m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELoose the 4 empty external large liquid boosters at about 30000m, vertical speed 934m/s.

(Sepatron assisted to ensure they blow clear.) The LV-909\u0027s will engage at this point and also begin drawing fuel from the drop-tanks. This is normal and expected.

Bit of a bear to land with all that dead-weight, but the fuel is there for it. Tested it once and got a partial recovery (core stage fell over and a few tanks popped off). May be the basis for building a Munbase.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESeparation of the transfer stage from the launch stages proved troublesome - redesigned and reinforced with struts and works much better now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith this design, I suspect it may be possible to reach Minmus and land/return. May have to try that after I reconfigure the return module/lander as mentioned above.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESwapping the main engines for the transfer stage for the nuclear ones may allow for interplanetary exploration using the heavy lander.

Will have to ping other more experienced KSP members for their thoughts. The parachutes on the initial stage (I like trying to recover as much of that as I can for \u0027reuse\u0027 in my head.) may be a starting point, but certainly open for suggestion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Notes: Am looking for feedback and thoughts from more experienced players - Would love to hear about design or approach changes to improve efficiency and such.

Did make it to the mun...but blew up on landing. Today decided to make it there, also upgraded to the 3 man craft. Didn\u0027t get any pictures, but i used 3.5 stages. I also used a central extra wide tank with fuel feeding from (6 for me) equally sized extra wide tank boosters to the centre, then lost the boosters (is this asparagus staging?) . Each booster has just the one full sized SRB (the .5 stage). I have to keep an eye on the throttle, for instance keeping it low transitioning between the first and second atmosphere layers and too much does rip the beast apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond stage was just 4.5 of the extra wide fuel tanks with a single big engine- there was a bit of deceleration at first until some fuel burnt away.
