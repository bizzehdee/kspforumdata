After I recently found out about the plan to expand the Kerbol System in the future, I thought I would make some concept art for one of the Gas Giants and its Moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RUibX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RUibX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XqKfL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XqKfL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iisNL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iisNL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow time to go into more detail;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELirinda\u0027s most notable features are its 3 large blue spots contain less Methane and more Helium than the rest of the plant (The Helium in these spots make up 16% of the Helium in Lirinda\u0027s atmosphere) These spots have magnetic field lines coming out of them, scanning of the core of the planet reveals 3 lumps in the same area of these spots, possible indicating a large planet that split in 3 large pieces before colliding and merging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuintus is not that interesting, but it has a small, but extremely molten core, its magnetic field interacts with its parent body\u0027s magnetic fields. Nobody know why it has a molten core as the tidal forces affecting the moon are extremely weak if not no tidal forces at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarion has a crust of Sylvite, suggesting a much more wetter and then extreme hot past, possibly it was in a orbit closer to Kerbol before interacting with a planet being put into a eccentric orbit where it took it close to Kerbol then far away where it was captured. Varion is affected by tidal forces causing volcanic eruptions which spout Nitrogen which interacts with other chemicals in the atmosphere and rain down as nitric acid and this process has created 2 lakes of nitric acid, one of these lakes have a delta traveling from it. During stormy seasons, the delta floods and expands causing it to create a shallow basin around it which will eventual be deep enough to become a lake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Llhxd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Llhxd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YcGuN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YcGuN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-22T22:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2012 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by VenereanSoviet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixing a typo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T04:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExellent idea!
