Something about the whole Ec to Joules system that\u0027s bugged me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, when you\u0027re talking about Joules, usually you\u0027re expressing energy in the form of mechanical or thermal energy. When working with an electrical system powering equipment, mechanical and thermal energy is a product process, an output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen working with electrical equipment, you\u0027re storing your joules in the form of potentials in an electrical circuit or voltage. The reason electricity is so useful is because we can take mechanical or thermal energy, and transfer it to a large number of processes ranging from purely computational, which is just lots of small switches putting out a little heat, to fully mechanical in the form of your industrial, 3-phase induction motor. (Which incidentally, puts out a huge amount of heat in itself)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is at the motor itself that the electricity converts to thermal or mechanical power. And it is Electrical voltages that the motors consume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I understand your logic is to say that Ec\u0027s and Mj\u0027s are just two scales of energy, without transducers to interswap these values freely, you are literally telling physics to go sit in a corner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all reality, your equipment should run on Ec\u0027s... anything that runs on electricity should use Ec\u0027s. It\u0027s just a matter of scaling how many Ecs they use. Your drill should run on Ec if it uses an electric motor. However, it should use a scaled up amount of Ecs as would make the solar configs we\u0027re used to seeing cry home to mommy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this in my opinion should go for (SOME OF) the other equipment in KSPI. Does that mean some of the equipment will have scale values that make Fractal look at it and go \u0027that\u0027s a silly small amount to the point as well be useless\u0027 ? Yes. But the point is that you can still use it, silly as the design might be. It will take days to build up the charge needed to run something for one second, but the option is \u0027there\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, one method of doing it if you want to throw around scales of units, is transformers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScale a million Ec\u0027s up to a Mega-Ec and another that scales Mega-Ec\u0027s down to a million Ec\u0027s. Maybe waste a few hundred each way during operation. But then you can free-transform your power scales without making those of us in a power machines class wonder why the units are doing the hokey pokey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat in turn allows for the introduction of high energy storage units... Mega-Ec heavy batteries and the like. But I get way ahead of myself. One thing at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL : DR version: I think the entirety of unit conversion system for KSPI could use an overhaul and cleanup for more universal cross-usage of energy. EVEN IF certain configurations of such a system would be laughable. But that\u0027s me and the OCD Engineer in me talking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RadHazard","CreatedById":80815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T02:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure why that\u0027s necessary. MJ in KSP Interstellar are MJ of electric charge. While Joules may usually be used for thermal or mechanical energy, there\u0027s nothing wrong with using the unit to measure electrical energy. Indeed, the definition of one watt is one joule of energy per second. One MJ is equal to 1000 kJ, which is what Fractal_UK uses as the definition of one unit of EC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s nothing in KSPI that uses MJ for anything that you wouldn\u0027t use electricity for in real life.

While the term is colloquially used when talking about batteries, the actual unit of charge (the Coulomb, or the Ampere-Hour) really has little to do with energy storage. Batteries are sometimes rated in Ah, but this is a measure of how long it will run under a given amperage, and can\u0027t be converted to energy or power without knowing more about the circuit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-23T02:40:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2013 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RadHazard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T02:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Goonswarm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Goonswarm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really wish there was some sort of FAQ on how upgrading or the advanced engines work.

It is probably a good idea to first design a fairly good medium-heavy lift vehicle to help you lift some of the big reactors into space.

I\u0027ve said before that if you want an ingame justification for the difference between the two resourcs, you can consider Megajoules as AC Power produced by large generating equipment and ElectricCharge as DC power created by the likes of solar cells and thermocouples. Generators are equipped with rectifiers to supply whichever is needed but solar panels and such aren\u0027t by default equipped with inverters to provide AC power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, as RadHazard suggests, this isn\u0027t purely a game constraint of design, it\u0027s a practical one as well. Megajoules (as well as ThermalPower and WasteHeat) use a custom resource manager in the mod which is far more advanced than the stock one, this is what makes the generators adapting to power demand possible. The resource manager has lots of information about the current power supply and demand situation and can also make decisions about prioritisation of power if its in short supply and generally ensure as little power is used as possible. This information simply doesn\u0027t exist in the stock resource system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could actually use the resource manager with ElectricCharge but the problem with doing so is that any stock device that produced ElectricCharge would not be detected as a supply (this is a big problem because then that power might as well not be generated) and anything that consumed ElectricCharge would not be detected as a demand (this isn\u0027t such a problem provided there aren\u0027t lots of components doing this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s best not to introduce two incompatible systems, its safer to keep them seperate. Hopefully someday we\u0027ll see an improved stock resource system, it\u0027s one of the most needed features in the game at this point, particularly for modders. If I ever adapt the resource manager to support others types of resource transfer, rather than just ALL_VESSEL flow, I\u0027ll probably release it as a standalone thing for other modders to make use of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T02:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current system isn\u0027t ideal and it does constrain design but only in a absolutely tiny number of circumstances.

Take EC\u0027s over time, turn them into MJ, and store a small amount.
