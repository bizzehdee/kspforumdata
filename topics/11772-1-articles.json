Not measured in GAME time, but in REAL LIFE time. For example, a larger orbit will take the Kerbal pilots longer to complete, but yields a faster warp speed to the player. Piloting the whole mission in 2x speed will have a huge impact on the end time, but much needed accuracy will be sacrificed.\n\n Of course, providing evidence for claimed times is going to be unreliable- so we\\\u0027ve decided to post this one with good faith in you guys. This leads us onto **the rules:**\n\n*First off, mission flight time begins at Lift Off. Meaning fast forwarding* ***pre-mission*** *in order to launch at a time when the mun is in an optimal position is encouraged!*\n\n**1: No mods are allowed**, apart from the simple and not game changing ones such as MechJeb and Decoupler Shrouds. Any mod that has an impact on ship speed or fuel capacity is strictly forbidden.\n\n**2: Landing on the Mun is classed as coming to a complete stop on the Mun\\\u0027s surface** for at least 10 REAL LIFE seconds, with no engines of any kind being active during that time.\n\n**3: Three images are required:** First the ship on the pad before Lift Off; Second the ship planted firmly at rest on the Mun; Lastly the **mission end overview**, with the command module at rest on Kerbin and the crew **INTACT** (aka alive, intact just sounds cooler).\n\nThe absolute best way to prove your claimed time is accurate is to provide video evidence, but we obviously can\\\u0027t expect everyone to do so.\n\nPlease, don\\\u0027t hesitate to share your strategies with the rest of us mere mortals! If you have a particular trick in order to save time I\\\u0027m sure we\\\u0027d all be interested to hear it.\n\nAnd that... is about it. ***Good Luck, fellow Kerbonaughts!***\n\n**LEADER BOARD:**\n\n**1st: Optical9090 - 00:12:53.30**\n\n**2nd: HOCgaming - 00:16:26**"},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T00:22:22Z","Content":"My time is **16 minutes and 26 seconds**\n\nAs displayed by this handy video here...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ah3EUjVvXTA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T15:51:36Z","Content":"I was going to post \u002B/- 180mph but it\\\u0027s a different kind of challenge.."},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T18:59:49Z","Content":"Going to try this one out, will try with MechJeb and without.\n\nExpect results in a few hours ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEdit: Is there any preferred method of time-keeping, I was just going to use the following site: [http://stopwatch.onlineclock.net/.](http://stopwatch.onlineclock.net/.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Optical9090","CreatedById":20177,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T19:34:36Z","Content":"Herman, Shepney and Billy-Bobfel Kerman just returned from their speedrun. \n\n12:53.3 was the time from lift-off until splash-down in the ocean.\n\nCould have done it quicker but i was aiming for high Gs too.\n\nSadly, if the game-engine had allowed it, our brave pilots would have been pancaked when their pod entered Kerbin atmosphere at ~5000 m/s or roughly 18000 km/h."},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T11:13:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there any preferred method of time-keeping, I was just going to use the following site: [http://stopwatch.onlineclock.net/.](http://stopwatch.onlineclock.net/.)\n\nThat\\\u0027s a great site to use, and no there isn\\\u0027t really any preferred way to time it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 12:53.3 was the time from lift-off until splash-down in the ocean.\n\u003E Could have done it quicker but i was aiming for high Gs too.\n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly, if the game-engine had allowed it, our brave pilots would have been pancaked when their pod entered Kerbin atmosphere at ~5000 m/s or roughly 18000 km/h.\n\nNice time!
