For instance, if you select LF \u002B O it would automatically balance to a 9/11 ratio. In the basic Mk 2 fuselage this would give you a max of 270 liquid fuel and 330 oxidizer.

I strongly disagree with the perceived need for them, and think that they would be unnecessary clutter and complexity. Not newbie-friendly. There is a clear need for LF-only tanks, but there is never a situation which actually requires O-only. Either carry less LF in the first place, or carry more LF\u002BO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard the arguments before, that somehow it makes sense to enable use of the dregs of LF-only tanks once out of the atmosphere, but have never been even remotely convinced by those arguments. The perceived benefits of a bit more orbital dV would very likely be minuscule, or even non-existent due to the additional weight required to carry the O-only up there in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, an emphatic \u0022NO, this makes no sense\u0022 from me, unless someone can actually produce a convincing case for it (which I believe is impossible).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
