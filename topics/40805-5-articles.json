In terms of popularity, the game is still reasonably popular, but many of the more casual players (i.e. those who don\u0027t REALLY get into the game and were more likely to have gotten it on a whim at 1.0 or to play MP with their friends) are starting to move on to other games.

Squad\u0027s new project has fizzled out, and the company quietly exits the video game business. Several of the devs (now wiser and more experienced) acquire the rights to KSP, quit Squad and recruit members of the community to kickstart KSP2, which is a complete rebuild of the game to surpass even the voxelized awesomeness of its competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T06:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the future: Squad updates KSP to Unity 18, and thus KSP now supports quantum computing.
