It does indeed work as advertised. Caution for using it on launch, though: because it is throttling engines differentially, in an asparagus configuration this throttling leads to slightly different rates of fuel consumption. Hence one side of your asparagus runs out of fuel before the other, causing the vessel to begin vibrating, potentially violently if you\u0027re lucky, and to spin out of control if you\u0027re unlucky.

Instead, the thrust balance adjusted at times when gimbal would be sufficient - robbing my craft of power at inopportune times.

How does this mod work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt first calculates the torque each engine is capable of and when a steering command is given, by yourself, by SAS or by anything else, it adjusts the throttle based on this torque. An engine is incorporated in the calculations when: it possesses the module \u0022ModuleEngines\u0022 and when it\u0027s field \u0022throttle enabled\u0022 is TRUE. This includes all the stock liquid engines, and excludes the SRB\u0027s. Also the thrust is assumed on the y-axis of the engine, which might not be true for modded engines. If anyone knows a more elegant solution, let me know. It is also worth nothing that my mod doesn\u0027t balances your craft, SAS balances your craft, and my mod picks up SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What do the sliders do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust factor: This sets the aggressiveness of the mod. With this to max, complete engines will completely shut down, even on minor corrections.

Only when a throttle change of more than 20% is asked, the engines will react.
