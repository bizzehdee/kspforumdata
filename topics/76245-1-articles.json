Sweet! It\u0027s a bit far out (63Mm) and its orbit still passes through Mun\u0027s SOI so I placed a maneuver node and used the right-click buttons to advance the node around one orbit at a time until it found the next intercept. Then I did it again on the projected path to get a third intercept and see what the asteroid would be up to in the future. Given that it moves closer after the first encounter, that would be a good time to head out, grab it and place it in a more stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/KSA/Skyvents/b87dw2id.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b87dw2id.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever a few in-game days later (earth time) when I viewed the rock in the tracking station the saved maneuver node no longer showed any Mun encounter. So I hopped over to the rock (the latest Kerbal Alarm Clock lets you jump to the asteroid when an alarm for it fires, so set a 0 second delay, hit Jump to Ship and boom, you\u0027re in flight with the asteroid) and deleted the node, made a new one and proceeded to advance my orbit until Mun encounter. This is what I got:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe orbits are different and now instead of 107 days it\u0027s 196 days to AP after the first encounter. Uhm, okay. I deleted that node and tried again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eson of a... 300 days?? So I created a second node on the projected orbit and that changed the Ap from 69Mm to 68Mm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, if I grabbed and just moved the node around the orbit back and forth, it would change the orbit until after dragging it around for a bit (and through a Minmus encounter) I ended up with this - although I could have kept going\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I tried moving the node ahead 1 orbit with the right-click buttons and doing so also moved the node\u0027s position and the orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd deleting the second node left me with this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I restarted the game and got this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/weirdnodes9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdnodes9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI restarted again and the same result as above came up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if the physics is supposed to be on rails for this kind of stuff what\u0027s messing with the placement of the orbits? Or am I misunderstanding how KSP plots this stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
