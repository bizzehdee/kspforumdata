We don\u0027t really know this yet since its only been tested in a stationary mounted scenario, not along track in a vacuum or anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d think that the more space it covers in a given amount of time, the more particles that will get trapped into the EM fields in a given amount of time and the more material you could use to produce thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if the particle is stationary and you\u0027re moving at an incredible speed compared to it, you may not have the EM strength to capture the particle. So you may only be getting the particles that happen to pop into existence within the space of the EM field at a given moment in time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what I\u0027ve never heard described about particles that pop in and out of existence, is if they\u0027re at an absolute speed of zero or if they\u0027re aligned with the rotation of the earth or the sun or anything else. If a particle were to pop into existence on earth, one would assume that it would have some predefined speed and direction before gravity can act on it, or no speed and direction at all.....which compared to the perspective of a person on rotating earth, would still appear to be moving the opposite direction of rotation at well over 1000mph. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it\u0027s going to take more power to capture more particles the faster you go otherwise they will just shoot through your EM field. Widening the EM field instead of just making it stronger could ensure a larger area to trap more particles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T03:11:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 03:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T06:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbtrek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerbtrek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the quark with that, is does speed change the \u0027absorption\u0027 of particles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t seem to, in the case of Hawking Radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Man","CreatedById":96549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T11:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has to be pointed out that the \u0027particles popping in and out of existence\u0027 picture is about as suitable for reasoning about quantum vacuum effects as the \u0027series of tubes\u0027 picture is for the Internet.

The QED vacuum is Lorentz invariant. Any hypothetical device using the QED vacuum as propulsion \u0022medium\u0022 will have to have a trust/power ratio that is independent of the current velocity.\u003Cp\u003EA bit more detail on the virtual particles: The virtual particles always pop in in groups, the most frequent one being electron, positron and photon. Total momentum of the group is always zero, as is total energy (1). That is true wherever they appear and from whatever frame of reference you measure their effects. The momenta of the individual particles that contribute to your process depend on your process: the higher your general energy scale, the higher the momenta of the virtual particles you have to take into account. In this case, the energy scales are really, really low; the virtual particles will still mostly have relativistic momentum, though (2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I carefully avoid discussing speed/velocity. That is a property virtual particles simply do not have in any meaningful way. Very naively put, they are simply not around long enough to get two position measurements done that differ by more than the inherent quantum uncertainty of the measurements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: That is, of course, classically impossible. That is the reason why they have to vanish again before the universe notices something is amiss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: If you are violating classical laws to spirit an electron into existence, you may as well ask for a little more and get an electron with a lot of momentum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
