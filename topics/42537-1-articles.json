I\u0027ve landed successfully and have got little less then half my fuel left (approx. 7L). My ship that I need to intercept is in 158 degree inclination measured with kerbal engineering mod (so it goes east to west) since I stupidly come around the wrong side on my Mun orbit and never though to correct it thinking of I had plenty of fuel on my lander. So since I don\u0027t have a lot of fuel I was thinking of timing my launch so that I intercept the ship when I reach AP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I calculate when to launch? I was thinking launch profile of launch up couple hundred meters (I am in pretty flat terrain) then burn on horizon till me AP intersects the ships orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what heading to aim for when launching to match the 158 degree inclination of the ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E My current plan is to quicksave. Do a launch and measure the time it takes to reach the AP that intersects. Then quickload, and switch to the ship and add maneuver at the intersect point. When the ETA is just before the time it takes the lander to reach that point, switch back and do my launch. Though still not sure what heading to go to match inclination. At the moment been wasting fuel adjusting it as I do my launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T02:13:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by grom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECurrent plan\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T02:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow much delta-v does your lander have left?

You can just launch in a retrograde orbit as well i think, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wait untill your landed lander crosses under the orbit of the ship in orbit. Then set your orbital vessel as a target, and then you should be able to deduce from the icons on your navball in which direction you should launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor timing, you can always try Scott Manley\u0027s \u0022Launch when target comes over the horizon\u0022. Its most likely meant for Kerbin, but it might work on the Mun too within a reasonable margin. And once you\u0027re reasonably close and in similar orbits, it won\u0027t take much delta-V to make the last bit of catching up/letting it catch up. 600 m/s sounds very reasonable to get into Munar orbit and preform maneuvers there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
