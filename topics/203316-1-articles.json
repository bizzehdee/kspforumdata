There could be multiple factors to this rating\u2014radiation exposure, sufficient food, adequate habitation space, luxuries like centrifuges and recreation modules, etc. It could also be that different modules had higher radiation shielding ratings and you\u2019d average them and multiply that by the vessel\u2019s cumulative exposure passing through different zones with varying levels of danger. This would make it a bit of a spatial puzzle as well.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also thinking they will lean towards something like this.
