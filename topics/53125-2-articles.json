It\u0027s about how long you can maintain the same well designed craft under the limitations. You leave it in orbit to refuel it later and the landing missions are to be done with a separate lander, unless it states that you can land the entire vessel. As for using an SSTO, shuttle, and non asparagus staging, it\u0027s mainly to see if you can use different methods to achieve the same result. Building an SSTO or shuttle to carry payloads up would be more difficult depending on the payload weight and how easily it can attach to the craft carrying it. Non-asparagus staging to get things into orbit is simple enough, but it\u0027s a lower point value. A lot of the challenges that award different points is to separate more skilled engineers from new players, but I would still like people of all skill levels to be able to compete in the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour craft has to be versatile, but maybe versatile isn\u0027t the best word to describe the challenge as a whole. It\u0027s a marathon challenge with new missions every two weeks, you have to keep and maintain the same craft you start with at the beginning, adapt it to the mission parameters, and get everything back to Kerban in the end. I guess it\u0027s in a way, simulating the cost constraints and missions that aren\u0027t officially made apart of the game yet. If you can think of a better name for the challenge then let me know, if it helps describe the challenge better I\u0027ll change the name so it makes more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T09:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1 satellite for \u0022both equatorial and polar orbits\u0022...how?\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022core craft\u0022 should be waiting at LKO...awaiting attachment of rovers \u0026amp; lander.
