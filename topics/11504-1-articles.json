About a kid in germany who \u0027worked out how to calculate exactly the path of a projectile under gravity and subject to air resistance,\u0027 using an analytical solution\n\nThought this might be relevant to ksp because in the discussions about gravity and the modeling approach the devs seemed to mention the high priority of using an analytical solution. with features, obviously, planned for modeling particles falling through an atmosphere under the influence of gravity, a heretofore unknown analytical solution now presents itself with many press releases. perhaps it will be useful?\n\nHis paper, in english is titled, \u0027Analytical solution of two fundamental unsolved problems of particle dynamics\u0027, (or in the original german, \u0027Analytische L\u00C3\u00B6sung von zwei ungel\u00C3\u00B6sten fundamentalen Partikeldynamikproblemen\u0027)\n\nThe best references to it i could find are at this forum: [http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=236821](http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=236821)\n\nmost official looking place as potential source of the paper: [http://www.jufo-dresden.de/projekt/teilnehmer/matheinfo/m1](http://www.jufo-dresden.de/projekt/teilnehmer/matheinfo/m1)\n\nmaybe his discovery could make kerbin a better place? if we can find the actual paper, that is. and the devs find it useful and appropriate."},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T15:56:45Z","Content":"It hasn\\\u0027t really got anything to do with gravity...\n\nAnd by the looks of it, he used a ball...
