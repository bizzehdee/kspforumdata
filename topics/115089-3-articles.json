I used the technique during my munar probe missions to get the science home. You just have to eyeball the intercept.

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u0027t do it within the part count limit.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Slashy\n\nYes that part count is a tad bit annoying and remember to reduce ablator to 20 units for reduced mass (should try with zero units and see if that works at least the vessel won\u0027t go in head first when out of electric). Had to take a few passes through the atmosphere in order to return safely.\n\nQuest For Fire sure was an awesome movie. Funny I don\u0027t remember that scene.

The bigger fins are way too stable and shoot the rocket straight up. This design -almost- gravity-turns itself into space; turn a couple of degrees east after reaching ~50m/s, careful throttling, and a little bit of tweaking on the way up was all it needed.

I run vertical to 80-100 m/sec (depending on t/w ratio) and then kick over 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 east and turn off SAS. After that, I taper the t/w ratio with the pitch angle.\n\n Sometimes it drops me right in, but other times it\u0027s way off. I\u0027ll try it your way; I\u0027d love to have a better process for this.\n\n/cavemen know their KSP\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T23:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"}]}
