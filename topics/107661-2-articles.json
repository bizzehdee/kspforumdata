Landed at Kerbin\u0027s Water can be done by having a barge of some sort (ie. decouple the bottom part of your vessel, and the top part is \u0022landed\u0022 on the bottom one). There\u0027s also various archipelagos where you can get landed. Same thing for grasslands - lots of lakes and rivers.\n\nAnd if you\u0027re interested, my Field Research contract pack (link in sig) has contracts that help find those \u0022rare\u0022 combinations by providing contracts with waypoints for them."},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Key Aerospace","CreatedById":138926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:53:23Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t found any islands where you can get \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0027s water\u0022 since 0.25. Let me know if you have found one, I\u0027m always interested.\n\nI\u0027ve always figured the right way is to make some sort of aircraft carrier. A plane with really big wings (to splash-down) and a separate VTOL craft (to land on it) would do the trick.\n\nThere is a cheat-ish way of getting it. You splash-down a craft with 2 cockpits, then EVA one pilot, then switch back to the craft. KSP does\u0027t care which one is on top - they are both landed. The EVA\u0027d pilot is \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0027s water\u0022 but so is the entire craft. As long as they are in contact they are \\_BOTH\\_ \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0027s water.\u0022 By flipping between the two you can cover all science in one go.\n\nYou can also (gently) crash two splashed-down craft into each other.

Available science is an indexed list for speed. (On-board science is a list of science-containing-parts on launched vessels. Available science is CrewReports, EvaReports, SurfaceSamples \u002B science parts purchased in the R\u002BD Lab. I\u0027ve optimised both lists for look-ups) **[x] Science! is now blazingly fast and (fingers crossed) just doesn\u0027t slow down.**\n- Building upgrades, part purchases, science unlocking do a full science rescan. KSC baby-biomes will appear in the list correctly. Surface-Sample is correctly handled. **[x] Science handles career mode correctly.**\n\nConcerning EVA Reports\n\nEVA reports are always available. I think this is correct.\n\nWith a not-upgraded AstroCenter Kerbals can only EVA on Kerbin. But they can still do EVA Reports. They can do EVA Reports anywhere. They just need to get there. So...\n\n1. EVA on Kerbin.\n2. Enter a cargo bay.\n3. Fly to Mun.\n4. Leave cargo bay.\n5. Do Eva Report\n6. Profit!\n\n I did put in code for suppressing EVA Reports for AstroCenter level 0 but I took it out \u0027cos EVA is limited to Kerbin but EVA Reports aren\u0027t.\n\n More stuff in next version\n\nDon\u0027t know what else will be in v4.5 but I may get around to... \n\n- Window keeps getting wider as the scroll bar appears and disappears.\n- Store window visibility for each scene\n- Window remains visible in main-menu scene\n- Total in top-left doesn\u0027t update after vehicle recovery\n- No one has asked for it but I would like to have a \u0022Lab Lander\u0022 mode. Science would be considered \u0022complete\u0022 with a green bar - even if it hasn\u0027t been recovered to KSC. The top-left total and \u0022hide completed\u0022 setting would act accordingly. The reason is that when I have a lab-lander containing loads of science I know I need to recover it. What I want from [x] Science is to find what is left to discover. That would be easier with all the 100%-researched stuff hidden.\n- I\u0027d like to add lab-lander mode as a setting, also a setting to look for science stored in debris."},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Key Aerospace","CreatedById":138926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:55:17Z","Content":"DMagic was kind enough to let me have a bit of code so I can tell if planets have been scanned with the M700 Surface Scanner.\n\nA scan is worth 10 science points.
