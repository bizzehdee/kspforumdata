When the destination planet is at roughly the correct position according to the chart you should have a reasonably good transfer window.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You could see it with [thread=98943]Distant Object Enhancement[/thread], in the sense that the planet would be visible in the sky near zenith at Kerbin midnight.\n\nI love DOE, an excellent mod. You\u0027re right that this would technically be seeing it in the night sky, it\u0027s just hard to distinguish anything special in such a pic compared to any other pic of a body in the sky at night.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T21:55:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T13:29:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there an idiots version of that \u0027Phase Angle\u0027 chart?\n\nTry this:\n\n[http://ksp.olex.biz/](http://ksp.olex.biz/)\n\nIt\u0027s nice because not only does it handle \u0022what\u0027s the phase angle between planet A and planet B\u0022, but it also tells you what place to start your burn based on how high your circular orbit is."}]}
