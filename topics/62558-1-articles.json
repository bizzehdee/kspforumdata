I\u0027d like to show you my best personal achievement in Kerbal Space Program! I\u0027ve been playing for about 6 months, and discovered the forums a while ago. Moving on, project \u0022Muddaship\u0022 is my first Mothership in KSP. I use a bunch of mods, I think it is much more fun and exciting. Even if I have 3000 Isp \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E and a couple dozens of tons as a main engine.
