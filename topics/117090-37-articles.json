You will need a part attached to the node for the slider to show up.  Make sure they both say \u00274\u0027, and test again.  Simply launch the craft, and test it on the pad.

I\u0027ll do some testing of that configuration tonight/tomorrow (if I remember) and see if I can spot the issue.\n\nWill be revisiting the ISA part in the near future (next couple of weeks) to add a proper payload base model (same as the upcoming fairing parts), and clean up its decoupler setup (move to using standard decoupler modules).\n\nMore general development updates:\n\n- SC-FUEL-MFT-A - Modular Fuel Tank has been \u0027finished\u0027 and is undergoing internal testing.  All of the design requirements were met, and it looks like it should be a fairly stable part in the future.\n- Added tech-limits to SC-FUEL-MUS - Modular Upper Stage parts; implemented the same as with MFT part\n- Fixed up in-editor mass display of all modular/custom/procedural parts except lander-core parts.  SC-GEN-DC, SC-GEN-ISA, SC-FUEL-MFT, SC-FUEL-MUS, SC-GEN-RBDC\n- Added interstage optional node to SC-FUEL-MFT, SC-FUEL-MUS, and SC-ENG parts.  There should be a \u0027Toggle Interstage Node\u0027 button in the VAB to enable/disable this node.  It will be used by the upcoming interstage decoupler, and can be used by the existing Interstage Petal Adapter.\n- Working on adding tech-limits to the rest of the configurable parts (SC-GEN-DC, SC-GEN-ISA both done, SC-GEN-RBDC is WIP)\n- Nearly every plugin/module has had some bugs fixed or new features added over this week; so there might well be some new bugs/etc to run into =\\\n- This weeks release will mark the start of the \u0027Semi-Public\u0027 release stage.  During this stage I will be posting a link in the OP directly to the most recent \u0027stable\u0027 release, and will begin doing more frequent dev/testing releases (every couple of days rather than once a week).  The \u0027stable\u0027 release might only be updated every few weeks/month, depending upon the stability of the dev releases.  Will be reorganizing my internal workflow/dev setup a bit to accommodate this (moving to using repo-branches a bit more, creating a pack-and-publish script to save me a bit of time).  The first \u0027stable\u0027 release will likely be the current 0.2.22 release -- I\u0027m sure this weekends release will have a few issues in it that need cleaning up.\n\nIn slightly more exciting news (for me at least), I remembered seeing/stumbling upon this little gem of info:\n\n[https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager/wiki/Managing-Dynamic-Modules](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager/wiki/Managing-Dynamic-Modules)\n\nApparently ModuleManager includes the capability to clean up part-persistence-save-data stubs from module config data that does not exist in the prefab part.  This was the single problem that kept me from implementing a proper module-switching functionality (the stuff used in the lander-core parts is a giant hack, at best... works, and is reliable so far, but is a giant hack/workaround).  So... I -might- be able to implement some of the functions I\u0027ve been holding off on -- such as being able to disable/remove the RCS on the MUS, or optional retro-rockets on the fuel tanks.  Will begin looking into this in the near future; have a few uses for it right now, and would like to re-implement the lander-core parts for cleaner setup/functionality/inclusion of stock modules where needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T01:39:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, MrMeeb said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll do as you suggested tomorrow.
