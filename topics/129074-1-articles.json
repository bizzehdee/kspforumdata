Everything is 3x bigger, and KSC is no longer on the equator.

The \u0022upgrading\u0022 buildings mechanic does nothing other than add frustrations. The T1 buildings, Stock is horrible. No surface samples... even on Kerbin (wut?) no EVA, 25 parts, 18t on the pad, the runway is a literal death trap, can\u0027t plot anything... 2 contracts at a time, and the HR building is limited to what you can do. T2 is a HUGE jump, but drains money like crazy and the R\u0026amp;D is limited to 100 science. To upgrade the stupid thing is like a couple million. No, Just no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur other solution is to use science mode... but that doesnt include contracts, which give purpose to the game, and a direction.
