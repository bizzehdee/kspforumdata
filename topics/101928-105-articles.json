KIS uses protos and prefabs a lot! If they fail to do the job then KIS fails as well.\n\nIn both cases above the issue is in BaseFieldList class: for a reason *some* modules in prefab have it half-initialized. To be more specific, member \u0060BaseFieldList._fields\u0060 is null. When \u0060ProtoPartSnapshot\u0060 goes thru modules to save their fields it attempts to get enumerator and fails with NRE. I solve this issue by calling \u0060Awake()\u0060 on \u0060PartModule\u0060 via reflection. It does the right initialization, and proto part doesn\u0027t fail. Another (but related) problem is nulls in \u0060[KSPField]\u0060 annotated fields. Looks like persisting code doesn\u0027t like it badly so, again, I fix it via reflection by setting to a default non-null value (e.g. field \u0022controlSrcStatusText\u0022 in ModuleCommand is set to an empty string).  \n\nUPD: The errors above is a result of getting snapshot for \u0022Probodobodyne HECS\u0022 with the mod installed and my fixes turned off. If I call \u0022Awake\u0022 on the module prior to get the snapshot then everything is working fine.\n\nUPD2: Here is [the code](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/Plugins/Source/KIS_Shared.cs#L782) that does the cleanup.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-08T08:53:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2016 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by IgorZ**"},{"CreatedByName":"habix","CreatedById":164066,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T13:17:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, IgorZ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Rob2222](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/102318-rob2222/) [@Bishop149](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/82368-bishop149/) [@cyberpunkdreams](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/161836-cyberpunkdreams/) [@StevieC](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/146665-steviec/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Guys, please try [this patch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gawKJed-H4X0tDa3k2WndVdVE/view?usp=sharing).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Detection of the uninitialized modules is now dirty but much more reliable.

Is OnStart or OnLoad called when a part is attached by KIS? How about when it is removed?\n\u003E \n\nAttach/detach part events are handled via common KSP mechanism. Register for evens \u0022GameEvents.onPartAttach\u0022 and \u0022GameEvents.onPartRemove\u0022. Alternatively, you can listen for KIS event \u0022OnKISAction\u0022 but there are cons:\n\n1. You\u0027ll have to deal with its parameters to figure out what happen.\n2.

This may be a known bug, but I couldn\u0027t seem to find anything regarding it. Upon loading a save of a Duna base, all struts, pipes and ground pylons suddenly break and flip up into the air. Is this expected behavior due to the nature of the KSP saves, or is there something I can do about it?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/luZxhaZ](http://imgur.com/luZxhaZ)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I\u0027m not actually sure if this falls under KIS or KAS. Let me know if its the latter and I\u0027ll move it.\n\u003E \n\n    As stated before, it is a known issue.  That said, I have a large base on the Mun (20\u002B buildings and ships) connected together with KAS and I have a rule of thumb that I use:  \n\n   ... always connect and disconnect along the linear \u0027chain\u0027.  In other words, the last thing you connected should be the first thing you disconnect.  Like a \u0027stack\u0027 of plates.  \n\n    If you disconnect or connect somewhere in the middle, it is much more likely to send everything flying into the air for a fireworks show.   \n\n    It also seems to depend which direction you attach to.  The larger section is situated on the ground and if anything needs to bounce around a bit, it is the smaller one I just added.   \n\n    If I follow this rule of thumb, my base does just fine.  That also means that if I want to disconnect something further down the chain, I must disconnect everything leading to it, and then reconnect leading back out.  One after another... in a linear chain.  \n\n     Another thing that I see happen occasionally if I link more than 2 lines to a single ship/building is that the connector becomes a permanent part of the ship/building.  When I disconnect it, the ship now has its axis origin of the mass at the point of the connector making it impossible to fly the ship without veering in the direction of the connector.  There seems to be no way to remove the connector as I must destroy everything attached to it first.  That is my biggest headache and can only be fixed with a reload (unless there is a fix that I am unaware of).  \n\n     Perhaps others have different experiences, but for me, this has been the easiest way to play without needing to reload often from, as they refer to it... the Kraken.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-11T09:11:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2016 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SCESW**"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T10:38:36Z","Content":"[@SCESW](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/164913-scesw/) [@AlexGodbehere](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/20472-alexgodbehere/) Actually the major reason bases blow up is a ground attachment.
