I\u0027ve added them into my parts folder but they don\u0027t show up ingame. Any help is appreciated, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T14:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe demo has a different structure than the normal game, so it won\u0027t recognize the location where parts are to be added to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut beyond that, the demo is based on KSP version 0.18.3, there are so many differences to the current game version (0.25) that most probably will cause issues with parts not specifically meant for that version. And, the game has so many more features in the current version, you should really consider getting a regular license for KSP instead. Given that Steam at the moment offers KSP for 40% off, I would hurry to get it now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
