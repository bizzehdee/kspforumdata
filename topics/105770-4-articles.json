By getting flung outward after the Tylo flyby you can tune your Jool apoapsis and thereby your arrival time at Laythe\u0027s orbit to whenever Laythe will be there. It\u0027s pretty universal as long as your Jool approach isn\u0027t too far out of Tylo\u0027s orbital plane. I tried paths that get flung inward but they make getting a future encounter much harder. I\u0027m also going to try your suggestion of taking off with the Rapier in closed mode, in open cycle it sits there for about 10 seconds spooling up before it even moves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENefrums- Very nice mission so far, that is a lot of dV still in the tank after returning to orbit from Laythe. It\u0027ll be interesting to see what you do with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eselfish_meme- I\u0027ll try that too. I want to find the limit of the dV I can get to orbit with a single Rapier using a vertical ascent, I suspect the maximum possible is around 1600m/s but it would take about 2300m/s to do a Laythe-and-return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It looks to me like the fastest you can get in air-breathing mode with the Rapier is about 1500m/s on Kerbal (without exploding, anyway). Has anyone substantially beaten that? Next step up is one Rapier and 1 nuke, I see Val has already made some high-dV ones of those with the Dart Mk5 and 6.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nefrums","CreatedById":145422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMission success!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum updated: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/PT7J7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/PT7J7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENefrums: That is all kinds of awesome, you put that extra dV to good use! 30 minute suicide burns?
