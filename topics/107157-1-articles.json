My idea was to have the shuttle-cockpit and then 1 or 2 MK3 cargo bays, with the bay doors facing downwards. I then wanted to connect any payload with a small decoupler to the center of the cockpit bulkhead.\n\nThe idea was to fly over a certain area, open the bay doors and then \u0022stage\u0022 the decoupler which would then let the payload drop out of the plane.\n\nThen quickly switch to the falling object, trigger it\u0027s parachutes (I dont want to deploy parachutes at the same time as the ejection because that would drag the payload into the plane) and the landing legs and let it drop to the ground on its own while hopping back to the plane and land this one home safely.\n\nAlmost proud of my idea, I added the decoupler (the small white red one- forgot the name) to the green connecting ball at the bulkhead but now I cannot add anything to that. I also tried attaching docking ports, which works fine but then you cannot add anything to that docking port.\n\nWhats the sense of having this cargo bay if I cannot transport something (also to space, like a satellite) which then cannot be released.\n\nAm I missing something or do you have any ideas?\n\nSee picture below of my test-construction:\n\n![\u003Ca  href=]()![%7Boption%7D](%7Boption%7D)http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150503/8wdlsv2t.png\u0027 alt=\u00278wdlsv2t.png\u0027\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T18:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bogeyman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:51:53Z","Content":"I should google more: [http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2pka11/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2pka11/)\n\nSolution is the ALT-key"}]}
