Even mods that have disappeared, and fallen through the cracks. With that including smaller mods that inspired bigger mods to take place, and mods that have been continued through other people who have stepped up to the plate. Thinking about it and knowing that this list would be massive and a large undertaking, I believe that it would in a way give honor to those have passed on(from KSP), or noting the hard work of modders who\u0027s work have been added into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
