If you don\u0027t slow down enough you come out the other side, but there is no way you can call this \u0022literally\u0022 skipping off the atmosphere, because \u0022skipping\u0022 requires a force pushing you outwards, which could only be lift, and the author goes to significant lengths to show that lift is mostly irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise with aerobraking: sure you can use lift to alter your passage through the atmosphere, which is good for controlling your heating rate, minimum altitude, time spent decelerating and final orbit, but it is absolutely not necessary to have a lifting body and you definitely do not \u0022bounce\u0022 out of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, am I missing something, or is this \u0022skipping\u0022 notion just wrong?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can understand it being used as a shorthand way of saying \u0022pass through the atmosphere with insufficient deceleration\u0022, and have no problem with that (as in, \u0022we need to make a burn to reduce \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E otherwise we\u0027ll skip instead of capturing\u0022), but not if you keep adding \u0022literally\u0022, and not if you imply that you need a lifting body to aerobrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T14:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah the \u0022literally skipping\u0022 part is wrong.
