When the Antares rocket exploded, some idiot reporter asked whether they were going to have problems with not having enough supplies on the ISS, as if they were going to starve or something. I don\u0027t even know why it\u0027s so frustrating to me, but It\u0027s so obivous that they know how many things can go wrong in a rocket and plan for every scenario, including this. When they resupply the ISS, they still have a month or two\u0027s-worth of provisions, just in case.\n\nThen, there was that twin engine ATR 72-600 prop plane that crashed in Taiwan, and the news(I don\u0027t remember who, probably CNN) lady had an aviation expert there to answer questions, and she asks, \u0022Is this plane generally considered, \u0027safe\u0027?\u0022 And that was the day I vowed never to watch the News voluntarily. \n\nNo plane meant to carry any living human being EVER makes it off the ground without thousands of tests, codes, and regulations to make sure it\u0027s safe in almost all expected situations.\n\nI just, hate the news...
