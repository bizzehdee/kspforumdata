Changes: Fixed an issue with Multi Vessel landings. In the old way MCE worked you could not really do Apollo style landings very well because MCE tracks mission completed goals with Vessel ID\u0027s. If you did Mission objectives with a Command Vessel, then separated a separate landing vessel to do the landing, MCE would not accept goal, because the Landing vessel has a different ID then the Command Vessel. This update fixes the issue, you now have a new option in Settings that allows you to turn Off and On the new Multi Vessel Landings. It comes with a price though and is the reason you can select it in settings. If you have Multi Vessel landings set to TRUE, then while you land its important not to switch to a new vessel that is already landed. If you do, you will get an instant Mission Objective complete. If you don\u0027t plan on doing Multi Vessel landings keep setting set to False.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fixed an issue with the Repair Goal not working.
