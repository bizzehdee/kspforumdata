I have a bunch of mods installed, and I might post screenshots if anyone wants to see them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the reason I have as to why the kerbals are trapped in the Jool system is that they built a ship, some sort of colony ship bound for the mun, and it broke the time-space continuum, creating a wormhole that transported it into the Jool system. The only thing I\u0027ll be starting with is said colony ship, and I\u0027ll try to see if I can find a way to keep myself from running out of parts to build rockets after the initial reserves on the colony ship run out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit) Here\u0027s a picture of the colony ship!
