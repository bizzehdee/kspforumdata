It\u0027s obvious to undo step 4 and put the internals back where they started from, but then the InternalCamera which looks at the IVA objects from the inside kicks in and you see double -- you see the neighbouring transparent pod both in the main camera and in the Internal camera, rotated. Doubtless, SFR\u0027s bizarre defaults are hackish attempts to fix the problem.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are multiple approaches to fixing this and they all include different kinds of suck.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMethod #1: Undo the culling mask change on the main camera.
