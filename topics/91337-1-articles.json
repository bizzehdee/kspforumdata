The fact that they all have internal cockpits and the newtonian nature of the game make them a perfect fit for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, my inability with both coding and 3D modeling have hampered any kind of progress I could have made on this mod, with the exception of two very nifty things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch and Math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, I have absolutely no ability in the 3D/programing business, but I\u0027ve been trying to get my mind over how such a vessel could be implemented in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve came to so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, the Vessel could be a single piece. It helps to save memory and is pretty easy to use. We could have the following on it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngine_module:\u003C/strong\u003E We have the main drive system. We can use the UV Map feature of engines to make glowing and actuating radiator fins as seen in Elite: Dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELanding_Gear:\u003C/strong\u003E Pretty straightforwards. Press G, landing gear extended/retracted, business as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELights:\u003C/strong\u003E Believe me or not, ships in Elite have floodlights! Retracting ones, like those from that 80\u0027s car! Yeah, how cool is that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInternals:\u003C/strong\u003E From here on it starts to get tricky. I\u0027m not sure it is possible to replicate the holographical displays from Elite in KSP. We may get away with RasterProp Monitors, but I\u0027m not sure. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERCS:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027m not quite sure on this one too, to be honest. The RCS is an amazing part of the Elite Ships that help give us the feel of realism. It would be plain wrong not to have them. The problem is: I don\u0027t know if we can use the RCS Part Module to exert rotational forces on itself. I\u0027ve never seen a KSP Capsule with integrated RCS, so... Yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case this last affirmation is true, we can always have a separate RCS part, increasing the part count of the mod to two. (Huh.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nice note I think it\u0027s worth to add: I\u0027ve been doing some math on the drive systems in Elite, and so far, it seems they are very advanced pieces of machinery, made of the finest quality Handwavium! Please, bare with me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take the good Sidywindy here as an example: It weights beautiful 14 Tons. The Metric ones. \u0027Cause really. Who uses the OTHER Tons? But I digress...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the Sidewinder weights 14 Tons. This nifty little ship can reach a top speed of 220 m/s, 320 with boost. (Yeah... this is were the hole \u0022Newtonian\u0022 thing gets kind of... Spaghetti...) Watching some youtube videos and counting how long it takes to reach said top speed, we can figure it\u0027s acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the video I watched, the Sidewinder was traveling at 233 m/s. The pilot boosted and it reached a top speed of 323 m/s in 3 seconds. That is, in 3 seconds, it accelerated 90 m/s. That is an amazing 30 meters per second per second! Which, in other words, is a 3 Gee acceleration. Quite the kick, huh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so moving on... Knowing the ship can accelerate at 3G, we deduce that, assuming the sidewinder is at it\u0027s minimum possible weight, 14 Tons, the thrusters produce hefty 420.000 Newtons. That is 420 KiloNewtons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk... Now on the the ISP. This engines are electrical. (Wait, really? Those are quite powerful for... well, moving on...) The basic Sidewinder has a 6MW powerplant. Now let\u0027s assume that all of this energy goes into the engines. We apply our values to the following formula: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnginePower = ExhaustVelocity * ThrustPower / 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk. Let\u0027s plug-in our numbers. 6.000.000 = Ev * 420000 / 2. So, our Ev = 28,5714 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E28,5 meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is an ISP of 2,9124 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is assuming the thrusters are 100% efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is... woah. Really? How do this things even fly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you see my point. Changing the MW to GW solves the problem, tough: we now have an amazing 28.571,42 m/s Exhaust Velocity, that is, an ISP of 2912,4 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all this rambling and idea-presenting, I finally come to you, good reader:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you like an Elite: Dangerous Ships Mod?
