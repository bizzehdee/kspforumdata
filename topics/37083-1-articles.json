A bit off kilter I must admit but it re-familiarized me with the game. From there I built my workhorse ship that can overshoot Minimus and completed a successful Mun landing with it. Keeping control of sideways momentum plagued me for days with that landing. Now I\u0027m deciding between a Minimus landing or doing rover/base work on the Mun. Oh well that\u0027s a short history.
