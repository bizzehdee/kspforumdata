When I start KSP 2, it loads the launcher, but after launching the game, a window appears that is black and stays that way. No logos, no sounds, no nothing. I\u0027ve attempted running it from Steam, from a steam-generated shortcut, and directly from the executable, with the same result each time. I\u0027ve also\u00A0 verified the integrity of the files. There are no mods or anything (obviously, I haven\u0027t managed to successfully run it once!) The only unusual thing about my machine is that I have an eGPU (desktop GPU in a thunderbolt3 breakout box). Still, I haven\u0027t had a problem with any other game, and I\u0027ve played quite a few.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHardware specs:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThinkpad T480\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU: Intel i7 8650u\u003Cbr\u003E\nGPU: RTX 3060 TI\u003Cbr\u003E\nRAM: 16gb DDR4-2400\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 TB SSD HD\u003Cbr\u003E\nWindows 11 Pro\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-07T00:35:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2023 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JebMeantToDoThat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
