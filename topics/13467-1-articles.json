I was going crazy trying to figure out how you got into orbit with no HUD. At the end, I saw you started to flip out of control on SECO. Then I realized you were using the mechjeb autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I suggest that next time, however, you cut away the video for like two seconds just to quickly set your translatron to Pro Grade? Most orbiting ships don\\\u0027t flip out of control when they achieve orbit. Anyway, this video was AWESOME. Great work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rascal Nag","CreatedById":9451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T18:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, glad you like it. I actually had done a test flight before this to see how mechjeb would work (this is the first time I used it, since I could not hope to get into orbit with these camera angles with no HUD), and I did consider making sure it was stable after it reached orbit, but decided against it so that the whole scene was visible at some point or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T18:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m planning on making a video utilizing the fixed camera mod.
