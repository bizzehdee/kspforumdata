This would override th tech tree, because the missions would determine which parts were available. Money could exist as a limit to the total amount you could spend for that mission, but a new revert mode would always allow you to revert back to the start of the current mission, so you\u0027d never bankrupt yourself into a dead-end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flintlockmusket","CreatedById":144820,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T02:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222388623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022106885\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454317281\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002255075\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Luis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I definitely think that the game mode missing from KSP is a campaign story mode.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell said Luis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI myself have not had fun using career mode as presented in the stock game. \u00A0Instead I use a custom made tech tree, and make up a set of missions to discover something or other in the system. \u00A0I don\u0027t use the contract system built in the game, as I don\u0027t feel the contracts really match what I trying to do. \u00A0By the way, I play in sandbox, with limits set by me, plus use a mod to give some chance of random failure. \u00A0Works out good, cause I get to plan everything out, then they to execute, with failure being a real option. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho said fun came in a box. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exploro","CreatedById":150492,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T04:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif it weren\u0027t for career mode I wouldn\u0027t have found use for planes.
