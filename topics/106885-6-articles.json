I agree that it could still use more work in terms of balancing and contracts, but I think the system is solid nonetheless.

In my current save, I am role playing a series of missions that has the Kerbals gradually learning about a threat from beyond Kerbin, centred on the easter eggs. Each mission gives them a specific task (eg send rovers to photograph each of the Munoliths) and I write them up in a notepad file to build an ongoing narrative. At the successful completion of each mission I award myself one or two new pieces of technology. These are always key pieces, like engines or fuel tanks. I assume that the little things like girders and adaptors are always available. Certain tech advances require some extra havesting - the uranium for the LV-N can only be mined from the Mun, for example.\n\nI\u0027d dearly love it if KSP added a framework for campaign mode that allowed the community to write linear sequences of missions with their own briefing text, completion requirements and rewards. This would override th tech tree, because the missions would determine which parts were available. Money could exist as a limit to the total amount you could spend for that mission, but a new revert mode would always allow you to revert back to the start of the current mission, so you\u0027d never bankrupt yourself into a dead-end."},{"CreatedByName":"flintlockmusket","CreatedById":144820,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T02:40:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, Luis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022I definitely think that the game mode missing from KSP is a campaign story mode.\u0022\n\u003E \n\nWell said Luis. \n\nI myself have not had fun using career mode as presented in the stock game.
