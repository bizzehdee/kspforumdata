First, I would suggest putting some standard SAS modules on all stages to assist in countering the rotation. Second, I would put a small RCS tank and some RCS thrusters on the lower portions of each stage to keep things stable on the way up and as parts begin to separate. Compliment these with some more RCS thrusters on your landing module to keep things nice and strait. This is almost standard on all of my larger rockets, just because they get topheavy and start to tip over as the huge lower fuel tanks run dry. I\u0027m sure a more seasoned Kerbonaut can lend you some better tips, but these are just things I noticed right off the bat. Hope it helps a little!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0jam3290","CreatedById":37975,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T01:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMay I suggest rcs to eliminate the spin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Dangit, I got ninjad\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-10T03:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2012 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by 0jam3290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T03:43:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post better screenshots?
