This is an agency that composes of the entire naval space arm, and is dedicated to protecting Kerbin and her colonies.

I mean a single gun that is acclerated through and electro-magnetic field, and strikes its target at nearly 2.1 times the speed of light, which is enough to puncture through any type of armor. The \u0022Interpid\u0022 is an starship, and has a range of 20 light-years, and a top speed of 90% light speed (But, topped with Abcluberrie Drive capabilites, it can go up to 11.5 times the speed of light.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Interpid\u0022 has four engines, powered by the most advanced type of nuclear fusion, and has armor of very high strength.

Hell, at 2.1x, I wouldn\u0027t doubt that it would create another big bang. *Sigh* I don\u0027t like to mess with FTL conversations... It\u0027s too insane.
