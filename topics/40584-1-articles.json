Being the first human explorers on another world have put them into the history books forever. But, they were only allowed to be extraterrestrial explorers for 2 hours, 31 minutes and 40 seconds. Imagine training for so long, travelling so far, just to spend such little time where you wanted to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt have spent more time on the Moon than anybody else-22 hours, 3 minutes and 57 seconds on EVA, spread across three Moonwalks, each lasting over 7 hours. These two men weren\u0027t camping like Neil and Buzz-setting up, a brief walk, a nap, then back home again. They had a house-in which they lived for 3 days-a job, a \u003Cstrong\u003Ecar\u003C/strong\u003E, even their suits where better and more flexible. But nobody knows who they are.
