It\u0027s pretty mod-heavy so I don\u0027t expect many people to be able to use it... but if you can I would really appreciate finding out if my inability to land it safely is just my incompetence or an actual design flaw . Mods are B9, ALCOR (and the IVA mod on which it relies), KW, Klockheed Martian Shuttle Engines, Procedural Wings, Realchutes, VNG EVA Chutes, Infernal Robotics, KAS, and FusTek station parts (the original not the expansion). It was designed with FAR, so if by some miracle you have all the aforementioned mods but not FAR don\u0027t be surprised if you can\u0027t get it off the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can get it into orbit (it does need to be mothered a bit; hence the auto-staging), but try as I might I cannot land the damn thing.

The wingspan is simply too long to be realistic and greatly affect performance. Download PWings and design a custom wing. If you don\u0027t wanna do that, then get rid of the outermost wing section. You don\u0027t need that much lift for such a small shuttle, especially at the approach speeds that you will be reaching. Your SRBs are too large for such a small shuttle. It\u0027s inefficient, but if it works then there\u0027s not much to complain about lol. Also, build your lift systems in the VAB and launch from the launchpad. The symmetry thing is much more important than you think.
