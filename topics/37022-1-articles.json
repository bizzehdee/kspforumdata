Most of them are not very good are they?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that the crafts bundled with the game should be excellent examples.

Seems very extravagant for a stock orbiter. What is with the Radial Engine Nacels Bodies. Using tail fins as structural mounts seems out of place too. Then there is the six legs... on an orbiter. I would think a stock orbiter would be something simple and sensible, but with all the trimmings.

The RCS is all over the place, and there is way too much monopropellant. Tanks and engines on an angle like that is silly. Has four legs - at least it has that right. I also notice that it has a docking port and no chutes, so it is intended to be used with an orbiter. I\u0027m thinking that for a simple example lander, have a decoupler and chute(s) so that it can be used by itself as an orbiter as well. Why is it called a Super-Heavy Lander?

Neat simple approach for a two stage lander. Seats two, has four legs. Good so far. For a more advanced lander like this, it does make sense to use a docking port, so as to be used with a separate orbiter.

Did anyone actually test this? It is not even stable. The CoM and CoL are basically on top of each other. It flips out. The engine at the far aft is also a tail strike hazard.

It flops around and could really use some struts. Just two of them would make a big difference. It cannot lift off the runway before the end. This is because the landing gear arrangement puts it nose down, so you get a downward force. The turbojets seem to indicate it is for high altitude and speed, but does not have the intakes for it. Why the RCS too, it\u0027s pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the winglets are over the cockpit ladder, hence the yellow Telus ladder places to the aft, which does not let you get back to the cockpit!

However, you can barely control this craft. The control inputs give you odd results. Rudder causes it to roll and ailerons do nothing. I did check the SPH part listing to be sure, and yes there *are* struts available. I used them, as well as move the Small Control Surfaces to the wingtips, and hey presto it actually flies reasonable well. So why is it not like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7428/9284658836_8b21f1d031.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229284658836_8b21f1d031.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAeris 3a\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally a good aircraft. Damn good - something people new to the game could actually learn to fly with. It\u0027s stable, responsive, has good control authority on all axis. Does not flip. No tail strike hazard. Only issue is the ladder, it\u0027s the same problem as the Ravenspear Mk3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5441/9281886371_f877722049.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229281886371_f877722049.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAeris 4a\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I saved the worst to last. Actually Ravenspear Mk1 is probably the worst, but if any craft here should be an exemplary of good design it should be the SSTO Spaceplane. For starters, the CoL is in front of the CoM. This is unforgivable. This is why many people lose control of it shortly after takeoff, occasionally with the LV-T30 still attached. Which brings me to the next issue. The engine is a tail strike hazard. Why not just use an aerospike? If you somehow do get it to orbit, you will surely lose control of it after re-entry unless you know what you are doing, and are really careful. New players toying around with stock crafts are neither of these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo jets and one rocket engine is also the worst setup. Since you have to switch from jets to rockets without much of a transition unlike a three jet setup. You also have to deal with flat spins, unlike a one jet setup. For a craft of this size, one jet with a couple of LV-909s would be a more effective and safer configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the fuel is fed inward as well, so there is nothing left for the jets to run on post-orbit unless you manually feed some back into the side tanks. Finally, the RCS is unbalanced as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/9281894397_943552df9a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229281894397_943552df9a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gompasta","CreatedById":560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T13:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all of the planes are old, and so they are not really compatible with current physics.
