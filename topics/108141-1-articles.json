The Pup and the camel were largely similar, except the Camel had two machine guns, while the Pup was armed with only one. The Camels\u0027s engine would range anywhere from 100HP to 150HP, depending on the type, while the Pup featured an 80HP Le Rhone engine. The Pup helped turn the tide of the air war in favor of the Allies, and gave British pilots a valuable edge over Germany\u0027s Albatross and Fokker Eindecker fighters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MhiwMRx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MhiwMRx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Pup is powered by two OMS engines at 86% maximum thrust, and seats a single Kerbal in its cockpit.
