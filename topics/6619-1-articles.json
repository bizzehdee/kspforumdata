Then i turn my craft to point at the green circle with a small cross on the navball and fire my engines to make the orbit significantly smaller, if you keep doing that you\\\u0027ll just have to wait to smack into the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really suck at landing though, this may derive from my stock part purism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-13T14:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-13T15:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy your time playing KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Joey73101\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevinlacht","CreatedById":14955,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-23T10:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome and have a Happy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKevin\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
