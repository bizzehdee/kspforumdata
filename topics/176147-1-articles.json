Naturally I installed a bunch of the latest versions of the mods I used to know and love (KW Rocketry, etc). I see that the physics especially with large space stations is still just as sketchy as it used to be, still thrashing a single CPU core when there are 12 available and still not using GPU compute resources (as far as I can tell). The good old infinite energy creation mechanism whereby a completely stationary construction will slowly oscillate more and more aggressively until it spontaneously self destructs in a huge explosion still exists too I see \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, this isn\u0027t a bashing session, I love KSP! This was more a related but simple question, is there a mod or struct these days that behaves rigidly like a \u0022real world\u0022 piece of metal would, i.e. it doesn\u0027t flex and bend like jelly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTa \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-24T12:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t even need a mod. Look into Autostruts.

Too many and your ship will shake itself apart trying to stay perfectly in line with all the struts telling it what to do, as quickly or quicker than no struts would. But in moderation they can hold the spindliest of ships together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd FWIW real metal bends under massive pressures.
