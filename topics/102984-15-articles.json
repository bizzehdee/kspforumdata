It was an assault on an ancient looking sun god sitting at the top humming so loudly the air shook."},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-04T15:33:52Z","Content":"Last night I dreamt I was late for class because I had been building a powerful laser gun."},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-15T20:42:31Z","Content":"Instead of the gauntlet, Thanos had the Lost Ark and used it to unleash hell onto Earth, boil the oceans and replace them with oil.
