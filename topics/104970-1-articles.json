With such a facility in place the revert option can now be deleted (or at least hidden) so it urges you to test your lander, rover or whatever first. This would make the whole thing quite a bit more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think this is a nice idea also or have any supplements please post a reply! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
