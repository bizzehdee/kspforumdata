Or at least, the argument is being diluted into different categories. The most important aspect is not the overall speed of your ISP that\u0027s at stake. The problem is certain online services paying money to have a faster speeds while all others have slow service.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe huge existing companies (online shops, payment services, streaming services, search engines, etc) will pay this premium and thus their services (websites, streaming, whatever) will be much more attractive to customers than services offered by smaller competing companies or startups which cannot pay this premium. Cue monopolies. And everybody knows how well monopolies work in a capitalistic environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s effectively a way for the current big internet companies to prevent new competitors from entering their market. Who cares if Upstart_Company_A\u0027s online video streaming service is a million times better than existing services (for whatever metrics you wish to use) if nobody can access it at reasonable speed? Would you switch to a service which needs to buffer all the time? Or use an online shop where the site takes ages (relatively) to load if the incumbent\u0027s page loads instantly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, it is a huge threat to the future diversity of the internet and the services which will be offered on it.
