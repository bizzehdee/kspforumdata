For the record, i had this issue back in 0.90, but it was mod-related, while this is a relatively clean install.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only mod i used was FMRS, but the plugin was deactivated for the entire session where the issue occurred, so i doubt it was the cause.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe save was made only a few days ago, and nothing i can think of has changed that might have caused this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically what it says on the tin. I started 4(3 sets of 2, and 1 set of four)\u00A0tourist contracts for visits to LKO, and launched several two-kerbal ships, however after landing them all, and heading to the tracking station to recover, i noticed that the contracts had disappeared. The contracts where definitely there when i started.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI loaded the quick-save i made before de-orbiting any of the capsules, but the problem was still present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked at the save file using a text editor, and all of the contracts are still present, but do not appear in-game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis gives me some hope that i can salvage this situation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, as i sunk a lot of funds into these missions hoping for a big payout\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy persistent file, with ships still in orbit, and contracts that exist but do not appear:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jalgsyfdhimsf12/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jalgsyfdhimsf12/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog file:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fnnv5tkfjb1uvdl/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fnnv5tkfjb1uvdl/KSP.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
