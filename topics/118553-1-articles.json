The fuel is cooler when it reaches the engines due to the path from the tank to the engines being more efficient than on the shuttle. They actually had to install heaters to heat up the fuel before letting it into the engines. The thrust will be higher (potentially up to 111%), and all the changes that come with that. It also wouldn\u0027t surprise me if the thrust profile was different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*ninja\u0027d\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the RS25 has been tested several times this year, but I there seemed to be a lot more attention given to this particular test.

Humor aside, as you have said, they have modified the design over time. Also, considering that these will be carrying humans back into space, and the fact that NASA has never reused an engine type between two vehicles, there are a lot of unknowns. For example, i would think that in order to,,certify the vehicle, i would think that it would have to,be able to,get through thefirst stage of flight under control,while one engine has failed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
