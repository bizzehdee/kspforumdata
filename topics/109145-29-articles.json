Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s amazingly cool and an awesome model! It\u0027s just... kind of filling a niche that exists on Earth, but not so much on Kerbin.\n\nMinimum engagement speed of Mach 4 is a whole Mach number higher than the max efficiency point of the best Ramjet engines available.\n\nNominal peak efficiency at Mach 15 is absurd. Mach 15 is well beyond escape velocity! Actually I think it\u0027s close to enough to coast all the way to Jool! If you could even keep it in atmosphere long enough to gain that much velocity, which I doubt you could.\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E velocity is somewhere closer to Mach 6 - 7, when this thing is still just edging past half-power. The only use I could see for it having a nominal ideal speed of Mach 15, would be to do a hyperbolic gravity assist with jet-powered Oberth effect around Kerbin or Laythe, but... yeah. That\u0027s not gonna be very common, if it\u0027s not just so fast that the game splats you as soon as you touch atmosphere from extreme overheat.\n\nIn many test runs, I couldn\u0027t even get up to a speed when the SCRamjet had enough power to take over, using six RAMJets and two Nukes. The RAMJets could get me up to about Mach 4.2, and then were just not powerful enough, which was just barely enough to get the SCRam to turn on, but not enough to give it any appreciable power at all, and the two Nukes weren\u0027t enough to get me there either.\n\nTo be intuitively useful, to my mind (and these are the kinds of designs real SCRamjets are being developed for), you need to be able to do a smooth hand-off from Ramjets or Turbojets to the SCRamjet, without needing a rocket in between. That means having a significant overlap of useful velocities, during which the two power curves effectively \u0022cross-fade\u0022 to maintain a reasonably flat net power curve. If I -do- need a rocket to bridge the gap, then that means four types of engines (or at least three, if you\u0027re just using it for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff and satellite delivery).\n\nIf I\u0027m gonna have to have three types of engines already (RAMJets to get me up to ~12-15km and Mach 4, upper-stage sustainer rockets to get me up out of the atmosphere, then high-efficiency vacuum engines to do anything useful in space)... I just don\u0027t see the very narrow speed and altitude range at which the SCRamjet is actually helpful being worth its weight and drag.\n\nBecause of the smaller scale of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, even though it\u0027s not technically \u0022realistic\u0022 to do so, I\u0027d tone it down to turn on at Mach 2.5, hit at least 50% power by Mach 3.5, and peak around Mach 6 with a dropoff back down to 50% or so by Mach 8. I could see it being a useful (but still not life-changing) engine with those stats, but as it is, it\u0027s just not worth its weight in fuel from what I can see.

I do -not- want to have to use rockets to transition from one jet engine to the next, nor do I want to have to dive 10 km to build up enough speed. From a meta perspective, if NASA were designing this, and they had a several-Mach gap between their launch engine and the SCRamjet, during which the ship has 10% of the thrust it has in the full power curves of each type of engine... they\u0027d call it not-viable and keep designing one or the other, or both.\n\nAlternatively, you could make one of the other Mk2 form factor engines much more powerful at higher speeds. Actually they seem pretty underpowered in general, IMO, compared to the stock engines, unless I\u0027m missing something?\n\nFor example, for Max Thrust...\n\n1x Afterburn = 190\n\n1x Whiplash = 130  Seems okay except that I can easily get 2x Whiplashes in the same space as the 1x Afterburn. With a little planning, and your wonderful, wonderful 3-way splitter, I can even get 3 on basically the same fuselage setup.\n\n2x Whiplash = 260\n\n3x Whiplash = 390\n\nSo... why should I ever use the Afterburn? I do notice it drops off slightly less quickly at high speed... but sacrificing a third to half of the power available to -get- to the point where the shape of the power curve starts to matter makes the Afterburn a tough sell. Since I\u0027m basically building at least a triple fuselage to get both types of engines on the ship in a symmetrical fashion, it\u0027s going to be a pretty heavy ship. My designs so far come in at about 60-70 tons, not including payload capacity, which I\u0027d like to see at least 5 tons of on a Mk II, whether for science gear, or satellite delivery.\n\nThe problem with a more patient climb is that these engines are still pretty fuel-hungry. Not as much as rockets, but they still guzzle it down, so the longer I take climbing up toward thin atmosphere, the more fuel I burn, the more fuel I have to bring with me, and the heavier the ship gets, which means more engines, which starts the cycle over again.\n\nUltimately the limiting case is the runway. I need enough power to get the ship up to anywhere from 90 to 120 m/s before I run out of runway, depending on how much wing I use (keeping in mind that more wing for lower liftoff speed means more drag later on). I can do that easily with multiple Whiplashes carrying along a Hyperblast\u0027s dead weight. It\u0027s... pretty dicey with the Afterburn.\n\nBut... like I said, maybe I\u0027m missing something. Hopefully the tutorial will explain it.\n\nI do have the feeling that when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E updates for 1.2, these engines will suddenly come into their own, as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s drag model is much more accurate, and winds up being significantly lower at all altitudes than Stock, though I acknowledge that Stock is much much better than it used to be."},{"CreatedByName":"Rushligh","CreatedById":31038,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T09:17:28Z","Content":"I have been waiting for that Front-Opening cargo bay for the longest time; you have no idea. this makes using the MK2 hulls as an aeroshell/fairing perfect!\n\nMore so on the side of an aeroshell, it makes for a deploy-able housing for retrojets!  \n\n(or weaponry if you\u0027re a BDA user)  \n\n![RaS6ksxm.png](http://i.imgur.com/RaS6ksxm.png)![a6mW8hum.png](http://i.imgur.com/a6mW8hum.png)![5NqgovVm.png](http://i.imgur.com/5NqgovVm.png)\n\nalso, [@FirroSeranel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144343-firroseranel/) is right about the mach15 speeds, that is in fact far faster than any shuttle has entered the atmosphere; reason being that nothing can stand that much heat going either way.  \n\nalso, it\u0027d be nice of the Banshee engine could be electric, or mode toggeling. it would also be realistic; (sort of)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T13:18:28Z","Content":"ok this is maybe a question for KSP in general but what are all the numbers on the reactor telling me?\n\nI assume the \u0022thermal efficiency: 81.4%\u0022 is telling me I am a bit hot so the reactor is not as efficient, and thus \u0022: 81.38% load\u0022 will be pegged at this value and never give us full power?\n\nbut then there is another number,  \u0022Cooling: 99.67%\u0022...

Regarding Mk2 engines, they are actually pretty much in line with or slightly better stock engines (except for the MATTOCK, which is the \u0022 much more powerful at higher speeds\u0022 Mk2 engine). The M2X engines in general produce ~150% thrust for 140-150% mass compared to their stock counterparts; Choosing engines for a craft is always a sliding scale of \u0022How much thrust do I need?\u0022 and \u0022How much mass budget can I spend on engines?\u0022, and the M2X engines were intended to be a mid-range option. Per your example, 2 Whiplashes produce 260 static thrust vs an Afterburn\u0027s 190, but you pay for that extra ~50% thrust with ~55% increase in mass cost (3.6 tons for 2X Whiplash vs 2.6 tons for the Afterburn), plus the added mass cost of the bicoupler. If a craft doesn\u0027t need that much power for that much mass, then mk2\u0027s or if a small craft single size 1s can provide what is needed, and if that much power is needed, then it is still available as an option.

In this case, the reactor is generating the maximum it currently can - 81.4%.

Without having KSP open, I was looking at the thrust on the jets compared to stock. The rapier stock is around 400, while some of your engines were around 2,000 and unlocked earlier. I think I am missing something. I am an English professor, not a scientist lol. I think I need to play around with them more to understand what is going on. \n\nAlso, if the \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

Let\u0027s take a look at it:  \n![JZOP5To.png](http://i.imgur.com/JZOP5To.png)\n\n2.6 tons, static thrust of 110kN, max thrust at mach 10, Isp of 2000. As mentioned in the description, this engine will not function below mach 4. This sets the Scramjet apart from other jet engines. In KSP, using jets is a matter of grabbing a fuel tank, adding an air intake somewhere, and bolting a jet nozzle to the end. The Scramjet, from a craft construction perspective, is no different, but from a use perspective requires an extra step unique to it: bringing the craft the Scramjet is on up to a prerequisite speed. In this it is more like an aerospike or a Nerva than a jet; a secondary engine engaged after the jets are done to finish accelerating a craft to orbital speeds\n\nBringing a Scramjet craft up to speed is probably the most difficult part of using a Scramjet; it requires patience, precision, and good craft design. This tutorial aims to facilitate that.\n\nTo demonstrate the optimum flight profile for a Scramjet craft, we could use the M2X Hyperblast example ship:\n\n![q9pkIwC.png](http://i.imgur.com/q9pkIwC.png)\n\nHowever, like most example craft, it primarily exists to serve as a technology demonstrator - the Hyperblast example ship is functional, and showcases how one could build a Scramjet vessel, but taking a closer look \u2013 No docking ports, solar panels, passenger capacity, or cargo space, and a heat shield nosecone that in 1.2 is going to generate a substantial amount of drag \u2013 this vessel isn\u0027t very useful from a gameplay perspective, so lets build something that is:\n\n![xJA7dh4.gif](http://i.imgur.com/xJA7dh4.gif)\n\nHere is a simple crew shuttle I threw together in 5 minutes or so. SR-71 derivative design, delta wing, 2 ramjets in nacelles, central scramjet. Scramjet has it\u0027s own intake so the the only intakes needed are the shock cones and precoolers for the Ramjets. The only changes from default part settings was draining the Oxidizer out of the hypersonic nosecone, setting the service tank to its monoprop variant, and setting activation toggles for the control surfaces, disabling yaw on the elevons and disabling pitch/roll on the rudders. The 2 \u201CPuff\u201D OMS engines have been added to action group 1 to toggle them on/off. 44 parts, 34.250 tons, seats 8.\n\n![RARG2cU.png](http://i.imgur.com/RARG2cU.png)\n\nAt launch, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is turned on, OMS engines are in their own stage, and the Ramjets and Scramjet are staged together. The Scramjet will flameout, but by staging it now, it will automatically activate when the craft gets up to speed.\n\n![df8xtq3.png](http://i.imgur.com/df8xtq3.png)\n\nTakeoff is like any other takeoff. A minute into the flight I decide to gain altitude more quickly and pitch up to 40 degrees for a swift ascent.\n\n![f7JRqSR.png](http://i.imgur.com/f7JRqSR.png)\n\nDuring the climb pitch attitude is gradually decreased to maintain steady speed. At 12000m the craft is now high enough to begin accelerating, and a moment later the nose is brought down to 0 pitch. Because this craft needs a shallow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to maintain level flight, zero pitch results in a shallow dive.\n\n![MVFOcDo.png](http://i.imgur.com/MVFOcDo.png)\n\nOne shallow dive later the craft hits mach 2 and I gradually pitch up. This shallow ascent will be maintained until the craft hits a cruising altitude of 15000m.\n\n![ga6z9y5.png](http://i.imgur.com/ga6z9y5.png)\n\nAt 12.5 km up the craft hits mach 4 and the Scramjet ignites. Vertical speed has hit 100m/s, that will need to be reduced to prevent overshooting 15000m. At this time comes a balance of pitching up/down to maintain desired altitude and keeping \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E as close to 0 as possible to minimize drag.  \n\nThe Scramjet will produce more thrust as the craft continues to accelerate, but for that, higher altitude is desired.\n\n![WZXdP5x.png](http://i.imgur.com/WZXdP5x.png)\n\nAt 15000m the craft levels off, and for the next 100-150m/s of acceleration vertical speed will be kept as close to 0 as feasible to keep the Ramjets in this 15000m sweetspot to get as much acceleration out of them as possible.\n\n![khyhBl0.png](http://i.imgur.com/khyhBl0.png)\n\nThe craft is getting quite toasty at this point, so as soon as it hits the magic 1500m/s, the nose is pitched gradually up. Despite a ~5 degree pitch up, at this speed it is enough to give a 100m/s vertical speed. Higher altitude is desired to reduce heating, but lingering as long as possible at a lower altitude will permit getting those extra few m/s before ramjet thrust falls off.\n\n1500m/s is the magic number because at this point, the Scramjet more or less becomes self-sustaining; Any further acceleration from the Ramjets is helpful, but the Scramjet is now producing enough thrust to to sustain the speed necessary for its operation and begin accelerating the craft on its own.\n\n![yA4ZKZF.png](http://i.imgur.com/yA4ZKZF.png)\n\nAt 19000m the Scramjet is producing as much thrust as both Ramjets combined; Ramjet thrust will only continue to fall off from here to pitch is increased another few degrees to being the climb to hypercruise altitude.\n\n![iPMJSXb.png](http://i.imgur.com/iPMJSXb.png)\n\nOptimum Scramjet cruising altitude has been reached, and craft temperature is less dire than it was; If speed records or circumnavigation are desired, then pitch should be reduced during the climb to 31000m to achieve a near zero vertical speed by the time 31000m is reached, and then pitch should be reduced further to -5 to -10 degrees or so, entering a shallow dive to maintain altitude. At this speed running out of planet is a concern; the curvature of Kerbin causes the surface to fall away faster than gravity can pull the craft down toward it.\n\n![1scIn8w.png](http://i.imgur.com/1scIn8w.png)\n\nThe goal is space, so pitch is maintained and the craft continues to climb out of the atmosphere, spending only enough time to accelerate to orbital velocity before hitting 36000m; that that point the Scramjet is now too high to operate, flaming out from lack of intake air. The craft is now on a ballistic sub-orbital trajectory, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is switched to prograde to reduce \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E drag.\n\n![yL3UChK.png](http://i.imgur.com/yL3UChK.png)\n\nApoapsis is around 500 km.  At this altitude, with the speed the craft has carried with it, circularization is fairly cheap, and well within the \u003Cfont face=\u0022Times New Roman, serif\u0022\u003E\u0394\u003C/font\u003EV budget of the OMS engines. With more precise piloting, either by throttling down or decreasing the angle of the crafts ascent, apoapsis can be set to a lower altitude, likewise, prolonged acceleration while in hypercruise can raise apoapsis to a desired height for low-orbit stations, Munar intercepts, etc.\n\n![1d83QxB.png](http://i.imgur.com/1d83QxB.png)\n\nThe Puffs don\u0027t produce much thrust and are inefficient, but they are sufficient for the job at hand. Were this craft equipped with RAPIERS instead of Afterburns, circularization could be achieved with ~100 units of oxidizer.\n\n![I9o8x8O.png](http://i.imgur.com/I9o8x8O.png)\n\nOrbit. Hardly the most optimized of crafts; it\u0027s carrying far more LiquidFuel than it needs, but for something thrown together without prior testing, it served well enough. Functioning scramjets are not constrained to this particular design; any spaceplane design that can hit ~1400m/s on jets is a viable scramjet design, regardless of hull type, be it mk1, mk2, or even mk3.\n\nIt should cover at least the basics; I don\u0027t really have much experience writing tutorials, so if there are any glaring deficiencies, let me know and I\u0027ll set about correcting them.\n\n@JBrown247: I can take a look at the CTT patch - if 1.2 changed things in the tech tree I should do that anyway, but the only engine I can think of offhand that would produce that much thrust is the Mk3 TurboRamjet from Mk3 Expansion, though considering the less finished nature of M3X it\u0027s possible that it isn\u0027t where it\u0027s supposed to be.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T00:05:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**\n  \nfixing typos"},{"CreatedByName":"C04L","CreatedById":160397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T16:05:23Z","Content":"[**SuicidalInsanity**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143878-suicidalinsanity/ \u0022Go to SuicidalInsanity\u0027s profile\u0022) , I am wondering.\n\nThe *5way mk2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E block.* \n\ncould you add the option to switch the colour to stockalike white as well as the default black?\n\nMainly because when I learn your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters I never use any others and I love using them on my rockets.\n\nwould be cool if you added it to a *to do list* - not asking for right away as its just cosmetic. but if it can be done would be great for the look of my craft."},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T18:05:27Z","Content":"I remember using the Hyperblast a couple times in 1.0.5 just to see.
