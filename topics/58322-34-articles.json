Snjo said I should post them here, so....well here they are XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the bugs. Transferring ammunition into a turret that isn\u0027t in transfer mode eats it. Instead of being returned to the ammo crate, it just blinks out of existence. Also, the CWIS turret \u0022jumps\u0022 off its mounts when you try manually aiming and firing with it. I\u0027ve also encountered the jumping when I set up an anti-air test using the IFF tags and a plane. The final bug is that objects attached to the top of the tank turret or the barrel of the cannon fail to move when it does. They just hover in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is a suggestion. Your Amoured Chassis part (ArmourBase1) is great on its own, but I discovered that adding a rescaled copy (I titled it ArmourBase2) by setting \u0022RescaleFactor = 1.5\u0022 in the config creates a hull that is perfectly sized for cross-compatibility with the RBI Caterpillar tracks mod.

It could use Kethane and the currently unimplemented part cost system.\u003Cp\u003EControlling territory gives you money, money is needed for vehicle parts and ammunition. In order for a territory to be controlled, a flag pole (or other marker) has to be inside that grid space on the kethane map. If a marker from more than one faction exists in that node, it\u0027s considered contested, income is distributed evenly among all people who control a grid node if it\u0027s contested for a total amount that\u0027s below how much somebody would get for controlling it uncontested (the economy suffers in a warzone) A node with no claims in it is considered wilderness and nobody benefits from having it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombine it with the extraplanetary launchpads mod to let people set up their own KSC\u0027s off-world and this would give real motivation for off-world colonizing and make for some epic long-term conflicts on servers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s safe to say this has the potential to be the mother of all real-time strategy games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a great idea!

Territory control doesn\u0027t have to be fancy but it can open up a whole new aspect of the multiplayer game. Add in KAS, Interstellar, multiple systems, plus many of the other mods people enjoy and it becomes the space sim multiplayer game I have been thinking of since first being exposed to eve. I hope to run a large server one day using a compilation of these mods. Think of the awesome cooperative science or industry to be had, or glorious interstellar warfare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tanya Sapien","CreatedById":58405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T22:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh yeah, the tanks on the ground hearken to DUST, the ships in space are like a physics-driven EVE, but in this case the transition between the two is seamless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe shall call it: \u0022EVE lite\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roblamb98","CreatedById":75487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T12:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll this talk of space weapons when the most advanced one so far is a dummy cluster bomb lol \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Error","CreatedById":58941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T13:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParticle projectors might be neat - cause fires, do tons of damage, overheat itself and nearby parts to the point of explosion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun stuff! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
