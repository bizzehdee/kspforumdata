Is there a limit temperature where the heat absorbtion starts for each part? It is better to have a 1 sec temperature spike of (e.g.) 3400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or to cook slowly for half an hour at 3000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0? (or if you prefer, if I put my oven at 220\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 how long it will take for my aerobrakes to cook till explosion?) \n\nHas anybody got a clue about this?\n\nEDIT: Didn\u0027t notice 1.0.3 was out with maybe new questions, so feel free to ignore me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T00:06:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**\n  \n1.0.3"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T22:04:18Z","Content":"1.x uses actual honest-to-goodness kilowatts and kilojoules.

And spikes should be affordable while long term overcooking might be dangerous. \n\nWhich is the most common way to calculate the amount of the energy flux generated? \n\nIs there any \u0022public\u0022 table with the amount of kJ the parts can absorb before exploding? \n\nThe energy is continuously absorbed/dissipated or are there some triggers?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:36:32Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure what you mean by limit temperature.\n\nAll parts have a \u0022max temperature\u0022 and if they exceed that they explode.\n\nAs of 1.0.3, parts now have two temperatures to track: internal and skin. They have two max temperatures that can be set independently in the cfg (but if the skinMaxTemp is unspecified it defaults to the regular maxTemp).\n\nIf you turn on Alt-F12-\u003EPhysics-\u003EThermal-\u003EDisplay thermal data, you can see all the part stats during flight when you right-click on a part.\n\nParts are subject to certain fluxes, and they have thermal masses (how many kilojoules it takes to raise temperature one kelvin).
