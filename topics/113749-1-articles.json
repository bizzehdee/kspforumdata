Is there a limit temperature where the heat absorbtion starts for each part? It is better to have a 1 sec temperature spike of (e.g.) 3400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or to cook slowly for half an hour at 3000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0? (or if you prefer, if I put my oven at 220\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 how long it will take for my aerobrakes to cook till explosion?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody got a clue about this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Didn\u0027t notice 1.0.3 was out with maybe new questions, so feel free to ignore me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T00:06:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E1.0.3\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T22:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.x uses actual honest-to-goodness kilowatts and kilojoules.
