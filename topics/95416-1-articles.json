Microsoft already charges for code and driver signing, but code signing isn\u0027t required to distribute a program. All this for about $150, the price of a Windows license. If you include the hardware, it\u0027s $1000 total. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a PS3\u0027s cost varies wildly, from $150 to $550. Not to mention the games, which are around $30-60 each. $30\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D25 (this is the average number of games people have, as seen on forums) \u002B $400 = $1,150. I expect 360 players to have even more games, but what I\u0027m saying is that I don\u0027t understand why these dev kit costs are reasonable, when consoles are such limited pieces of hardware and revenue must be recouped by distributing \u003Cem\u003Emore and more games\u003C/em\u003E for consumers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow exactly does a lonely developer get into developing games for consoles? They have no contacts with publishers, no money to develop alone, and no experience with the inner workings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is like the MPAA all over again: \u003Cem\u003Eonly the big six are allowed to distribute to the masses. \u003C/em\u003ELiterally.
