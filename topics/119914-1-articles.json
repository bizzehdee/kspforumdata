Those moons would simply enter more eccetric orbits, if it got much closer they would enter hyperbolic orbits and be thrown from our system. That hole is traveling maybe at \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 km/sec relative to Earth, and it might be passing in a normal or anti-normal trajectory which means more than likely it would shift the inclination of the moons orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of earth, the same problem, if it is traveling at Earth at 100 km per second and Mach speed is 300 metrer per second it would not suck the atmosphere off of Earth, Instead the Earth would start to deform into a teardrop as it was serially compressed into the singularity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gas in Earths atmosphere and the heat created by the deformation would cause gas to spin around the polar ends of the hole causing it to belch x-rays and gamma rays sufficient to expel all the gas\u003Cem\u003E above and below\u003C/em\u003E the hole from the galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T18:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot terribly worried about it... we\u0027re already orbiting a supermassive black hole, and I feel fine.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T19:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was a kid, old folks used to scare kids with the Bogeyman.
