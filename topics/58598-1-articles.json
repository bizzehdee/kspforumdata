It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 2nd and morning of the 3rd. The thin crescent moon will set early in the evening leaving dark skies for what could be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: \u003Ca href=\u0022www.seasky.org\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.seasky.org\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d give everyone a heads up! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T13:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh well...

I\u0027m a deep space observer almost exclusively (mainly galaxies and nebulae), so I usually ignore meteor showers. This despite the fact that some of the greatest observing experiences in my 20 years of sky observing have had to do with meteors (the 2001 Leonid meteor storm with like 1500 meteors/hour, and a super bright bollide I saw in 2011 that created sonic booms that arrived a few minutes later). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as far as regular meteor showers go, they are pretty boring to me. Starting at 0100 and on, I see a ton of sporadic meteors anyway, just glancing at the sky between glimpses through the eyepiece. Maybe I\u0027ll see a few Quadranids as I HOPE to take my telescope out Friday night/Saturday morning for the first serious observing session I\u0027ve had since November 2012! My scope takes around 45-60 mins to get fully set up, and apart from public outreach, I only use it from really dark sky sites that are a few hours drive away. So I observe all night to make the most of the 7-8 hours of driving and 3 hours of packing/set-up/tear-down/unpacking time... so I need a confluence of very clear skies, time off from work, and a new Moon to go observing, and I\u0027ve been supremely unlucky in the last year. For example, last month, I had a chance to go observing, but I was sick for the first time in a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if I DO get to observe on Friday night/Saturday morning, I\u0027ll see if I can trace any sporadic meteors I spot back to their radiant and see if they are possibly Quadranids. Maybe I\u0027ll report back here and let you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-02T19:11:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2014 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sickle","CreatedById":76853,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T21:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T22:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn it.
