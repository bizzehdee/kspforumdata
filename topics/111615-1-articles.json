Prototyped in about an hour.\n\nThe airbrakes at the front are only for show, but can function to slow the craft slightly. With SAS on, she flies like a dream, stable as a rock. With SAS off, she tends to nose down, but is still flyable. She isn\u0027t fast or maneuverable, but she\u0027s still fun to fly.\n\nAnd to answer the question I always had as a kid, \u0022How do they land with a wing on the bottom of the plane?\u0022; the answer is: very, very carefully.\n\nPut some more work into the SW-190, and for now, I am calling it complete. Later on, I might do a few cosmetic tweaks here and there, if I feel the urge.\n\nFinal form:\n\n![vGuaKp6.png](http://i.imgur.com/vGuaKp6.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T20:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nipulsansei**\n  \nUpdate"},{"CreatedByName":"volapong","CreatedById":114281,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T12:21:02Z","Content":"Nice!
