The picture below is just an idea of what it could look like.

Also the yellow targeted craft is sometimes hard to spot from a distance. The Radar could also show other crafts in orbit around the Planet or Mun. This feature may not better the game much but make it look a little more technical on the view screen giving more information of distant objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
