However, I\u0027m unsure of the exponent modifier system can set exact numbers like that. I also do not think TweakScale can modify strings in that way. I would probably look into grabbing the source for one of the fuel switchers and trying to rewrite the code to handle crew capacities instead of fuel.\n\nScale drives the other properties, so I guess if the scale does not change the dll will think that there is nothing to do. I also agree about the strings, there probably are hardcoded assumptions in a few places that the scaled values are numbers.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there any way to scale kerbal heads?\n\nNot supported out of the box, because Kerbal heads are not configured as parts.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a config for the stock antennas?\n\nTo scale the model, just copy an MM patch from the config files and fill in the antenna\u0027s name.

So it sounds like we either need to scale some drag property of the part, or trigger a recalculation of its drag model. Is anyone familiar with this new drag mechanic?\n\nThe drag mechanics are a bit hard to work around/with/change. When the part is -first- loaded (like..the very first time ever) the game engine will calculate the drag-cubes based upon the part geometry and planar projections. It then stores all of this information in the PartDatabase.cfg file (in the root KSP directory, next to the main game config file).\n\nNow, even if the model for that part changes (through recompiling the model, changing geometry, whatever); that initial drag-cube calculation will be used and -never- updated or re-calculated, unless/until the user deletes either the entire PartDatabase.cfg file or the entries for the relevant part(s).\n\nIn the case of in-game-scaling, I would wager that the initial non-scaled drag-cube will always be loaded (if the part were rescaled manually in the part.cfg file prior to the PartDatabase entry being created, it would have the correctly rescaled drag cube). I have not dug into the source to confirm this (just starting work on drag cube stuff for my plugins), but I would highly doubt that the stock Part recalculates the drag-cube when it detects it has been rescaled; however, I did notice some drag-cube scaling code related to stock animations (it was actually interpolating between two drag cubes for the start and end state of animations), so there -might- be a chance that you can rescale the drag cubes on a per-active-part basis.\n\nDrag cubes, their bugs, and the static nature of the PartDatabase file have been nothing but headaches in my mod development....why would it be any different here?"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:43:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wonder if anyone else is experiencing this... I\u0027ve got a set of wheels (the KF wheels, in which I implemented the original TweakScale options for, which worked fine with the same scale type setup a while back) and at least from the launch of 1.0.2 of kSP and onward I am getting not only no option to scale them, but the place where the scale would be is replaced by a blank entry. What I mean is the context menu has a blank spot in it where I believe it is trying to render the scale slider and failing. In addition to this, the log is spammed with: \u0022ItemPrefab for control type \u0027UI\\_ChooseOption\u0027 not found.\u0022 Now I did some digging of my own and \u0027UI\\_ChooseOption\u0027 is a KSPAPIExtensions thing which, when browsing that DLL, in the version specified by the references for TweakScale\u0027s DLL, the item does in fact exist. What\u0027s even more irritating is that the same scale type options for another part type (the KF repulsors) works perfectly fine. I\u0027m about ready to pull my hair out trying to fix this. Has some form of game-changing modification been done to how the scale type has to be defined in order for this mod to continue working as it has in the past?\n\nThe repulsors (as in the KerbalStuff download) are different, they have freeScale=true so they use the continuous tweakable.
