Something fun and with a business excuse, \u0022prospect more ore-rich places\u0022. I sought some rover projects, but they were slow, prone to tip over, and not much fun all around. And with Minmus gravity, they make little sense. The idea struck: let\u0027s make a lightweight craft for traveling the moon. Something small, lean and mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a long while I looked at the set of parts for something lean and mean, until I spotted the Aerobrakes. These would make cool sides. OKTO2 for the core component, two infamous XM-G50 Radial Air Intakes for a landing gear (80m/s crash tolerance), then all the goodies and essentials. Two Oscar fuel tanks and Spark to give it some good kick, RCS through a bunch of \u0022place-anywhere\u0022 ports (plus a small monopropellant tank), a docking port, a headlight, two solar batteries tucked under the \u0022wings\u0022, and finally a Surface Scanning Module so that it could be used for actual prospecting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen tests began. Good 150m/s groundspeed on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeeder boat. Hardly, only 26m/s, but still waterborne just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qkl89bm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qkl89bm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime for docking tests. Need to take one and a docking port into orbit... One? Why not three? Tricoupler for the win!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst round proved that RCS thrusters can\u0027t be placed squat in the middle of the docking port. Time for second round with necessary corrections...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q1cUCQL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Q1cUCQL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got the idea... would my Engineer be able to return to Kerbin in that thingy? It has more than enough dV for escaping Minmus and probably can escape at an angle good enough to catch the edge of Kerbin atmosphere; several orbits of aerobraking will bring it into LKO. But what about reentry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s when the idea was born. Dockable heatshields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eaa5swS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eaa5swS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us not mention the fate of the third crew member, who drew the short straw and tried the small heat shield. Still, two with the big ones..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first of the two survived - barely. He ran out of battery before entering the atmosphere, so no reaction wheel to keep the shield and braking... Did I mention the whole thing was built around two big aerobrakes? Well, they work, but they need stabilizing. First using RCS, then as propellant ran out, switching the main engine from time to time, using its swivel for stabilization. (it still couldn\u0027t overcome the strength of aerobraking.) I was a little too excited to take screenshots; this one is when I knew he was safe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hSTwtfY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hSTwtfY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, now for a very good entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let\u0027s not run out of the batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YJtYmXS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YJtYmXS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for the trajectory is to start the aerobrakes after periapsis located some 55000km above Kerbin. That way we have a plenty of time to lose the horizontal speed while still rising instead of dropping down into thick atmosphere at full orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the only hitch of the plan: forgot to switch SAS and the headlight off, so the batteries were almost drained near the periapsis again. And since the Sun was directly \u0022prograde\u0022, I had to swing a little to give the panels light under the aerobrakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PS0oBrO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PS0oBrO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and this resulted in some small burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UNVtqiP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UNVtqiP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to leave the panels extended for as long as they would last... they lasted quite a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit rose back into sixties and aerobraking became quite weak. Time to burn off all that remaining fuel. First, that is some more delta-V than from aerobraking there, and then, less mass to slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ihfsmwd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ihfsmwd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the burn, 59km and 1900m/s. That\u0027s not an orbital speed anymore. Well, at that point any other craft begins falling increasingly fast, to reach some 30km altitude with speed in excess of 2000m/s and go into flames. Not us. Aerobrakes deployed, prograde direction set in SAS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2piCCBB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222piCCBB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E42km. At this altitude most crafts start showing flames. But 1700m/s is not enough at this air density. It would be at 30km, but we\u0027re still far from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0daeZ4S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220daeZ4S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24km. This is usually the area where the craft slows below 1000m/s and the flames go out. And I didn\u0027t even lose the solar panels! 400m/s before the final descent!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qvfPuNw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qvfPuNw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo THIS is when I lose the solar panels?
