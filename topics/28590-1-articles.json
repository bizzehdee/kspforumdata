And that was with the base component resting on the thruster that go it to the Mun safely, and not the landing legs. The docking ports of the forklift and those of the component\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t really match up well. What is really needed is a way to lower or raise the forklift by a few feet in increments, instead of \u0022legs down\u0022 and \u0022legs up\u0022 heights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how to take vids, nor how to share the file.
