But when they\u0027re not equal, the ln(Rwd) comes onto play. \n\n Any rocket is engine, fuel, tanks to hold the fuel, and payload. Everything except the fuel is the dry mass, while all of it together is the wet mass.\n\n In the case of the LV-N vs. the LV-909, the 2 1/2 tonnes that is engine in the LV-N can be 2 1/2 tonnes of fuel and tankage for the LV-909. So if the payload is relatively small, the LV-909 can actually produce *more* DV for the same mass than the LV-N despite it\u0027s lower specific impulse.\n\n This also holds true for small DV budgets (such as circularizing in LKO).

I do this by computing the total ship mass required to yield a desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for a specified payload mass. The \u0022ship\u0022 is considered as one engine \u002B fuel \u002B fuel tanks to hold it \u002B payload.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- **Only one LV-909 or one LV-N, so no restriction on TWR**. Both engines now have a thrust of 60 kN, which is not much for an interplanetary ship, so TWR considerations will be important; see my [next post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119135-LV-N-Delta-V-Is-this-right?p=1903722\u0026viewfull=1#post1903722) for an updated calculation.\n- **Single-stage ship**. As we all know, dropping mass on the way yields higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv values, but I\u0027m keeping it simple here.\n- **Propellant quantity is treated as a continuous value**, so tanks are considered infinitely divisible. While this is not realistic, one could approximate this in practice by using a large numbers of small tanks (at least for LFO tanks; for LF only there are fewer options).\n- For the LV-909 I\u0027m assuming a **fuel-to-empty tank mass ratio** (my \u0022alpha\u0022) of **8** (i.e., 8 tonnes of fuel per tonne of empy tank mass), corresponding to most LFO tanks. For the LV-N fuel-only tanks, I\u0027m using a value of **6**, the value for the Mk 2 tanks. The Mk 3 tanks have a better ratio of 8.3, even better than LFO tanks, so choosing this value would only make the case better for the LV-N.\n- \u0022Payload\u0022 is defined as everything that is *not* the engine, fuel or tanks, so it includes stuff like structural elements as well as the proper payload.\n- Engine stats used: LV-909: Isp=345 s, mass=0.5 t; LV-N: Isp=800 s, mass=3.0 t (vacuum Isp used)\n\n---\n\n**Results**\n\nWith a bit of algebra, we find that for a given desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and using the parameters of these two engines, the total ship mass for a desired payload mass is given by:\n\n![I_{\\text{sp}}g_0)-1}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_%7B%5Ctext%7Btotal%7D%7D\u0026space;=\u0026space;%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha(m_%7B%5Ctext%7Bpayload%7D%7D\u0026plus;m_%7B%5Ctext%7Bengine%7D%7D)%7D%7B(%5Calpha\u0026plus;1)%5Cexp(-%5CDelta\u0026space;v/I_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsp%7D%7Dg_0)-1%7D)\n\nwhere\n\n![gif.latex?\\alpha\u0026space;\\equiv\u0026space;\\frac{m_{\\text{fuel}}}{m_{\\text{tank}}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha\u0026space;%5Cequiv\u0026space;%5Cfrac%7Bm_%7B%5Ctext%7Bfuel%7D%7D%7D%7Bm_%7B%5Ctext%7Btank%7D%7D%7D)\n\nis the fuel-to-empty tank mass ratio, which states how many tonnes of fuel you get for each tonne of dry tank mass (the more, the better).\n\nBefore we get to the graphs, let me take a detour to mention an important point: the fact that we\u0027re considering the mass of the fuel tanks in the calculation basically imposes a maximum achievable \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for any engine, which depends on its Isp and the value of \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 of the tanks:\n\n![gif.latex?\\Delta\u0026space;v_{\\text{max}}\u0026space;=\u0026space;I_{\\text{sp}}\u0026space;g_0\u0026space;\\ln(1\u0026plus;\\alpha)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta\u0026space;v_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D\u0026space;=\u0026space;I_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsp%7D%7D\u0026space;g_0\u0026space;%5Cln(1\u0026plus;%5Calpha))\n\nFor the LV-909 and assuming \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1=8, this turns out to be \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACvmax = 7,444 m/s, which means that for anything close to or beyond this value, *a single-stage ship using an LV-909 is impossible*. For the LV-N and assuming \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1=6, the limiting value is \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACvmax = 15,287 m/s.\n\nNow to the graphs. I\u0027ve plotted the total ship mass vs. desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for payload masses of 5, 10, 20 and 50 tonnes. For any desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, the *lower* curve indicates the more efficient engine of the two, since it achieves that \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv with a smaller total ship mass (which includes its own mass and the fuel mass it needs). The vertical blue dashed line indicates the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv limit for the LV-909 at ~7450 m/s. The last image shows 2D map of the regions where each engine is a better option, like tavert did.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/4Xjr2)\n\nIt\u0027s clear that the LV-N becomes the better choice very quickly: already at only 5 tonnes of payload it outperforms the LV-909 for any \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv larger than 2000 m/s. That\u0027s not a lot: it\u0027s not sufficient for a round trip to low Mun orbit unless aerobraking is heavily used for the return.\n\nFrom the last plot we confirm that the LV-N dominates for all but the lightest ships (\u003C 5 tonnes) and for most useful interplanetary \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv figures (\u003E 2000 m/s). But as mentioned previously, this does not consider the TWR of the resulting ship, and these solutions with a single engine might not be practical (pushing a 100 t ship with a single LV-N yields 0.6 m/s^2 of acceleration).\n\nEdit: I made some corrections since the thrust of the engines is not as high as I initially thought.

I\u0027ve included a minimum TWR restriction to the analysis (by asking my program to increase the number of engines in each case until the restriction is met).\n\n**Edit**: Charts recalculated using correct thrust values.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/cbidE)\n\nFor TWR up to 0.4 (about 4 m/s^2 of acceleration), the previous result holds: the LV-N is generally the better choice for \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u0027s larger than about 2000 m/s and payloads heavier than 5 tonnes.\n\nFor TWR of 0.5-0.6, the breakeven point moves to higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u0027s and becomes less sensitive to payload mass (the masses of the engines are starting to become dominant). Also, a region of no solution at high \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv appears (to the right of the charts). This is because the LV-909 can\u0027t yield more than 7400 m/s and the solution with the LV-N would require a ridiculous amount of engines (I\u0027ve limited the code 100 engines).\n\nFor a TWR of 0.8 and beyond, the LV-N is too heavy to provide efficient solutions, and the LV-909 wins where a solution is possible.\n\n---\n\nI think the bottomline is that the LV-N\u0027s efficiency makes it the better choice for TWRs up to about 0.5; beyond this it\u0027s just too heavy to satisfy the TWR restriction efficiently and the LV-909 is the only practical choice. Of course, the more sensible solution to this problem is to drop stages on the way.\n\nI\u0027ve done missions to Jool with a TWR of 0.25 (with 6 LV-Ns and a total ship mass of 130 tonnes) and it\u0027s perfectly practical. It\u0027s all about whether your mission profile can work with long burns (on the order of 10 minutes).\n\nIf you\u0027re curious as to why the jaggedness in some of these charts, it\u0027s because the number of engines changes suddenly to satisfy the TWR restriction. I\u0027ve included the last chart to better visualize the effect: it\u0027s clear how the additional LV-N added at a \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of 2200 m/s temporarily makes it a worse choice than the LV-909. Those 3 tonnes hurt!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Interestingly, a fuel-cell powered ion drive can work anywhere and still deliver an effective Isp of about 1200s.\n\nI saw that thread. The new solar power scaling is definitely making things interesting for ion drives. I\u0027ve been wanting to crunch the numbers on that, but I really should get to work for now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:37:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan**"},{"CreatedByName":"phunk","CreatedById":77377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:42:08Z","Content":"FYI, I\u0027m pretty sure Mechjeb is having some issues calculating dV in 1.0.x, on multiple occasions I\u0027ve noticed it telling me the current stage has more dV than the burn I was about to perform, only to have the tanks run dry well before the burn completed."}]}
