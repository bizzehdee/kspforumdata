I\u0027m also happy about them announcing it for an earlier build than post-1.0.

If that is what SQUAD ends up with, then the sooner they begin implementing it, the less work it\u0027s going to be adapting stuff to a multi-player based code later.

I thought maybe there could be 4-5 equatorial KSC\u0027s, because those are the easiest ones, and then a number of KSC\u0027s all around Kerbin. Possibly even the option of placing your KSC wherever you like. (Extra challenge; place it in a slope so that all your creations have to take off from the runway or be built with a special slope-compensator leg). Of course, this should resonate back to single-player, so that it\u0027s possible to choose a start location in single-player as well. Implementing additional KSC\u0027s into the code will give modders a lot of new tools to work with as well, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that it would be nice for several players to be part of one KSC, so that they don\u0027t have to have their own KSC far apart from each other if they don\u0027t want to. That way, they don\u0027t need to trade at all in order to sync their progress (if technology and science points are tied to KSC\u0027s instead of players). Perhaps we could get to build KSC\u0027s from the ground up, as it were, so that it\u0027s possible to have several launch pads for a KSC with several people. Having modular KSC\u0027s would also open up a lot of possibilities for modders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf only science results are allowed for trading, as opposed to trading technology itself, then it would not be game-breaking, I think, because the largest total amount of science input into any tech tree would only be the sum of all distinct science results among all the KSC\u0027s, instead of the sum of all science results from all KSC\u0027s multiplied with the number of KSC\u0027s (which could be achieved by everyone choosing a different tech after having completed one mission and then sharing it with everyone else). Of course, only getting to trade science results, wouldn\u0027t disallow people from choosing different technologies with the corresponding science points. Thus, one could end up with different players going different ways in the tech tree and open up for co-operation between players. Like, if one player goes for all the space station parts and another one chooses heavier rockets, then they could somehow co-operate in order to get the space station into orbit. This would require a joint mission functionality, but I think that would be a good idea anyway.

A little thing I just thought of that would keep things interesting, make it so the \u0022Pilot\u0022 and \u0022Kontrol\u0022 could switch places if they wished. Let \u0022Kontrol\u0022 have some support rolls, like they control the rovers and probes, unless the pilot is given equipment to do so, they can control things that take two different craft like a X-15 test craft type scenario, \u0022Kontrol\u0022 flies the drop craft while the pilot flies the X-15 analog, that way the drop craft doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just crash ruining all the K-bucks you spent on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is an incredible idea, you should officially suggest it to them in the dev forum\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T16:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t care about multiplayer. Sure, implement it, but \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the SP version is pretty much done and is entering beta. Otherwise, it\u0027s a waste of resources that could be spent on improving SP experience, which is, always was, and always will be core of KSP. MP should be done so that it\u0027s not interfering with SP development, nor with SP features. And sure as hell I never want to hear stuff like \u0022it can\u0027t be done because it\u0027ll break multi\u0022. If I had to chose between a gameplay-enhancing feature and a multiplayer mode, I\u0027ll take that feature no matter what it is. Maintaining and balancing multiplayer is a huge task, so it should be the lowest priority one so that it doesn\u0027t bog Squad down. Alternatively, if the game does well enough, they could hire a new guy (possibly the KMP one) exclusively for multiplayer development/maintenance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I\u0027d play any form of multiplayer would be a \u0022BARIS-style\u0022 competitive mode, with one friend of mine. We\u0027d have different tech trees based on real Soviet and American space programs, then compete on RSS-based universe, the ultimate goal probably being putting a man on the Moon or Mars. A nice perspective, but would probably require a ton of mods anyway. Besides, it\u0027d only be partially realistic. The fully realistic Space Race would be me (and perhaps one more person) on one side, my friend and about 10 of her collegues on the other, competing for resources and funding, with different, partial tech trees and managed by one of the aforementioned 13-years old griefers, changing every session. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Really, if it wasn\u0027t for political squabbling, the Soviets would\u0027ve probably got to the Moon, possibly before Americans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T17:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI might play a multiplayer mode where players operate space centers on opposite sides of Kerbin in some sort of persistent space race.
