I\u0027ve been working on a heavy transport fuel delivery space plane which is pretty much exactly the width of the runway concrete, and 200t fully loaded, so needs the entire runway length for takeoff. It flies just fine (for a large, heavy transport plane), hits orbit nicely with useful payload, looks reasonably realistic, etc. The major PITA is that it is extremely difficult to takeoff from KSC due to the wingtips and outer engine nacelles only just clearing those lights. Building the wings and nacelles higher is not an appropriate solution \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the fault is with the runway lights, not the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the lights need to be reduced in size and/or lowered, as they seem stupidly large and high to me, for a runway edge feature. I suggest making them flush with the ground, embedded in the ground, or non-collidable, and with safe clearance for a wing on standard landing gear above them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they are intended to be PAPI lights, they are wrong on 2 counts \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC no sectoring; and PAPI lights are pretty much always positioned safely to the side of the threshold, generally very low on the ground, commonly on the grass, not even remotely close to where a wing might legitimately be.

It basically requires the entire runway to reach takeoff speed, and the gear positions are pretty much as good as they can be, while keeping the part count reasonable, the gear structurally sound, and the chance of a tail strike down (it\u0027s got a Concorde-style tail wheel because the margin is already so slim, mounted high so not preventing rotation). It\u0027s not just wide, it\u0027s also long. If it stays perfectly aligned to the centre line on the takeoff run, it has about a 50/50 chance of the wingtips clearing the lights ok. Keeping it perfectly on the line, that\u0027s hard.

As others have said, if your plane requires the entire runway to liftoff it\u0027s almost certainly because of COM/COL \u0026amp; gear placement issues. The reason it actually flies is that the small dropoff at the end allows your craft to change its\u0027 AoA enough to generate sufficient lift. If I have to do this I just consider it a design failure because I shouldn\u0027t have to rely on a cliff to make a plane fly,and revert back to the drawing board. That being said, It is true that the stock landing gear is too short for larger craft.

Clearly, no: The rocket has already launched, so clearly it is possible to launch, and is therefore viable. The fact that someone might pilot it into the flagpole after this has happened is not relevant: If you have flown the rocket into the flagpole, then tautologically (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fortiori\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea fortiori\u003C/a\u003E) you are flying the rocket. There is no \u0022except for the fact that\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the problem with the launch tower (and in a completely equivalent way, the problem with the landing lights) is that it prevents the craft from being launched. There is no amount of good or bad flying that can make a difference, because the conception here is of a craft that \u003Cem\u003Ecannot be flown due to KSC geometry, and would be able to be flown otherwise\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has not yet been any argument that refutes this, or if you like, there has not been any argument that would not also, by its own logic, be in favour of the return of the launch tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat you really need are better stock landing gear.
