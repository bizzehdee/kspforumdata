If it\u0027s a jet plane - you probably placed a lot of air intakes in the front. Move them as far back as possible, at high speeds Drag is the most common reason for instability. New players get stuck with this a lot since there is no marker or indication that Drag has its own center which depends on air intake placement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T19:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore wings in the back, more struts. that outta do the trick \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Try to get the center of lift about a half-meter behind the center of mass, not aligned with it. Put the rear wheels on any massive object (not a wing!) thats more than a meter behind the center of mass. Finally, if it\u0027s squirrely, replace some of those control surfaces with plain wings. Even for a massive plane, two small control surfaces is plenty. Finally, you have two rudders are up on the tail. while that may look good, it\u0027s not going to fly good. change it to one rudder and hide it between those two big engine at the back, right in line vertically with the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
