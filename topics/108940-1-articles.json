Whenever I flying an aircraft (not heading to space), and I throttle engines to the point where mach effects begin, the sound starts stuttering and eventually results in a crash. \n\nIt seems to only happen at near-sonic and super-sonic speeds. Regardless of the aircraft. \n\nI haven\u0027t tried to fly in the upper atmosphere. I am still in the early career mode stages of the game.\n\nAll rockets seem to not be affected; not sure if launching from the other launch makes a difference (i.e. I have not tried to launch an airplane from the rocket pad.\n\nI have seen some people suggest, to similar problems, that using the force-opengl fixes some of these issues. I have yet to try that option, but plan to soon. I will post any updates.\n\nThanks, any help would appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T09:36:06Z","Content":"Hi ai\\_guy, help us to help you [**by seeing this thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide) and providing information on your issue ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
