Whenever I flying an aircraft (not heading to space), and I throttle engines to the point where mach effects begin, the sound starts stuttering and eventually results in a crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to only happen at near-sonic and super-sonic speeds. Regardless of the aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried to fly in the upper atmosphere. I am still in the early career mode stages of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll rockets seem to not be affected; not sure if launching from the other launch makes a difference (i.e. I have not tried to launch an airplane from the rocket pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen some people suggest, to similar problems, that using the force-opengl fixes some of these issues.
