I\u0027m just an IT guy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do raise an extremely good point about anti-viruses; they are not 100% effective. There are several reasons for this, one of which is because the entire concept of anti-viruses is flawed to begin with; anti-viruses are a reactive measure, and do not take any action until the security breach has already occurred. With that being said, I still recommend paid anti-viruses for businesses for two reasons: 1) the corporate grade anti-viruses will send log reports to a system administrator to be reviewed and 2) they can be part of what the industry calls a \u0022defense in depth\u0022 strategy (more on that here in a bit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe government, when requiring businesses to provide adequate protection for client\u0027s data, does not dictate how that data is to be protected. FERPA for example, simply states that disclosing a student\u0027s information, whether intentionally or unintentionally (this includes security breaches), warrants a very hefty fine. Attach to that several pages of jargon written in some language other than plain ole\u0027 English that adds exceptions, loopholes, etc. How most businesses approach this is push anti-viruses out to the entire corporation followed by an access control list defined in Microsoft Active Directory, and then forget about it. Even this is not considered best practice, but it\u0027s what most businesses do. My guess is that this is what Target did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is considered best practice is a concept called \u0022defense in depth.\u0022 This concept dictates that no single security approach can provide adequate protection, but rather a combination of security software and procedures that are applied in \u0022layers.\u0022 The idea is that if one layer is breached, the other layers remain in place. One layer might be requiring all corporate computers having anti-virus software that reports to a centralized server. Another layer might be requiring that all laptops have full disk encryption software along with a remote location software such as Prey. Yet another layer might be training users to not download stuff they shouldn\u0027t be downloading. All three of these layers are layers that can be easily implemented by both a small business and a large corporation. Other measures include firewalls with white/black listing, UTM servers, setting up dual authentication, \u0022always-on\u0022 VPN connections, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically when a large company such as Target suffers a major breach it\u0027s because the proper security measures were not taken, such as failing to provide multiple layers of protection. Target is not disclosing all the information about their breach, so the best that anyone can do is speculate. My personal theory is that they only implemented one layer of protection, and that layer was breached. Typically POS systems are not connected to the internet; they are completely isolated and they authorize their payments through a locked down proxy that is put under a microscope. The fact that malware was found on their POS systems and was able to forward information tells me that either 1) their POS systems were not isolated or 2) their proxy was breached in addition to the POS systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T21:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! Curiosity is satisfied. I\u0027m also very impressed that you took the time to explain instead of just biting my head off. I also think that if Target had nothing to hide they would be putting more info out there. I have searched for more info as far as exactly what kind of security they had in place but got nowhere with that. I\u0027m sure if all the details were made public, they would probably get a big black eye, along with even more civil and criminal prosecution than what they are seeing now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic for O.P. : I don\u0027t think you have to uninstall Norton to do an operating system upgrade. But, like others have said, don\u0027t waste your money on something that really isn\u0027t needed. Free anti-virus works just as well, or doesn\u0027t work just as well. Personally, I won\u0027t install anything that sets up a constantly running process that monitors my every move online. I like the free version of malwarebytes, that only runs when I tell it to. One still has to be careful when installing malwarebytes however, because they will try to install free trials of their paid version if you don\u0027t pay close attention to the check boxes during installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
