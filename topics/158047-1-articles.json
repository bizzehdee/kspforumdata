Why every game has to be free with paid add-ons, because its the only way you will give up $0.99 for 327 hours of gameplay. By the way, you would still complain about spending the $0.99 for 327 hours of gameplay cause anything less would be robbery.

can get.\u00A0 But one of those wonderful things was promising early adopters free content.\u00A0 That was one of the selling points at that time.\u00A0 They cannot risk their reputation (EA anyone?) by going back on their word,\u00A0 If you buy a car, and part of that purchase agreement is free routine service for the life of the car, you expect the dealership to honor that.\u00A0 If they don\u0027t 3 things will happen.\u00A0 One, they lose a lot of customers who won\u0027t buy another car from them.\u00A0 Two, they lose all the referral and other new customers through the bad press.\u00A0 And Three, they will probably end up in court. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven in this case, all three are possible.\u00A0 Since they only have one product (that I know of), the risk of losing repeat business is not that great, but any future products they release will be met with skepticism.\u00A0\u00A0 This would also definitely cloud future sales to new customers too, as they would hesitate to buy from a company known to screw over their customers.\u00A0 And while a lawsuit seems ridiculous, given the cost of the DLC, that\u0027s the very reason why someone would sue.\u00A0 The cost of defending all these suits on this topic would far outweigh any revenue they generate from the sales.\u00A0 And as soon as they settle one of them, they would have to settle them all.\u00A0 They know that and it\u0027s just easier and cheaper to stand by their promise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically every comment I seen asking about this topic fall into 2 categories.\u00A0\u00A0 One, Those few early adopters asking if Squad would honor their promise.\u00A0 And Two, those complaining about us asking about the promise.\u00A0\u00A0 Yes there were maybe a couple asking for financial reasons, but not the majority.\u00A0 There are so many companies out there that do nothing but screw over their customers, that it\u0027s very reasonable for this to be a concern.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe bought this game early, knowing it was still a work in progress, and a lot of these early release games never make it to a full release.\u00A0 We knew that and yet we still supported Squad.\u00A0 Without our seed money, there may not have been a full version.\u00A0\u00A0 So instead of complaining about us

Those that works for Squad are not doing it for \u0022free\u0022...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could see the problems from those that have not a constant revenue, but will like to have the announced (but not yet finalized) options from the fist DLC as \u0022stock\u0022...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also see the complains about \u0022what SQUAD announced as DLC is now easily achieved with some free mods\u0022, but this is not the same: I saw tons of interesting concepts being difficoult implemented by mods, but very easily done once stock (my first example was the kraken-driven first mods that tried to add \u0022docking\u0022, generally killing tons of space assemblies, rather the smoothness achieved once \u0022docking\u0022 was made in the core game)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is probably one of the few (if not the only) game that will grant to me ton of fun even if \u0022tomorrow\u0022 SQUAD could announce that will close any further development of the game (I hope a far away \u0022tomorrow\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m probably naive enough in my thoughts to have been, in fact, one of the \u0022early buyer\u0022 of a product very far to be complete (I wish that for any complaining guy, he should be reverted to 0.17 for at least a couple of hours or REAL game, to feel what it was KSP back in its early state, when aside a couple of cilinder labelled as \u0022fuel tanks\u0022, there was basically nothing: no tweakable to fine tuning part positioning, no nodes for manouvers, no docking, no kerbals to walk away from crafts) just to HELP a very promising concept to bloom in a full fledged game (yes... there are still things I expect to be added on stock to consider it really \u0022complete\u0022 -\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E tables, for example-, but this actual situation is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E MORE COMPLETE than any experienced FIVE YEARS AGO!!!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if with the upcoming \u0022language localization\u0022, probably some sales will go up again, I suspect that KSP is not bringing the same amount of cash to SQAUD as it was, just to say, around 0.90 or early 1.XXX releases, so what is it needed to keep SQUAD afloat to further spend time and resources on the future? Obviously add contents as payed \u0022expansions/DLCs/whatever-you-could-call-them\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s obviously a market stategy long ABUSED by a lot of companies (basic games in which you could do very litlle, without, and then you have a decent one, instead, if you put more money in it) but, as NOW (data from the official KSP store) how BAD PRICEY could them be, with a basic game costing 18\u20AC now? 5 euros??? 10???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m OFFICIALLY asking to SQUAD to leave in ANY CASE OPEN the \u0022buy the DLC\u0022 option (at least in their KSP-Store, if it could be problematic to have it done on Steam/other selling platforms) even if I\u0027ll receive the \u0022download it\u0022 option for free because... well... I\u0027m naive and romantic (and old: beying old enough helps to be \u0022naive\u0022 and \u0022romantic\u0022, sometime), and I\u0027ll probably wanna (re-)FUND SQUAD itself of the FUN they are keeping me, still after 5 years (and with a LOT of time in the future) buying it ANYWAY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause, even if some features/bugs need to be still addressed, even if I expect some polishment in the future (stock rocket parts revamp, for example????)

That would be like basing the price of your next pizza against a different type of pizza you had 3 years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDLC needs to stand on its own as a package price wise, I will always judge the price against the content it contains, I will factor in how much I play/enjoy the base game still, after all if you don\u0027t play the game at all any more it\u0027s probably wise to avoid paying more money towards additional content. For me KSP is a part time game, it\u0027s that game I play for a while, then take a break from and come back to. So for me I will take that into account when it comes to DLC. Not so much \u0027is the price point agreeable\u0027, but more \u0027is it worth it right at this moment\u0027. For me the answer is probably \u0027no\u0027. I am currently not playing KSP actively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the actual price point, \u00A312 isn\u0027t too bad. I\u0027ve paid more for other game DLCs. But it really depends on the content, I haven\u0027t really looked into it too deeply at this point, so I am reserving judgement until I have all the facts. However I am waiting on DLC for another game too, a game I play and mod for on a more regular basis, so as you can imagine that game will take precedence for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn truth given the price point, I think it is likely I will not be buying the KSP DLC at this time. I will most likely wait until I start playing again, and who knows maybe the price will drop in the meantime making it all the sweeter deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there are times that I will buy a DLC outright simply because I want to support the devs. For those of you who play, or are familiar with Euro Truck Sim, I will always buy the skin packs (less than \u00A31 usually) because it is pocket change. If Squad were to release little skin packs for space suits or additional looks for rocket parts up to \u00A32 I freely admit I would buy it instantly. 1 because I do enjoy KSP and want to help support the game, and 2 because I consider it pocket change for me. But when we start talking \u00A35\u002B for a DLC that is when I have to really think about it, because I am currently dealing with health issues that prevent me from working and will likely stop me being employed in the near future, money obviously is also an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was working I would probably just buy it as soon as it releases.
