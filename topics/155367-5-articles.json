don\u0027t want to ship crap, because no matter how much you bat other stuff out of the park, a crap product will come back to bite you and you\u0027ll fail your business goals when the customers abandon you.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the other hand, you generally don\u0027t want to ship armor-plated, guaranteed-never-to-have-a-problem-even-once-in-a-century product, because getting something to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E level of reliability is so ludicrously expensive and time-consuming that you\u0027ll totally fail on the other two axes and go out of business.\u00A0 (Fault-finding and quality control are subject to diminishing returns; the fewer bugs are left, the more expensive and time consuming it is to find and fix them.\u00A0 It\u0027s like cleaning a room:\u00A0 easy and quick to clean it well, virtually impossible to clean it perfectly so there\u0027s literally not a single speck of dust anywhere.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly there are outliers.\u00A0 If you\u0027re a company that\u0027s producing really critical software-- for example, to run the space shuttle, or hospital life-support equipment, or air traffic control, or nuclear power station control-- where people die, or you can literally cause billions-with-a-B dollars of damage, if something breaks-- then \u0022extreme quality\u0022 is an option.\u00A0 Those are the cases where the call has been made that \u0022It\u0027s okay if it takes years and many millions of dollars to produce a simple piece of code, and each individual line of code literally costs more than a thousand dollars to produce.\u0022\u00A0 In other words, it\u0027s a situation where time and features go out the window in order to sacrifice everything to the god of Quality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, those tend to be rare exceptions.\u00A0 In the vast majority of cases, there\u0027s a fairly clear \u0022sweet spot\u0022 of quality control investment, where you can get really-good-but-not-perfect for a reasonable cost.\u00A0 You don\u0027t want to be crappier than that, because it doesn\u0027t save you much money and makes your product a lot worse and seriously annoys your customer base.\u00A0 But you don\u0027t want to be a lot better than that, either, since you\u0027ve hit the point of diminishing returns and it would involve spending tons of money and time for only a tiny incremental improvement in quality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the remainder of the discussion here will assume we\u0027re talking about software produced at this \u0022sweet spot\u0022 level of quality, and just talk about the time-versus-features question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, assuming that as a company you\u0027ve made the usually-what-everyone-does decision to ship \u0022really good, but not perfect\u0022 software with a reasonable investment in QA, this means you\u0027re down to a question of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E versus \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It means that, broadly speaking, you have two ways to ship:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFeature-driven:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 \u0022We know what features we want to ship.\u00A0 We\u0027re going to work on it until those features are ready, and will take as much time as it takes in order to do so.\u00A0 This means we can\u0027t predict exactly when we\u0027ll ship.\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESchedule-driven:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 \u0022We know \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E we want to ship; there\u0027s a date we need to meet, for some external or internal reasons.\u00A0 We will do whatever we have to in order to meet that date.\u00A0 This means we may have to cut features.\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not strictly an either/or; there\u0027s a spectrum.\u00A0 For example, you may be primarily schedule-driven, but you have some absolute-must-have features that you literally can\u0027t ship without, so you have to accept the risk that you may have to slip the schedule.\u00A0 (You want to avoid that if possible, because it gives you a black eye and erodes your credibility if you do it a lot, but sometimes it\u0027s unavoidable.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, it\u0027s external factors that force a company\u0027s hand and determine whether a given release will be feature-driven or schedule-driven.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, suppose you\u0027re a game company working on a major new release, and a big gaming convention like E3 is coming up nine months from now, and your business model and marketing and such is critically dependent on having a big \u0022wow\u0022 release at the convention, and if you miss it you\u0027ll go out of business because you don\u0027t have enough venture capital to last another year until the next one.\u00A0 In that case... you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egotta\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E make that date.\u00A0 So you\u0027ll do whatever it takes to hit that date, which may entail working some long hours... but it also may entail scaling back the planned feature list and cutting features until you\u0027ve whittled it down to something that you can get done by the deadline, but still has enough stuff in it to be sellable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, you might have a case where you already have a product that\u0027s out there, working well, selling well.\u00A0 You\u0027re working on a new version that you\u0027ll be releasing to address some issues.\u00A0 On the one hand, there\u0027s no explicit deadline breathing down your neck-- it\u0027s not like \u0022this has to be ready by 3:12PM on Thursday, six weeks from now, or we\u0027ll go out of business.\u0022\u00A0 On the other hand, you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to address these issues, otherwise what\u0027s the point of releasing?\u00A0 So in that case, you just work on those features until they\u0027re ready, then you ship, whenever that happens to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth cases happen.\u00A0 My experience is that the large majority of releases are schedule-driven, especially in larger companies where there are other big, heavy wheels with lots of inertia that also have to be set in motion for a release (e.g. marketing campaigns, scheduled analyst calls, tech support centers set up, supply-chain issues for hardware, documentation production, all kinds of other stuff).\u00A0 But feature-driven releases happen, too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote

because \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emanagement and production are in close cahoots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The managers and the developers work closely together, probably sit right next to each other, communicate frequently on a day-to-day basis.\u00A0 The managers make sure that the developers know what the business goals are and what external requirements have to get nailed.\u00A0 The developers make sure that management knows how the work is going, and give a prompt heads-up if any technical issues pop up that could impact schedule or quality.\u00A0 Low-level management tends to have an engineering background.\u00A0 If the company\u0027s big enough to have layers of upper-level management, then they respect what engineers tell them, and listen carefully to lower management.\u00A0 So this conflict that you describe \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eisn\u0027t a conflict and (mostly) doesn\u0027t happen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E because everyone\u0027s playing for

perspective, I define \u0022good company\u0022 as one that treats developers well.\u00A0 So that\u0027s going to color the language that I use here.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to work almost exclusively at Type A companies for my whole career, since those are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eabsolutely\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the best place to work, if you\u0027re a developer.\u00A0 (That\u0027s no accident:\u00A0 if there\u0027s a prospective company that may be interested in hiring me, naturally I\u0027m gonna ask enough questions to figure out \u0022is this going to be a place I will enjoy working.\u0022)\u00A0 However, I\u0027ve worked closely with a lot of other people, including ones who came from the B\u0027s and C\u0027s of the world, so I\u0027ve got a reasonable handle on what those are like.\u00A0 It\u0027s worth noting that Type B, while unpleasant to work at as a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edeveloper\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, can be highly commercially successful for many years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, for a big enough company, it\u0027s not necessarily an either-or thing.\u00A0 You could have, for example, a company that might have some divisions that are run as Type A, but other divisions that are Type B.\u00A0 It\u0027s a whole spectrum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to note-- if you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eoutside\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the company (e.g. as a customer, looking on)-- it can be difficult or impossible to tell which of the above-described models it is, unless the company is so large and well-known and has so many ex-employees that conditions in the company are an open secret.\u00A0 But if the company is a small one, then it can be impossible for an outsider to tell.\u00A0 \u0022Don\u0027t know\u0022 means \u0022don\u0027t know\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, again, please take everything I say above as a general commentary on the state of the industry, and don\u0027t take anything I say as even the remotest speculation as to what category Squad might be in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022

supply-chain stuff that has to be coordinated, and approval process, and all that stuff.\u00A0 I base these guesses on my general knowledge of how things work in the industry, and also on what I\u0027ve observed from Squad\u0027s public announcements and actions.\u00A0 I suspect they\u0027re reasonably good guesses, but that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E they are, just guesses, and I could be wrong, since (like you) I don\u0027t have any insider knowledge of how they make their shipping

They may have specific expectations about how many years a game will take or in which quarter it will be released.\u00A0All of this means that the studio has to show regular\u00A0progress and commit to dates to get continued funding.\u00A0Publishers tend to push such games into the \u0022schedule-driven\u0022 camp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s somewhat probable that the marketing-company higher-ups of SQUAD function like an internal publisher to the game-dev side of SQUAD; the dev team reports to them and probably provides high level overviews of the status of things. But I think we can all see that the relationship isn\u0027t exactly analogous, since the dev side seems to have significant freedom to define their own feature\u00A0goals and release dates (presumably\u00A0as long as they can make a convincing business case for those decisions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this is the video where this former game industry guy talks about publishers.
