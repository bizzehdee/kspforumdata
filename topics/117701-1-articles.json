Absolutely NO RF input in your TV?\n\nMost modern TV\u0027s still have the round coaxial RF input even though it\u0027s used for digital input (or old fashioned analogue TV). Try unplugging that one and use it for your NES.\n\nIf all else fails instead of converting to HDMI you might find it easier to convert the RF signal to SCART or composite RCA. Don\u0027t waste money/time/energy on converting to digital when you don\u0027t have to. Converters are sold on eBay for $20-30.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T16:37:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tex\\_NL**"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T21:42:10Z","Content":"Well, I\u0027m still doing the VCR trick probably.

Check Amazon or your local Wal\\*Mart (or equivalent). WallyWorld always has decades old RF tuners whenever I dig through their electronics/tv gear section. Probably a little bit cheaper than a used VCR. You\u0027ll also find that RCA-out on lots of older VCRs may not work thanks to dead or dying capacitors. (Both of the audio-outs on my VCR are dead, and I\u0027m too lazy/busy to crack it open to replace the dead caps. I also haven\u0027t watched a VHS tape in more than a decade....)\n\nYou really might have trouble finding a new TV that will decode analog signals. The latest Samsung I bought (a small 27\u0022 that I use for X-Box LAN parties) will only tune to digital stations (3.1, 4.1, etc), and won\u0027t go to their analog equivalents. The tuner is probably still physically there but the TV\u0027s software won\u0027t let me get to it. That TV was only $100 though, so ya gets what ya pays for. If your TV is more than a couple years old you\u0027ll be fine. Obviously if your TV doesn\u0027t even have a coax in then that whole last paragraph is irrelevant.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T16:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:59:02Z","Content":"Depends on country. Britain has completely done away with analogue TV broadcasts, rendering the ability to receive them irrelevant to anybody who doesn\u0027t want to use a *really* old games console, VCR, or suchlike. And consider that some models of the NES and all SNESes supported composite video which is something you are likely to want and get on a modern TV, so you\u0027re looking at NES era or even earlier to find equipment that demands the ability to receive an analogue TV broadcast type of signal here.\n\n**To our OP**, consider finding a NES that supports composite video output and getting hold of the relevant cables.
