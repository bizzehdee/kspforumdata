I love building things that shouldn\u0027t work and doing it anyway. And piston engines have become somewhat of a obsession to me, from the first one i build that litterally needed the power of rockets to even run to ever more effiencient, simple and powerfull designs, Just to see how far i can push this concept. That for me, is what ksp is all about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is Just an introduction to this story. But later today i wil be uploading video\u0027s, pictures and also explanations as to why i made specific design choices and i how i improved them or how i would like to improve them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI really hope that i can get people interested. But if that is not the case at least i will have written a story and that\u0027s pretty good fun on it\u0027s own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-26T19:20:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2020 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Flying dutchman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
