Is there any way to swap a crew in flight? For example, I did an orbital rendezvous with a spacestation I put in orbit, then came back home. If crews had swapped (so the space station crew took the ride home while the other stayed) is there any way to reflect this by editing the persistent or save file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried swapping ToD and State with both crews, saved the file, restarted the game, and they were back in their original positions. Are crew \u0027tied\u0027 to the vehicle they launched in? I didn\\\u0027t see anywhere else in the persistent file where it referenced (by vessel for instance) which crew were aboard it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know? I realize most people probably don\\\u0027t care, but if anyone knows I\\\u0027d appreciate it, thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-23T10:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple ways to do this. The way with the least editing of the file is to find the vessel that you want to port the crew from in the persistence.sfs file, find the capsule part within that vessel, and note the \u0027crew =\u0027 numbers in that capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen find the vessel you want to port the crew to, find the capsule part within that vessel, and change those \u0027crew = \u0027 numbers accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of right now, I don\\\u0027t think there are issues with having the same crew in multiple vessels.
