The Oberth effect just comes from the conservation of mechanical energy (trading propellant potential energy for rocket kinetic energy), whereas the gravity assist is a way to increase your velocity in a paticular inertial refrence frame (usually the one with respect to the sun or Kerbol ibn this case), by exchaning angular momentum by another body. In this case for instance you could use the Oberth effect to good use burning close in to Kerbol, but you \u003Cem\u003Ecan not\u003C/em\u003E use Kerbol for gravity assists (as Kerbol is at rest with respect to the entire solar system).
