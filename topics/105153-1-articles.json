Yesterday being the 26th, so highlighting 0.90/0.26. 0.25 on the 25th, etc.\n\nI don\u0027t know if it was intentional for them to release .27 on the 27th but I find it interesting nonetheless."},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T14:20:28Z","Content":"History is full of subtle and strange coincidences...
