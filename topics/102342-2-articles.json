Seriously guys, this is not cool. At all. It would make Squad look bad, and discourage new users from the community. It\u0027s not April 1st yet, is it? No, it\u0027s not. Was this announcement posted 10 days too early? \n\nYou know why online forums haven\u0027t changed since the 1990s? Because they work. Any time you have an intelligent device helping you, it\u0027s shortcomings are frustrating because they\u0027re not your own fault. And 140 character-only posts? That\u0027s not a forum at all, that\u0027s just a messaging system.\n\nAt the very least, if you\u0027re going to have a paid forum, don\u0027t have the paid features be features that you would expect as normal and free on any other forum. No ability to post videos or use signatures or avatars? This just causes classism to begin. Poorer people won\u0027t be able to afford these features.\n\nThe Kerbal Space Program community has long been the best, and most supportive community on the internet. This is a sure way to destroy that. When I first saw the paid features list, I had to take a break from the internet so that I wouldn\u0027t submit a post of pure rage.\n\nScrew this. I\u0027m driving the HypeTrain as far away as possible from the new forum.
