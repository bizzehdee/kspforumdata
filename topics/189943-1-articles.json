There\u0027s a lot of liquid fuel there, but Wernher suspected that mission control might wanna adjust the orbital parameters at some point in time, and too much fuel in orbit isn\u0027t really an issue. You can still dock craft there to refuel, so this com array can also serve as a refueling station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002262020FE1FBF1E8655CFBDD6963F08A0736279896\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/768362254712017974/62020FE1FBF1E8655CFBDD6963F08A0736279896/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the relay dishes are now online, and the crew aboard the Minmus orbitals systems can now enjoy their full HD streaming there.
