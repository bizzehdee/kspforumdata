Working on fixing that for my mainstay craft, which I plan on very seldom changing, and using them as the backbone for missions, so right now I\u0027m doing a TON of designing, but once I round out my fleet, I\u0027ll be doing far more flying than anything since I\u0027ll already have some basic designs down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally try to name things after stars in our real world, but if I can\u0027t happen to find one I like, I\u0027ll just use one I made up that sounds like it may be legitimate, or I find an animal I\u0027m particularly fond of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis name is then applied to a series of crafts, a \u0022family\u0022, if you will, which will have I\u0027s II\u0027s and III\u0027s and so forth assigned to them based on size/use. Then, I will append to the end of the Roman Numeral a sub-reference designator, based on a single letter which is derived from the most notable special feature on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will then test this and make minor edits to the craft design until it works well. Once it has the numbers (Delta-V is enough according to KER in-editor) and it passes some basic flight tests (these vary on a per-ship type basis. Rockets must achieve orbit with some payload, usually a fuel tank, whereas landers simply need to hover around the KSC, where still unmanned probes may only need to do a test-engine fire or solar power test), the craft will then be saved with an ! next to the name to put it in first in the list of all the craft, so I know that it\u0027s a proven, tested design, ready for repeated re-use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I happen to make a major edit at a later date, or build a craft from the ground-up in such a way that it is nearly identical, visually and functionally, to a previous version, a special word may be appended to the end of the name, past the single-letter sub-reference designator, to remind that it is not the original iteration of this exact craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, craft with no special features outside of their outlined purposes and criteria are not given a special sub-reference designator. For example, a 3-seat OTV would not get a sub-ref, because an OTV of that size is expected to carry at least so many crew. However, if the OTV happened to have a different propulsion system than standard bi-propellant engines, for example Ion, Nuclear, or Monopropellant, it may be given a sub-reference. The same goes to modified craft with special purposes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more popular ones I\u0027ve come up with is the Betelgeuse series..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had the..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-I Delta\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-II\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-M\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-III Gamma\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetelgeuse-X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, this series is a bit messed up, as the Betelgeuse-I is actually quite larger than the Betelgeuse-II will be, and the Betelgeuse-III Gamma never had a \u0022non-gamma\u0022 version, and is basically just a REALLY optimized Betelgeuse-I Delta. Also, the Betelgeuse-M is basically just going to be a re-useable version of the Betelgeuse-II\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, it made sense in my head, don\u0027t judge me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geckgo","CreatedById":76457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T05:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, some diversity here. I tend to restart my game from time to time (still mod-hopping).
