I always try to treat each module as if it had its own internal RCS source. This way, when something connects with RCS they are fairly well balanced. It won\u0027t be precise, but usually close enough. Combined with a torque source, it\u0027s good enough to take care of most anything. As long as the amount of RCS TWR is kept fairly constant, things should stay relatively balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: FYI, so long as RCS is placed symmetrically and has no rotational offset there\u0027s no need to calculate the RCS TWR for each direction. Total thrust/weight will give you just as useful a ratio... it doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s being divided by three or four or more (so long as *all* vessels that will be connected have the same symmetry mode). If you\u0027re connecting one vehicle with 8-fold symm RCS to one with 4-fold symm rcs, you need to account for the difference in TWR. Again, none of this is *exact*, but it\u0027s usually good enough that getting it more closely matched doesn\u0027t end up making any noticeable difference (especially when torque is present from other sources).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T18:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPutting RCS on payload increases part count.
