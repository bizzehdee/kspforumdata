Requires Silisko Edition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStages 1 \u0026amp; 2 fire at once, with stage 1 cutting out after a minute at about 5,600m / 160ms\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E, after jettisoning stage 1, stage 2 continues for another 6 seconds to 6,700m at which point stages 3 and 4 fire off. Throttle stage 4 back when you reach 550ms\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E, which should be around 19,000m, about 1m45s after launch. Stage 3 should burn out just before 2m30s with a final velocity near 650ms\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E. Maintain vertical attitude until atmosphere exit at 70,000m then rotate and burn for orbit at Apoapsis of about 73,500m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3 should retain sufficient fuel to achieve a Munar capture trajectory, with Stage 5 available for final adjustments to Munar orbit, where it should be left to provide a communications relay back to KSC. Stage 6 provides Munar landing capability, the Munar science module, and a convenient launch pad for Stage 7, the Return Vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedRockets","CreatedById":10539,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-01T05:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s Amazing!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewow!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove the lander!!
