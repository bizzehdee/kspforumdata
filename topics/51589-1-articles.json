How long player play a game does not depend on its server size but content. PvP games usually offer more, while PvE or story driven games require the developer to publish new content regularly. Private servers are also not worse in terms of cheaters, since you usually have way more admins per player than in an MMO, where the publisher would have to pay for them. It ofc depends on the server \u0022owner\u0022, no matter if its a company (e.g. mmo creator) or a small private group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, developer-controlled servers are currently the industries way to go. But the primary reason for that is that this way they can squeeze out the last penny they are willing to pay out of their players. I really like that Squad appears to not blindly follow that trend!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, ofc a huge public ksp MMO server would be nice. But imo thats sth absolutely different from the current KMP-like approach. Its impossible to say that one is better than the other, even though you might personally prefer on of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T06:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes I have looked into KMP. \u003Cp\u003EAnd I was talking about if Squad decided to FULLY implement multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with decentralized mmo\u0027s is and always has been the same....they dont have the longevity as dev/studio centralized mmos, and are plauged with problems like maleware, hacks, and general flaming/trolling crap.....and this is more the case than not with any player/community run servers based games.

So being able to use Mainsails costs you $10, the big orange tank $10, the 3 man capsule $10, the 1.5m decoupler $5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously doubt many of the current KSP fans would be willing to sign up to either of those pricing models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
