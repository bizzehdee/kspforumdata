It\u0027s UpsilonAerospace.\n\nBecause I\u0027ve had a *load* of time recently to work on creative projects, I\u0027ve dug out a song that I was working on a long while back and finished it. Presenting:\n\nDROPS OF JOOL \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_pn352Cgp4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n~~~\n\nThis music is a pretty obvious cover of \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Xf-Lesrkuc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n by the group Train. However, it\u0027s purely instrumental, downtempo, in a different key with a different chord progression... actually, it\u0027s not too much like the original, though it does keep a bit of the original melody.\nOther than two synth pads (one for the bass and one for a bit of texture throughout the main melody), the entire thing was played on the violin by me. You can hear some good ol\u0027-fashioned pizzicato, some playing with a bow, some little soft tremolos, and even some harmonics as the piece progresses.\n\nAt any rate, I hope you enjoy listening to this! I\u0027ll provide a download link if anyone asks for it. And yes, I *will* be resuming my KSP plugin songs in just a little bit as well as doing a collaboration. I haven\u0027t forgotten about it, Starwhip!\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"CG_Kerbin","CreatedById":117777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:24:54Z","Content":"This Is nice And extremely relaxing id love them to add this music as you first see jool as just a green dot."},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:27:47Z","Content":"Thats so deep and beautiful!

If this was added into the game, I\u0027d have it be one of the tracks that plays when you\u0027re in orbit, as it\u0027s peaceful and would mesh with the other tracks pretty well, IMO.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thats so deep and beautiful!

Believe it or not, I originally wanted this to have a completely different and much less relaxing feel. I\u0027m glad I eventually decided to make this song sound like... well, like this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Was I surprised this was a remix? Yes. Did it sound completely original? Yes. Do I love it?

I make music that doesn\u0027t easily fit into any one genre, and I\u0027m proud of it.\n\n~~~\n\nI trust that people want the audio file for this guy, based on the positive comments. **Give me an hour or two, and I\u0027ll have it up!**\n\nOnce again, thanks for listening to this... I really appreciate it.
