(Unless this is per IP?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese joints do look oxidized to hell, though. I guess Nuke had a good call on this. With practice, you should be able to make joints using flux core solder without additional flux, but maybe you did burn off all of your flux while making these. Good practice when working with simple wire joints is to use the soldering iron to heat up the wire, then touch it with the solder wire. That tends to produce very neat joints. These look like you\u0027ve transferred solder to iron, then applied it to the joint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, unless you feel like having good practice in de-soldering and then re-soldering everything, next step would be to try and find a bad joint.
