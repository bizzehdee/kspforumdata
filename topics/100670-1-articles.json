Now I have a gaming PC I built. Both machines have 4 GB of RAM. However, with the new machine, each session of gameplay doesn\u0027t last more than 5 flights before I end up crashing to desktop with a message saying \u0022There has been an error log created\u0022 or something to that effect. I have no clue why this is happening or why I would end up running out of RAM. Task manager never shows KSP reaching even 1.5 GB, and I don\u0027t run anything else in the background while I play. Why might the game be crashing, why wouldn\u0027t it crash on the laptop, and how can I fix it? Thanks for any ideas.\n\nIf the specifics of the error log, or my computer specs would be helpful, I\u0027d be happy to post. Just say what specifically you\u0027re looking for and I\u0027ll say so as soon as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"renejant","CreatedById":104304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:05:48Z","Content":"how many mods do you use? are you using active texture management? post your logs and computer spec will certainly help, but don\u0027t post them here or it makes it hard to read the thread for us, instead post it to dropbox or something and just provide the link instead..."},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T23:33:39Z","Content":"\u00224 Gb RAM\u0022 is a hardly gaming PC by the modern standarts. I\u0027d say that 4 Gb is minimum for Windows 7 and later.\n\nSecond, what OS are you using? KSP is basically incompatible with 32-bit Windows - since it cannot address more than 2 Gb to one process, and KSP 0.90 easily reaches that when stock.\n\nThird, as renejant said, post your log."}]}
