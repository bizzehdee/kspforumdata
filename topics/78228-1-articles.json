That means, if you chose Ironman when you start your career, the F5 and F9 buttons do not work and the \u0022revert to ....\u0022 is not even available. Before it was more an convenience to revert, now I kind of see it on par with save scumming. I don\u0027t mind if people do it, but not for me. I know it\u0027s up to me to use them or not. But wouldn\u0027t it be handy to have an Ironman feature like in other games, where it is impossible to do save scumming? It\u0027s just too tempting to to revert if that button is available and it would give the whole planing and doing a mission a totally new feeling if you know that if you are going to fail that one big mission, you are losing a lot of funds and reputation so you have to plan and execute it carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T15:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can create this with the debug menu now (F12 I think?).

Reverting your flight kind of defeats the purpose of playing career mode, but I can still see the appeal of it for some(even myself sometimes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve always said, though, was that they should have a series of difficulty tweakables, sliders and toggles. Like ironman, where you can\u0027t revert your save beyond the last automatic quicksave or whatever. Or life support or multipliers for how much money and/or science you earn per mission or science task represented by a slider. Lowest setting for those would be like half of the current rate for income and science but the maximum setting would be like...five to ten times as much science or money per task. When they revamp the aerodynamics, there can be an option to have it rather complex or an option to ramp it up and add things like reentry damage and what-not. Those types of settings should definitely be stock and they should obviously be optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I seem to recall some people pointing out that the developers weren\u0027t very interested in having those sorts of difficulty options, even as toggles in an option menu somewheres(or when you make a new game, like XCOM or Space Engineers or others). So that\u0027s kind of a downer. I mean, I know there\u0027s lots of mods out there to do some of this stuff, but like...a lot of them just \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be stock, you know? But whatever, maybe we\u0027ll see that stuff as DLC someday or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"morph113","CreatedById":102656,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T15:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk cheers LethalDose thats perfect for me..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T15:55:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by morph113\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T15:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you can not press it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T16:23:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad that worked for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, be careful with those options.
