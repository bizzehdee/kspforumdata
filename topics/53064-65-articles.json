Yes, I pretty much want to do that. I would like to create a script that removes all the unnecessary files automatically. It would be even better if it were possible to remove the access of the parts with some kind of config file instead of removing the files. Even though that doesnt safe memory, I would be much better because removing can go wrong pretty fast and do real damage to unintended files on the computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to create such a script, I need a list what these parts to remove. I have not the experience with all the mods to do that though. Can someone with knowledge of the RPL tech tree and the mods create that list? The assumption is, that the game should be balanced and playable with all the intended mods installed. So if there are procedural tanks for example, no other (large) fuel tanks are needed. Since there are procedural fairings, no normal wings are required. Since AIES provides custom science modules, the originals can be removed. There are many more examples, but I guess you get my drift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx and cheers to everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESemmel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T21:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aazard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aazard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell this curse site issue just made getting the mod packages needed harder.
