First, the heatshields shouldn\u0027t have their physics turned off (it\u0027s not just massless). As I understand it, the KSP devs added the physicsless thing because Unity has (had?) issues with connecting two parts where one part has more than ten times the mass of the smaller part. Since even the 1.25m heatshield has a 0.3t mass, I don\u0027t think it really falls into this category.\n\nSecond, physicsless parts aren\u0027t really supposed to be massless under 1.0, they\u0027re supposed to add their mass and drag to the item that they\u0027re attached to. If the mass and air resistance of the physicsless parts were being properly added to what they\u0027re attached to, then adding a heatshield to a capsule should still work. It may be that this function works correctly for parts that should be physicsless, but it botches it when the mass is more than it should be. This would be the case if they\u0027re not shifting the CoM of the part that the physicsless part is attached to, which would be a reasonable simplification if the attached part were actually significantly less mass, but quirky if that\u0027s not true.\n\nThird, the map mode info popup doesn\u0027t include the mass of physicsless parts, but that\u0027s a display error only.\n\nAnd no, this is not intended as a bug report, just an explanation why I think what\u0027s going on here is a bit more complex than just a flag set wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:02:07Z","Content":"Eric S, I think he is referring to the heatshirld not changing the CoM because it adds its mass to its parent part, and that only fairing bases have mass."},{"CreatedByName":"FlexGunship","CreatedById":32705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:49:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have to say that I am a bit disappointed. Over 2 years of playing KSP early access with no bugs that make the game unplayable. Then 1.0 releases and my space physics break entirely. Pods flip 180 on re-entry and spin wildly in space with no input or explanation at all stock. The sad fact for me is that early access was playable. 1.0 release is completely unplayable. Very disappointed. A place I never expected to find myself with KSP.\n\nHonestly, this sounds way over-dramatic. This was the cleanest release I\u0027ve seen. They warned everyone about the new aerodynamics. That\u0027s not a bug, that\u0027s LIKE REAL LIFE! Guess what... re-entering an atmosphere is HARD!

Sadly. But - Aero absolutely now acts more like the real-deal. It *isn\u0027t* the real deal however or you\u0027d find it much more challenging.\n\nBut, much like an actual rocket launch, the ascent is best handled by ensuring you have a positive ascent rate once clear of the pad, and slowly banking in the desired orbital direction in ~5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (degree) increments. Anything more than about 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (degrees) of attack angle (i.e. you stand on the controls to do that ridiculous 45% turn in space at 10km) then you\u0027ll have a bad day.\n\nFolks will have habits that may need to be relearned.
