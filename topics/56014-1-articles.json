When we first went into space, we were hesitant, unsure if it was even possible, and laden with issues surrounding the process. The Kerbals, by contrast, are 100% behind the concept and cannot wait to get into space. They clearly have some good engineering instincts and can adapt rapidly on the fly, but their enthusiasm leads them to want to send manned pods up right away. They\u0027ve always sort of reminded me of little kids playing at going into space in a cardboard box, only instead they have real working rocket parts and the actual means to attain their goal. They start at a different point than we do: not with doubts and cautious advances due to political and social pressures, but with gusto and excitement to find out what lies beyond their atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals are explorers at heart, and nothing holds them back. If you want to imitate human space flight advancement order in KSP, sandbox is the best way to do it, because Kerbals are not human. It makes more sense to role-play as a Kerbal than as a human, as we know exactly what path we go down with the latter. In the former, however, lies endless possibility for excitement and discovery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T20:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is another thread about this, but the basic message is that probes are more complex to operate, especially to a new player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T20:59:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is another thread about this, but the basic message is that probes are more complex to operate, especially to a new player.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.
