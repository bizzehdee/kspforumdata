This was introduced in a patch over 2 years ago. Idea is to help avoid accidental staging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd frankly, this \u0027feature\u0027 is infuriating at times, while having very little real benefit for anyone without major motorical problems with his or her hands - I know it certainly never helped me in the last 2 years of play, while killing a few crafts that could\u0027ve been at least partly recovered. Whenever a craft, launch or operation fails, it\u0027s often time critical to stage as fast as possible, and sometimes also just because you messed up the staging or build a complex craft relying on fast staging. In more common flight, it\u0027s sometimes just plain annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t even get who this is supposed to help. Who accidently presses a button, even moreso one as large as space, 2 times in a row? I managed to tip this post, over 1400 letters, without getting double letters a single time. The easy to make mistake with staging is accidental staging, but that\u0027s pretty much unavoidable as long as the the function has to be 100% ready at all times - and even then, it just doesn\u0027t really matter in the long run, the game plays fine.
