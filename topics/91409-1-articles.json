They\u0027d help with stability on ascent, but I\u0027m concerned they might cause strange issues during landing (for the descent, they would pull CoP in the wrong direction). And for that matter, how are your typical ascents going to be handled? I know the whole \u00222-5 degrees at 60-100 m/s\u0022 thing for Kerbin ascents, but I suspect Duna launches are going to have a sharper gravity turn*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Depending on final engine layout, I suspect I\u0027ll have a starting Duna TWR of 1.8-2.5, which further encourages sharp turns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-27T21:34:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2014 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMarked as answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T18:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Duna treat it as if it has no atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere is so thin that it is really just there for affect. It wont create enough drag to slow down most aircraft, but it will be enough to create some lift at near Kerbin supersonic speeds. Last time I sent a SSTO space plane there was way back in .21 and the landing speed was close to 300m/s which is WAY to fast. I ended up just landing VTOL without to much of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T21:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback. Hopefully this all goes without a hitch, because if stuff goes kaboom, I\u0027m not sure this career mode game will survive the financial hit. The payload ratio is making me wince: about 2.1 tonnes of science payload, which will probably in the end require 1000\u002B tonnes of booster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T21:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you pop \u0027chutes (and in general, you should), the fins will be insignificant in comparison during descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, to be mass optimal, 1 chute is sufficient.
