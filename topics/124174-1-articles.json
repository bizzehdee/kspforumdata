Placing a \u0022training wheel\u0022 near the engines can introduce additional challenges. For one, it just looks ridiculous. Secondly, that wheel can still strike the ground and depending on your speed or terrain, damage your craft or bounce you off-course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy approach is to keep the wheels back as far as possible toward the engine, wing-mount them for a wide stance (floppy wings get strutted first), and use surfaces toward the back of the plane to raise the center of lift and point its vector somewhat downward. While gears under the CoM are always more efficient from a torque perspective, the high and rearward lifting surfaces of my method provide the torque necessary to overcome the inefficiencies of rear-mounted gears. I also mount my wings with an angle of incidence in order to produce additional lift in front of the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of one of my designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SW4MD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cowls over the engines in both designs use airflow to push the back of the plane toward the ground, raising the front of plane earlier than if they weren\u0027t there at all. The thin, leading edge of the wings which extend toward the front of these planes are mounted at an angle of incidence, as described above. All in all, this produces spectacular lift from runways or bumpy terrain with a greatly diminished risk of tail-strikes. The single-engine version shown gets off the runway at 45m/s. Those home-made canards up front don\u0027t even pitch up or down, I only have them there for roll and yaw authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to note is that since I\u0027m wing-mounting, rather than fuselage-mounting, the airplane naturally sits higher in the front than in the back.
