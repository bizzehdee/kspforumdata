For instance, the newer pre-built Kerbal X rocket has 6 liquid fuel boosters with the NCS nose cone (the one with fuel in it). The cones only show up on 5 of the boosters, and if I try and add it to the missing one, it keeps trying to attach sideways. If I flip the part around to the correct orientation, it doesn\u0027t want to \u0027click\u0027 into place, rather tries to embed itself in another part, rather than attach. I\u0027ve also noticed this problem with the advanced nose cone part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd not just on the preloaded craft, I\u0027ve also started one from scratch, so as to not have any existing errors in production, and have run into the same problem where sometimes nose cones (and other pieces) keep trying to attach sideways when they are obviously at the top of the part, and there are no other parts close by that they could be getting confused by and trying to attach to. Either they refuse to attach (correctly anyway) to all the similar parts, or (in the case of a rocket with two boosters) will attach just fine to booster 1, but not 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known problem, and is there a way to fix it, or am I just doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T00:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T05:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can hold the mod key (Alt on Windows) to prevent surface attachment and force node attachment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T05:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, some of the attachment mechanics and the way some of the parts connect were changed.
