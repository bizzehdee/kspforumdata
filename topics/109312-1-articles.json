For instance, the newer pre-built Kerbal X rocket has 6 liquid fuel boosters with the NCS nose cone (the one with fuel in it). The cones only show up on 5 of the boosters, and if I try and add it to the missing one, it keeps trying to attach sideways. If I flip the part around to the correct orientation, it doesn\u0027t want to \u0027click\u0027 into place, rather tries to embed itself in another part, rather than attach. I\u0027ve also noticed this problem with the advanced nose cone part.\n\nAnd not just on the preloaded craft, I\u0027ve also started one from scratch, so as to not have any existing errors in production, and have run into the same problem where sometimes nose cones (and other pieces) keep trying to attach sideways when they are obviously at the top of the part, and there are no other parts close by that they could be getting confused by and trying to attach to. Either they refuse to attach (correctly anyway) to all the similar parts, or (in the case of a rocket with two boosters) will attach just fine to booster 1, but not 2.\n\nIs this a known problem, and is there a way to fix it, or am I just doing something wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T00:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T05:14:42Z","Content":"You can hold the mod key (Alt on Windows) to prevent surface attachment and force node attachment."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T05:30:49Z","Content":"Yes, some of the attachment mechanics and the way some of the parts connect were changed. As DeMatt says, holding ALT will probably help you out. If that doesn\u0027t do it, a quick picture of what you\u0027re trying to do would help us give more specific advice.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T06:19:20Z","Content":"I don\u0027t feel it much while bulding a rocket but i had some fraustrating moments trying to build a plane. I feel like they have changed something wrong. Sometimes the damn part just doesn\u0027t want to connect with the node yet its not like it wants to connect with anything else either.

Sometimes when you can\u0027t attach something you can first attach a small cubic strut, attach the part you want to that and then offset.\n\nAlso the camera angle can affect how they attach. I\u0027ve noticed this while attaching nose cones to radial mounted engines. Lowering the camera angle allows them to attach correctly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-25T18:18:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2018 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CrashyMcCrashFace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-25T22:37:13Z","Content":"This is a pretty old thread and chances are whatever current difficulty you may be seeing is not related to the subject of this thread, so the thread will be closed now. \n\nIn the process, a post or two have been removed.
