Also to set all the panels on a craft to toggle with action group 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060m not sure if action groups on the fly is still a thing but it could be a cool feature for that mod, hmm just did a search and it seems to have fallen by the wayside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone fancy having a go?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T23:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA while back, ozraven wrote a plugin called AutomaticActionGroupModule, which reads off ModuleManager patches to automatically assign/modify/remove action group definitions for new parts in the VAB/SPH scene. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been testing it with my FusTek parts to automatically unassign the IACBM docking ports from the Light action group - the docking ports had built-in lights with electric charge consumption using ModuleLight, but leaving it assigned to the Lights AG would cause major lag when a user wants to illuminate other areas of a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe hasn\u0027t officially released it since it was still highly experimental at the time, but here\u0027s the link in case you want to try it out.
