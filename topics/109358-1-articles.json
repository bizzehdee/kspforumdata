But 1.0.2 doesn\u0027t love me. So I made a shuttle instead.\n\n**ZRC - Krueger**.\n\nIndeed, ZRC^(1)^ has built a three-staged shuttle. The name was chosen because it\u0027s phonetically similar to \u0022Crewer\u0022 which is basically its function, to transfer crew. It\u0027s also the same as in Freddy Krueger due to its capability to chop your Kerbals really bad if things go awry. It carries up to 6 kerbals (pilots included). It\u0027s deadly easy to fly it to LKO (as long as your pilot has Track Prograde available) and ends up there with 700 m/s of spare deltaV. It costs 70K funds, of which 30K belong to the spaceplane and can, thus, return back.\n\nNo mods needed.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If you need more, you can set it up to 90 by tweaking the ammount in the inline docking port. Just remember to lock it at launch so you can use the Vernors without loosing monopropellant and unlock it when you need to dock.\n\n**Note:** The top orange fuel tank is at 80% of its capacity. You can increase it for more deltaV but launches will become more difficult. Your choice.\n\nDOWNLOAD: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3oz5b269fpdh8i/ZRC%20-%20Krueger.craft?dl=0).\n\n(1)ZRC is the non-existant civilian division of ZRM^(2)^.\n\n(2)ZRM is my non-existant military corporation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T14:20:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Uzric**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:46:25Z","Content":"HAHA Cute ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Gonna try this out ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Uzric","CreatedById":102098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:20:58Z","Content":"Little update: simplified action groups."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:40:20Z","Content":"Nice!
