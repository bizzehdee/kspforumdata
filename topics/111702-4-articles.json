You need do nothing (except install the mod) and your fairings will clamshell by default.\n\nI don\u0027t know if it will work on ships you already built, though. Those may keep the confetti fairings as that\u0027s how they were set when built."},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T22:58:26Z","Content":"I love how you call them confetti.

While it\u0027s unfortunate Squad didn\u0027t include an option for clamshell, the current stock implementation of fairings is *totally* kerbal, and it seems most of the community has gotten a bit too serious about the game to accept this ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"bb-pio","CreatedById":145405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:59:32Z","Content":"Thank you for this mod!
