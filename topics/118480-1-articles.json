I attached it to the \u0022not yet mined\u0022 Class E and with only 300 delta V, I decided to add a second \u0022booster\u0022 section with the Mk3 10,000u rocket fuel tank and 2 LV-A engines, and I got 980 delta v. I needed at least 2800dv to get to Jool, and even more then that to orbit around Pol (Jool moon with highest orbit). Note that I would have gotten more DV if i got to the point where I would de-couple my 10000u empty fuel tank. I saved and decided to try it out anyways to see how everything preformed.

My craft would sway quite a bit, increasing even more as the 10,000 rear fuel tank emptied. I used a total of 4 large SAS units to help, but they didnt help that well. Maybe place more of them at the end of my craft? 3 were in the middle of the final craft (see pictures) and one at the end of the 10000u fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I need to move the weight closer to the asteroid, yet increase the total weight of the craft. The best way I can think of to do this is with multiple launches and making it in stages, probably more then the 2 I used previously.. I would also have to make sure what ever I assemble wont be too big and encompassing, as you all know we cant place struts once in space (though that would be awesome if engineers could do that) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is to get it to Pol, but originally before I even saw the mission, I\u0027d been wanting to take a Class E and attach it to my space station orbiting Jool. The way this went in my head, I could then have a large supply of fuel there without having to launch many expensive re-fueling missions; this is seeming less and less possible after realizing how much effort it is to control and move these objects, but if there is anyway to move the thing there--with enough ore left inside it to keep my space station happy--im very down to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a lot of trouble visualizing it all..

My experience is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheel does nothing. You need to constantly adjust claw pivot, and use engine thrust to gain torque.

You probably need to rethink about the design there. Usually with a drilling base, fuel tanker (to move around fuel), and orbital station, it\u0027s self sufficient in terms of fuel - after the infra is set up, you don\u0027t launch something new to refuel.
