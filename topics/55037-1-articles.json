(I\u0027ve actually only done this for Duna and Laythe landers; the Duna one was all-stock, nuclear-powered, and had four RT-10s; the Laythe one used three RT-10 boosters and the HOME radial aerospikes for the first stage, then an LV-909 for the second stage). So what I\u0027m wondering is: is this actually effective? Has anyone else done this? Does the quicker, easier ascent outweigh the weight costs of toting several solid-rocket boosters hundreds of thousands of kilometers and the difficulties incurred in landing them safely, or would I be better off just going with liquid boosters or a bigger lander?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T03:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEeeerrrrrr... well I could only guess and I am not pretty good when it comes to crunching the Numbers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in my opinion the SRB\u0027s are only a cheap way (If Money will be implemented) to get some additional thrust on take off at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont really use them anymore because Liquid Fuel Engines are much more efficient and controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides this, feel free to do what you want. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaFish","CreatedById":68386,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T03:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that this is definitely an interesting possibility!
