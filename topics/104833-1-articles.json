Great. Ker-dames? Necessary. Resources? Finally. Now the most important thing for me on Monday is to go to the map and see that Eeloo is not there anymore. Because it is in orbit around an as yet undiscovered planet where it belongs. And maybe there\u0027s even more beyond. With resources, an outer system is all the more doable now. I don\u0027t care how long it takes to get there.\n\nWho\u0027s bloody with me?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T10:07:11Z","Content":"Me.

I feel bad about sending crew on 20 year journeys xD\n\nPersonally I\u0027d prefer another terrestrial world, just inside or outside Kerbin\u0027s orbit, either desert or tundra, with a bit of vegetation. Something like the old sci-fi visions of Venus as a jungle world, or Mars as a covered in red vegetation and rivers. Might mean nudging Duna or Eve around, but would be nice to have somewhere nearby that spaceplanes would be viable on ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) No reason it couldn\u0027t have a couple of moons of its own either.\n\nBut I wouldn\u0027t blame the devs for deciding they want the stock game to be lightweight. For now I\u0027ll pin my hopes on Kopernicus being updated for 1.0 fairly quickly, so\u0027s modders can add this sort of thing for those who want it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T11:04:15Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think Squad\u0027s going to do this... they\u0027d have to spend a massive amount of work on it to make people stop calling them out on a \u0022half-assed ripoff of [Outer Planets Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-0-90-Outer-Planets-Mod-%281-6-5%29-We-need-help-writing-science-blurbs-for-Urlum-s-moons!-29-Mar)\u0022 (regardless of how dumb that statement would be).\n\nMaking new celestial bodies takes a lot of work. Way too much work to not advertise with the feature. Yeah, you can get by with not mentioning little things like new UI elements or the like... but a new gas giant with multiple moons? That\u0027s a headline feature for an entire patch, not a last minute snuck-it-in surprise!"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T11:14:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because it is in orbit around an as yet undiscovered planet where it belongs.

They could hire the dev like they\u0027ve done in the past with other mods.\n\nMaybe we don\u0027t need two ice giants though, one would be enough.\n\nEither way, I\u0027m sure this is something they\u0027ll look into post 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:04:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If any new planets are added, I hope there is something Eeloo like beyond, because an iceball in an eccentric orbit \\*does\\* belong there.\n\nAgree 100%.
