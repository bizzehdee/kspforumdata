The mass profile suggests the ram intake is better for orbital maneuvering.\n\nI suspect the differences come out in the wash. The most significant drag barrier for space planes is transonic. Once you pass that, more streamlining others minimal velocity gains; flight profile is more important. OTOH the mass difference will only come out to 1% dV difference in the worst scenario. Landing fuel probably has a bigger impact on OMS capability.\n\nFor a LKO limited space plane, the shock cones are a no brainer. For an interplanetary space plane, it depends on how often you plan to visit atmospheric worlds.
