Surface of a sphere is a 2d manifold that can be embedded in 3d space. Locally, it behaves like a 2d surface, but if you want to picture it as a complete shape in flat space, you need at least one extra dimension.\u003Cp\u003EGR space-time is a 4d manifold. Some special cases can be embedded. You might have seen a picture of a funnel that represents curvature of space around a black hole. Of course, these representations are somewhat limited, since it is hard for us to picture more than 3 dimensions at the same time. But they exist, nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, an interesting result in GR is that a general solution to Einstein\u0027s Field Equations cannot be embedded. In other words, for any finite number of dimensions, there exists a mass arrangement that results in a space-time shape that cannot fit into that number of dimensions. Therefore, our space-time is not embedded. If it was, there would be significant and measureable differences in how gravity works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of can. As mentioned above, ebedding is not an option. Some flavors of String Theory work with a bulk, but they also make predictions that do not pan out based on it. So bulk seems unlikely. Locally, topology is fixed, so there cannot be a connection to an outside of any sort. That leaves edges, but we observe a very uniform universe. So unless we are dead center of a huge, much larger than observable, but still finite universe, it does not look good for edges either. If you have some other definition of outside, please, bring it forward. As it is, I can claim lack of outside as a scientific fact.

And you may point out that someone better informed in the future could make a better conclusion than what we have. But for now, we have no evidence about the existence of the \u0027outside\u0027 of the universe. While absence of evidence may not mean evidence of absence, in this case, the existence (or lack thereof) of another universe have little visible effect on the workings and mechanisms of our universe, at least as far as one can predict from here, so it is convenient to simplify the hypothesis by stating that there are no other universes out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
