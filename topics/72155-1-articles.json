I think this is a false argument: why not simply have difficulty settings? Then everyone could get what they want out of the game. This is basically what people are doing already with mods: tuning the game to the difficulty they want, but then why should squad make life-support, different fuel types, etc, and not instead simply direct players to use the mods? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/rott_difficulty_easy_3904.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rott_difficulty_easy_3904.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T12:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, KSP have those buried in the settings.cfg, but is only for toggle crew perma-kill and allow stock craft in career.

IMO life support doesn\u0027t need that sort of treatment, maybe just a toggle on/off per save. When the rest of the economics are put into the game we could see difficulties based on how much of anything you start with/the rate at which you acrue it (although that would be better named \u0022grind level\u0022 to be sure).\u003Cbr\u003EOn a side note, when/if the aerdynamic model gets overhauled, that is something I believe should be enabled for everyone all the time since the current one is unbelievably crappy. A better aero model will be more intuitive for new players because it will encourage familiar, realistic rocket and airplane design.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
