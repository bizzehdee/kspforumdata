As a microphone you could choose the Zalman Mic 1, if you can get it, its very cheap (about 6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC) and offers decent quality, it can be attached to headphones by cliping it to the cable. Buying sperate headphones offers better performance per money, since most headsets are designated for gamers who choose for design and bright LEDs, not audiophiles who know more about sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T04:20:56Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Kerbart\u0027]The Astro A40 is pretty nice.
