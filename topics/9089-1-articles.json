With each big content patch, that will attract a chunk of people at a time. With each Youtube sensation that throws light on the game, that will attract another big chunk of people. I have faith that Squad will stay strong through the hardships of early development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything this helps you become aware of how perilous development can be.

But you shouldn\\\u0027t worry. KSP is a class upon itself and stands to become a name for many to remember. I aim to be here for the long run.
