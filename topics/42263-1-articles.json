So far I\u0027ve only spent a few hours and have done a few simple flights. But I love the building approach and the user interface for space maneuvers. I\u0027m impressed with KSP so far, and it looks like there is much more to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI live in Massachusetts and in real life I\u0027m an optical engineer working for an engineering software company. I\u0027m also a singer-songwriter and a sadly inactive private pilot. Space-wise, I\u0027m a JPL Solar System Ambassador (volunteer educational outreach program, not a NASA or JPL employee), but also sadly, I have not done any school programs in a couple of years. I love space and astronomy, and in 2005 I discovered a certain other space flight simulator whose name begins with O... I liked it so much I wrote a book about it called \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aovi93.dsl.pipex.com/play_in_space.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGo Play In Space\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 (and for any that care, sorry that I never finished the third edition for the 2010 version). The original idea for that free e-book was to teach myself the whole simulated space flight thing. It was fun and useful for that, and I hope it has helped some others too. For all that, I know I still have a lot to learn about space flight, and I\u0027m looking forward to being a KSP beginner. I like learning (and re-learning) stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a blog where I write about space, music, books, and what-not, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flyingsinger.blogspot.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMusic of the Spheres\u003C/a\u003E.

I\u0027m new here myself, but for all the time I\u0027ve spent playing KSP, I\u0027ve concentrated on things planetside or in orbit. I expect that in the near future I will venture to the moons and planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T15:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
