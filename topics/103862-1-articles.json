The ones that make you stop.\u003Cp\u003EThe power output of a generator comes directly from the the kinetic energy that keeps the generator moving. If you take energy out of the system, you have to put that much energy back in to keep the system going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe coils in orbit will be constantly breaking and trying to stop. Any power you put into getting it moving will be at least (actually more that due to imperfect efficiency.) as much as what was generated. You might as well connect this kinetic energy source directly to a generator on earth and save a bunch of steps and power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny question about sources of power MUST ABSOLUTELY start with where this kinetic energy comes from. The coils in the generator are part of the step after the next step. (The next step is the transmission to the generator.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone fails to understand your point, especially after the \u003Cem\u003Ethird\u003C/em\u003E time you exlained it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E We are just having a little fun with impossible ideas, is all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T22:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that we should call our energy generators \u0022energy harvesters\u0022 because that is what we are doing.
