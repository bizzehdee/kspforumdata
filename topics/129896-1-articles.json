The part is similar to the delta-deluxe winglet in that it has a built-in control surface, which I attempted to do by having the control surface as a separate mesh which I assigned the module to. It is mostly working, but it rotates around the wrong axis. I tried re-orienting it in Unity, and it didn\u0027t change, and I tried re-doing the axes in blender but it didn\u0027t carry over into Unity. How can I make the control surface rotate about the correct axis?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T03:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond post in this thread has a picture \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/44531-control-surfaces/#post626740\u0022\u003EControl surfaces?\u003C/a\u003E that I found helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T15:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl surface transform rotates around its PARENT\u0027s X-axis (and appears to ignore its own rotation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreate an empty at the postiion of where your flap should rotate.\u00A0 Rotate that empty so that x\u002B points along the hinge of the flap.\u00A0 Reparent your flap to this empty transform.\u00A0 The trasformName in your config file should be the name of the flap - NOT the name of the empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently ran into this myself while prototyping some parts and it took a few days to figure out what was going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T16:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan confirm it rotates around X axis. The angle you defined in the cfg how much the control surface can extend out is added to the the current X orientation, so you\u0027ll maybe need to add another empty and set the control surface as a child of it in order to rotate properly.
