The only thing\u0027s we\u0027ve seen as far as mobile phones go are x86 processors and ARM processors...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a middle ground is what we could really put to good use. However, processors like the Tegra 3 \u0026amp; 4, in my opinion, show an entirely new concept: High-power cores to do the heavy lifting, paired with a more basic low-power core to do things like play music.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
