Skinned mesh is a thing that unity applied automatically to cylinders so I don\u0027t know at the moment why it\u0027s not normal mesh (since animation changes only their rotation and location). It might possibly cause another bug with docking ports, I\u0027ll investigate it tomorrow."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:26:15Z","Content":"I suspect that\u0027s there in error, in that case. FYI, the tracks use skinned mesh for the deformation as the suspension moves. Plain old animated objects won\u0027t need it, so try removing it and replace with standard mesh renderer.\n\nSkinned meshes are normally used in character animation binding a mesh to bones, They can be a great tool if you want to model things like deformable pipes or something similar that you can\u0027t animate with rotations and transforms, but there\u0027s a bit of an art to setting them up just so."},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T12:53:25Z","Content":"update, I did some testing and I think there are no bugs with docking ports.\n\nI tried to move origin of parts but it didn\u0027t change anything. Maybe because skinned mesh area is set arbitrarily by unity and is quite big compared to elements themselves.\n\nFrom what I gathered Unity applies skinned mesh automatically to every element that is parented to a bone in blender.\n\n[http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/371776/blender-to-unity-faulty-skinned-mesh-renderer.html](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/371776/blender-to-unity-faulty-skinned-mesh-renderer.html)\n\nI tried replacing skinned mesh with normal ones in Unity but that caused element to disappear in unity and errors in KSP.\n\nWORKING SOLUTION:\n\n- don\u0027t parent elements to bones in blender\n\n- export to unity\n\n- parent elements to bones in unity\n\nIn this way unity won\u0027t apply skinned mesh renderer and you could avoid \u0027headache\u0027 associated with it (disappearing elements with zooming in so you have to tick \u0027update when offscreen\u0027). In this way I think you can reduce a bit of CPU overhead as well."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T17:47:34Z","Content":"Yeah, it will apply skinned mesh to objects with bones.
