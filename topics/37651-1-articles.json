I\u0027m curious if this has been a group endeavor or who is designing the campaign? Will this at some point be integrated into the game design? How do I go about posting issues that I\u0027ve had with the campaign where I feel it doesn\u0027t work well as an introduction to new players (for instance, the last K2 mission of the Age of Rockets campaign is VERY difficult for a new player - particularly given the constraint of not using SAS - that 2nd stage is very top heavy with an Mk-16 on top of it and almost impossible to maneuver - perhaps the campaign doesn\u0027t mean \u0022 you can\u0027t use SAS\u0022 perhaps it means, \u0022you can\u0027t install an SAS module\u0022 but you can use the SAS that is a default part of control pods).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T03:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI drafted the initial series.
