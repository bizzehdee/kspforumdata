Both of these are a function of air speed and air density. The best glide speed is usually equal to the airplane\u0027s V\u003Csub\u003EY\u003C/sub\u003E speed, which also gives best rate of climb. So if you are trying to land an airplane unpowered, you shoot for V\u003Csub\u003EY\u003C/sub\u003E. Airplanes with good glide ratio are relatively easy to land with no engines. A typical light airplane will have a glide ratio in the 8-10 range and unpowered landing is often part of standard training. High performance gliders can have glide ratio of over 60. These can stay in the air pretty much indefinitely with a good pilot, thanks to thermals. An airliner, typically, has much lower glide ratio. A 777, as an extreme case, has a glide ratio of only 4. (Actually, a 777 has a glide ratio of almost 10 at cruise altitude, but that\u0027s due to it being designed for flight at low density and high speeds. At low altitudes, it\u0027s only marginally better than a brick.) A wing suit has glide ratio of about 2.5-3. Helicopter in auto-rotation is also about 3, but helicopter can flare a lot better than an airplane can due to energy stored in the rotor, so they can do a soft landing unpowered, despite being very bad at \u0022gliding\u0022. A 777 with all four engines dead is typically considered incapable of unpowered landing. It needs at least 1 engine running. Though, under ideal conditions, a survivable landing is possible with that glide ratio.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA typical airliner, 777 included, has a much better glide ratio then light aircraft - over 15 generally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlide ratio is constant as long as the aircraft is properly trimmed for gliding - it does not change as a function of altitude, it only varies as a function of angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for powered aircraft, best l/d always occurs below Vy, the only time the two values equal to each other is at the absolute ceiling of the aircraft - where climb rate equals zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, a 777 has only 2 engines under the best of circumstances! And the ability to glide to a landing has less to do with an aircrafts glide ratio and much more to do with its overall energy state - the space shuttle lands unpowered just fine even with its horrible glide ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T06:41:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 06:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mrfox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T06:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esome fighter jets cannot glide very well... like that F-117 one...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokker","CreatedById":15359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T07:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esome fighter jets cannot glide very well... like that F-117 one...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlide well, no, glide, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T07:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThAnks for the answers guys!
