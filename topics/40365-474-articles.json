Just don\u0027t want to post it without testing first. It should set everything to RF standards, and change everything in the configs that RealFuels doesnt handle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I wanted to support Tweakscale; with 60\u002B mods, my parts menu is VERY cluttered as-is with LSPI-Lite and over 50 parts disabled or removed. Also, a general note on Tweakscale and mass scaling: I thought realistic tank scaling was non-linear at one point myself. Turns out, this isnt the case. All tanks for space craft are actually pressure vessels, even when the contents are just at STP. Space is a vacuum, thus unless the fuel is at like 1/100th STP, it\u0027s going to scale more or less linearly because the tank\u0027s pressure increases with it\u0027s size. Strictly linearly in the case of highly pressurized gasses like Xenon and Argon whose tanks can\u0027t be built larger than a fixed size practically. The only real factors in tank weight that may not be linear are things like outer shells and structural elements. The tanks themselves are mostly linear, and at a certain point, all tanks become linear because we do not have the material structural integrity to build larger tanks, and instead tanks must simply be duplicated for more volume. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Fractal_UK \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you considered collaborating with NathanKell\u0027s efforts for AJE/RealHeat? AJE handles jet engines brilliantly, matching realism better than I thought possible myself. While RealHeat is in it\u0027s infancy, it could be the answer to your efforts to manage thermal energy realistically, as it wont use KSP\u0027s \u0022pump\u0022 system, but instead uses a custom system based on physical properties. I think you and Kell have a lot of similar goals; the only difference is your mod pushes into the theoretical. But your emphasis on realism is the same none the less. In fact, I would highly suggest utilizing mods like RealFuels, AJE, and so forth so you no longer have to implement so many things in KSPI. The best part about realism is that IRL, there\u0027s ultimately only one way things work. There\u0027s only one STP desnity of LiquidOxygen. The various reactors and materials have piles and piles of data. 100 degrees kelvin is always 100 degrees kelvin. The only things that the topic can contain that lead to disagreement are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) how deep the realism goes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) which data set is used (typically resulting in something like a 1-10% variance) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) semantics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data set used typically just doesn\u0027t matter, long as the data was acquired with decent control and scientific rigor. Semantics are just that: semantics. In English I call the rose \u0027Red\u0027. In Japanese I call it \u0027Akaii\u0027. In Greek I might call it \u0027Kokino\u0027. Because computers demand we all speak the same language, we have to pick one word for everything that is the same. If we mean H2O at STP, then there should be only one term for it, and everything that uses H2O at STP refers to the same definition. I\u0027ve standardized everything to RealFuels currently in my configs, mostly because the mod has more realistic chemicals which are based on scientific data than any other mod. Far as I am concerned it\u0027s the realism standard currently. The only other notation I would support would be scientific standards of some kind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, many other mods around the forums offer their models under open licenses; You could use them as a base or final models.
