I\u0027m unable to upload screenshots, so I\u0027ll do my best to explain the situation in detail. The two vessels are pretty much exactly the same, with a lab above a fuel tank of the same size as the lab, and a poodle engine below that. Each one also has three docking ports put up with symmetry around the mid-point of the lab with one of these three docking ports occupied by a Mk1 lander can that was originally positioned on top of the vessel, before being decoupled and shifted to the side.\n\nNow, here\u0027s where I believe I began screwing up: On one, I placed the RCS jets only around the lander can. On the other, I placed them around the lander can, and the lab, but not the fuel tank. So neither one has perfect translation. On top of this, when I shifted the lander can from the top to the side on the first ship (the one with jets only around the can) I also chose to \u0022control from here\u0022 on a docking port, so now the navball is all insane, and, without a docking port on top of the ship, I can\u0027t reorient it correctly.\n\nThese two are going to be the base for a huge ship, so I really need them to be docked with their engines pointed the correct way, and I\u0027ve managed to get them in just about perfectly synchronized orbits within 10m of each other, but I can\u0027t get them in parallel orientations, and, even if I\u0027m close, when I try to translate, they rotate. What can I do?\n\nAlso, in case it\u0027s useful, this is a career mode game, I\u0027m about halfway up the tech tree, and I have the following mods: KAS, KIS, KW Rocketry, Ferram, Infernal Robotics, Chatterer, MechJeb (There is a MechJeb module on each ship).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T18:56:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rithaniel**\n  \nA solution was found."},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T16:55:30Z","Content":"Easiest solution would be to ask MJ to do the job for you this time and then go back to the VAB to design a new project incorporating what you learnt.\n\nTo overcome the navball frenzy add a \u0022friendly\u0022 pod in a reachable place to set it as the control part whenever needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Rithaniel","CreatedById":146402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T17:02:51Z","Content":"I plan to have future additions to this ship to include forward-facing docking ports to fix the navball issue, so that\u0027s not a long-term issue.

If it has been mentioned, apologies for the redundancy) is the fact that obital time acceleration changes how physics are applied. Most notably, it makes each ship a stable and solid body. Any bending, spinning, rotation, vibration, porpoising, etc. will be killed off if time acceleration is applied even for the briefest instant. Some might consider exploiting this aspect as cheesing. But it might help you manage alignment by stoppung unwanted rotation. Otherwise, all I can suggest is trying to manage all 6 degrees of freedom with hands on wasdqe and ijklhn. It\u0027s difficult but as long the undesired rotation isn\u0027t too severe, you should be able to counter rotate against (wasd) it as it is induced by your translational control (ijkl) input.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:43:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**\n  \nTypos for days"}]}
