First you need to survive EDL. I would propose some form of two stage re-entry using lifting guidance like the techniques employed by Apollo and Curiosity. This give pinpoint landing accuracy for picking the most hospitable locations on the surface which would be prescouted using probes. This probes would also test techniques for withstanding the surface pressure and harsh environment. Parachutes would give easily enough drag to allow an unpowered descent.\u003Cp\u003ESecond is craft design. I would suggest a Bathysphere type design. Good for re-entry (proved by soyuz) withstands pressure well. Allows for a minimal number of facets for acid to cause trouble at. The only blemishes would be for extending legs, and the engine. A single airlock allows egress (more on this later). Comms would be established via a small ruggedized plastic balloon that would carry a wire aloft beyond the worst of the atmosphere. A rover could fold out from the lower regions of the sphere for extra mobility. The sphere would be large with two floors and an engineering section (containing three chemical rockets and a nerva that runs on gas extracted from the atmosphere during Venus Ascent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVAing would be less like wearing a spacesuit and more like donning a turn of the century diving suit. It will be very heavy. Maybe the exoskeleton could contain some servos to aid the astronaut?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower would be supplied by the on board reactor that also runs the NERVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stay would be short and after takeoff the craft would use a Mercury gravity assist to slingshot back to Earth, with a travel time of not more than 300 days. This limits radiation exposure. Th Bathysphere design inherently offers a fair amount of radiation protection due to the structural elements necessary for the atmospheric pressure on Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupplies would be freeze dried and stored maybe a small supplementary hydroponics lab but Venus is not going to permit any kind of inflatable habitat for growing food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?

For starters we could just try a one way trip. The astronaut(s) would work on the surface until supplies ran out and then painlessly commit suicide.

Reactors on Earth all use water to cool them, but that\u0027s not available in space.

These diving suits are like wearable submarines. Plus they\u0027ll need to be even heavier to add insulation and refrigeration equipment...and a powered exoskeleton to move the damn thing. It would be like a little human-shaped tank. Not really what I\u0027d call an EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut maybe you could have a bell-shaped chamber on the bottom of your lander that makes a tight seal to the ground (maybe because it has an alloy around the rim that softens enough at 735K)... Place this against a flat area of the surface and start pumping the Venus air out of it. Venus\u0027 atmospheric pressure would mash it down powerfully to the surface by the time you pump out the Venus air and pump in some cool oxygem-helium mix at a lower pressure. Then you can open up the top airlock and stand on the surface of Venus naked if you wear insulated booties. But a cooling suit would be advised. Pick up some rocks, drill a sample, plant a flag, pee on the dirt, whatever.
