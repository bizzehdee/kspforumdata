Success has been more or less inversely proportional to mass. Oddly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not a status quo I was happy to let slide, so I\u0027ve been experimenting with small purely atmospheric planes and having some success. But I have questions for you aerodynamic wizards out there. For reference, the craft I\u0027ve been playing with are in the album below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027ll see from the twin-engine plane that the engines are very low relative to the CoM. This causes \u003Cem\u003Eabsolutely no problem at all!\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ve tried them fully on top of the wing, fully beneath the wing and some different embedded setups, makes no difference. What\u0027s that about??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On the other hand, the height of the CoL relative to the CoM makes a big difference but in the opposite direction to what I would expect. Every plane design runs into the \u0027lawn dart\u0027 concept at some point, whereby the CoL tries to align itself directly behind the CoM relative to the direction of travel. With that in mind, I would expect a plane with high CoL to be trying to pitch up the whole time, and vice versa. In practice, I find the opposite to be true and the balance very sensitive. Why??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Anhedral and dihedral angle and high or low wing don\u0027t actually seem to have a very dramatic effect on roll stability. They do however seem to have a massive effect on pitch as per question 2. That is to say, in order to make a dramatic change to roll, pitch will be made totally uncontrollable. In which case, does the angle of the wing really matter??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Yaw control escapes me completely. Example, true for both single and twin designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei. apply starboard yaw input\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eii. vessel behaves as though fixed through an axis from cockpit roof to rudder tip, with force applied to port at rudder base\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiii. dramatic roll to starboard around this axis, involving a slight pitch drop and smaller yaw to starboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried bigger and smaller rudder, bigger and smaller vertical fin, vertical elements on the wingtips, vertical elements on the tail horizontals. So far nothing has worked at all.

There\u0027s just not enough thrust - replace the props with say, aerospikes, and you\u0027ll notice a difference. One spaceplane I made used RAPIERs that were very slightly below the CoM (it had the forward cockpit section radially mounted to the top). Worked fine in atmo and all the way to the top of the flight envelope. Switched to rocket mode and fwoomp, it flipped up and around and I was facing backwards before I had a chance to stop it. I learnt that day that angling engines is a viable tactic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T05:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Engines low will tend to pitch the nose up when more thrust is applied, engines high tend to pitch it down. As Obsessed says, the horizontal stabiliser will control this. If you fly without SAS you\u0027ll notice you need to change pitch trim as you change power, but then you sort of need to do that \u003Cem\u003Eanyway\u003C/em\u003E because changing power means you need to change AoA to maintain level flight. If you fly with SAS you might not even notice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I\u0027m not sure about this. If the wing is low that in theory will make the plane less stable in pitch, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a big effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) For me a slight dihedral does help roll stability. Usually I use the rotate gizmo with angle snap, then hold down shift for 5 degree increments.
