I\u0027ve recently stumbled on something regarding the propulsive efficiency in rocket engines in regards to energy utilization and the Oberth effect. I understand how the effect works. The thing that confuses me, though, is how propulsive efficiency is capped. The equation I\u0027ve seen is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/3/b23be54f294caba9d5ec6f24eb804fba.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b23be54f294caba9d5ec6f24eb804fba.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith c as exhaust speed, and v is speed of the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this equation, efficiency caps out (at 1.0) when v = c, and then starts decreasing, but this doesn\u0027t make sense to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a static firing of the engine, where the craft doesn\u0027t move, all of the (non-wasted) energy from combustion is imparted on the exhaust shooting out the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the craft is moving at half the exhaust velocity, all of the energy is given to the craft. As an example, say exhaust velocity is 100m/s. The craft is moving 50 m/s. The reaction mass changes from moving 50m/s with the craft to 50m/s away in the opposite direction, thus its kinetic energy hasn\u0027t changed, so all of the produced energy is with the craft. Why this turns out to be 0.8 all the time, I\u0027m not sure... I\u0027d think the value would depend on the specific chemical energy of the propellant being used, but anyway that\u0027s not as important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the craft is moving at the same speed as the exhaust velocity, not only is it getting all the energy of combustion, but it\u0027s also stealing all of the kinetic energy of the exhaust, which will have a velocity of 0. With the 100m/s example, that\u0027s an extra gain of 5kJ/kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it seems to me the efficiency should continue to climb as the craft gets faster. Say it is moving 200 m/s. The exhaust will be moving 100m/s in the same direction after leaving the craft. It\u0027s specific kinetic energy would go from 20 kJ/kg down to 5 kJ/kg, a difference of 15 kJ/kg, 3 times more than in the above situation. So why doesn\u0027t this translate into even greater propulsive efficiency for the spacecraft? According to that equation, the 2:1 velocity to exhaust velocity ratio has the same 0.8 efficiency as the 1:2 ratio (with 1:1 being 1.0 efficiency). Anyone able to explain this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T08:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat equation describes how much energy of the propellant ends up in the vehicle.

I was originally envisioning it as what fraction of the chemical potential energy in the propellant only. But now I realize it is a combination of that and the kinetic energy. Clearly when moving faster than the exhaust velocity, some of the kinetic energy will be left behind in the exhaust, with no way to recover it, thus the reduced efficiency. I also realized why the value is 0.8 at both 1/2 and 2x exhaust velocity. At 1/2 speed, the propellant has 4x more chemical potential energy than kinetic energy, and you can obtain all of the chemical energy on the craft, but none of the kinetic. At 2x speed, you can get 3/4 of the kinetic (which is 4x the chemical) energy and all of the chemical, so in both cases you get 80% of the total energy involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t read through your equations in detail, but I\u0027m assuming they more precisely explained the concepts I just summarized.
