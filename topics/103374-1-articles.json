But they have a downside : they can\u0027t travel across the ocean...or can they !\n\nYour Goal :\n\nYour goal in this challenge is to manage to make a train cross the ocean next to the KSC, as shown on this picture.\n\n![Cbd8wqo.png](http://i.imgur.com/Cbd8wqo.png)\n\nHow to do it?\n\nThere is two main ways to do it :\n\n-You can make your train a boat, and cross the ocean with your train-boat \n\n-You can make your train a plane, and cross the ocean by going above it (I recommand this one if you want to be at the top of the leaderboards)\n\nBoth ways are accepted\n\nNote that you CAN\u0027T go to the other side of the ocean like this :\n\n![XPZZVqd.png](http://i.imgur.com/XPZZVqd.png)\n\nYou MUST cross the ocean\n\nRemember, post screenshots/videos to detail your trip. If you don\u0027t post screenshots/videos, your submission won\u0027t be accepted.\n\nLevels :\n\nLEVEL 1 :\n\nCross the ocean and land on the other side. Your train must hold at least 10 kerbals (I recommend to have much more to get a good score).\n\nLEVEL 2 :\n\nCross the ocean and go back to the KSC (KSC=The light green square the buildings are located on). Your train must hold at least 12 kerbals.\n\nJEBEDIAH LEVEL :\n\nLike Level 2, but you have to do it twice. Your train must hold at least 15 kerbals.\n\nScoring System :\n\nThe scoring system is simple : the faster you cross the sea, the higher you are in the leaderboard! Note that each level of difficulty have their own leaderboard. \n\nEach extra kerbal above the minimum amount will remove 10 seconds from your time.\n\nLeaderboards (Negative scores ARE possible) :\n\nLEVEL 1 :\n\n-Juzeris : -30:00\n\nLEVEL 2 :\n\n-None for now\n\nJEBEDIAH LEVEL :\n\n-None for now\n\nRules :\n\n-The core of your train must be \u0022trainey\u0022.\n\n-NO CHEATING (This means no debug screen and no hyperedit).\n\n-You can hack funds, reputation and science if you are in Career mode.\n\n-The train have to come back intact.\n\nAllowed Mods :\n\n-Realism Mods\n\n-Near Future Mod Family\n\n-Station Parts Expansion\n\n-KAS\n\n-Kerbal Foundries (EXEPT THE HOVER WHEELS)\n\n-MechJeb\n\n-Kerbal Join Renforcer\n\n-Throttle Control Avionic\n\nBadge :\n\nIf you manage to beat this challenge, you can have this badge :\n\n![W6zYq21.png](http://i.imgur.com/W6zYq21.png)\n\nTo add it to your signature, copy and paste this (add a \u0022/\u0022 at the end, like this  ):\n\n https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114757-The-Trans-Kontinental-Train-Challenge!?p=1820619#post1820619[!\\[%7Boption%7D\\](%7Boption%7D)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114757-The-Trans-Kontinental-Train-Challenge!?p=1820619#post1820619)http://i.imgur.com/W6zYq21.png[http://i.imgur.com/W6zYq21.png](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114757-The-Trans-Kontinental-Train-Challenge!?p=1820619#post1820619)[!\\[%7Boption%7D\\](%7Boption%7D)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114757-The-Trans-Kontinental-Train-Challenge!?p=1820619#post1820619)https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114757-The-Trans-Kontinental-Train-Challenge!?p=1820619#post1820619\n\n%7Boption%7D[GOOD LUCK!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114757-The-Trans-Kontinental-Train-Challenge!?p=1820619#post1820619)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T08:48:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Elowiny**"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T15:33:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m In!
