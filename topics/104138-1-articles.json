For those that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know, the airflow through jet engines (and thus fuel flow, and thus thrust) is now a function of mach and of air density giving them more interesting limitations and effects.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;The week started with the demo and ended with tutorials again.

Difficulty sliders make sense for the \u0022game\u0022 elements, such as Money and Science and Rep. But should we really be able to change the laws of physics? That would be like having a slider to make engines more efficient or even change the gravity of Kerbin, not good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, would you rather have a slider to turn off the reentry heat if you didn\u0027t want to deal with it for whatever reason or be forced to use a mod to turn that off?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T21:45:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T21:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice.
