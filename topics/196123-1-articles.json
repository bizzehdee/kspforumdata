Could we make massive ships that keep their stuff clean in the boat for cross country shipments of food and other goods. this could have redundancy in the boat and at port and all stages of transit. Or is the electrical cost too high?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other idea is then to use the cold plasma to convert water and air into fuel and then use that to fuel the boat and or generate electricity.. Or minimize fuel/electricity. How far could this be taken. Could current boats be equipped to use it to keep food corona free? How much energy does it take to generate this and what designs could be made. What is the maximum that could be done? This could include other things along the way to help make it efficient. For instance are MHD generators useful with cold plasma? One idea is you could put them on the nozzles actually used to prep the food or along other areas of flow to generate electricity or other things. You could keep it magnetized to the boat or to various structures and even use the boat as a giant field or something weird. Maybe go to automated boats and get rid of crews. Or have crews go on a side boat or tug like boat that helps at port and not on the actual ship. It could have remote overrides and stuff. No idea. Just coming up with random ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven more random. Then you could make them into submarines and use them in shallow water and make them work like super cavitation missiles to get to port faster! Obviously it would have to stop along the way(or before hitting something), but the tech could make for faster travel and less fuel from longer trips. You are basically adding super aerodynamics, but the boat equivalent. This could be great for things across long ocean stretches like the major oceans. Assuming there aren\u0027t other issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould the cold plasma be used to actually propel the boat? I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s strong point is not heavy loads.

It\u0027s not about justification. It could be done hypothetically. If it\u0027s efficient enough or useful enough it could get rid of fuel costs by using water and air and changing out the generators for the turbines. This would be good for fleets as they could gain versatility in case of emergencies or just in changing routes as they won\u0027t have to refuel and do as many things at port. Plus it\u0027s a universal decontamination method for anything. Corona is just a reason to look into it. The rest are just other things that could be done with it in order to hypothetically improve travel times or other things. No idea on feasibility. But we know it\u0027s already possible. It\u0027s a matter of realistic loads. And whether you use propeller or other things is just a matter of converting to the most efficient or needed matter of propulsion. Converting stuff is normal in designs. All real world examples do multiple times for everything from cars to boats. We already or can already use gas to potentially charge batteries. Strap a boat to an intake method with infinite air and water and you have potentially infinite fuel and travel. The rest is a matter of details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could even take on new methods of staying out of port and having ships come get goods that are then a part of the port. Depends on the ship and the load and the realities of what is being carried. And that is one example of potentially many new things(or old things) that could be applied or reapplied if needed or desired. It could open up lots of interesting things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s something real companies should be doing real world feasibility tests for if they haven\u0027t already. Imagine and airport with free fuel near an ocean and the lowered cost of travel. The planes wouldn\u0027t need the equipment potentially as it would likely be heavey unless it can convert air and water fast enough mid flight.(which it could by going into clouds to get water. Although I don\u0027t know if enough could be collected. Although it might be good for specialized functions). But you could remove fuel cost almost entirely from tickets. And install cold plasma in the airliner for safety and corona reason as an air filter. This would then make the going into clouds useful for an emergency refill for those safety features potentially. The fuel thing on the other hand would be a matter of the efficiency of the fuel developed. Can you produce a fuel as good as normal oils from resources at the airliner? Or even offsight and shipped in? Obviously it has to be cheaper though outside of other practicalities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-06T21:17:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2020 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T21:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetails like conservation of energy.

There are things related to the brain(it\u0027s entire functionality) that require repetition to learn things thoroughly. That does not exist in sciences unless use sufficiently or primarily in conjunction with something more thorough. The other thing is supposed to be dominant or you won\u0027t learn anything. Degrees in science aren\u0027t even supposed to exist for this reason outside of classes for applied degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-07T02:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2020 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-07T00:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much electricity/energy is generated by large metal ship hull while going through the water normally?

If the ship design came before the realization of the energy produced it\u0027s not proportional. The only way it is if it\u0027s completely considered in the design in an absolute way.

You act as if there is no variance to the existing equipment and that the laws of thermodynamics are constantly simply in play. That is not how the real world works. Real world can make inefficient things last a long time for varied reasons. In fact the most efficient thing is basically never used. Real world application even commonly make the most inefficient thing more efficient in given normal scenarios. Because what you call efficient is only in a given generalized math formula that never applies directly without endless other considerations changing what is best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to mention all it minimally has to do is add needed function or improve the existing.

And no you don\u0027t have to use cold plasma to remove the salt, you possibly could, you just have to do part of the process.). You don\u0027t seem to understand how this works when applying to a real object.. But if you could do that much more it would be a bit stupid not to find out or possibly test it in real life. The whole point of this discussion was a verbal feasibility test. You know, an intelligent conversation. That requires as many specifics as possible and an open mind.
