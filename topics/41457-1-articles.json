I tend to go with \u0022more is better\u0022 and alternate between \u0022at the CoM\u0022 and \u0022out at the ends, for more lever-arm torque\u0022.

However, see above regarding the need for *all* the oomph to get off Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENukes - I don\u0027t like to use nukes on anything that lands.
