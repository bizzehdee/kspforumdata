The planet is know now as \u0027Kerbin\u0027 but in that time it was called Kebroni. The giant asteroid\u00A0which had created the huge crater in West Kerbin hit 890 million years ago at that time. Because of that kerbin was now a desert planet. Only on the poles there were pine forests, and\u00A0there was life. These organisms were very similar to today\u0027s kerbal, and they were the ancestors of kerbal kind. They called themselves the Keba or Keba\u0027s or the Kemrah they lived in caves and were very brave. They ate fish and bugs and plants. Sometimes the \u0027ken\u0027 /men often whent out to hunt fish with sticks and often they failed. The problem was, gow to get to the open ocean? About 10 million years later, a Keba called Jebnediahak got a piece of wood and boarded it and it floated! Jebnediahak had invented the first boat! Soon the Keba built wooded houses, boats and other stuff, and soon the Keba had taken over Kebroni.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Keba named Koperhicus looked at the star and saw a great big green dot. That star shall be called JOOL, for the green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Keba did not know that jool was a planet. As the years whent by, the Keba invented lots of new things. 5 million years ago, the Keba called themselves Krebars. Later duna,eve,dres and moho were discovered, but now kerbin looked different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was more water and a lot of GREEN but still deserts covered most of the land. Then about 2 million years later, the krebars were almost identical to the present kerbal they were abot 20 cm taller than before and there skin was lighter due to less sun. Because the\u00A0planet gradual l\u0027y\u00A0moved away from kerbol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2,000 years ago the Krebars built 5 huge temples in the desert, in the honor of there king, Jebredediah Keran because once again they changed there name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs time whent, on the Kerbls built huge cities out of wood, rock and mud. But the structures were destroyed due to battles and nature. 100 years ago a kerbal named Genegisus built the first rocket a few years later, the old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E was built.
