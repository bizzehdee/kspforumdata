My Kerbals got food on EVA, and the transfer is actually working. That\u0027s greatly appreciated, thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i guess the food disapearing at transfer wasn\u0027t actually bound to Microbiome part, but it seems that there is generally some incomaptibility between BM\u002BS and TAC with STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH, this problem occured also on vessels with only stock Squad parts and TAC LS container. So unless stock parts like Science Jr require food, it seem (at least on my mod setup) that with default BM\u002BS settings TAC food just gets removed instead of transfered without any additional conditions required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, i have issue with godawful slow transfer speed of food between parts, but looking at these config files i guess there is not much more to tweak so it could be changed. Oh well, it\u0027s a game of patience after all, not big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy little bigger issue would be the lightning effects on both AGStudy-2 and GooExp2. Is there ANY way to disable or remove it? Can i somehow import .mu models to 3DS and remove some light source helpers, or is some other software required to modify it? The blue glow of Biological Systems Study looks most of the time absolutly out of the place, and the white glow of Bio Containment Study while nice - glows out of the doors when they are closed, making this part a really iritating \u0022candy bulb\u0022. Models in BM\u002BS have really a lot of details to them, but the overall aesthetic of textures and lights brings them seriously down.

We\u0027re aware of things not working well above 50x timewarp. Above 10x timewarp is a new one. Keep in mind that, as you move away from the sun, the greenhouses will be less efficient when using just light from the sun. If you were not using the onboard lights in the greenhouses, maybe they got too far from the sun and were not producing enough oxygen? It could also just be a limitation of the generator modules Biomass currently uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hesitate to suggest this, but there is a way you could cheat: The dll that comes with TAC-LS allows it to do basic calculations to give the appearance that Kerbals continue to respire, drink water, etc. when the craft is not selected. As of right now Biomass does not do this. What you _could_ do is have a few Biomass greenhouses running. Deselect your ship, increase the time warp, swap back when TAC-LS gives you a warning, and reselect the ship. At normal time, replenish your O2 tanks from the greenhouses. Deselect, timewarp, repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also use an oxygen compressor to release oxidizer fuel pressure to make oxygen. You would sacrifice oxidizer for breathable oxygen, but it\u0027s an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe longterm solution to this timewarp problem is to either write a custom dll for biomass that would replicate some of the features TAC-LS has, or see whether Biomass can just use TAC-LS\u0027s dlls. \u0026lt;shrug\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see some images of your ship, if you\u0027re willing to share. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"balricaso","CreatedById":101797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T21:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI almost always leave the lights on in the greenhouse, because as I move i often forget to turn to face the fun (thank goodness for tracking on solar panels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/JaOtF#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/JaOtF#0\u003C/a\u003E Here\u0027s the ship on a routine trip to Duna (with excess materials as I believe one should be prepared for catastrophe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ or below 10x the oxygen slowly creeps up 0.01 at a time, but I noticed the problem shortly after I escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI.

Right now one large plant greenhouse produces enough O2 for 3 kerbals on easy mode. I can probably game the numbers to make the greenhouse support 3, or even 6 kerbals on Easy mode. For an idea of how big the large greenhouses are, picture a compact car\u0027s parking spot, roughly 2m by 3.25m. Now imagine growing enough food in that area for a child. Every day. So on hard mode, a single greenhouse probably won\u0027t produce enough food for 1 kerbal.

Certainly not 18, though.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be perfectly honest, i can absolutly imagine a small room filled with loads of cuckooflower able to keep up 3 adult people alive as long as it\u0027s regenerated.
