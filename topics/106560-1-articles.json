Does KER not take into account the new ISPs or something?"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:58:23Z","Content":"That\u0027s a lot of fuel. But yes, I\u0027ve seen weird values from KER. I had one ship that KER reported I had 2000m/s dV (It was to complete a suborbital contract). I launched it and it barely made it to 40km. When I checked the ship later, KER decided it only had 1500m/s dV.\n\nI think we just need to wait for a proper update."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:03:49Z","Content":"Note that KSP was running for 10 minutes in the background without the engines on. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![4kTD41c.png](http://i.imgur.com/4kTD41c.png)\n\n![y8rno5Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/y8rno5Y.png)\n\nProper update would be nice."}]}
