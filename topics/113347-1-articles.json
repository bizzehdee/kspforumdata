Nothing to see really unless you are interested in how it has changed.\n\nAh, the 3D Pro, brings back memories. Cut my teeth on *Flight Sim* with them, had a blast with them in *Enemy Engaged: Comanche v. Hokum*. Yeah, they do wear out after extended use, especially when one person in household is an avid aviation and space nut, and the other is a trainee pilot. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I wonder where that joystick went, it\u0027s been years since I\u0027ve seen it...\n\nOn your high end, and going by other message boards, many people on flight sims usually swear by [the Saitek X52](http://store.madcatz.com/X52-Flight-Control-System-by-Saitek.html). She\u0027s general-purpose enough for a wide range of joystick-based games, and it seems the price is well within your budget (without shipping being taken into account though, just to add). If you investigate the product page further, you\u0027ll find a pro version that\u0027s a little better built (but at $200 compared to the $150 of the base version). No pedals, but I think you could get those separately and just map them separately in the game--presuming the Unity engine is capable of detecting two different control peripherals at the same time. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) But the stick twist might be enough. \n\nThe number of buttons on them may seem a bit much, especially compared to the 3D Pro, but you can effectively bind nearly every (if not *every*) key-controllable function in KSP to the Saitek, making your game nearly keyboard-free. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Maybe even mouse, if you can bind the view controls to one of the hat switches. (Although I think the mouse will still be necessary for tweakables, and the keyboard for mod controls). \n\nNot sure about low-end options. If you\u0027re not averse to transitioning from a joystick to a gamepad, I\u0027m using a Logitech Xinput gamepad (Xbox 360-type controls) for the game. KSP will detect and work with it, and IMO it\u0027s sufficient for KSP needs (I still go to keyboard for gravity turns, since a button is certainly more precise means of input than a 2-asix thumbstick, but for atmo flight, docking with simultaneous access to translation and rotation, and--as I found recently--rover control with simultaneous rotation and translation control, it\u0027s just about perfect.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\nADDENDUM: Ah, this is also available from MadCatz, and is in your low end, too: [http://store.madcatz.com/categories/pro-flight-category/Mad-Catz-FLY-5-Stick-for-PC.html](http://store.madcatz.com/categories/pro-flight-category/Mad-Catz-FLY-5-Stick-for-PC.html) Otherwise, the 3D Pro is still a solid controller. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T09:51:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by B-STRK**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T10:22:09Z","Content":"i had my ch fighterstick started to show some mechanical problems after 8\u002B years of dedicated service. it will be missed."}]}
