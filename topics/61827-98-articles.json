I\u0027ve wasted days and days trying every which combination to work out why and I can\u0027t find anything that fixes it at all. It has something to do with the timing of when parts are moved by the main game, and when the callbacks are called by the main game. it seems to be interleaving the movement of parts with the calls to those parts\u0027 callbacks, in a way that randomly jumbles whether all, some, or none of the parts have been moved by the time the mod tries to perform its ray cast. When I cast the ray, some of the parts are located where they belong on THIS physics frame and some are located where they belong on the NEXT physics frame, making the laser miss half the time. I\u0027ve had a zillion bits of advice on moving the code to fixedUpdate, or to lateUpdate - I\u0027ve tried them all. it makes NO difference.
