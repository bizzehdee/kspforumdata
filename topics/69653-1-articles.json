This allows me to make believe that the Kerbals hollowed out the roid to use as a station. The 3 wheels make for comfortable living with gravity for 12 Kerbals. The lifeboat only holds 16 Kerbals so I limit the number to 12 at any one time. The orange tanks hold fuel so that visiting ships can refuel if they need to.
