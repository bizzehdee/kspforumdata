When you get down to it, a rocket scientist is just a scientist (or engineer) who works on rockets (or spacecraft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specific term for a rocket- or spacecraft-focused educational program actually changes from school to school. The most common title for departments and degrees is \u0022aerospace,\u0022 which is usually organized under a department/school/college of engineering. Cal Poly and Georgia Tech are two of many examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany institutions still have \u0022aeronautics\u0022 departments in which rocket and spacecraft courses are included. (Until recently, this was the case for CalTech, if I remember my grad school applications correctly.) Stanford\u0027s and MIT\u0027s departments are still called \u0022aeronautics and astronautics\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore traditional specialties remain very relevant to aerospace work. Mechanical engineering in particular is seen as an excellent all-around background for which aerospace is a very appropriate application. You also have other, more-focused specialties that contribute a great deal to critical components like electrical engineering, chemical engineering, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, there\u0027s the integration piece. \u0022Systems engineering\u0022 is a type of engineering that focuses on the design, integration, and deployment of large and complex systems, and is a direct consequence of challenges faced and solved during the past decade of defense and aerospace programs. Controls engineering is similarly relevant, if not as involved in the design process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the takeaway is that studying any one of these fields can help you contribute to rocket science and space programs. As mentioned, physics is also a legitimate choice (in addition to math and computer science). Regardless, it will be less about your education and more about the actual kind of work you manage to land, so develop your professional network, pay attention to where the work is, and do your best to get your foot in the door. Even a position as a technical writer on the right program can lead to great opportunities and a robust on-the-job education.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"No one","CreatedById":112131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T17:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rocket\u0022 is like \u0022mad\u0022 in that most scientists described that way are just engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it completely depends on which part you want to focus on.
