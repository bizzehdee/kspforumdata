I selected all of my ships and opened them at the same time, and then used the \u003Cem\u003EReplace All in All Open Documents\u003C/em\u003E button in the find-and-replace dialog. As a sanity check, there should be twice as many replacements of EngineerChipFlight to EngineerChip as there are replacements of FlightEngineer to FlightEngineerModule, because each chip itself is named twice (once by the parent part, and once by the chip itself) while the module is only named once (within the actual chip).

In retrospect, I should have started from the bottom and worked my way up. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to automate this (Notepad\u002B\u002B has a feature for recording and executing macros, for one thing), but it didn\u0027t take more than a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027ll open a GitHub issue to ask cybutek to make some migrating instructions.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaelumEtAstra","CreatedById":109360,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WildLynx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WildLynx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in the same boat as you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ninja\u0027d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T20:10:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mrsupersonic8\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDarn Ninjas.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmm it could be possible to use KAS to remove a part from craft in flight, then upgrade KSP with newer KER (which has option for partless mode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of roundabout way of doing this, but this is actually a mission on its own. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T21:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually added the KER (flight) parts to KAS config to be able to upgrade my ships, but not new KE, I not using it yet, only reading forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManual upgrade is not my option with, KE, because I have too many ships with KER and some of them are far away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, I think, you cannot use KER and KE at some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T14:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThen get \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100798\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlcubierre Warp Drive\u003C/a\u003E by Rover Dude and fix them all in one go \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Zip-Fix-Zip-Fix-Zip-... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starchitect","CreatedById":132255,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed a bug with KER\u0027s KIDS integration \u0026amp; symmetrically placed engines.
