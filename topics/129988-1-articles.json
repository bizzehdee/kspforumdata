The planets would also be made partially of electron-degenerate matter, making them much denser than any known planets and making possible their high surface gravities relative to their sizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut today I decided to fact-check myself and look up the lower mass limits for stellar remnants such as white dwarfs, and I found the following:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- White dwarf: at least 0.6 solar masses, below which it will convert into a \u0022carbon planet\u0022 and expand to a much larger size and lower density\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Neutron star: at least 0.1 solar masses, below which it will explode in an event similar to a type 1a supernova, and any core remnant left over will be composed of ordinary matter of assorted elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbol has a mass of roughly 0.01 solar masses, and Kerbin less than a millionth of a solar mass. So nothing in the Kerbolar system could actually be made of electron-degenerate matter or solid neutrons, which leaves the question: Exactly what might they be made of?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo can anyone else come up with some ideas for how to greatly increase the density of a planet or star, so that we don\u0027t have to go with \u0022gravity is stronger in the Kerbal universe\u0022 or \u0022it\u0027s magic\u0022? Yes, I do understand that it IS magic, but for the sake of mental stimulation, I\u0027d like to try to come up with a headcanon that holds water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, say we take a planet like Earth. It has a certain mass, and since it\u0027s made mainly of iron, silicon, and oxygen, it has a certain resulting radius and density. But if we converted it into pure gold, it would become denser and thus end up smaller. Can we come up with some configuration of materials, possibly including degenerate matter, that could produce the necessary densities?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T22:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity isn\u0027t stronger.
