I tried launching a rocket with only a probe core in control, and while I was able to control the staging I was not able to turn it. However a ship/station in orbit controlled by a probe core can be turned. Is this supposed to happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gromaz","CreatedById":57688,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T07:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas the a.s.a.s. turned on? I used to use mostly probe cores but now I mostly use them for craft that I don\u0027t need to turn very much since the manned pods are much more responsive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T07:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect your ship/station in orbit also had an (empty) command pod onboard - that\u0027s what made it easy to turn. correct?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T07:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbe cores have almost no torque so for a rocket launch you will want to have tailfins installed at the base of your core stage to provide steering in the lower atmosphere, as well as gymbaling engines for steering higher up once the atmosphere is too thin for the fins to work. And RCS for your Space maneuvers. Probe cores can turn you in space yes but very very slowly!! Also, you may have lost control due to running out of power? They only have 5 units of power so be sure you have RTG\u0027s or solar panels installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T08:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat is because the probes have almost no torque, so you can just put a empty command pod on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T09:31:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe station in orbit has only its own inertia to resist the torque of the pod, but a ship taking off has to deal with the weight distribution of the ship, forces applied by the airflow, exactly how the thrust of the engine is aligned with the COM, \u003Cem\u003Eand \u003C/em\u003Ethe inertia of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T18:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Vanamonde says pretty much nailed it on the head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d advise you to stick some fins to the base of the rocket to help it maneuver while you\u0027re still in the lower reaches of the atmosphere. Gimballed engines are also useful, especially once you reach a point where the fins don\u0027t work as well. Finally, a tiny splash of RCS fuel and a few strategically-placed thrusters will provide you with some additional control once you\u0027re above the atmosphere and no longer firing your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
