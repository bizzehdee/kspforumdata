Nik Kruger Sciences CEO Mr. Me here, and I have a question to ask on behalf of my company. You see, all our .crafts are from 1.0.4. But in order to reach a larger crowd and boost downloads, we want to move to 1.0.5. However, the fear of making all our .craft invalid is blocking us from doing so. Will our .craft remain usable if we were to move? Can we safely expand NKS\u0027s business?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T21:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had broken ships. \u00A0Anything on structural pylons vanished, which was my entire duna fleet. \u00A0New career was started\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T21:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy can\u0027t it be both?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep your 1.0.4 install, or at least the craft files. \u00A0Re-build everything for 1.0.5.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext year (which is 4 days away) you can do it for 1.1 too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T21:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the short answer is \u0022it depends.\u0022\u00A0 For the most part I expect ships to be okay, though there might be some pieces with problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, it\u0027s easy to test.\u00A0 KSP doesn\u0027t come with any DRM of any kind, it\u0027s easy to copy.\u00A0 So just make a backup copy of your entire 1.0.4 directory tree, with KSP.EXE and everything, then install the 1.0.5 upgrade so that you have the two versions of KSP.EXE side-by-side.\u00A0 Then try it out.\u00A0 If you\u0027re good, you\u0027re good.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 If it turns out to have problems, then you can play your old career in your 1.0.4 folder, and if you start any new career games, you can start them in 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also worth bearing in mind that 1.1 will be coming out in the not too distant future, and is likely to be a significantly more disruptive change than the move from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5.\u00A0 I have no idea how backwards-compatible it would be, but I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if it breaks pretty much all old saves.\u00A0 So it\u0027s all gonna be moot relatively soon, I expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Me","CreatedById":29791,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T22:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe FightOrFlights (My most prized series) have Mk1 cockpits.
