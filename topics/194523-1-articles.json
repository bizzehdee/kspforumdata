I guess Im worried that filling all those positions could become cumbersome, though perhaps many or most are entry level and don\u0027t require experience. On a previous save I had 50 or 60\u00A0kerbals on various missions and it took pages and pages of notes to manage crew rotations and get them leveled up in KSOI before they shipped out interplanetary. Part of this was the clunkiness of the UI for crew management, looking down the tiny text on the roster in\u00A0the Astronaut complex and figuring out who had and hadn\u0027t been in munar\u00A0orbit and landed where. I have a pretty high threshold and it tested my patience. I like the idea that kerbals gain experience and increase their abilities in principal, but in practice it can be a tedious thing to manage, especially once we have hundreds of them. Even if we discount experience for most jobs\u00A0do the 3 classifications of pilots, engineers, \u002B scientists still make sense? I could see needing engineers to work foundries and shipyards and scientists for greenhouses and nurseries, but how many pilots would you really need? Maybe if there were some more automation and mech-jebby abilities I could see needing more. Are kerbals born with an occupation\u00A0or does the player choose for them? I think having crews automatically filled when you build modules\u00A0and some kind of streamlined UI to manage them would help, but it still seems like a lot of fuss for an omelette.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIm sort of leaning toward the idea that we could ditch experience entirely in favor of a habitation mechanic. If properly engineering your colony or vessel with enough LS \u002B hab space contributed to a vessel-wide happiness rating you could use that to determine mining efficiency and science outputs rather than individual kerbal stats.\u00A0I think it takes something away from making hero 5 star kerbals, but in the end is time spent managing that really worth it? Maybe instead kerbal skills could be purchased like building upgrades and apply across your program so you weren\u0027t bogged down micromanaging each kerbal\u0027s career.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-09T02:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2020 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArtemisAZ","CreatedById":179669,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T18:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave them there just to look at and feel accomplished.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike little green uhhh... what were those pet shrimp things that you put in water and they started being alive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-07T18:24:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2020 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Krulliam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T18:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798891\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194523\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591554189\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179669\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krulliam\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n34 minutes ago, Krulliam said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike little green uhhh... what were those pet shrimp things that you put in water and they started being alive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose were sea monkeys, my dude.

And I agree there should probably be a stock of general workers that are auto-selected to fill greenhouses and VABs and the like as they\u0027re built to cut down on staff-management time. You\u0027ll probably also need to be able to manually move crews around depending on your situation.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nB) I also like the idea of Kerblings, i: because they would be cute af and ii: because it sounds like there will be some form of non-punishing LS and I like the idea that after a \u0022boom\u0022 you\u0027d have a hot second to catch up on your LS volume before they mature. Otherwise you\u0027d feel like you needed to overproduce LS before a achieving a goal and you wouldn\u0027t necessarily know how much to plan for.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nC) Recruitment to the major professions (scientists, engineers, pilots) is the last bit. Im cool pulling from the general pool mainly cause I like to pick the best sounding names. The first question is should recruitment come with a cost in terms of time, energy, and/or facilities?\u00A0I think\u00A0there needs to be be some limiting factor but I\u0027d prefer if it was controllable.\u00A0Again Im of the probably controversial mindset that we should ditch individual\u00A0kerbal experience because it takes too much time to fuss over with that many crew members. From my experience you spend more time touring them around to level them up than doing almost anything else. It\u0027s fine if touring them around earns them cosmetic ranks but giving big bonuses creates grindy incentives.

Im guessing by now the devs have some specific ideas about this, but generally I imagine first it\u0027s about producing fuel and LS\u00A0and then grows to allow for the building of new and more complex modules and new vessels from scratch. I think it\u0027s okay if a max-tech colony capable of producing and supporting interstellar vessels is a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E complicated to orchestrate so long as that complexity builds slowly enough to not overwhelm or bog down gameplay. I\u0027d also like if there was some flexibility and strategy to how you allocate resources, workers included. Like you could devote a colony more heavily toward fuel production or science collection or rocket manufacturing or buoying population depending on the resources available on site and how you combine them with supply routes. It be nice if it wasn\u0027t just a rote,\u00A0linear, A leads to B leads to C build for every situation. To add flexibility it would also be nice if we could recycle and convert parts and resources in order\u00A0to adapt over time, much like the way\u00A0you can convert water and carbon to rocket fuel and back irl.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-09T02:38:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2020 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-09T05:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some limit, the Kerbals should become resources rather than persons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet alone O\u0027Neil cylinders, but even a 1k population colony hardly can be populated if you need to put everyone in his seat.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd CPU will smoke if call them to a city meeting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnlikely you could even read their list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, colonies larger than tens of Kerbals inevitably separate Kerbals in a privileged class with personalities and occupations (Pilot, Scientist, Engineer, several more) and faceless mass of plebs/muggles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA funny fact.

And I agree there should probably be a stock of general workers that are auto-selected to fill greenhouses and VABs and the like as they\u0027re built to cut down on staff-management time. You\u0027ll probably also need to be able to manually move crews around depending on your situation.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nB) I also like the idea of Kerblings, i: because they would be cute af and ii: because it sounds like there will be some form of non-punishing LS and I like the idea that after a \u0022boom\u0022 you\u0027d have a hot second to catch up on your LS volume before they mature.

Im cool pulling from the general pool mainly cause I like to pick the best sounding names. The first question is should recruitment come with a cost in terms of time, energy, and/or facilities?\u00A0I think\u00A0there needs to be be some limiting factor but I\u0027d prefer if it was controllable.\u00A0Again Im of the probably controversial mindset that we should ditch individual\u00A0kerbal experience because it takes too much time to fuss over with that many crew members. From my experience you spend more time touring them around to level them up than doing almost anything else. It\u0027s fine if touring them around earns them cosmetic ranks but giving big bonuses creates grindy incentives.

Im guessing by now the devs have some specific ideas about this, but generally I imagine first it\u0027s about producing fuel and LS\u00A0and then grows to allow for the building of new and more complex modules and new vessels from scratch. I think it\u0027s okay if a max-tech colony capable of producing and supporting interstellar vessels is a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E complicated to orchestrate so long as that complexity builds slowly enough to not overwhelm or bog down gameplay. I\u0027d also like if there was some flexibility and strategy to how you allocate resources, workers included. Like you could devote a colony more heavily toward fuel production or science collection or rocket manufacturing or buoying population depending on the resources available on site and how you combine them with supply routes. It be nice if it wasn\u0027t just a rote,\u00A0linear, A leads to B leads to C build for every situation. To add flexibility it would also be nice if we could recycle and convert parts and resources in order\u00A0to adapt over time, much like the way\u00A0you can convert water and carbon to rocket fuel and back irl.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth ideas do seem to fit what the devs envision for colonies.
