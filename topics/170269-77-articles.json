To paraphrase the scene:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This planet is deep within the black hole\u0027s gravity field, so an hour on the surface is like 25 years up here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, when we go there for an hour, 25 years will have passed on the ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002225 years on the ship, that will be lonely for me.

One hour on surface, 25 years in space. Anyway, let\u0027s go down to the surface and check that beacon that has been sending signals to us for 25 years. I\u0027m sure that means the planet is habitable, otherwise it wouldn\u0027t have sent signals for 25 years. It would have stopped broadcasting after, ah, an hour or so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(They go to the surface)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, the ship is destroyed, and it happened only recently! I\u0027d say about an hour or so! Wow, the astronaut was waiting for us for 25 years, and then disaster happened only right before we arrived!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait a second ... I just realized! One hour on the surface of this planet is like 25 years outside! The ship has only been here for an hour, even though the signals it broadcast have been reaching us for 25 years! It was destroyed almost immediately upon landing!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow, that\u0027s quite a revelation! Good thinking! Sadly, it was impossible for us to foresee this. None of us could ever know that when 25 years had passed on the outside, only an hour had passed on this planet. I only ever thought of it, like, the other way around.

Prof. McGonagall gives all the Transfiguration classes in the Transfiguration classroom. Prof. Flitwick teaches Charms in the Charms classroom. Prof. Snape teaches Potions in the Potions classroom. And so on. Divination is eventually taught by two teachers, and Herbology is spread across multiple greenhouses, but otherwise there\u0027s one teacher and one location for every class.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, we\u0027re shown that most classes are usually taught to students of one or two houses at the time. Gryffindor tends to be paired with Slytherin for Potions, for instance, but Transfiguration is always done by Gryffindor alone. Same with Charms, if I recall correctly. The students usually have four classes per day, two before lunch and two afterwards.\u00A0Each class usually has multiple lectures per week. There may be double-length classes that take up half the school day, such as Potions which usually has one double-length class per week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Hogwarts has students spread across seven years and four houses. Some classes are taught only for a few years (such as Divination, which is only mandatory for years 3-5), but others such as History of Magic or Charms remain mandatory at least through year five. For the higher-year courses, the classes are small enough that all four houses are mixed in class (such as Prof. Slughorn\u0027s Potions class), yet the number of classes per week for a student remains the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s the problem: for most subjects, the numbers don\u0027t add up. There simply isn\u0027t enough time to teach everybody.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake Transfiguration, for instance. Five years with separate classes for the four houses, plus two years with students from all houses, that\u0027s 22 classes per week, even with only one Transfiguration class per student per week. With two Transfiguration classes per week, the teacher has to be present for 44 classes. Yet the calendar only contains room for 20 classes in a week. Potions is supposed to teach all the 12 student groups for at least half a day each over a five-day week, and presumably a typical school week contains some shorter classes as well. And it\u0027s all done by one teacher. Something similar goes for Astronomy. Classes take place at midnight, yet there aren\u0027t enough midnights in a week for all the school years, unless the teacher never takes a day off and students don\u0027t have weekends off for up to two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what about Time-Turners? They allow a person to be in multiple classes at the same time!\u0022 Hence the point about each class having only one classroom. Using a Time-Turner, a person may be in several different locations at the same time, but here we\u0027re explicitly told that most classes exclusively take place in one classroom, so two classes can\u0027t be taught simultaneously. Prof. Sprout\u0027s classes occur across several greenhouses, so she might be able to pull of tricks with time-turners, but that\u0027s not an option for anybody else, and apparently Time-Turners were destroyed after book 5 anyway. Only Divination and the elected subjects would realistically be able to fit into the allotted schedule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think any reasonable teacher would complain about the workload, too. In addition to apparently teaching more than forty two-hour classes per week, Prof. McGonagall apparently assigns each of Hogwarts\u0027 hundreds of student several pages\u0027 worth of homework to write after every class, and she\u0027s the only one around to grade it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Harry Potter series is fun to dissect like this. The books are an absolute joy to read, but as soon as you try to run the numbers on anything, they never add up. Take for instance the beginning of the school year, with the train to Hogwarts from platform 9\u00BE at King\u0027s Cross station. The train leaves at 11 sharp, yet the main characters always arrive only a few minutes before 11, which seems to be a common time to arrive for most people. \u0022Most people\u0022 in this case means hundreds of students, most of whom are accompanied by their entire living family. There could be around a thousand people arriving on that platform every September 1st, and it has only one entrance, which means somebody would have to pass through the magical barrier every few seconds for hours, somehow without forming a huge crowd on the outside or attract Muggle attention. Or maybe Harry and his friends are always the only ones to arrive just in time, while it is customary to show up at an assigned time slot between 7 and 10 AM?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything makes sense when seen through the eyes of Harry Potter, yet as soon as you start considering he\u0027s only one student among many, the given explanations for how things work quickly fall apart. J.K. Rowling has apparently admitted that math isn\u0027t her strongest suit, and I\u0027m inclined to agree with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe it all works because magic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-02T22:55:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2020 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Codraroll\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T02:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223830358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596387879\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me started again on \u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBad on so many levels (lousy plot not the least of them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0because it plays out like a dream.

Then, he\u0027s very suddenly transported into space, where he experiences various absurd alien settings with a vivid emotional reaction to what are essentially dead, silent natural processes. That\u0027s what astronauts felt when they walked on the Moon - They were emotionally moved by the motionless rocks and hills, which are fairly ordinary as far as the universe is concerned.
