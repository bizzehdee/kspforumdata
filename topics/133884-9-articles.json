However, I do like it - it sort of reminds me of all those old \u003Cem\u003EPopular Science\u003C/em\u003E magazines from the 1950s and 1960s my grandfather shared with me. In its own Kerbal way, it brings some great memories from childhood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is probably not the right place to say this, but between this forum and the various KSP Facebook pages I belong on, I truly believe that there are a small part of the KSP fan base that simply does have no appreciation to what Squad and the modders have brought to us. Without the mods, KSP is a fabulous game that engages each user in a fundamental way so that no two people that play KSP ever have the same game or even the same results. It literally means something different to each player and to me, that is the mark of a truly great game. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002266485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0022\u003E@SQUAD\u003C/a\u003E - the members of the team deserve the respect of this community; if it were not for their vision for the Kerbal Space Program, none of us would be a part of one of the best gaming communities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe modders in this community give a lot of their passion, their time, and their own financial resources for continued development of \u003Cem\u003Eextras\u003C/em\u003E that increase the game\u0027s scope and enjoyment. Some, such as rbray89\u0027s EVE mods make an already beautiful planetary system simply breathtaking, while sarbian has made some improvements through his many mods that benefit players such as me. Porkjet\u0027s mods were so good Squad made him an official member, complete with a secret decoder ring, to their team. Then there\u0027s bahamutoD\u0027s mods that not only fill in some of the gaps with engines and cockpits, but that allow me to rid my world of orbital debris \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E. There are another dozen mods, like Kerbal Planetary Bases, Kerbal Engineer Redux, LackLuster Labs, the near future mods, Mark 2 Expansion, and ScanSat (and many, many others) that encourage my imagination and creativity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the release of 1.1 there has been a lot of complaining about the cut-away views versus the clear canopy; folks, again, to me, both are great and if we didn\u0027t have either one, it would be great too. Let\u0027s not lose focus on how remarkably sensitive Squad has been towards its fan base and cut them some slack. It may not be in 1.1, but may be in 1.1.5... or so forth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-13T13:15:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2016 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhedd","CreatedById":112088,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T04:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am going to go INSANE trying to find out how to activate this view!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been implemented in 1.1 pre, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve looked in options, I\u0027ve looked in right click menus, I\u0027ve looked in the on-screen interface...
