I remember what the twinkle looks like because I did find one of the Mun arches that way back in version 0.19. But other than that one, and the one that can be found by just looking up historical information in Wikipedia (no spoilers here which one I mean but if you\u0027ve found it you know what I mean), I\u0027ve never seen any others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that my graphics make white pixel twinkles quite a lot. Whenever looking at a polygon edge-on, the thin edge of it can make a phantom white pixel twinkle. It doesn\u0027t happen everywhere, but they happen frequently enough that at any given moment there\u0027s at least two or three of them on the screen. They appear to twinkle in the same spot for about 10-20 seconds until your view moves far enough that you\u0027re no longer looking at that particular hillside or crater-side polygon in such an edge-on way anymore, by which point there will be another twinkling pixel somewhere else, most likely. This is making it nearly impossible to visually look for easter eggs because I\u0027m being flooded with false positives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else have this problem and know how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T10:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe extra \u0022twinkling\u0022 is caused by the terrain scatter.
