I put the pedal to the metal and reach the top of some hill. As we drive across the summit, another nuclear explosion goes off in the town below. This was the most vivid dream moment I\\\u0027ve ever had. The shockwave overtakes and swallows the town, as the ground shakes and the windows on the car shatter. (vibration) All of a sudden the trees in front of me bend back and the buildings to my side are disintegrated as I wake up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"witeken","CreatedById":12816,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-08T19:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dreamed this morning that I came to a friend of my.

The oddest thing is that I had memories of them even though they weren\\\u0027t from RL. We flew to Europa in a large craft. The idea was that we were to land, disassemble the ship, reassemble it into a base. We stayed there for about two weeks but on the 13th (oh... 13...) night I saw lights outside the window. I freaked out (because I have a habit of panicking when things act erratically) and I wanted to leave the next day. We stayed for our arranged time (2 more days) throughout which everything seemed like it was on time warp. We didn\\\u0027t see anything until we started taking down the base and reassembling it as a ship again. These robot things were marching towards us across the plain. We all hid, and the robots searched for us (they were very big). Eventually I decided that hiding and starving wasn\\\u0027t an option and that if they didn\\\u0027t leave we couldn\\\u0027t get home. So I stood up and surrendered. The robots knocked me unconscious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bit I can explain; I woke up in a room with one of my companions. At this point I really woke up because my mum was telling me to wake up (I have an alarm clock... It sounds like a fire bell but I never hear it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway thanks for reading. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-08T19:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@iamwearingpants:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Die letzten Kinder von Schewenborn\u0027, don\\\u0027t think that it was translated into english, anyway, it\\\u0027s about the soviets nuking west Germany for some reason and a family that tries to survive in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, another one, I once played the Chernobyl mission of Emergency 4 (911 first responders in english) and I could not sleep in that night, so I thought about my bedcover protectiong me from radiation, DIDN\\\u0027T WORK \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
