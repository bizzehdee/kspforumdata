I\u0027m still trying to figure it out. To me it\u0027s C or maybe something looser. Here\u0027s what I did: I accepted a contract to put a \u0022newly discovered\u0022 class B Asteroid in Kerbin Orbit. So I found one in the tracking station and started tracking it. While waiting the 100 days or so for it to get closer I\u00A0accepted a new contract to put a \u0022newly discovered\u0022 class B asteroid in Mun orbit. When I finally got to the Asteroid, green check boxes lit up for both contracts. I put the Asteroid in Kerbin Orbit. Waited my ten seconds (plus several days to line up the intercepts) and\u00A0brought it to the Mun and accomplished both contracts with one asteroid. So previously tracked Asteroids still count as \u0022Newly Discovered\u0022 Which raises the question: what else counts? I just accepted a couple of new asteroid contracts, so I\u0027ll do some experimentation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
