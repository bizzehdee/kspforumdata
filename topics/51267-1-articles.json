Since I didn\u0027t see a reference to what modules would be use-once, I\u0027m guessing that this would apply to the Mystery Goo container and the SC-9001 science lab. Both employ materials whose conditions \u0022change\u0022 once exposed to a new environment, so if you\u0027re removing data from them for maximum science output, that probably entails taking out the Goo or materials and shipping them back to a suitable lab for analysis. To \u0022reset\u0022 the module afterward means you need \u0022unchanged\u0022 Goo or materials, and those would \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C/strong\u003E to be shuttled up from Kerbin.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I think this would encourage more Space Stations/Bases (for newer players and those that haven\u0027t tried yet), or at the very least more Space Station/Base interactions than just an orbiting gas station (which I assume is what people basically use them for now). One of the \u0022experimental\u0022 stations I have up is modular but I\u0027d love to send probes back to it with materials, swap science modules, refuel it, and send it back out.
