The rocket will be unable to use liquid fuel when it runs out of oxidiser, so the amount of LF-only that you start with is dedicated to jets only, regardless of the rocket engines draining the tanks themselves, assuming you start out with all LF-only and LF\u002BO tanks 100% full. The amount of dedicated LF-only will remain unused in the rocket tanks. If need be, isolate the LF part of one of the rocket tanks instead, which will avoid compromising lateral weight balance (do it to the furthest forward tank, ideally, as too much tail weight is much more of a problem than too much nose weight).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
