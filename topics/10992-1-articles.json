I have a pod floating in the middle of the ocean, and a ship orbiting endlessly around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking, how could I get those back? I looked at the Landing Gear, and didn\\\u0027t see a landing strut, I saw a claw. That\\\u0027s right. You see, you can rotate parts now, if you didn\\\u0027t know. When you\\\u0027re placing a part, use WASDQE to rotate it, hold Shift for finer adjustments. I used this to create a 3 armed claw that could hopefully pick up a command module. Well, how should I test it if I\\\u0027m such a horrible pilot? I put a body with 3 fuel tanks on the sides, I put the claw on the bottom. Then I attached a decoupler to the bottom. After the decoupler is the command module. I set the staging so the rockets launch, then the command module detaches, and falls into the claw. I used this to check if it could successfully hold a CM. It worked, well, mostly. I had no control over the rockets because the CM wasn\\\u0027t attached, but it stayed in the claw!
