I have a pod floating in the middle of the ocean, and a ship orbiting endlessly around Kerbin.\n\nI was thinking, how could I get those back? I looked at the Landing Gear, and didn\\\u0027t see a landing strut, I saw a claw. That\\\u0027s right. You see, you can rotate parts now, if you didn\\\u0027t know. When you\\\u0027re placing a part, use WASDQE to rotate it, hold Shift for finer adjustments. I used this to create a 3 armed claw that could hopefully pick up a command module. Well, how should I test it if I\\\u0027m such a horrible pilot? I put a body with 3 fuel tanks on the sides, I put the claw on the bottom. Then I attached a decoupler to the bottom. After the decoupler is the command module. I set the staging so the rockets launch, then the command module detaches, and falls into the claw. I used this to check if it could successfully hold a CM. It worked, well, mostly. I had no control over the rockets because the CM wasn\\\u0027t attached, but it stayed in the claw! If you wanna try it out, here\\\u0027s the file.\n\nEDIT: SCREENSHOTS!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In this one, the decoupler\\\u0027s actually split, so the CM is resting in the claw.\n\u003E ![7VjSh.png](http://i.imgur.com/7VjSh.png)![BtU0c.png](http://i.imgur.com/BtU0c.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"LazerEagle1","CreatedById":25977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T17:31:42Z","Content":"Now with screenshots!"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T17:38:23Z","Content":"Socially Awkward Penguin moment...\n\nThis has been done many times before..."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T17:47:28Z","Content":"It may have been done, but it\\\u0027s still nice to see people try these things, the new ability to tilt parts makes it far too easy though, it\\\u0027s to late now to show off my nail biting flight to rescue a crew on the surface of the Mun as the tricks I had to do with the cart exploit will just be seen as old hat now."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T17:50:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It may have been done, but it\\\u0027s still nice to see people try these things, the new ability to tilt parts makes it far too easy though, it\\\u0027s to late now to show off my nail biting flight to rescue a crew on the surface of the Mun as the tricks I had to do with the cart exploit will just be seen as old hat now.\n\nThough to be honest, is it really better to have to use exploits to do that sort of thing rather than an actual game feature?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T18:25:48Z","Content":"It was harder, and the new feature is great, I wouldn\\\u0027t be without it now, but may of us get more pleasure from the difficulty it used to present, but that was just with the build.\n\nThe actual flight with something like this will still be hard, unless the game is better at checking node\\_colliders now you\\\u0027ll have lots of scary moments whenever you reload with a capsule in the claw ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LazerEagle1","CreatedById":25977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T20:16:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It was harder, and the new feature is great, I wouldn\\\u0027t be without it now, but may of us get more pleasure from the difficulty it used to present, but that was just with the build.\n\u003E \n\u003E The actual flight with something like this will still be hard, unless the game is better at checking node\\_colliders now you\\\u0027ll have lots of scary moments whenever you reload with a capsule in the claw ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYeah, I\\\u0027m gonna make a prototype ship with this concept, this was really just to demonstrate how it worked."},{"CreatedByName":"DeadlyPear","CreatedById":9606,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T23:13:23Z","Content":"I think I made a good design for ships stranded on the surface, I will post results once I complete the mission.\n\nEdit: Mission failed.\n\nThere should really be a \u0027Are you sure you want to end this flight\u0027 thing :\\\u0027("},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T23:17:04Z","Content":"I better sort my pics out and post mine as well, there are so many though, I was spamming the F1 key."},{"CreatedByName":"DeadlyPear","CreatedById":9606,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T23:54:46Z","Content":"Well, since that mission failed.
