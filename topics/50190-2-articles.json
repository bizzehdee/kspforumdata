I remember in micromanagement games that, while I\u0027m busy working on something, news flashes pop up, informing me of some tech developed by a rival, or our own R\u0026amp;D labs. It would be nice say, if you just arrived on the Mun that some news flash pops up on screen saying that the engineers back in Kerbin have just discovered how to make nuke engines (well of course, this would mean that, when you select its development in the tech tree, the science points won\u0027t take effect immediately...but then I like delayed gratification). It would recreate historical moments like, when Apollo 16 was on the moon, Young and Duke received news from Houston that the US Congress just approved the building of the space shuttle, or something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T18:53:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T18:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane to become stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"borisvolodnikov","CreatedById":78010,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T18:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENumber 1 feature request from me at this stage: add the currency to career mode to make it an actual career mode, rather than guided sandbox (not to say that I\u0027m not having fun with SCIENCE! we just need more substance now to make it a true \u0022game\u0022 rather than a interplanetary train set).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T18:59:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EResources is number one on my wishlist.
