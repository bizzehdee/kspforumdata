I thonk this is were they are going. And as point of argument NASA has clearly stated that they do not have a meaningful interstellar technology, and it is clear That LFOx is not it. So they are willing to Push alternatives for the same reason the Germans pushed traditional propellants. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe critical point is to place an improved ION drive in circumstances of high payload and I agree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider the problem to be solved viable interstellar is essentially 1g at 1year and the reverse. We cannot even get close to this. And I think all would agree that VASiMR is not it. But even 1/10th this would require an advanced nuclear device. And anything beyond Mars will need nuclear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo an orbit that has significant radial velocity reaching mars with a viable payload is a major step forward in terms of efficiency per mass. If this were not tbe case we would not be arguing about it. NASA is not alone now. all the major space agencies have landed something on the moon and reached or landed on mars, The brits landed beagle but its panels failed to open. So the context makes the problem hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are context specific issues that have to be defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The dV for M intercept in 39 days, this I don\u0027t think is the major problem......strictly in terms of hums on board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Decellerating on martian approach, add a couple of days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Orbital insertion, this will be a problem for Vasmir because the humans have to be on board, decels at peri will have to be kicks which means that time is wasted, Not smart to do Aerobraking with panels or nuclear, and the drive could be damaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. LFOx carried to decel and land, which means a lander weight, which means payload doubles or triples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets say you are at 50 days, you left mars, at 39 days earth was slightly ahead of Mars, now its several degress ahead, there will be know 39 day return. The ship will have to reach the Vasmir and that ship will have to kick its to a higher period. And then it have to produce double or triple the radial velocity, because simply reducing orbital velocity will slow the ship relative to earth it will not regain higher speed until close to perigee. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. So the ship now has to maintain its orbital speed by applying alot of negative radil velocity, it will need to oeri at almost venus-mercury orbit and then intercept earth coming in, The gain is the lander can be jettisonned, but Now slowing to earth is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. One solution is given the energy is to stop at L2 and transfer the crew to a pod for transfer back home, a second is once arriving past L2 decel into a elliptical orbit and kick back to ISS and dock, refuel the ship and recrew it, then exchange Martian crew for A soyuz pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Since the lander is not time dependent, it can be sent on a regular Hohman a year before the crewed mission and parked in a martian orbit. You could Even land a return lander on Mars if you can control the landing site lication. So niether the lander or the return launch vehicle need to transit in 39days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. So that leaves the essential problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssential problems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You have a free docking port, you can LFOx into a mars crossing orbit, we know we can get 100 tons x whatever of feul from the russians, this is not the problem, the problem is the time and thrust required fir an ION drive to stop at Martian Insolance. It maybe the case that only Nuclear can do this. Panels and girders and/or radiators would have to lose alot of mass per watt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. That venus crossing orbit is loaded with problems, there is alot of sun, but you dont need sun at least not until close to earth, you could have a shield ship that intercepts interior to venus but thats really difficult. You could reposition the panels. the dV required would mean weeks of peak acceleration off of Mars, assuming a load of argon was supplied with lander coupling. you could partially fold one panel to reduce absorption and store the others but this also adds weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The essential Mars return vessel landing is not solved. We could sky crane humans down but not the return ship, too heavy. alternative is to use indvidual command chairs in which you have a controlled ascent to an apogee that then circularizes, three ships for three nauts, the weight of each launch vehicle is cut. lol. Samples would have to be curtailed. you could land a ship and the nauts refule from separte fuel lands. You could have dead minimu weight lauch vehicle in which no food water, and minimal air to reach the vasmir. you could intercept the ship at an eccentric opa used an EM tether to quckly grab it and then pull it to a minimum orbit which vasmir intercepts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo right now as it stands a one year Mars mission is only viable as a suicide mission. The landing mission alone begs fir two ships and 2 or more LEO fuelers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return ship begs for at least 1 more ship and at least 1/2 a ship for argon or a shield ship with nuclear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets say we are arguing about the best of several bad alternatives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T19:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo achieve the \u002239 days to Mars\u0022 trajectory that started this whole thing, you need jet powers on the order of Gigawatts.

Are you stating my point, that the weight of the radiator system dominates the whole thing? For a given thrust, you get a given jet power (the energy in your exhaust). And if you pick an engine, then you have a given efficiency in heat-to-thrust conversion, so you also get a set waste heat to get rid off.

Just like your fridge keeps part of your house slightly colder than the rest, using a boopload of energy, a convection radiator, and a complex fluid compression/expansion system.

So you move forcing that heat with a heat pump, this consume power (much more than a simple electrical pump, but it does not matter because they are two very different things.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m using Lithium because it is one the best at moving amazing quantities of heat from point A to B with the minimum mass. But you touch a very good point here, the \u0022secondary\u0022 radiators. I know they would not bother the high-temperature radiators... they would be too big to notice them, even if they only reject a fraction of the heat. It\u0027s funny how people forget that \u0022secondary\u0022 system, which is likely to weight \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E than the fancy high-temperature radiators that handle the nuclear core. I mean, anything with a magnetic nozzle (and VASIMIR and every other high power, high Isp engine has one) means superconductors working at spitting distance from the main reaction chamber. In VASIMIR\u0027s case, about \u003Cem\u003E40% of the the electrical power going to the engine gets wasted as low level heat\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E you have had \u0026gt;50% losses in thermal-to-electric conversion, so you are dealing with heat on sensitive electronics and high-power magnets that needs to be rejecter at a MUCH lower temperature. Hence, your \u0022secondary\u0022 radiators are likely your main radiator wings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithium has low heat capacity, I read in some place that ferrofluids or other different kind of metal liquids are more promising.

Shorta. That is tricky, they have actually built themselves the ion engines \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E wanted, Chang-Diaz just got a few technology development grants to work on the side on his own company. But I\u0027ll grant that. In any case, NASA is interested in a 200kW VASIMIR, to get an awesome payload fraction in a very expensive future probe, or do a crazy mission with incredible dV requirements (like putting a telescope at the sun\u0027s gravity lensing point). Certainly no NASA engineer believes they will ever use a VASIMIR to send a crew to Mars in 39 days, I hope.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThey plan to use it as first application, to keep the space station in orbit. \u003Cp\u003ESo if that works fine, then they will use it for any other application they want. a mars mission is not discarded, more taking into account that this was their main excuse to not go to mars in all these years.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMeaning 65% of the energy is low-level heat deposited in your solar panels.

Usually a more reasonable figure for that is 15% according to most literature (i.e: Zubrin popularized that figure), but as you point out, the mass to stop (~100mT) is so over what we have done to date, you would have to develop some pretty smart tech, like inflatable heatshields, supersonic ballutes, or something similar. Certainly a bigger heatshield that your LV\u0027s diameter is in order. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I actually budget ~800m/s dV for terminal deceleration and touchdown, at about 10 times the martian surface gravity in acceleration since I gave the ship 1G acceleration fully loaded, and it gets to Mars almost empty of fuel. I \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E have overspec\u0027ed everything because I know this is a very rough proof of concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is to trust in ISRU: the first one would drop a ~50mT ISRU factory, and test it before the flight back. Cuts your dV for the mission in roughly half, and you can imagine what that does to your single-stage mass ratio.

Depots, much less so. Basically, why would you go through the trouble of lofting an extra tank, when you can use the one in the ship you are refueling? Makes no sense.
