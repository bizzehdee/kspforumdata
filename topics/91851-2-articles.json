(This can be in a future update.) That way, researching higher tech probe cores actually makes sense, and it lets you grant your craft the skills of a pilot without having to train one - in exchange for the multitude of downsides that using probe cores has (electricity upkeep, no reports or surface samples, weak reaction wheels). Perhaps the \u0022maneuver\u0022 and/or \u0022target/anti-target\u0022 modes could remain reserved for actual Kerbals, but the rest sounds easily fair game. Heck, you could even mount a high-level probe core to a manned craft to add some maneuvering assistance when the designated pilot is fresh out of the recruitment office, until he has learned some skills of his own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps four tiers of probe cores: first tier can do nothing, second tier can do stability assist, third tier can do that plus prograde/retrograde, and the fourth and final tier adds both normal and radial vectors.
