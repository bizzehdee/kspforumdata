Keybinds were not loading correctly in the original 1.13 version. When you upgrade, please check the keycode window to make sure Alpha 1 through 10 (zero) are still assigned.

The way loading action groups works has two error traps that your report seems to bypass. First, only actions on a part are valid to be assigned to that part so an engine activation action on a fuel tank is supposed to be not possible. The other bypass is that for action groups 1-10 I port the actions back to KSP in real time. This is a second step that should keep an action from being assigned to the wrong part, or have an action assigned twice, once on the wrong part and once on the correct part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAnother reason for the porting of groups 1-10 to KSP means that when you installed AGExt, it should have picked up your previously assigned actions and bound them for you.
