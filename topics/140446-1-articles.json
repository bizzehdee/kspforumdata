I proceeded to check my email. I walked away, and it started to rain and thunder. So, being the smart laptop user, I unplugged the computer so any power surges wouldn\u0027t screw anything up. I came back about\u00A0an hour later, \u00A0and the screen was all black, but the power light was on, and the ring of light around the mousepad was still lit, so the computer was still on. I figured that the battery was low, so I plugged the cord back in. Nothing. I restarted the computer. About a minute later, it happened - the Blue Screen of Death. I thought, \u0022Oh s#!t, my computer is screwed!\u0022 Then I did what any person would do - turn it off and on. I rebooted fine. I\u0027m going to have it checked by the people at Best Buy. But that was the first BSoD I\u0027d ever seen in person. I\u0027d had the laptop for four years. I\u0027d used computers in the labs at school, and even though they were state-of-the-art at the time, they were still Windows XP and 98. I have an old HP Windows 95 in the basement that still runs - never seen it bluescreen.

Around...six years ago? I was using a Dell machine at the time, probably with XP or something. There was a lot of problems leading up to that, however. Mostly involved with leaving it outside while renovations took place in my room, probably.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLately, my desktop has been plagued with various errors every time it boots back up after a power failure. It seems to run through every error it knows how to throw before finally calming down and running. If you shut it down on its own terms, however, it seems to be fine.
