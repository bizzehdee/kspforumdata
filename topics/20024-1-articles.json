Also, landing on Duna is a bit quirky: one must make sure to break enough so that the craft is not torn to pieces when the cuhtes deploy (happens frequently) while at the same time conserving enough fuel to make it out of Duna\u0027s meager atmosphere again! If done correctly, the lander\u0027s center of both thrust and drag have been deliberately placed towards the rear of the craft which allows it to auto-stabilize itself during landing. Also worth noting is that the four extra nuclear engines could be removed for a reduction of weight. However, this would extend the required burn to around 15 minutes in order to catch up with Duna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning to modify this vessel to make it suitable for missions to Eve; I\u0027ll probably end up attaching more rockets to it to clear Eve\u0027s thicker atmosphere and gravity well.

Returning safely (or just returning at all) to Kerbin requires a few more thousand m/s of delta-V than just reaching the destination. The rocket equation demands that for every pound of fuel you need for the return trip, you also need an extra pound to get the first one to the destination. So any stock rocket rated for interplanetary return to Kerbin is going to be gigantic.
