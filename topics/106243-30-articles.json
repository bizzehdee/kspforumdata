Basically I\u0027ve added in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E to the front of a few lines (using the LiquidFuelOxidizer compatibility file as a reference), however since the LiquidFuel compat. file looks for parts that don\u0027t have oxidizer specifically (i.e. parts with only liquid fuel). At some part of the process the default BDB parts get patched to only use liquid fuel, which this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch then builds upon. To give some context/an example the file I\u0027m attempting to give the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E option to looks like:  \n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@RESOURCE[LiquidFuel],!RESOURCE[Oxidizer],!RESOURCE[MonoPropellant],!MODULE[ModuleTankManager],!MODULE[InterstellarFuelSwitch],!MODULE[FSfuelSwitch],!MODULE[B9PartSwitch],!MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX],!MODULE[ModuleEngines]]:NEEDS[InterstellarFuelSwitch\u0026!CryoTanks\u0026!ModularFuelTanks\u0026!RealFuels]:FOR[InterstellarFuelSwitch]\n    {%LF = #$RESOURCE[LiquidFuel]/maxAmount$\u002BOX = #$RESOURCE[Oxidizer]/maxAmount$%totalCap = #$RESOURCE[LiquidFuel]/maxAmount$@totalCap \u002B= #$RESOURCE[Oxidizer]/maxAmount$\n    %onlyLH2 = #$totalCap$@onlyLH2 *= 5\n    %cryoPower = #$onlyLH2$@cryoPower /= 500MODULE:NEEDS[!WarpPlugin]{\tname = InterstellarFuelSwitch\ttankSwitchNames = LiquidFuelOxidizer;LiquidFuel;Oxidizer;MonoPropel;Hydrogen\tresourceGui = LFO;LiquidFuel;Oxidizer;MonoPropellant;LqdHydrogen\tresourceNames = LiquidFuel,Oxidizer;LiquidFuel;Oxidizer;MonoPropellant;LqdHydrogen\tresourceAmounts = #$../LF$,$../OX$;#$../totalCap$;$../totalCap$;$../totalCap$;$../onlyLH2$\ttankTechReq = start;start;start;advFuelSystems;largeVolumeContainment\ttankResourceMassDivider = 8;8;8;6.66666666666;5.5\tadaptiveTankSelection = false\torderBySwitchName = true\tdisplayTankCost = true\thasGUI = true}\n    MODULE:NEEDS[WarpPlugin]{\tname = InterstellarFuelSwitch\ttankSwitchNames = LiquidFuelOxidizer;LiquidFuel;Oxidizer;MonoProp;Hydrogen;Nitrogen;Argon;Methane;Ammonia;Hydrazine;CO2\tresourceGui = LFO;LiquidFuel;Oxidizer;MonoPropellant;LqdHydrogen;LqdNitrogen;LqdAmmonia;Methane;LqdArgon;Hydrazine;LqdCO2\tresourceNames = LiquidFuel,Oxidizer;LiquidFuel;Oxidizer;MonoPropellant;LqdHydrogen;LqdNitrogen;LqdArgon;LqdMethane;LqdAmmonia;Hydrazine;LqdCO2\tresourceAmounts = #$../LF$,$../OX$;#$../totalCap$;$../totalCap$;$../totalCap$;$../onlyLH2$;$../onlyLH2$;$../onlyLH2$;$../onlyLH2$;$../onlyLH2$;$../onlyLH2$;$../onlyLH2$\ttankTechReq = start;start;start;advFuelSystems;largeVolumeContainment;highPerformanceFuelSystems;highPerformanceFuelSystems;specializedFuelStorage;specializedFuelStorage;exoticFuelStorage\ttankResourceMassDivider = 8;8;8;6.66666666666;5.5;8;8;8;8;8\tadaptiveTankSelection = false\torderBySwitchName = true\tdisplayTankCost = true\t\n\nBasically I\u0027m trying to add oxidizer back in in order for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E option to include both liquid fuel and oxidizer, which is accomplished in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E compat file by adding the OX variable, which the resourceAmounts line then reads from. However, I have no idea how to set up this patch to add in oxidizer. I thought about setting the OX variable to use the liquid fuel as a base (i.e. change it so it reads \u002BOX = #$RESOURCE[LiquidFuel]/maxAmount$, however the totalCap line needs oxidizer to read from as well. Can anyone help me with this patch so I can finally get my Apollo 11 mission underway? I\u0027d greatly appreciate it! My only other option as far as I know is to remove IFS and if that goes, then does KSPi (WarpPlugin). The other option I was thinking of going with is omitting BDB parts outright by changing the @PART[\\*] line to include @PART[!\\*bluedog,!\\*Bluedog]. That way it will only use B9PartSwitch as opposed to IFS.\n\nThanks for your time and any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\\*Update\\*\n\nFound a temporary workaround for it for now.
