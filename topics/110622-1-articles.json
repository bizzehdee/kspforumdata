They are a 2000 degree part like most everything else. Flying at 18k-20k altitude at 1200m/s.

Only 1 of the 2 singles will actually be connected to both doubles, the other will only be connected on one side. In real physics (ignoring for a moment that the real world doesn\u0027t have restrictions on connection types), there\u0027s only half the path for heat to be conducted there, but not sure if KSP physics cares about connection size for heat transfer."},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T11:22:56Z","Content":"From what I can tell there may be a missing piece of the config (I\u0027m looking into this as well).\n\nIt appears to be missing from the configs:\n\n thermalMassModifier = 4.0\n\n emissiveConstant = 0.95\n\nI\u0027ll be testing on this later, but you might want to give it a try first.

The emissive constant is for radiating heat, which is one of the special things that solar panel do -- so that should likely not be applied here. \n\nIf you want to fix it without mods, you can put the ladder inside the sonic shockwave of something else. The sonic shockwaves extends out in a cone from the origin part, but only has a limited length. They basically seem to correspond with the cone of flame you can around the various pieces. If you put it inside that cone, with a length from it lower than the length of the flames, then it should be much more protected. I think NathanKell or Claw posted a diagram of this protective cone somewhere on the forums.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T03:46:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T03:42:53Z","Content":"The reason ladders always blow first is their low thermal mass, which causes them to heat up faster.
