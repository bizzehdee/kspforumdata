That\u0027s an interesting comparison you make because, apparently, the 0.21.1 SAS is supposed to hold a heading once it engages locking mode. MechJeb\u0027s KillRot handles my off-balance craft just fine, the 0.21.1 SAS does not (or it does, but not for me, my install/computer seems bugged).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orangexception","CreatedById":72566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T14:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKillRot will use all your reaction wheel power, so it\u0027ll slow things faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder most circumstances, I find the SAS will kill rot just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
