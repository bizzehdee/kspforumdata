Later, when the mice were sleeping, the researchers monitored the animals\u0027 brain activity as they replayed the day\u0027s experiences. A computer recognised when the specific place cell fired; each time it did, a separate electrode would stimulate brain areas associated with reward.When the mice awoke, they made a beeline for the location represented by the place cell that had been linked to a rewarding feeling in their sleep. A brand new memory - linking a place with reward - had been formed.\n\nSoo, inception soon?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T10:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T10:07:59Z","Content":"You are already incepted you just don\u0027t know it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T15:08:01Z","Content":"Screw Inception.\n\n![anigif_enhanced-buzz-12325-1362400573-0.gif](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr03/2013/3/4/7/anigif_enhanced-buzz-12325-1362400573-0.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T15:31:43Z","Content":"Huhm ... more like a dream commercial ... the mouse already knew the maze, all they did was raise its desire to get there.\n\nSo, if your SmartClothes register which neurons fire during a TV ad and stimulate your pleasure zones during the night, they can make you visit junk food joints and buy useless tech gimmicks, hurray future!"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T15:32:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Screw Inception.\n\u003E [http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr03/2013/3/4/7/anigif_enhanced-buzz-12325-1362400573-0.gif](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr03/2013/3/4/7/anigif_enhanced-buzz-12325-1362400573-0.gif)\n\nThey are actually thinking about that (learning while sleeping). But right now they are just able to hijack the re-compiling information process that goes inside the brain while you sleep and add a new memory based on it. So while you may remember you hate something, if they get into your brain, they might make you actually remember you strangely like it a lot. Kind of a horrifying application."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T17:31:17Z","Content":"Of course, every new thing has its awful applications.
