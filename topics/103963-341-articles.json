Wonder what\u0027s different on your config?  hmmm...  Weird is all I can say.  Must be a GPU-driver based difference.\n\nEDIT:  Oh!  Spectra and Astronomers both don\u0027t presently account for the new 1.9 \u0022Ultra\u0022 Kerbin shader.  I used to work around this, but I don\u0027t in recent builds because it\u0027s not technically the correct way to interpret the data. \n\nTo fix, You need to lower the Spec R,G,B values in the Kerbin Atmo.conf file by about a factor of 5 (divide the number by 5 and round, basically).  That seems to be what the Ultra shader needs.  It\u0027s weird I know, but I can\u0027t implement that in code because it only applies to Kerbin (or well, I could technically but I feel this is more the visual pack authors duty).\n\nI will advise them of this so they can make a proper config.  Spectra is a close second to Astronomers in my \u0022favorite visual pack\u0022 list afterall.\n\nEDIT:  Authors advised:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002280363\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8370159242\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/159443-12-191-no-kopernicus-spectra-v124-visual-compilation-10th-february-20/page/34/\u0026tab=comments\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=3763327\u0026embedComment=3763327\u0026embedDo=findComment#comment-3763327\u0022 style=\u0022height:268px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-30T04:59:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2020 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gabriel B","CreatedById":200166,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-30T04:59:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, R-T-B said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E that line indicates you are using 1.7.

So I just tested the unofficial version of scatterer for 1.9 and works just as the original did on previous versions. Great!!! That being said, I\u0027m experiencing some weird visual behaviors I also had from previous versions. I know this was previously discussed, but I wasn\u0027t able to find the specific comment talking about this.  \n\nThe \u0022bug\u0022 I\u0027m experiencing is that some of the planets look kind of transparent! Searching through this topic I found a photo from blackrack from 2015 that seems to also show this same visual glitch!

This are from the center of the planet and are visible all the time once scatterer is running. I\u0027ve seen this too on Jool and Eve I think.\n\nHere\u0027s a video I just made showing this effect on Duna. It\u0027s not that easy to see, but you may find the same halos inside Duna always showing. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3Hzcqi3HbM?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-31T00:26:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2020 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by aristizabal951**\n  \nWrote my text inside a quote"},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-31T04:49:03Z","Content":"Please pm me some log files (found in your KSP install root after flight as KSP.log text file) and I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t sort out what\u0027s going on with your system.\n\nThat being said, this thread is supposed to be for official scatterer.
