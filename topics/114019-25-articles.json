I tried to use wing pitch to correct the AOA on a few designs but never had much success. It felt to me like they were inducing more drag than I felt with a high AOA on a craft with wings parallel to the fuselage.\n\u003E I\u0027d consider it convergent evolution. Like how Buran ended up looking so much like STS. Believe me when I say I tried a LOT of sizes and shapes to pull that flight off and would not be one bit surprised if anyone else trying the same ended up with a very similar craft. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve realized that going that distance requires more than just a well designed craft. It will test your skills as a flight captain as well. And it will be ever so rewarding when you finally touch down. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYeah, well, I\u0027m a bit of a geek, so I did a lot of testing before the 4-circle run, to find the optimal altitude for the craft as it burned off fuel and lost mass. Now, I\u0027m doing it all over again. I think since my design has a lot fewer wings and uses the flat strake instead of the Big-S strake, I have a lot less parasitic drag from the wings. That makes the parasitic drag from the fuselage a bigger factor.\nI\u0027m still running all the tests to find the optimum altitudes throughout the flight. The craft starts at 12.8 tons and runs dry at 4.8 tons, so I get up to altitude (start at 23.5km), burn down to 12t total, then enable infinite fuel and let Pilot Assistant hold the altitude until the speed/thrust stabilize. Then I write down an \u0022efficiency quotient\u0022 = (speed/thrust). Then I go up 250 meters and do it again, and then another 250m, etc, until the efficiency starts dropping. After that, it\u0027s a matter of burning of 1000kg of fuel, dropping down to 23.5km, and then measuring the efficiency every 250m. It takes a lot of time to run all the tests (burning 1t of fuel at 0.5-0.8kg/sec takes a *long* time), but it has a huge impact on fuel efficiency. Just a 250m change in altitude can change the gas mileage by \u003E5%. When you\u0027re shooting for 5x around the planet, that\u0027s a quarter of a circumnavigation right there."},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T16:43:15Z","Content":"That\u0027s way more effort than I put into it. I took off, set a lock on heading just after retracting the gear, manually flew up to speed/altitude, locked ascent rate to near zero, then used changes in speed to dictate when/how to climb/dive. I knew roughly what my mean fuel consumption rate would have to be and I just let the calculus run mostly subconsciously. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI never aimed for a record pace or purely optimized flight plan. Just tried to do what I could to reach my mean consumption rate by the halfway mark, then kept doing it for the homestretch. There might be room for an extra lap with your more scientific approach. I\u0027ll be interested to see your results.\n\nAlso, my second-to-last prototype didn\u0027t have any wing strakes. But it ran out of gas just before the fifth desert flyover. I went with the strakes partially for aesthetics and partially to keep the extra fuel close to COM. An additional fuselage tank would have been considerably more difficult to deal with, and I only needed about 80-100 more fuel anyway. I did fill them up completely, though. Filled everything up completely, in fact. That last several hundred km didn\u0027t need that much fuel on its own, but carrying that much fuel with the extra drag meant through the previous 10000 meant that I still used most of it. I\u0027ll have to look back at my album; I don\u0027t remember explicitly noting how much remained. I was just relieved to have made it safely down without needing a reload (really didn\u0027t want the odometer reset by F9) and like I said in the original post, in a little bit of shocked state after the roll-over scare.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T17:03:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**"},{"CreatedByName":"zolotiyeruki","CreatedById":150224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T18:10:26Z","Content":"I seem to remember doing a comparison test with the wet strakes vs the basic ones, and noticed increased drag, but my recollection might be wrong.

My gut feeling is that I would have had enough to go another 1/3 of revolution, so maybe 100 units or so.\n\nLooking back, I may have been able to improve efficiency by moving the COL forward a little.

That took....a long time. Enable infinite fuel, set the weight by emptying the fuel tanks in the SPH, fly it up to 23.5km without losing stability, let it sit at that altitude for 10 minutes to stabilize speed and thrust, go up 250m, repeat the 10 minute wait, do that until efficiency drops. Then revert to the SPH, lower the weight some more, and repeat, in 1 ton increments from MTOW down to empty fuel tanks. I\u0027ve got my flight profile now, just a bit of math left and I\u0027ll have to find 3.5 hours where I\u0027ll be around the house and can periodically come back and check my progress. With almost empty fuel tanks, my cruise altitude will be 27,500m (!) and my thrust will be a whopping 8.1kN. Seriously, 8.1kN will be enough to maintain that altitude at \u003E1600m/s.

I\u0027ve made a few minor optimizations to my craft: eliminated the battery (I only need a little bit of torque when levelling off), emptied the monoprop tanks in the fuselage. I did some tests to see if a ram air intake would provide better efficiency, or a nose cone \u002B precooler. Neither were better than a shock cone intake. \n\nI also am trying something new: since my wings are already angled up, and my drag is minimized when I\u0027m traveling exactly prograde, instead of following my carefully-plotted altitude spreadsheet, I\u0027m using Pilot Assistant to maintain a 0 degree AoA, and as the craft lightens up, it\u0027ll naturally float to a higher altitude.\n\nSo far, the results are promising: I\u0027m flying both faster and with lower fuel consumption than I did in my tests at the same weight. Which is good, since my ascent consumed more fuel than I had anticipated.\n\nEDIT: 3 laps down! Efficiency is now quite close to expected values.

I swear, this thing doesn\u0027t want to land when it\u0027s empty. It naturally sits with the nose down a bit, but the wings are still angled upward. The approach was still hot, so when I flared in order to land on the main gear first, the stinkin\u0027 thing started climbing again.
