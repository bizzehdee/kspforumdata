Like how Buran ended up looking so much like STS. Believe me when I say I tried a LOT of sizes and shapes to pull that flight off and would not be one bit surprised if anyone else trying the same ended up with a very similar craft. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve realized that going that distance requires more than just a well designed craft. It will test your skills as a flight captain as well. And it will be ever so rewarding when you finally touch down. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYeah, well, I\u0027m a bit of a geek, so I did a lot of testing before the 4-circle run, to find the optimal altitude for the craft as it burned off fuel and lost mass. Now, I\u0027m doing it all over again. I think since my design has a lot fewer wings and uses the flat strake instead of the Big-S strake, I have a lot less parasitic drag from the wings. That makes the parasitic drag from the fuselage a bigger factor.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still running all the tests to find the optimum altitudes throughout the flight. The craft starts at 12.8 tons and runs dry at 4.8 tons, so I get up to altitude (start at 23.5km), burn down to 12t total, then enable infinite fuel and let Pilot Assistant hold the altitude until the speed/thrust stabilize. Then I write down an \u0022efficiency quotient\u0022 = (speed/thrust). Then I go up 250 meters and do it again, and then another 250m, etc, until the efficiency starts dropping. After that, it\u0027s a matter of burning of 1000kg of fuel, dropping down to 23.5km, and then measuring the efficiency every 250m. It takes a lot of time to run all the tests (burning 1t of fuel at 0.5-0.8kg/sec takes a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E time), but it has a huge impact on fuel efficiency. Just a 250m change in altitude can change the gas mileage by \u0026gt;5%. When you\u0027re shooting for 5x around the planet, that\u0027s a quarter of a circumnavigation right there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T16:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s way more effort than I put into it.

An additional fuselage tank would have been considerably more difficult to deal with, and I only needed about 80-100 more fuel anyway. I did fill them up completely, though. Filled everything up completely, in fact. That last several hundred km didn\u0027t need that much fuel on its own, but carrying that much fuel with the extra drag meant through the previous 10000 meant that I still used most of it.

Bill was passing over KSC for the 5th time at 3:17 (hh:mm), so that gives an average time of about 39 minutes for circles 2-5.

The approach was still hot, so when I flared in order to land on the main gear first, the stinkin\u0027 thing started climbing again.
