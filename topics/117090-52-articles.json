And if I add support for any built-in supplies, it will be those from USI-LS (probably through patch/etc).  \n\nTAC is a good concept, but far too filled with kerbal-killing bugs last I played (e.g. unfocused ships would kill kerbals if it detected it ran out of EC, even though it -should- have had plenty of solar power), and the resource simulation was quite numerically unstable (a \u0027closed\u0027 loop would slowly leak resources of one type or another; floating-point rounding errors).."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T16:51:21Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Whenever I make an Interplanetary Ship, I normally stick the docking port on some sort of tube extension or I just put the docking port somewhere else and put a forward airlock there(I know the CM has a hatch, but a forward airlock... A FORWARD AIRLOCK). This is probably the first Orion CM that holds 6 that I can use for orbital operations with a reasonable IVA, so yeah, I\u0027m going to be using this for my big interplanetary ships from now on so that\u0027s why I asked about the docking port. \n\n![dtpZtSN.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/dtpZtSN.png?2)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T16:58:32Z","Content":"Closed loop LS is for noobs ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)   Half the fun is sending up resupply ships.

Even made my own chain once with C/N/H/O and all sort of convertors/scrubber/containers based on Rover\u0027s Karbonite parts. Making it more plausible to mine water to get H\u002BO and CO2 scoops to get C\u002BO, Ore to get C etc, and make fuels (C12H35 for LF, H gas compress to LH2, etc) even the water\u002Boxygen you need for LS, with it being more credible than mining Ore/Karbonite and getting everything out of that one magic mineral. \n\nBut either way, no issues with TAC so far though, no deaths due to warps etc, only LS running out and kerbals dying on their way down because TAC supplies are no longer on SSTU parts since 1-2 updates ago, despite the patch adding them. I just installed OPT Space Plane parts, and they have the supplies added straight away with the TAC patch. Really weird. Jos\u00E9 can you check with the latest SSTU if you do have TAC supplies on new modules (the old ones will retain what they had when you launched them).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T18:59:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T20:02:09Z","Content":"Bug on the interstage fairing.

The HUS now does have LF (still no LH/Ox options), and some craft I made that are missing parts etc. Also a craft I made with the B-CM-X and when loaded it turned into the regular one with heatshield again...
