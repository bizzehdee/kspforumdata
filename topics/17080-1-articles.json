I would like to build space stations and satelites ith those typical solar panels and those strange forms, not only a vertical rocket. I only can do vertical rockets with few parts, all of them vanilla parts: One problem is that I don\u0027t know what many of the parts do or what is their effect. I downloaded some mods and plugins, one mod is extraplanetary parts or sometning like that, carts etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any good tutorial on how to build any of these?
