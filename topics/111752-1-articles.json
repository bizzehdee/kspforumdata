Radius:100.000][Gravity: 0.100]\n\n\u0022Chesta is a asteroid orbiting near dres. it\u0027s brown surface is covered in craters.\u0022\n\nSat (A Yellow Gas Giant Orbiting past jool)\n\n[Eq. Radius:6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0000\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0000 m]\n\n\u0022Sat was discovered shortly after jool, and is identical to it in every way, exept for it\u0027s yellow color and rings\u0022\n\n Amanda (An asteroid orbiting very close to Sat\n\n[Eq. Radius:30.000m][Gravity:0.008 g] \n\n\u0022It was always thought that Sat\u0027s Rings were solid, until a small moon was found orbiting in them.\u0022\n\n Kurt (A Green Ocean moon teaming with life. also has spiky islands)\n\n[Eq. Radius:543,000][Gravity: 0.8g]\n\n\u0022Kurt was the first moon of Sat to be disovered, because of it\u0027s bright green colour created by all the basic life on the surface.\u0022\n\n Kim (A Purple moon orbiting sat in a retrograde direction) \n\n[Eq. Radius:200,000m][Gravity: 0.324g]\n\n\u0022Kim orbits sat in a retrograde direction, Sugesting it was captured. that or it\u0027s a giant purple spacecraft.\u0022\n\n Fon (A Red moon with a thin atmosphere and peaks that streath into the vacuum)\n\n[Eq Radius:890,000][Gravity: 1.5 g] \u0022In Kerbal mythology Fon is the place where bad kerbals go after death. It\u0027s blood red color is said to prove this ledgend\u0022"}]}
