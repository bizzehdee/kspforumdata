Quantum entanglement cannot result in instantaneous communication (although recent experiments are sure suggest that something that looks identical as such) because this would be sending signals backwards in time, violating relativity, and yet we have no reason to understand why time flows, the flow of time is something that resolves as space and time, a process we do not understand, coevolves from quantum space-time an essence we have yet to observe. The basic reason we say time cannot flow backwards is because its never been observed and consistencies on the macro scale with relativity, but relativity does not hold up on the quantum scale. IOW there are several aspects of QM that appear to be such but when we try to convert to classical physics they appear to be something ever so slightly different and we don\u0027t know why.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T21:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQM also gets used by con artists. \u00A0They typically wrap some snippet of QM into some snippet of religion to extract money, time or services from people. \u00A0You can usually find these guys hanging around about three blocks from any major campus. \u00A0The fact that QM seems so strange to the lay person (I am not a physicist and definitely a lay person) gives these folks tools and room to maneuver.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
