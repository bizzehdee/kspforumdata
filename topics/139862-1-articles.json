If you can do that, you can rendezvous and dock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresuming you\u0027re launching to rendezvous, launch below and in front of your target when its approaching approximately 5* (that number may be off, but visually you\u0027re looking for an 8th Pie slice. So imagine a quarter circle and cut it in half)\u00A0off the launch pad (IE, in map view, you can measure a 5* angle between the launch pad and the target). While doing this, make sure the target is set (right click and target), then, as you coast to apoapsis set up your maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom here, play with it until you get a good encounter. At this stage, its okay to have it anywhere under 10km, though if you can launch and then circularize\u00A0into physics load distance (2.3km or lower), then even better. \u00A0Once you have that node set up, go ahead and keep coasting and then make your burn. Be sure to start with your normal/anti-normal (The purple markers) to make sure you\u0027re as close to your targets plane as possible before doing anything else. It will help get you your encounter markers. A good tip here is to zoom in on your projected orbit and compare it to your targets orbit when it comes to burning normal or anti-normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething to keep in mind here is that may have to raise your orbit higher than your targets orbit in order to hit the encounter. If you do this in map mode, watch the markers as you play with the nodes. Once the orange marker shows up, you should see one stay static while the other moves around the orbit. This will help guide you towards an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, once thats done, put your craft on prograde and turn on your RCS. Go into map view, focus on Kerbin (so your screen stays static rather than following your craft)\u00A0and hover your mouse over your encounter markers (non static screen makes it a pain to keep your mouse on these markers)\u00A0so it lists your sep distance and relative speed. Then, using the IJKL/HN keys, maneuver your craft so that the sep distance becomes lower and lower until you get as close as you want to get. 0.1km is ideal, though I typically prefer 0.3km, as it gives me some room to slow down without damaging my target. At this point, you may hit a point where you simply can\u0027t get the distance to go lower no matter which key you hit. In this case, plop a maneuver node on the next asc/desc node, and play with the node until the distance comes down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, once your sep distance is perfect, the issue becomes your relative speed. This also needs to be as low as possible, but is much easier to manage once you have a good encounter. Ideally, you want to wait until you hit your encounter and come into physics load range. At this point, you\u0027re basically landing on the Mun, except the Mun in this case is your target. So, treat your pro/retrograde markers like you would on the Mun, but treat your target as the center of your navball. (like on the Mun when you want your retrograde marker to be in the center of the blue horizon, indicating your coming straight down).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint your craft towards your anti-target marker (the Y shape one) and maneuver your retrograde marker onto it. If your relative speed is very high (2-300m/s range), you will want to use your actual engines for it, as RCS won\u0027t do it fast enough unless yours are very powerful (as in, beyond stock powerful) or you have a ton of them. Push the retro marker on to the anti-target, and then just keep it there as you slow down. The retro marker will move around during this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, once you\u0027ve slowed down to about 10m/s or better, point your craft towards the target marker (the broken circle with a dot) and maneuver the prograde marker onto it. You will have to speed up a bit to do this, as your craft\u00A0is still going backwards relative to the target. Then, just use your RCS to keep your prograde on the marker until you meet up with your target. Be sure during this to stay below 10m/s until you get comfortable doing it faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking isn\u0027t very hard once you\u0027ve rendezvous\u0027d. First set the port you want to dock to as your target, and align your craft with it. You don\u0027t want to rely on the target markers here, and instead eye ball it. You want your craft to be oriented in such a way that, if the port was directly in front of your craft, you could just RCS forward and dock. Once you\u0027re oriented and you have your relative speed cut down to a minimum, start using your RCS to maneuver to the port. Here, you definitely want to be patient, and keep CapsLock turned on at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this does is cut your input by a significant degree so that your RCS comes out in tiny, weak\u00A0bursts rather than full power blasts. One or two pulses of your thrusters in the direction you need to move in is all you need at this stage. So, for example, lets say you\u0027ve done all the above and your target port is 300m ahead of your craft, and\u00A0to your crafts left and above it. So, 2 pulses to the left, 2 pulses forward, 2 pulses up. (in this case, the pulses would push to the right, backwards, and downward, respectively*) and wait. Once you start to get close, pulse in the opposite directions to slow down and eventually stop. At this point, you can pull up your nav ball, and presumably your target marker and prograde marker should be starting to get lined up, if they haven\u0027t already. If they have (that is, center of prograde on center of target), just pulse forward until you meet up and dock. If not, use your thrusters to get the markers lined up, and pulse forward.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce the ports meet, they should magnetize and then dock. If the ports are placed strangely (Such as part clipped, or if theres other things your craft may otherwise be colliding with, you may have to put some thrust forward in order to dock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T06:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid not read the other replies, but I am sure they are well explained and detailed, but my short and quick tips are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen you get really close to your target in orbit (such as 10km or around that range), your navball references will change to be related to your target velocity.
