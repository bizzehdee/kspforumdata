You can easily build a craft that has trouble getting through mach 1, but a few seconds later is starting to overheat due to the speed at which it is flying. Then just a few seconds after that (and just a few thousand meters higher) your engines run out of thrust because they have exceeded their peak power output and because of what seems like two rather significant steps in air density that seem to happen at ~20,000m - 27000m. Put all of this together and it makes aircraft a bit weird to fly. Now, there may not actually be two significant steps in air density in that altitude range, but that\u0027s kinda the point.... whatever is going on, it just seems odd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis impression might be exacerbated by the huge step in technology between the basic jet engines and the turbojets/rapiers. Basic jet engines seem pretty OK, but turbojets will easily push you to speeds that will cook your aircraft. Compare this with real jets, where the limiting factor for your engines is almost never that the aircraft is going to overheat... it\u0027s that the engines just can\u0027t push you any faster. The only aircraft with engines that even come close to the performance of KSP\u0027s turboramjets would be the SR71, and yeah, that thing got really hot and had to be made out of titanium because of it. But check out the engines on that thing! Each of the Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney J58 engines puts out 35,000 pounds of thrust, and are very specially designed around their bypasses and intakes for super high speed flight. The F100 engines on an an F15 each put out 14000 pounds of thrust at a TWR of about 7 to 1, and the F15 is itself known as an energy fighter (very high power). The General Electric CJ610 engine (used on, eg, a Lear Jet) puts out about 3000 pounds of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the basic jet engine matches the Lear Jet, and the turboramjet matches an SR71, there\u0027s a pretty huge gap in the middle that represents engines for the kinds of planes that many people want to build. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, rapiers work a lot like the turboramjets, except that they have a little less thrust at lower speed, max out thrust at higher speed and have a higher max thrust than the turboramjets. I think rapiers are just about right for spaceplanes in terms of their high altitude, high speed performance. But they do still behave like the turboramjets when climbing: An aircraft that can barely push through mach 1 can easily be burning itself up just a few seconds after pushing through. Odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Apparently re-entry heat is largely irrelevant, but I can\u0027t comment on this personally because I haven\u0027t played with rockets much yet in 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Mach 1 represents a point of very high instability for rockets. 1.0 did this as well, but to a lesser degree which was, in my opinion, right on the money. Whether by design or luck, in 1.0 keeping your navball chevron inside the prograde ring would keep you from flipping. This meant that the interface lined up really nicely with what it meant to fly a craft through a stable launch. In 1.0.2 that\u0027s no longer true, and some rockets (not super crazy ones either) will flip even if the chevron seems, visually, to be right in the middle of the prograde ring.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T07:10:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BmB","CreatedById":42188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could re-enter anything safely in 1.0 using airbrakes.

Trick is to come in shallow and use the wings to brake high before you hit the bulk of the atmosphere, it takes a while of skimming the atmosphere at 45 degrees angle of attack but you come down safely with almost no plasma.
