Again, you can kind of think of it as a pressure vessel. It\u0027s not easy to instantly fill a vessel with pressurized gas without risking blowing something up. There is a lot of energy and very strong forces involved in both cases. But it is possible. Even superconductor magnets can be \u0022turned\u0022 on and off. Admittedly, \u0022turning\u0022 them off is a lot easier. The process is known as quenching;\u00A0the coil stops being superconducting, and pretty rapidly dumps its energy as heat. The hardest part is not letting magnet melt down in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of technology allowing us to overcome these difficulties, well, that\u0027s a complicated topic. Lets use an example with something way simpler than a magnet. (If we gave out prizes for deceptively complex topics, magnets would take my first place nomination with no competition.)\u00A0Think about using a flywheel to store energy. It\u0027s amazingly simple and efficient. Humans have used flywheels since, well, pretty much since they\u0027ve known what a wheel is. By the time of ancient Greeks, they\u0027ve done some nifty things with flywheels as temporary energy storage, and it kept finding uses in clocks, trains, gasoline engines, jets, rockets.\u00A0Modern flywheels can store energy for long time with conversion factors far exceeding these of chemical batteries and they\u0027re still cheaper than a battery. So why don\u0027t you have one in your phone? Well, it\u0027s all about energy density. In order to increase amount of energy a given weight of flywheel can store, you need to spin it faster. And at some point, no known material can survive the centrifugal forces involved. Can we make stronger materials? A bit. But there are limits to how strong forces between atoms can be in principle, and that\u0027s all we get to build on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets say you\u0027re writing a sci-fi story in which humans\u00A0are using flywheels for energy storage. If you write a story where we\u0027re using them to store energy from solar panels for use at night and to balance grid demand, you\u0027re writing near-future sci-fi with very plausible setup. It\u0027s probably one of the methods we\u0027ll use for storing renewable energy in the near future, unless we come up with something drastically better. If you will write about airliners powered by flywheels made out of spools of extremely strong fiber, you\u0027re writing something that\u0027s still hard science fiction, but much more speculative. We have fibers that should potentially allow for it, but we have no idea how to make them in sufficient lengths and sufficiently cheap to replace jet fuel. And odds are, we will come up with something better by the time we have this kind of tech. It\u0027s sort of a space-elevator kind of tech, and would, in fact, require similar materials. But it\u0027s not implausible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you write about personal orbit-capable shuttle size of a car that are powered by a flywheel, you\u0027re in Star Wars territory. This would take materials stronger than maximum limits on chemical bonds, meaning, you\u0027re dealing with the kind of unobtainium where you might as well be making up whatever you want. Saying that this magical power source is based on a flywheel at this point is contrived, and unless you\u0027re writing a comedic space-opera, I wouldn\u0027t recommend it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we\u0027re talking about building absurdly powerful magnets, we\u0027re dealing with similar kinds of limitations. We\u0027re not just talking about limits of technology, but of material properties. We can push these a lot further than what we can practically make now, but these limits aren\u0027t infinite. Past a certain point, it\u0027s not just that we don\u0027t know how to make these things. It\u0027s that if we figure out how to make materials tough enough to handle it, we\u0027ll have better ways of dealing with the problem you\u0027re trying to solve. Way, way better ways, which if you want to write into a sci-fi, you might as well treat as magic, because it goes outside of our core understanding of physics. At that point, anything you come up with might as well be magic, so there is no reason to try and explain it with magnets. Unless, of course, you\u0027re intentionally going for that Joules Verne style of sci-fi that\u0027s so naive, it actually becomes kind of charming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-14T08:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Ctable

Again, you can kind of think of it as a pressure vessel. It\u0027s not easy to instantly fill a vessel with pressurized gas without risking blowing something up. There is a lot of energy and very strong forces involved in both cases. But it is possible. Even superconductor magnets can be \u0022turned\u0022 on and off. Admittedly, \u0022turning\u0022 them off is a lot easier. The process is known as quenching;\u00A0the coil stops being superconducting, and pretty rapidly dumps its energy as heat. The hardest part is not letting magnet melt down in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of technology allowing us to overcome these difficulties, well, that\u0027s a complicated topic. Lets use an example with something way simpler than a magnet. (If we gave out prizes for deceptively complex topics, magnets would take my first place nomination with no competition.)\u00A0Think about using a flywheel to store energy. It\u0027s amazingly simple and efficient. Humans have used flywheels since, well, pretty much since they\u0027ve known what a wheel is. By the time of ancient Greeks, they\u0027ve done some nifty things with flywheels as temporary energy storage, and it kept finding uses in clocks, trains, gasoline engines, jets, rockets.\u00A0Modern flywheels can store energy for long time with conversion factors far exceeding these of chemical batteries and they\u0027re still cheaper than a battery. So why don\u0027t you have one in your phone? Well, it\u0027s all about energy density. In order to increase amount of energy a given weight of flywheel can store, you need to spin it faster. And at some point, no known material can survive the centrifugal forces involved. Can we make stronger materials? A bit. But there are limits to how strong forces between atoms can be in principle, and that\u0027s all we get to build on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets say you\u0027re writing a sci-fi story in which humans\u00A0are using flywheels for energy storage. If you write a story where we\u0027re using them to store energy from solar panels for use at night and to balance grid demand, you\u0027re writing near-future sci-fi with very plausible setup. It\u0027s probably one of the methods we\u0027ll use for storing renewable energy in the near future, unless we come up with something drastically better. If you will write about airliners powered by flywheels made out of spools of extremely strong fiber, you\u0027re writing something that\u0027s still hard science fiction, but much more speculative. We have fibers that should potentially allow for it, but we have no idea how to make them in sufficient lengths and sufficiently cheap to replace jet fuel. And odds are, we will come up with something better by the time we have this kind of tech. It\u0027s sort of a space-elevator kind of tech, and would, in fact, require similar materials. But it\u0027s not implausible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you write about personal orbit-capable shuttle size of a car that are powered by a flywheel, you\u0027re in Star Wars territory. This would take materials stronger than maximum limits on chemical bonds, meaning, you\u0027re dealing with the kind of unobtainium where you might as well be making up whatever you want. Saying that this magical power source is based on a flywheel at this point is contrived, and unless you\u0027re writing a comedic space-opera, I wouldn\u0027t recommend it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we\u0027re talking about building absurdly powerful magnets, we\u0027re dealing with similar kinds of limitations. We\u0027re not just talking about limits of technology, but of material properties. We can push these a lot further than what we can practically make now, but these limits aren\u0027t infinite. Past a certain point, it\u0027s not just that we don\u0027t know how to make these things. It\u0027s that if we figure out how to make materials tough enough to handle it, we\u0027ll have better ways of dealing with the problem you\u0027re trying to solve. Way, way better ways, which if you want to write into a sci-fi, you might as well treat as magic, because it goes outside of our core understanding of physics. At that point, anything you come up with might as well be magic, so there is no reason to try and explain it with magnets. Unless, of course, you\u0027re intentionally going for that Joules Verne style of sci-fi that\u0027s so naive, it actually becomes kind of charming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see.... well you make interesting points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNamely that the point I put an idea to paper it is either beyond anything we know how to do or will require answers to questions we have not even asked in earnest yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus using fiction is totally justifiable and I tend to agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am aware that doing scifi stuff by it\u0027s very definition will allow all sorts of stuff I cannot even imagine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNamely warping of space vacuum according to current science requires on paper negative matter... which only exists\u00A0on paper that we know of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd dark energy is so mysterious that we literally call it that because we assume it must be a force we just are not aware of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any rate I think the key to ALL scifi\u00A0tech lies in small manipulation rather than big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe better one is at sewing the better garment they can make, rather than tying knots and calling it good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly,\u00A0a single fish is far more a conplex creature than a star, which is just a bunch of mass inducing a fusion reaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not know the future tech at all, but I take ideas I wish we had that I like and incorporate them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-14T08:33:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2020 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-15T00:19:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is actually another good example, yeah.

And \u0022likely\u0022 is great, because if you\u0027re working on near-future fiction, that\u0027s what you want to hold on to. Things that probably will come to be, unless we stumble on something better, but \u0022unlikely\u0022 is a mixed bag. Because it\u0027s a very loose word and can apply to a wide range of plausibility. If you ever want advice on these things, you probably should be discussing it within context of a setting.

A flying wheel powering a starship is contrived, because if you can deal with materials of that super-strength and these levels of energy, a black hole reactor makes way more sense.

This is particularly relevant now, when a lot of people remember what life used to be like before smart phones and even before internet. When you introduce a piece of technology, if something it relies on is almost magical, then it will change all of society. And make no mistake, modern processors in phones and laptops are absolute magic from perspective of actual computer manufacturers from 50 years ago. They would tell you that transistors smaller than 100nm are flat impossible, and at any rate, heat generation from a chip that runs at several gigahertz and does trillions of computations per second would have to have a building dedicated to cooling it. So I think, people now better than any time in the past understand, at least subconsciously, the consequences of \u0022magic\u0022 technology. If you have to come up with impossible material or drive or energy source, and that\u0027s all it does, it will feel contrived, even if it\u0027s not that implausible outside the setting.
