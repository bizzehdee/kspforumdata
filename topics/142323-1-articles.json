it has nothing whatever to do with rovers or other ground vehicles). \u00A0If none of those twelve is close enough, you\u0027ll never get where you need to go. \u00A0The solution then is to destroy the resonance, which you can do by modifying inclination or\u00A0eccentricity. \u00A0Each of these has a drawback: \u00A0changing inclination changes your ground track at the cost of missing certain latitudes;

This will be 90 degrees ahead of your target -- so your target will be there in 3 orbits = 90 minutes = 90 degrees.
