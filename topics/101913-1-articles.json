Anyway I know what system I am running but my program folder is labelled \u0022Program files x86\u0022 and inside my KSP folder it says KSP_x64 Data! Pardon my tech ignorance but this has left me slightly confused, and I just wanted to double check before I download anything that might mess up my game. Its the only game I play and I love it! I never thought I could have fun playing a game that required me to use a calculator haha (for the sake of efficiency). One of the things I love about KSP is that its helping me to learn just a little bit more about computers and how system files are stored and subsequently processed, anyway I tried to look this up and educate myself via Google but I was fruitless in my efforts.
