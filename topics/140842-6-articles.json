Or just your personal device. I\u0027m asking because I just got myself an older laptop with a real honest-to-goodness mechanical keyboard. I plan to use it for my writing stuff, as it provides a totally distraction-free environment while being portable.

It kinda died a couple years ago, because I got stuck (and busy), and I wasn\u0027t sure if it\u0027d be any good.

But I\u0027ve got good news, neutral news, and semi-bad news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is, I\u0027m working on the last chapter. I have a lot of ideas on the worldbuilding, plot, and character aspects, and I\u0027ll be spending the rest of the month polishing that. And possibly some of March as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeutral news, I\u0027ve really underwritten. Not really a bad thing, but I need to write a lot to really flesh it out. It\u0027ll probably be less than 35k words when the last chapter is finished, and I\u0027ll need to cut 11k off the bat because the plotlines involved aren\u0027t needed at all in my new ideas. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mellow:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_mellow.png\u0022 title=\u0022:mellow:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSemi-bad news is that it\u0027ll probably take a while to write the 2nd draft, due to how much it\u0027ll need to be expanded. Or it could take until the end of March, who knows. But my writing is pretty sporadic. For two weeks it\u0027s like I could write a novel with the snap of my fingers; but then after that, I lose all that steam. So we\u0027ll see. I did put together a playlist of videos I\u0027ll be watching for ideas, and tips too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo show progress, after I finish the 2nd draft\u0027s 1st page, I\u0027ll post that, and my 1st draft\u0027s 1st page to compare, and show progress. As well with the 3rd, 4th, etc (Hopefully not too many) drafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I\u0027m short of ideas. How would aliens communicate/show time passing? They can\u0027t use minutes, hours, weeks, etc. A friend gave suggestions and ideas, like mentioning about how if they\u0027re nocturnal, their concept of \u0022day\u0022 and \u0022night\u0022 is different. And orbital resonance\u0027s with the Moons could add to how they explain time passing, etc. But I\u0027m not sure how that\u0027ll all work out yet. But I do need more ideas, plus names. It gets really repetitive saying \u0022a few moments passed\u0022 or \u0022some time later\u0022 all the time \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-19T21:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, I\u0027m done! It was kinda rushed, and I don\u0027t think anyone wants to see it now, but it\u0027s a rough template of a novel. I got some ideas on how to explain time in the series. Maybe not a great system, but it has to be better than using human units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, in the last few chapters or so, I shoehorned in ideas I wanted to do, so it\u0027s a mess. Then a couple of characters, and their POV chapters are useless, so I\u0027ll cut that out, and then I need to reshuffle the chapters into where they should be, tear stuff out, and rewrite it. For now though, I\u0027m going to focus on worldbuilding, and plot revisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
