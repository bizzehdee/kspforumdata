It landed back at the launch site too, not just anywhere downrange, thanks to mostly going straight up and down. It\u0026#39;s also a big step forward for their ambitions of using it for cheap, rapid-reusable space tourism launches.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpaceX missed the boat (or barge? Hurr hurr :D) on this one, although their flight profile is more challenging and the F9 is much, much larger. And we may yet see a Falcon stage land this year as well when the company returns to flight in December.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a pretty great day for reusable spaceflight, so congrats to Blue Origin!
