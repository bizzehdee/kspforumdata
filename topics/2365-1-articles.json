Managed to get my first rocket into space and also managed to build some ridiculous ones that in true Kerbal fashion left no survivors. Now I am trying to build a multistage rocket to try and reach as far as I could into oooouuuteeeer spaaaace. I ran into a small problem though when the weight of the fuel needed meant my rocket could not get off the ground. The solution to this was of course, more rockets! In particular I figured I could use some lateral decouplers on the bottom and stick a couple help rockets to get the thing off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this is that the lateral decoupler seems to have a quite weak grip, as in the rockets start to wobble and bad things ensue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to use the lateral decouplers responsibly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-15T15:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStruts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe little piece of metal is a champion, just strap them boosters together, use em like duct tape.
