Now I am slightly getting more interested in it and plan to do a day by day progression of missions. So last friday, I got a man into a 100k orbit around Kerbin, then I landed one on the Mun and made it back to Kerbin safely (I have made orbits, before, and even landed, but I believe this was my first succesful manual non mech jeb land and return \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). I also planted a flag on the Mun. My next mission was to get a Rover onto the mun, so I took the base it gives you, added 4 small wheels, lights, and a comms dish and solar panels and was on my way. Landed, quite bad due to my RCS running out on my lander, but got the rover down. Started driving, next thing I know, I flipped her, couldnt go above like 5km/h.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I am asking, what are some rover building tips?? And on top of that, if you make a heavier rover, what are tips to get it into space? I am bad at building lifters for heavier loads (I really try to avoid the rockomax tanks/ mainsails if I can)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECasey.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T10:32:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you drive it in docking mode? It helps with the spinning and flipping by removing pod torque. Also, try disabling the rear wheel motors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as in real life, you can\u0027t turn very well at high speeds. If your rover i is unstable, you\u0027ll need to slow down before turning.

Also, you must build it first on the SPH for fine-tuning and symmetry, then move it to VAB for the booster. Oh - and the CoM must be exactly at the center of the mobile base (especially if you\u0027re planning to land it on its own power)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you don\u0027t like using mainsails, you can always go clustering (they\u0027re much easier to do now).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T11:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe mindful that large heavy rovers using the big wheels tend to be a bit fragile.

Any of the following might help:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Attach a pair of rovers on the side of your lander (I don\u0027t recommend this, because your design looks heavy enough without doubling it). This keeps your lander balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use a sky-crane (a fuel tank on the top with radially mounted engines). This will work well only if your rover is well-balanced. I\u0027d also recommend using RCS thrusters to keep your orientation because these can be hard to steer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Attach a pair of engines on the side of your rover. This may make it unstable at launch, but if you attach a series of radially-mounted boosters in pairs on each side, it might work. (Again, RCS.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Build your rover in smaller parts which can be attached with docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) (This is sort of a cheat) Leave the engine on the bottom separated from the rover by a decoupler. After you decouple, cycle to the engine using the [] keys and end the mission for the engine. Then go to the tracking station and select the rover, which will gently drop to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
