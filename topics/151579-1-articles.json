But this only matters for very big ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, going interplanetary from Minmus doesn\u0027t save you any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than doing your interplanetary burn from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E because you loose the Oberth effect. So, the most fuel efficient way to do it is to either:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRefuel at Minmus, leave Minmus in a highly elliptical Kerbin\u0027s orbit which is timed so the time for your interplanetary injection burn matches your periapsis. That way, you\u0027ll be leaving Kerbin\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E with nearly full tanks, because you start your burn with your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E already near the edge of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. But this is very difficult to time - you need to leave Minmus at a time that puts your periapsis in the correct side of Kerbin and also happens during the transfer window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you refuel a tanker in Minums, the tanker then goes back to Kerbin (possibly making several aerobrake passes) and you refuel your interplanetary mothership in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. That way, you don\u0027t need too much timing, since your orbital period is about 30 minutes instead of an entire week long and the tanker can go back to Minmus to refuel and serve another mission in the future. Such a mission profile is more complex as you have at least two ships you need to dock, aerobrake and send to different destinations. It also means you won\u0027t be leaving Kerbin\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E with as much fuel as the previous way, as you\u0027ll need to burn some 900 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E just to leave Kerbin\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suicidejunkie","CreatedById":155878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T18:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your tanker is as large as it should be, and your docking ports are along the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can use the tanker as a booster stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest of both worlds; fast orbit for making the window, and the interplanetary ship will still have full fuel at the edge of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the tanker needed to boost its AP anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did this for my Dres mission, but failed to return the booster to Minmus as pushing 10k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E through a pack of LV-Ns caused the control node to explode due to overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next version will include a radiator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sneaky Bstard Sword","CreatedById":106377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T18:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222840574\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151579\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478431262\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/6/2016 at 6:21 AM, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncircularizing does not waste \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, because that velocity is stored, your ship goes in a circle, so you just add extra velocity at the right point in your orbit, and you get the velocity you need in the direction you need... but you also have your acceleration perpendicular to gravity, and thus minimize gravity drag losses.
