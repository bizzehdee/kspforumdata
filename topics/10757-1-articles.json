With a bit of elevator trim you can basically leave her alone and she will glide until she runs out of fuel approximately 40 minutes later. \n\nWhen out of fuel, the F-56 can glide for an extremely long time and land very softly with minimal pilot correction. The F-56 is also capable of ditching in water, though the wings do not take kindly to the gesture...\n\nRoll all you want, the wings will not snap off! DO A BARREL ROLL! ???\n\nAt a recent Kerbal aerobatics competition, the F-56 successfully pulled off a low altitude [tailslide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_tailslide) and double inside loop!\n\nRange:\n\nFactory claim: 400km\n\nPractical: 330km\n\nIf launched from a rocket: 2.9 x 10^29^km (no substantial evidence)\n\n\\*Known Issues\\*\n\n- on the runway try not to touch the roll keys, they cause the plane to swerve!\n\n- Wing gear don\\\u0027t *quite* touch the ground, minor instability at low speeds! Take off with full thrust to minimize swaying."},{"CreatedByName":"purple100","CreatedById":10989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T02:16:45Z","Content":"Works as advertised, even with a keyboard.
