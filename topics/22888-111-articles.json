RL-10 would, by far, allow the most interesting possibilities, but the problem is, each would require a fuel tank to go with it.

Such systems, when cobbled together from multiple mods by multiple authors, have a nasty habit of not fitting together, or bugging out on docking. Denny\u0027s S-IVB happens to be 3.75m, so his Skylab will have to be scaled the same. Meaning including it into FASA would be possible, since it\u0027s mostly self-contained, and the important part will be the correct size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the Voyager is done already: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12106-0-23-Lionhead-Aerospace-Inc-ESA-pack-and-Icarus-updated?highlight=Lionhead\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12106-0-23-Lionhead-Aerospace-Inc-ESA-pack-and-Icarus-updated?highlight=Lionhead\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis (and Viking) is partly why I want the Centaur so badly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T23:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tygoo7\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tygoo7\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow about a payload fairing for the Saturn V like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Skylab_launch_on_Saturn_V.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eskylab\u003C/a\u003E?\u003Cp\u003EKSP has a NERVA engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has liquid engines, command pods, solar panels too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

NASA developed and very nearly produced nuclear engines to convert the Saturn V into a ship that went to Mars. If you stick the incompleted M-1 engines to the bottom of the Saturn make everything a little bigger and attach the NERVA engine to the bottom of the service module you basically get the NOVA rocket which was supposed to get us to Mars in 1978 but they cut the funding way before that could happen. Think of the F-1 engines as a SECOND STAGE!
