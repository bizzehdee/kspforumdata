This is exactly what Mechjeb is actually simulating. Not a single launch, that I\u0027m aware of, even before Apollo, correct me if I\u0027m wrong, had a pilot launching from the pad with his hand on the stick....  \n\nSo for me, Mechjeb isn\u0027t cheating. It\u0027s actually providing a tool that should have already been there. The ability for ground control and mission planning to do the math ahead of you, load the algorithms into the ship\u0027s computer, and allow that all you need to do is execute the programs in the right order, to fly the ship.   \n\nRemember - NASA\u0027s challenge was never \u0022have the rocket make orbit because the pilot was steady on the stick.\u0022 It was - \u0022Have it make orbit because it was loaded properly and designed well.\u0022 It was never, \u0022Get to the moon because the pilot can steer a straight line.\u0022 It was \u0022get to the moon because the ship was built to be capable of that, and the astronauts were able to stay on schedule with the program.\u0022   \n\nWhen I load manuever editor, or ascent profile....that\u0027s me punching the math into the onboard computer that I\u0027d surely have, and having that program be run by the computer while I oversee it\u0027s completion. Sometimes there are hiccups. The program doesn\u0027t execute precisely enough, and I have to work out a correction, or the atmosphere affects the program\u0027s algorithm, and you have to manually reset the node (IE - manually punch in a new correction). Mechjeb still doesn\u0027t land on the moon for me, I must descend myself. Mechjeb doesn\u0027t stage. Mechjeb doesn\u0027t EVA for science. And it doesn\u0027t plan the whole trip for me. \\*I\\* plan the trip, by building it in the maneuver nodes.   \n\nSo no, Mechjeb is not \u0027cheating,\u0027 quite contrary, it is a very elemental tool that simulates more conditions we cannot actually replicate in a game. Heck, if anything, we should be able to go into the Tracking Center and literally \u0022Build\u0022 a mission or trip. Using algorithms like \u0022Trajectories\u0022 mod, we should be able to plan an entire set of Manuever nodes that will give us a rounded estimate of DV necessary, as well as giving us a launch window. Never has NASA sent a probe to Mars who\u0027s course wasn\u0027t laid out in full, down to the M/S entry into the atmosphere, years in advance. In Kerbal - we must guess, once we make orbit, THEN we plan our intercept. Once we burn the first time, THEN we configure a fine tune adjustment. All these steps are completed in the real world, here on earth, well before the ship ever leaves. Each ship is purpose built to exactly the weight and thrust needed to reach the target orbit or planet.   \n\nNo one ever intercepted an asteroid at NASA by shooting a probe into orbit and going, \u0022Ok, now where\u0027s that asteroid at?\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T19:15:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bosun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T19:16:38Z","Content":"\u002B1 to Bosun"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T21:46:30Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027Bosun\u0027]I\u0027ll just mention, in case anyone didn\u0027t in the last....29 pages....All spacecraft launched after Apollo began had ascent profiles and programs loaded into them for the pilots to \u0027Execute\u0027 at the right times.

KSP is about much more than just the piloting challenges - there\u0027s the engineering of the spacecraft themselves, setup and management of any infrastructure you may want/need (i.e. life support, EPL, RemoteTech, or any of the colonization mods), the actual exploration when you finally get to your destination, and for Career and Science modes, some management decisions over contracts and R\u0026D.  \n\nI would compare playing with MechJeb to playing a RTS game - You\u0027re controlling your units and telling them where to go (and how to get there), but the decisions of what to do and how you do it are entirely up to you. I wouldn\u0027t ever brag about, say, completing a suicide burn safely that, in reality, was done by MechJeb, or abuse MechJeb to complete piloting contests. I design and test the craft I build, oversee production of individual units, and monitor them as they move to their objectives. Once there, I complete whatever task I set out to do, then recall that mission back to its home base.  \n\nThis isn\u0027t to say I don\u0027t enjoy piloting - in particular, I love flying atmospheric craft and I find orbital rendezvous and docking (which I do without MJ\u0027s assistance) to be really fun. If you enjoy the challenge of piloting ascents and executing maneuvers manually, by all means go ahead. But I\u0027m not interested in manually following the exact same ascent profile for every single launch like some mechanical pilot, so I have an actual mechanical pilot do it for me."},{"CreatedByName":"oglommi","CreatedById":127214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T09:58:55Z","Content":"Mechjeb is brilliant, tedious to do all the launches/landings?.
