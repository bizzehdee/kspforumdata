With mods I already start at 3.7 gigabytes!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like I did. Basically, if you play heavily modded (for an interstellar experience for example) you will be close to max ram usage even with the memory leak greatly reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sollution to this is to run the game in OpenGL.

Now its not as pretty and I dont have smooth edges!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, thats a result of the OpenGL render not having the high end settings that Direct X does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to work around this is pretty simple too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Open your graphics driver software (Catalyst / Nvidia software)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Find whatever tab controlls 3D program / game settings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Add KSP to the list of custom settings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Tweak the settings to be nice! (especialy Anti-Aliasing maxes a difference)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd youre done. The OpenGL version of KSP runs stock at about 2 Gigabyte of RAM, giving you a whole 1.8 Gigs of headroom before it will crash to the memory leak. Youd have to keep the game running for a day or two to do this. If you run modded, the game will not crash after 30 minutes anymore (unless you got buggy addons).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T08:24:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Samlow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETitle reflecting actual content now\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T08:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is nice Samlow, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118658-New-Heat-System-causes-memory-leak?p=1938584\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1938584\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebut turning off the PPFX edge highlighting will stop the leak too\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, and leaves you with a visual indication that you\u0027re getting hot before you blow up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-force-opengl is an unsupported Unity3D game engine command\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E which \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117307-OpenGL-Mode-Doesn-t-Work\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emany players have found to be broken in the latest Unity4x release\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, so it is not recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome players have more luck with -force-d3d11 but expect weirdness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T08:11:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 08:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samlow","CreatedById":144473,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T08:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that PPFX link, that will help a lot too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for me Im already running close to CTD due to heavy mod usage, so Im kind of forced into OpenGL.

I agree that people shouldn\u0027t whine about features like the new aero, it\u0027s just game advancement. However, as a programmer myself, I think 1.0 was released too early. And as paying customers, it\u0027s expected that an out-of-beta 1.0 release be generally bug-free. A memory leak is a huge problem that should have been found during a testing period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while on the subject of memory issues; A 32-bit program that is limited by its own memory limitation should have much better memory management, especially since it\u0027s so easy to build huge ships that can bloat the address space available using only the stock game. Unloading unused objects out of memory, compression, loading on demand and disk caching methods should all be heavily used in order to avoid this problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally use the 64-bit Linux version, but I\u0027ve been trying to use the Windows version because I expected it to be much more stable. Throwing workarounds at the game, and disabling things should not be a solution for a full release. Just like forcing someone to install Linux in order to play crash-free is also not a solution as some people just aren\u0027t that computer savvy, or they don\u0027t have the disk space, or whatever. I have suggested that people install Linux in the past, but again, that\u0027s not a solution, it\u0027s a workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said before, paying customers have every right to complain about an out-of-beta full version game that\u0027s still not stable. As for the previous Alpha and Beta versions, bugs were to be expected, that\u0027s why they were in Alpha and Beta, so there was nothing to complain about because you knew what you were downloading and paying for. Squad should have continued on with Beta versions 0.91, 0.92 etc until stability and memory issues were at least in the high 99%-ish range of fixes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a game developer wants to be in the business, they need to take care of their product.

When the application code frees memory (or it is garbage collected due to having reached a 0 reference count), it is not necessarily returned to the OS. The first step is that it is returned to the application\u0027s \u0022free list\u0022 (often much more complex than a simple single free list these days, with several pools for different size allocations). The application\u0027s memory management will only return memory to the OS in certain circumstances, otherwise it will keep the OS allocation and reuse it when it next needs memory for something. Also, with a language that uses garbage collection, the collection is not instant on every unload. Bottom line, while sustained growth over time probably is a memory leak, some of your observations may not be indicative of a memory leak, since you\u0027re using the OS allocation, not the application\u0027s internal memory allocator to measure it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(load X; unload X) is not expected to necessarily return to the OS memory usage before X was loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(for (i = 0; i \u0026lt; 1000; i\u002B\u002B) { load X; unload X; }) OS memory usage with X loaded should not grow with every iteration of the loop, significant repeated growth on every iteration indicates a possible memory leak, but it doesn\u0027t necessarily follow that the memory usage should be exactly flat over every iteration of the loop, as things like fragmentation of the free memory may require the application\u0027s allocator to request more memory from the OS to make a suitable size block available for an object (despite the application overall having sufficient free memory for the object).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mega_newblar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mega_newblar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEh.
