I knocked together some asteroid-redirect thrusters, determined how to intercept the asteroid, and sent the interceptors on their way-- primary mission, redirect asteroid to avoid an impact, secondary mission lasso it and bring it into a convenient orbit. Kind of exciting, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I wondered-- I only recently figured out how to track asteroids. Out of curiosity, would it still have \u0027spawned\u0027 as an object on a collision course if I hadn\u0027t tracked it? (Presumably, it would hit somewhere far away from KSC and I might hear an unexplained \u0022boom\u0022 or something and that would be it?) Or, by tracking it, did I in essence trigger the current situation? Not sure how big a coincidence it is that the second asteroid I track just happens to be on a collision course...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T12:37:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaxwellsDemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T15:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure the game doesn\u0027t keep track of them for that long unless you do decide to track it.
