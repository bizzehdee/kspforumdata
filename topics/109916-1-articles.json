I\u0027m about to fling some unmanned things at Gilly and Eve, but Eve does not sound like fun. Especially not the taking off bit. That might be beyond me for a bit. Going to post my Duna ship for critique shortly, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach station consists of at least five launches of varying weight, largest being 30t, smallest more like five - core/habitat, comms/power, science lab, docking hub and fuel/resupply. Rendezvous and docking were really daunting at first but now I really enjoy it. Each stationa lso has a crew ferry and Mun and Minmus have reusable landers bristling with science stuff (though one LV-909 for Mun isn\u0027t fun for descent and it might need a replacement). I\u0027ve been cycling four crews through each station for XP in preparation for the Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo much fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boots","CreatedById":144409,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dman979\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dman979\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWelcome!
