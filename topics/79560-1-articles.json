Is there a mod that records game data and allows you to play it back from different viewpoints? A spectator mod? Again I am stumped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Minecraft I\u0027d use an alt account on a different computer, but KSP\u0027s lack of native multiplayer nixs that idea. Has anyone tried with one of the MP mods, like Dark? Even then, station-keeping a camera-dolly-probe at a fixed relative position would be nearly impossible... like windmills, Orbits Do Not Work That Way! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies again if this is misplaced, and TIA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
