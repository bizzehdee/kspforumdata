Problem is the skybox looks like a pile of hot garbage - blurry and pixelated at the same time, and it really breaks immersion for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there any tweak to break out skybox texture quality from the global setting? Would it even be better on CPU or memory load than just running the global texture quality up?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T12:10:14Z","Content":"\nI don\u0026#39;t think stock can do this. You could likely make it happen with [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107471\u0022]Texture Replacer[/URL] and a really high-res skybox, that way lower resolution won\u0026#39;t look as bad.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T17:34:26Z","Content":"\nThanks - I did try that, and it looks just as bad. In fact there\u0026#39;s nothing wrong with the stock skybox at high enough res, it\u0026#39;s just the really, really crummy downsampling. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe if I downsample the skybox myself in a proper photo editor, specifically for the resolution I\u0026#39;m running at, and use Texture Replacer - or would it immediately try to downsample that even more...?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T17:37:58Z","Content":"\nMaybe start with a lower res skybox and increase its resolution, that way when it downsamples it might look close to the original. (Never tried this, but it might work.)\n"}]}
