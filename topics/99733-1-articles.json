And for the first time ever, I made it with more fuel than I needed. Sorta. I\u0027ll try to edit in a pic of my rocket, don\u0027t have time now, but my first stage was a Delta-IV Heavy type stage, 3 orange tanks, 3 mainsails, no extra fuel in the center though, used crossfeed as well. Second stage was a step down from the orange, forget the name. Lt-800? idk. That, and a skipper. Then a transfer stage with a nuke to stay in orbit around Duna and then a Liquid fuel and RCS probe with parachutes, LFO for soft landing and ascent. Well I ended up with a fraction of a unit in fuel to get into orbit with my nuke, and unbeknownst to me, that included my lander. So I soft landed with two radial parachutes and RCS and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be getting into orbit or back home...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I still landed! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Zfwikn1\u0022 alt=\u0022Zfwikn1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zfwikn1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zfwikn1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I inserted my pic right, I\u0027ll edit with a pic of my rocket next time if I didn\u0027t.

You can run them alongside your main engine (provided you follow the second tip also) to give yourself a TWR boost and cut fuel consumption. That might also allow you to use a single stack main engine instead of multiple radially mounted ones, saving money.

In case I didn\u0027t make it clear, the Delta IV doesn\u0027t use fuel crossfeed and the center stage has a little bit more than the radial boosters so that not all three engines burn out at the same time. My \u0022Delta IV\u0022 uses fuel crossfeed and thus doesn\u0027t need extra fuel in the center stage. A little bit different, but it works. Also, to Scotius, I know I could use radial fuel tanks for my nuke, but this is my first inerplanetary mission and I underestimated the fuel consumption of the nuclear engine.
