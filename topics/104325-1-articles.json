I was going to make my first challenge but figured I\u0027d stop here and see if it is even possible in the KSP universe. Maybe some of you have heard in recent news that SpaceX has been trying to land their 1st rocket stage on a floating drone barge for recovery, but to no avail. I figured if there was anyone who could show these guys how it\u0027s done it would be the KSP community.\n\nSOOO my question is this. Is it possible to launch a barge out to sea, launch a craft, and then have your first stage land safely on said barge.. Also, it looks like they use no parachutes, making it extra hard. I am going to try tonight when I get home.\n\nSee SpaceX\u0027s latest attempt.. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhMSzC1crr0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T19:27:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by falloutaddict**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T18:32:19Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s more possible in KSP than real life: we don\u0027t have wind, or ocean drift. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n I\u0027d advise you to scroll through the challenge threads first though, Mr. Musk has been trying to do this for some time and it stands to reasons someone might have already posted such a challenge.
