Did that work as soon as you equipped the gun? Or did you need to fast switch as mentioned before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Does that mean we could offset the ammo to the Kerbal when a weapon is equipped as well? That should remove the uncontrolled rotating in place issue. I had messed around with that once before. And by removing the ammo from the weapon and equipping a backpack the Kerbal remained still. I think it has something to do with having to spawn the weapons as \u0022Physic\u0022 plus the mass of the ammo. Where we can spawn a backpack as \u0022part\u0022 The Kerbal\u0027s seem to reacts differently to the two modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And as far as recoil, we could try messing around with the weapon cfg\u0027s to reduce / eliminate recoil? I will try playing with this tonight.
