When the SABRE is in air-breathing mode, it will pull LF from the LFO tank which will be replenished by the LF-only tank.

If you\u0027re running your sabres on airbreathing mode, they shouldn\u0027t draw from the oxidizer. I usually put a LF only tank somewhere on the ship. The previously mentioned drop tanks always work well on a decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your action group question directly, you can absolutely switch from air breathing to rocket mode at 20km. Use the \u0022Toggle engine mode\u0022 option, and make sure to group them all under the same action group. Afterwards, hitting the same button will toggle them back to air breathing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, I have a spaceplane that has both turbofans and sabres. In that case, I will put \u0022toggle engine\u0022 for the turbofans (turning them on or off) in the same action group as the \u0022toggle engine mode\u0022 for the sabres. in this scenario, my turbofans turn off and the sabres switch to rocket mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I often will put engines on an action group that shuts them off in case of some emergency, like a flameout. I might put them all on \u0022toggle engine\u0022 on action group 9 or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.
