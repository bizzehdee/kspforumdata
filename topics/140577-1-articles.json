I\u0027ve got a rookie Realism Overhaul question for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI downloaded Realism Overhaul manually, and added only the parts that are indicated \u0022necessary for the mod to work correctly\u0022, via CKAN. The cause of this was the fact that CKAN couldn\u0027t download RO, it kept failing every time. Thing is, it looks like solid rocket boosters of any kind, although loaded with what is indicated as PBAN, they won\u0027t ignite, because of \u0022fuel deprivation\u0022. I can\u0027t, however, load the tank with any other fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anybody know of any mods that control the fuel or this behavior?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T17:47:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TheMonkeytect\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
