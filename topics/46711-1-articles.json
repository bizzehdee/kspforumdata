If you want to get to Moho I would suggest you pack along at least 5km/s of delta-V, and an extra 500m/s for corrections. I usually pack 6km/s at a minimum just to feel safe and that\u0027s usually cutting it close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get back you\u0027ll probably need at least 3km/s plus another 500m/s for corrections, but aerocapture removes a lot of the braking delta-V requirements for Kerbin return and you can just do a shallow dive right into landing. Your total budget is going to be around 9.5km/s, probably 10km/s for safety margin.

The Parachute Calculator says you should come down at 5.7 m/s with the single chute. If you choose to add a Clamp-o-tron and use radial chutes (to dock with a lander in Moho orbit, maybe), you\u0027ll need two radial chutes and I can\u0027t guarantee that booster will get you into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you want to do a landing, we can talk more.
