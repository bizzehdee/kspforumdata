Good luck running a jet at 30 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, Kerbin\u0027s scale height is pretty small. According to the formula I found on Wikipedia, assuming the same atmospheric temperature as Earth, its atmosphere would have to have a mean molecular weight of 42.4 g/mol. Assuming an O2 and CO2 mixture, the atmosphere would have to be 13% oxygen and 87% CO2. Assuming an Earthlike 21% oxygen, the remainder would need to be heavier than pure CO2, meaning Kerbin needs to have significant amounts of a gas heavier than CO2. Unfortunately there aren\u0027t many gases like that: apart from weird organic compounds that won\u0027t be stable over geologic time, the only good candidates are Sulfur Dioxide, Krypton, and... wait a second...

Basically, the closer you are to Mach effect territory, the more air you will have for your engines and the higher their thrust will get (the effect is quite dramatic, actually). If you go too slow, they won\u0027t give you enough oomph, so pull down AoA again until you get mach effects and a decent acceleration, then go up basically as fast as you can.
