(Not promoting intake spam, just saying they CANNOT be used at 30km anymore from my testing)\n- Thrust spikes absurdly high (950 / 1150 for turbojet / rapier) at moderate altitudes as speed increases\n\nThis is causing planes that behave as I\u0027d expect only in the lower atmosphere, suddenly turn into a 15g fiery deathtrap in the middle-atmosphere, then cut out again shortly after.\n\nNow I have a lot of experience building spaceplanes in the old model, so maybe I\u0027m just stuck in the old way of thinking. And if the jets are supposed to get a sizable nerf to how high up or fast they can operate at, then fine. But the massive increase in thrust (over 10x!) as you approach the intended operating altitude/speed of the engine is just absurd. At 1000kn a single turbojet is putting out almost as much thrust as two skipper engines!\n\nThe code behind this system seems great - like it could really support an awesome balance for jet engines.

Good luck running a jet at 30 km.\n\nReally, Kerbin\u0027s scale height is pretty small. According to the formula I found on Wikipedia, assuming the same atmospheric temperature as Earth, its atmosphere would have to have a mean molecular weight of 42.4 g/mol. Assuming an O2 and CO2 mixture, the atmosphere would have to be 13% oxygen and 87% CO2. Assuming an Earthlike 21% oxygen, the remainder would need to be heavier than pure CO2, meaning Kerbin needs to have significant amounts of a gas heavier than CO2. Unfortunately there aren\u0027t many gases like that: apart from weird organic compounds that won\u0027t be stable over geologic time, the only good candidates are Sulfur Dioxide, Krypton, and... wait a second... Xenon.\n\nHuh. Does this mean we could use an ISRU converter to extract xenon from Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere?\n\ntl;dr reason #468 why I like RSS."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:19:41Z","Content":"Your thrust spikes may actually be the engine functioning as intended. Turbojets function better at higher speeds. You\u0027ll notice that until you hit Mach 1 they are significantly less powerful than a regular jet. I suspect RAPIER works similarly though I haven\u0027t tested it myself.\n\nAll that said, those max thrust values doe seem rather absurd to me. XD\n\nIn my experience you want to stay under around 1km/s until you are above 25k-30k. Space planes are TOTALLY possible, I have made several already that are capable of achieving orbit without problems, but you are pretty much going to have to throw away everything you thought you knew about how to do it. Personally I\u0027ve stopped thinking it as building a plane and instead think of it as a rocket that just happens to get past the first 20km using jet engines. Which means bringing waaay more oxidizer than I am used to (although I am starting to consider a try with RCS engines. Sorta wish there was an inline version of those)."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:34:46Z","Content":"You\u0027ll get a thrust peak from the engine when you see mach effect visuals around the plane.

Rinse and repeat for a safe, if slightly bouncy, ascent to orbit ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI believe I shall keep pasting this quote until it becomes common knowledge...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Turns out the key is to follow the Mach effects, without blowing up. Basically, the closer you are to Mach effect territory, the more air you will have for your engines and the higher their thrust will get (the effect is quite dramatic, actually). If you go too slow, they won\u0027t give you enough oomph, so pull down AoA again until you get mach effects and a decent acceleration, then go up basically as fast as you can. But, once you get close to the thermal barrier (about 1km/s at 20kms, less if lower) you have to pull up to go higher, faster and thus avoid burning up.\n\nSo far this flight plan has consistently worked on every dumbass thing I\u0027ve made that actually had enough TWR and fuel to get to LKO ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nRegarding 1MN from a single turbo...

Those\u0027re odd ducks\n\nFunny you should mention that; the turboramjet (note: turbo**ram**jet) engine does appear to be modeled on an \u0022only moreso\u0022 version of that engine, i.e. one that switches over much more heavily to ram mode at high speed (rather than only bleeding some of the air around the turbine, on the Blackbird\u0027s J58).\n\nIt\u0027s worth mentioning that, indeed, the jets are very, very OP compared to real life engines. The Blackbird\u0027s J58, that engine which topped out somewhere around Mach 3.5 (we presume), produced only 150kN static thrust (compared to the TRJ\u0027s 180) on 2.7 tons (compared to the TRJ\u0027s 1.8 tons). And the TRJ can provide useful thrust past Mach 4. Besides, the J58 was about 1.4 meters in diameter, not 1.25m. Oh yeah, and the TRJ is about 10x the efficiency (Isp) of the real engine.\n\nNow some of that is presumably because we can\u0027t make planes as well-streamlined as the Blackbird. But let\u0027s recall that the Blackbird had about 60 tons takeoff weight, on 2 J58s (300kN static thrust afterburning, total). Scaled, that\u0027s like using only two TRJs for a 72 ton craft.

Those O-10s are now worthless when every single other engine is better suited for flight.\n\nAnyways, as for SSTOs, they still work, but forget achieving 400km AP and 50km PE with nothing but jets\u002Bairhogging. Right now a single RAM/engine is plenty, and you can probably even get away with a single side mounted intake too (like those precooler things). Also, the absolute max ejection velocity ive managed myself is 1600ish m/s, any more and your TWR just wong cut it even if you spam engines. Im guessing with inf fuel and just a pod\u002Bengine\u002Bnose cone, you can pull off more, but i dont use inf fuel unless im screwing around in DPM. The hard limit is the engines failing at 30ish KM, and while you can get the highest velocities down near 10-15km, if you try to gun it at 1500m/s that low you will fry (using stock heating amounts).\n\nFinally, wings are all but useless for anything but landing, ive switched to nothing but 3 delta-deluxe wings for every SSTO thats under 15t and a control surface in the front, more then enough lift and it doesnt add excessive drag either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T16:52:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:58:22Z","Content":"Is it still possible to get to orbit as an SSTO without RAPIERS?
