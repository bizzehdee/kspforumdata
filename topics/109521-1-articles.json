Granted I didn\u0027t use the Mk1-2 command pod much. In my tests I had the command pod, either a M16-XL or Mk25 on the nose (2 separate tests) and 4 mk12 radial chutes. no extra heatshield and I had a stack separator to lose the engine. So it was literally just the command pod and chutes. In both cases I ended up splashing down at like 30m/s. Seems overly excessive given the larger parachutes seem made for the nose of that capsule.\n\nIs there a way to figure out how many chutes you need without trial and error?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T17:48:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:11:59Z","Content":"Be aware that the Mk25 and Mk12-R are \u0022drogue\u0022 chutes, designed to slow you from \u0022really fast\u0022 to \u0022still too fast to land\u0022.

One thing that changed with 1.0 is that chutes open gradually now, instead of popping open instantly. On the one hand, that\u0027s good (no more sudden G shock sometimes ripping your ship apart)... but on the other hand, it means that the chutes take more distance to slow you down, so you need to allow for that."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:37:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Be aware that the Mk25 and Mk12-R are \u0022drogue\u0022 chutes, designed to slow you from \u0022really fast\u0022 to \u0022still too fast to land\u0022.

I never noticed two types of radial chutes before. Helps to pay attention to the changes I guess.\n\nEdit, yea found the Mk2-r big difference. kind of annoying with the mods i have that the chutes aren\u0027t all together in the parts window anymore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T17:46:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp**"},{"CreatedByName":"The-MathMog","CreatedById":36417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:53:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh snap, are those new?

Meanwhile, I still use [http://ksp.freeiz.com/](http://ksp.freeiz.com/) for parachute planning. The site is not perfect for the new aero model, but I find it works well enough for starting guidelines."}]}
