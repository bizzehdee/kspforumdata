Granted I didn\u0027t use the Mk1-2 command pod much. In my tests I had the command pod, either a M16-XL or Mk25 on the nose (2 separate tests) and 4 mk12 radial chutes. no extra heatshield and I had a stack separator to lose the engine. So it was literally just the command pod and chutes. In both cases I ended up splashing down at like 30m/s. Seems overly excessive given the larger parachutes seem made for the nose of that capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to figure out how many chutes you need without trial and error?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T17:48:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe aware that the Mk25 and Mk12-R are \u0022drogue\u0022 chutes, designed to slow you from \u0022really fast\u0022 to \u0022still too fast to land\u0022.

One thing that changed with 1.0 is that chutes open gradually now, instead of popping open instantly. On the one hand, that\u0027s good (no more sudden G shock sometimes ripping your ship apart)... but on the other hand, it means that the chutes take more distance to slow you down, so you need to allow for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBe aware that the Mk25 and Mk12-R are \u0022drogue\u0022 chutes, designed to slow you from \u0022really fast\u0022 to \u0022still too fast to land\u0022.
