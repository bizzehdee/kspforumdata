Without stating what Nate is doing (and I\u0027m not suggesting any sort of NateTracker or anything), simply saying he is checking out player creations, without saying he is doing anything else is selling him short. Presumably he is working hard coaching the team to release the first patch, but with only the comment from the CM, all we know is that he is browsing pics of rockets and \u0022liking\u0022 the cool ones.
