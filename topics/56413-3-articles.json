The thrust that\u0027s listed is throttle * max thrust * the velocity curve, and your plane accelerates based on that. So now you have an actual mass flow, and an actual thrust, so you can calculate the actual Isp. Basically, you just multiply the listed Isp by the velocity curve.

You can run a jet at whatever throttle you want, it won\u0027t flame out just from being at low throttle. I have experienced that if I let throttle go to zero, I need to bump throttle up well above zero before the jet starts using fuel (and maybe generating thrust, but usually when I see this I\u0027ve reached orbit and just want to dump excess jet fuel before an interplanetary cruise).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-17T06:40:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2013 06:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by numerobis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T06:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I agree!
