With the unconfusing layout, once you get the hang of it, you can easily make your missions feel so much more lifelike.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I recently got inspired to make one of my own after an unfortunate Mars mission. After my Mars lander exploded into about a million tiny little pieces, Artemis Kerman waited above in the Orbital module. As she was alone, she was consuming less than three kerbals would, so that was alright. The big issue, though, is that I had failed to bring extra Nitrogen and thus I didn\u0027t have enough to keep my pod pressurized longer than 1 and a half years (which sucks since I have to wait 405 days until my transfer window opens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this got me thinking. Well, I have PLENTY of O2 left, so why can\u0027t I just use more O2 for pressurization. While I know\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erealistically\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this isn\u0027t exactly the best idea,\u00A0but come on. This is a game about green men.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI want to make a mod similar to Kerbalism that employs the ability to change:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPressurized Capsule Gas Concentration (How much O2, N2, or CO2)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow pressurized the capsule is (Instead of 1atm, why not pressure the capsule lower in order to preserve resources?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCaloric intake of Kerbals (In fact, kerbals now have a daily caloric intake they need to meet in order to maintain certain health levels. Using too little calories may cause a kerbal to become underweight, while the opposite may cause a kerbal to GAIN weight. A kerbal who has gained weight LITERALLY weighs more, so if a kerbal gains weight during a transfer and then hops in a lander, the lander might have more troubles with weight than you originally thought. Also, this way you can stretch your food supplies in case of emergencies).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSicknesses. So far there aren\u0027t (that I\u0027m aware of) any life support mods that actually contain any actual \u0027health\u0027 requirements for Kerbals. You can change cleanliness settings, such as choosing to launch with a\u00A0super-steralized pod or choosing to launch without cleaning the pod. You can also choose to quarantine a Kerbal after visiting space/another planet in case they come down with a space sickness (inspired by the actual events of Apollo 11). Kerbals can also get radiation sickness in orbit, and old kerbals with a lot of time receiving those lovely ionizing rays could get cancer (Kancer)! This incentivizes a large pool of astronauts instead of having a choice number of astronauts that do all your missions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA fully fledged kerbal physical health system. Tired of kerbals bouncing on the ground and getting off scot free? What about possible mishaps in zero-g (possibly\u00A0by Kerbals with more stupidity)? Now, kerbals can break limbs, get concussions, and require medical assitance. I could even add a fourth kerbal type, medic, who can repair broken kerbals in case of injury. But this also means Kerbals don\u0027t die instantly in some cases. Imagine a kerbal breaking a limb while on the moon, and begins suffering internal bleeding. You have a timer before the kerbal bleeds out and dies (and a medic could help elongate that time), and you need to get them back to Kerbin before the timer runs out or the kerbal is dead forever (or in the case of the veterans, if one insists, dies for a little while). And remember how I said mishaps in zero g? Well, what if, based on the kerbals stupidity level, accidental injuries could happen randomly while in orbit?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbals aren\u0027t all perfect. Now, when you hire Kerbals, you can see what pre-existing conditions they have that might effect their strengths and weaknesses. What if a kerbal is sickle-celled? Well, they might be less resistant to low-oxygen environments. What if you choose a kerbal with osteoporosis? Well, they might have bone density issues that could be exacerbated by long stays in orbit. And this also means a kerbal can GAIN a condition. Spent too much time in orbit? They might come down with a\u00A0bone density issue, or other health problem that effects resource consumption, frequency of health issues, tolerance to g\u0027s, you name it! This doesn\u0027t mean all conditions are bad though! You could get a kerbal with strong G tolerance, or a kerbal with low-oxygen resilience. You could get a loner\u00A0kerbal, who PREFERS to be on a mission alone, and doesn\u0027t need connection with home to stay sane (which is an idea from Kerbalism). What if you choose a kerbal that\u0027s\u00A0claustrophobic? Well, they might be prone to breakdowns in long missions in cramped ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically, this all seems simple enough to code to me. A lot of it just effects resource consumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to put this as a disclaimer, I AM NOT PROMISING THAT I WILL MAKE ANY MOD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m simply interested in trying to learn and pursue. I have no real modding experience and am just learning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also making this to see how big the interest may be for a mod like this. I can see that this may not be the mod for everyone (let\u0027s face it, life support is a huge obstacle most of the time). However, some of the most fun I\u0027ve ever had in this game has been using Kerbalism and running test after test to make sure a mission will go successfully. I\u0027m sure a lot of people would agree with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real meat of the mod would be in setting up configs for external mods. I know that Tantares, Bluedog, SSTU, Space Station Tech, and other mods would be fundamental for making configs for. However, I pledge that if I do make this mod, I will make in-depth VIDEOS on setting up configs for your own mods. I know the hardest part of modding can sometimes be figuring\u00A0out how the heck a mod even works in the first place, so providing adequate wiki and tutorials is a goal of mine if this project gets a lot of love.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027ve said it a couple times, but this mod is heavily inspired by Sir Mortimer\u0027s\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190382-15-110-kerbalism-311/\u0026amp;tab=comments#comment-3717577\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbalism\u003C/a\u003E.

When science can be ran over time, and continue to be run in the background, I almost cried. So much more fun than the stock system. I also plan to make this a little more friendly than the Kerbalism system, allowing science definitions to be seen [and a possibilty to add more science def\u0027s based on how much research you\u0027ve done in a certain biome])\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod would be designed to hinge on \u003Cstrong\u003EProbability\u003C/strong\u003E. There\u0027s a chance that a Medic causes a health condition to get worse; there\u0027s a chance a kerbal bonks their head in their space station;\u00A0there\u0027s a chance that an oxygen tank can explode and we could lose some of our oxygen supply (I\u0027m looking at you, Apollo 13). By adding chance, but not complete randomness, I believe the mod can get us closer to a realistic space simulator that\u0027s still fun to use!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI WOULD LOVE SOME POINTERS. If you have an idea of how something can be implemented, please tell me! I am open to ideas and I am open to letting someone else take over this project if they feel so inclined.
