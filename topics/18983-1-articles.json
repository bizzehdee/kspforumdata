I\u0027ve been poking around in KSP on and off for a couple weeks now, and two things have started to bug me. The following seem like they really impact the delta-V of your rocket (or, rather, the portion of your rocket that reaches orbit) and deserve rigorous answers, but I don\u0027t know how to address them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Launch trajectory: for a given rocket, what\u0027s the flight path (all the way from launch to circularized orbit) that requires the least delta-V?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly suspect that the optimal trajectory keeps the direction of thrust exactly prograde (to minimize steering losses), starts at a small offset from vertical at launch (so that we actually end up in orbit, despite point #1), and burns continuously until orbit is reached (to minimize time spent in freefall pre-orbit, and thus gravitational losses). I haven\u0027t a clue where to start designing the relevant equations, though, so I can\u0027t produce a checklist like \u0022at 10km altitude be oriented at 80 degrees, at 20 be oriented at 65 degrees,\u0022 etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrecting for air resistance presumably makes the path \u0022curvier\u0022 (i.e. you aim closer to vertical early on, to get out of the atmosphere earlier, and then lean over on your side more quickly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a069296.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis Naval Research Laboratory \u0022primer\u0022\u003C/a\u003E from the late 70s that\u0027s talking about the same stuff, but the equations are illegible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Staging: given fixed total and payload masses and a fixed number of stages (or a fixed set of KSP parts to make your rocket with), what\u0027s the optimal rocket staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevote too much fuel (and delta-V, and mass) to your early stages, and you waste fuel accelerating partially-empty tanks and other infrastructure that you can\u0027t jettison; make the opposite mistake and you waste fuel accelerating other fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027m just staging my rockets in a roughly geometric progression (e.g. two tanks \u002B one thruster, then six tanks \u002B three thrusters, then 18 \u002B 9), but I have no evidence that that\u0027s the efficient way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/multistage.php#id--Optimization\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis more general description of the problem\u003C/a\u003E (great site, by the way) and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.medwelljournals.com/fulltext/?doi=ojesci.2010.1.5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis paper on mathematically modeling it\u003C/a\u003E, but the former only briefly touches on the relevant factors instead of solving them (and eventually devolves into guess-and-check) and the latter (which, I admit, isn\u0027t exactly light reading for a Monday morning) only seems to describe how total required rocket mass for a fixed payload mass decreases as the number of stages increases, not how to lay out the actual stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tackled these problems?
