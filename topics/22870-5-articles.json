As a bonus it saves me from the slightly irritating fuel lines connecting 5 attach nodes to the single central Octo lines. But... maybe something can be done about both of these things eventually. I\u0027m not on Semni\u0027s level yet I think lol. I made a RCS thruster tank model using various tricks to reduce the poly count way down per-piece while still keeping almost the same style as the usual THSS, but even with that the count would have been upwards of 8000 on this model I think. It\u0027s just very complex. Then again, all of the Octo pieces are heavy poly, so maybe it\u0027s not really that important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s7.postimg.org/ryljbqiq3/GEParts2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GEParts2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74868312/GE_Octo_adapters.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload just the Octo-Struts.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74868312/GoblinIndustries.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload the Goblin Industries THSS pieces I\u0027ve made so far.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T07:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are amazing!
