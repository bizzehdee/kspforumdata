The effect seems to stem from our proper decision that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and that this evidence be then backed up by another source. This is good and should not change. However, I think we have a problem where due to what can somewhat amount to politics within the scientific fields (and of course media sensationalism) this process is being negatively circumvented towards a direction of preventing possible good science rather than actually acting as the proper check it was designed to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good example of this system being properly implemented was when CERN released their findings on the possibility that neutrinos moved at FTL speeds (ever so slightly faster than light). When they released the documents their stance for the most part was \u0022This doesn\u0027t quite make sense to us, but we cannot yet explain it, can someone please verify or disprove it?\u0022. There were many of course that were skeptical, many that hoped that this discovery could be something important. Other locations were unable to repeat the results and in the end it was found that a loose fiber optic connection was at fault for the incorrect result. No harm done, on a machine as big as CERN it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s frankly amazing that they\u0027ve had as few problems of this nature as they have had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECold fusion on the other hand is having a much more difficult time of it. Now we are all aware that the first initial instance of cold fusion (where the term was in fact coined) turned out to be false. We are also aware of several individuals over the years that have implemented scams based around this idea. Additionally we have yet to really get \u0022hot\u0022 fusion under control. Considering all of this it is understandable that the scientific community is a little wary of new information on the topic. However it has become something more than just wary experience, it seems to have taken on an edge of dogmatic denial. There are quite a few legitimate research efforts going on into cold fusion across the world (more than one would assume given its reputation anyway). They all run into a problem upon releasing whatever results they have, which is that they cannot match the second half of the aforementioned process. Repeated results by another source. And this is in general not because the other source was unable to reproduce the results, but because other sources refuse to even try! From my observations it so far seems as though the only groups interested in attempting to reproduce the results of any given CF team are other CF teams, meaning that whatever they find is still ignored because of course a CF team wants to find CF. But worse than that, nobody external to the CF teams will peer review CF papers through a combination of \u0022It\u0027s just going to be false.\u0022 and/or \u0022I don\u0027t want to be dragged down in the mud with it when it is found to be false.\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now Q-Thruster/Cannae/EMDrive technology is a good example of a technology sitting on the precipice of this divide between correct science and denied science. This is not me declaring that the technology is true and working. What I am meaning is that the camps on this technology are very polarized. There are scientists and respected labs that have already ordered production test articles from NASA for their thruster once they are completed later this year, so we are getting external sources of verification for positive/negative results. This is good. Meanwhile though, we do also have examples of scientists and labs that are against this technology almost to the point of outright violence. If I had to guess, I would actually say the only reason this technology has not already descended into CF-level depths of denial is simply because NASA seems to think it works. Regardless of arguments about the tests that were performed, NASA IS proceeding as though they believe the technology to be valid. NASA in general is not one to back technologies without good reason, so it has provided Q-Thruster technology with enough of a legitimate face that other teams are willing to look at it too. After all, if it turns out they wasted money they can always say \u0022Well NASA was fooled too!\u0022. Near as I have been able to tell, the pre-NASA situation of the QT technology ends up being rooted in the realm of the dogmatic denial I mentioned earlier. The QT drive cannot possibly work because no current science theory agrees with what it can supposedly do, and therefore it is not even attempted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne can understand facilities not wanting to waste the millions required to try out CF technologies given that they do require fairly specialized devices and technology as well as a lot of lead time and man hours. However the QT drive does not really fit this description. Given the simplicity of the design (in short a correctly shaped metal container with a radio at one end) and the simplicity of the test setup (precision measurement pendulum in a vacuum chamber) this experiment is quite easily replicated without too much cost. Quite likely all of the equipment as well as rental time in a vacuum chamber might well reach as much as 40-50 thousand dollars. A nice amount to be sure, but frankly a number that most major universities can throw away in an attempt to gain the prestige of being part of the QT drive verification group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne part of what is happening seems to come from us ignoring one of our other scientific precepts, that data should not be ignored even when in conflict with what you know to be true. Now of course you occams razor the \u0022bad\u0022 data as much as you can to narrow down the source if possible. But one option that should always be on the table brings in the fact that right now we fully admit that we just don\u0027t know for sure how the whole universe works just yet. There are some who say we may never, but that is a different discussion for another time. We are already aware that there are conditions under which understood aspects of the universe are no longer true. Time near black holes, Newtonian physics at near light speeds, assorted effects on the quantum scale, etc. It isn\u0027t so much that these items are \u0027wrong\u0027 per se, but that our understanding of them is incomplete. And we should be mindful of this and take our own advice. Don\u0027t throw out data because it does not fit what we know. Use it to find out what we don\u0027t know (we didn\u0027t know we had a loose cable, we didn\u0027t know about relativity, etc). Somewhere along the way you find out what you didn\u0027t know, it could be a problem with your test setup, or a problem with your lack of understanding of physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point I am attempting to make is that we very clearly have a level of bias going on in science. This is not to say science itself is flawed or anything of that nature. So much as this is a problem that exists with our current implementation of our scientific infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question I raise here is thusly: Assuming that the proper methods are being observed towards verification and validation, how would you propose to correct this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want an analogy of sorts to go with, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s assume you have a pair of devices the size of a small truck and weigh 12 tons that each cost $5 Million to produce. These devices can instantly send information between themselves; to make it have added impossibility let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say you have reason to believe that the receiver is actually receiving the information a tiny fraction of a second before the transmission occurred. A very crazy and nonrealistic situation to have. Given the way our system works now, how would you go about proving it to others?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReminder: This is NOT a thread on the validity of the technologies I have mentioned here; it is a discussion on the state of our scientific process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T18:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not attribute the actions of 1 small subgroup of NASA, as representative of NASA\u0027s collective view on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as we shouldn\u0027t hold that terrible arsenic life paper against the whole of NASA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T18:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly the discussion intended KerikBalm.

They almost certainly won\u0027t find them, because they almost certainly do not exist. Our theory says so. But it says so based on certain assumptions that don\u0027t absolutely have to be correct. And if heavy photons are found, we need to fix these assumptions and readjust our theory. It would be of great benefit, and we wouldn\u0027t have to scrap things we\u0027ve learned.

From very bottom to very top. There is not a shred of modern theory we can preserve against it. All of Quantum Mechanics and all of General Relativity ride on the concept of local symmetry groups, and these two devices violate these local symmetries. It is absolutely beyond salvage.

It probably wouldn\u0027t require quite 2,000 years to catch up, but it\u0027d be centuries for sure. And until then, what? We keep using these devices that produce thrust out of nothing? Who knows what else they produce out of nothing? If momentum isn\u0027t conserved, then why should energy be.

They loaded their mock rover with a map of the terrain, they set it down on the ground, and they told it to move. It didn\u0027t. It stayed in place. They checked for mechanical obstructions, power to the motors, and found no problems. They reset, and still couldn\u0027t get it to move.

The only place where it new for sure that the ground wasn\u0027t 10 feet bellow was right underneath its wheels.

Energy conservation, and in fact, just general properties of the symmetries in question, guarantee us that we can only screw up so much. That\u0027s what we\u0027ve been relying on to say that it\u0027s probably ok to keep pushing the boundaries. Anything we do screw up will have local consequences. Not so if these principles don\u0027t hold. The moment we discover a failure like that, we\u0027d have to stop.
