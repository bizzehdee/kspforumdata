It uses lots of Electric charge and a little bit of Liquid Hydrogen from the Cryogenic Engines mod and outputs a small amount of Hydrogen for use in mods like TAC Life Support.

There are engines from other mods that do things like produce monopropellant when they run. So I wonder if it could just be made to produce as much fuel as it uses when it runs.\n\n\\*\\*It does indeed work. I grabbed the alternator module from the stock jet engine and made it output the fuel it uses. It\u0027s a bit goofy because those show up in the VAB description pop-up but hey it works!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T09:15:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 09:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bignumbers**"}]}
