On top of that was the stack separator, pod, 2 parachutes, and the LES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the appropriate altitude of 25K, I triggered the separator and then the LES. Nothing seemed to happen with the LES. I right-clicked and it said Flame-Out! Cause: SolidFuel deprived.

Is flameout normal with this contraption? I did have the thrust set pretty low at the time, so that could be it, but if so, where did the fuel go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, the mission was a success. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T10:12:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may have staged it accidentally earlier, it shows up like a srb in the staging, it is also bound to the abort action group, so you can hit the abort button to trigger it.
