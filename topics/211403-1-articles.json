This can be done with special metallic nubs located on the roof and jowls inside the mouth. These would generate electric bolts between them as the methane is rapidly blown out the mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaveauts: Any intelligent biological race with these abilities must already be highly resistant to burning, especially inside their mouth as well as their skin, hair, and eyes. Otherwise they would hurt themselves more. They also need to be resistant to electric shock as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRange: Would be low if just using breath blowing. But what if the neck had side air pockets that swelled with compressed methane before it was blown out? That would provide more range. It won\u0027t be like a military flame thrower for range, since those can reach 70 feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think at most you may get ten feet range at best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConclusion: You do not need a humanoid form to have this ability... but it does not scale down well, and the bigger you scale any creature the more powerful their firebreath and it\u0027s range could be... due to a larger capacity for fuel and compressed gas release. Dinos with this ability would be like a subpar form of Godzilla.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso with methane you get blue flames,so blue fire breath.

Such a creature would be an extremely efficient predator because it could attack without closing distance, protecting it from whatever natural defenses the prey animal might have. This survival advantage would prioritize the causticity of the venom and exothermicity of the reaction, which in turn would drive the predator to evolve protections against being burned by its own venom, like heat-resistant scales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately such a creature could evolve a secondary chemical used to trigger catalytic decomposition of its venom, allowing it to self-pressurize (in the adapted fangs, which at this point have likely evolved to be used primarily for spraying and not for injecting) and fire its oxidizer-venom farther. With catalytic decomposition of a sufficiently aggressive oxidizer, it could reach the point that it was hypergolic with living tissue, igniting its target on contact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will say that your idea could be less destructive for the overall environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a sentient humanoid who could spew venom that only caught on fire when it was absorbed by animal fur?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of burning down the forest everytime they spew venom, it would only occur if\u00A0 they were actually under threat of attack and they actually hit an enemy with fur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-12T03:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224218259\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211403\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221673480255\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will say that your idea could be less destructive for the overall environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a sentient humanoid who could spew venom that only caught on fire when it was absorbed by animal fur?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of burning down the forest everytime they spew venom, it would only occur if\u00A0 they were actually under threat of attack and they actually hit an enemy with fur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to make sure you have a clear idea in your head of what \u0022fire breathing\u0022 actually means.
