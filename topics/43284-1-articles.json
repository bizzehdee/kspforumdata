I have just started trying to make parts for KSP and so for the only problem I have had is one that I cannot find anywhere, my parts work fine, unless I make an engine. The engine works fine, as far as the game is concerned but nothing moves? When I right click the engine it says its making thrust, it says the alternator is working, it consumes fuel, it makes sound effects but it just... doesnt move?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same config file works fine if I replace the mesh with one that came with the game, and configs that came with the game dont work with the mesh, so the problem must be something I am doing in unity. I am applying a mesh collider, and it is set to convex, and it works fine. I am also setting the material to KSP\\Diffuse. If I make a fuel tank or something it works fine, the part looks as expexted and nothing is logged to the console and yet it just doesnt work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part and CFG are in this ZIP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dqnbe7it2vmqceu/btnisHYCcx/lopdv_engine.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elopdv_engine.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any suggestions, thanks for the help (even if it doesnt work haha - also sorry for what I now realise resembles a wall of text)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T00:59:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mishka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESolved my problem\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ohfive30","CreatedById":74380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T00:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould it be the thrustTransform being in the wrong place in the unity heirachy? without seeing the unity setup and heirachy it\u0027s a bit hard to diagnose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mishka","CreatedById":79724,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T00:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually just figured it out after a few more minutes of googling, none of the tutorials I had read or watched had mentioned anything about engines needing this \u0022thrustTransform\u0022 but now that I have found it I realise this is where the problem was \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
