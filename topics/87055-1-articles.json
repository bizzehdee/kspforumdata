But use of the Sagan series in cinematics has become a little over-saturated, and if you have to use it then don\u0027t bring it in right at the beginning; Save it for when the time is right. To improve you should use a little more kerbcam, maintain a bit more quality control with the audio and music, and spend some more time framing your shots.
