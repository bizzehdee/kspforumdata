Technology doesn\u0027t come in lumps and waves, it\u0027s tested out and gradually makes an appearance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI considered a system for testing prototypes of parts, randomly offered similarly to missions might be, in which you test the object in return for a reduction in points or in percent (to increase alternate tech tree compatibility) to research the level in which the part resides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting would work like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOffer appears at the space center/R\u0026amp;D hub to test an item. Each item would have parameters defining where it might be tested with rewards for each level (e.g. Escape towers= 5%@LaunchPad, 8%@Atmosphere, 10%@LowOrbit; Landing Legs=10 Research@Launchpad, 15 Research@Landed, 25 Research@ForeignPlanet). If the offer is accepted, the player temporarily receives access to a locked item under the condition that it be tested. (Potentially only works in specified zones to prevent abuse?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting would involve \u0027using\u0027 or activating the object x number of times (potentially with a large bonus for vessel recovery). Launch escape towers would obviously need multiple launches to fully complete testing, whereas landing legs or thrusters might be tested multiple times in each biome in one flight. One time use items like SRBs might receive lower test requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing a test might result in a penalty or perhaps just losing access to the item or even just increasing the repetitions required. A system like this might help ease up situations where players are stuck in a rut without enough Research to unlock the equipment to achieve more research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of setting up an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Joe_II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eunmanned pod with a probe body controller on the end of an SRB to test out the LES\u003C/a\u003E and gain research without endangering Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cleric2145","CreatedById":73281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T00:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel special.
