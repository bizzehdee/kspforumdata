I made an asparagus piped thing of 5 tanks and i made a standerd fuel crossfeed piping with the same engines and fuel tanks and i burned them to see witch burned longer. And it turns out the asparugus burned longer than the other one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E, But it only burned 45 seconds longer than the crosfeed way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E Well if you think about it that is considered much more efficient but lets think. You loss thust and drag, it reduces your drag a lot so that is a bonus, but what if you can not lift the payload with only 2 boosters then you need to hang on to the 3rd and 4th boosters longer for that extra thrust. Some might say \u0022just add more fuel\u0022 but that is a problem with that, the more fuel you have, the more thrust you need to lift it. That means you will need more powerful and less eficient rocket engines. And if you might be at sqaure one, needing more fuel. I say acording to this information asparagus is still the most eficient way to do things but i want to know what you think so leave a coment below and tell me what you think.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T20:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, under ideal circumstances, yes. The theory is, you drop boosters as you don\u0027t need to fight gravity/atmospheric drag as much. This becomes especially useful when you start your grav-turn, where your TWR becomes less important.

I\u0027d imagine future engineers using Antimatter-fuel rockets would use asparagus staging to get the best bang for their buck. On Earth, in the atmosphere, no, at least, not the way KSP does it. You see, the way KSP does boosters, is that each booster would have to take up a column of air, this is aerodynamically inefficient. However, he same logic is true for regular onion style or parallel-stlyle boosters, which do exist in real life, on the Soyuz. Regardless of what people say, you actually can have a relatively efficient asparagus staged vehicle if you use boosters with the same form as the soyuz uses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T21:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf by asparagus you mean using fuel lines and dropping empty tanks, it is the most efficient way for any ship in KSP.
