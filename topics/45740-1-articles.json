Didn\u0027t have a reason to make an acc here before, but after trying to find a thread regarding this point (without luck) gave me a chance to open an acc up and boot this discussion out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not new to KSP, been playing over 6 months, so this is something that kept bugging me the most:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart highlighting is very inconsistent. I do understand that the future plans are to make some kind of a better system for stage setups (something along the lines of a schematic type setup?), which would be very desirable and make everything easier to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a big issue on smaller ships/setups, but once you set something complicated up, parts get covered and you can\u0027t figure out what are you looking at in the stagings on the right, and where it is on the ship. Sometimes, an entire section gets highlighted to denote that it will be decoupled, but sometimes, only the decoupler gets highlighted disregarding the rest of the attached items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nicer if parts could get highlighted brighter, just a bit more, and show transparent, in case there\u0027s tons of stuff covering an item to be able to set up stages with less guessing. Action Groups window helps a little, but there\u0027s still the issue of fishing the items out from the deep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering what are your thoughts on this? Have you had cumbersome experiences whilst building comlicated vehicles/rockets? Don\u0027t take everything I wrote as a complaint, just had to point out the exact issue and get some opinions and info on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove this game to bits for what it provides tho. :} Tons of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZenithRising","CreatedById":77506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T07:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree a lot could be done to improve the Assembly Building GUI and feedback.
