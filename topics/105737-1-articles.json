For normal SCUBA, the pressure is only a major concern in terms of rate of pressure change, due to decompression issues. The human body can withstand far more than Earth\u0027s sea level atmospheric pressure (1 bar). A fully qualified advanced recreational SCUBA diver can go to 50m, which is 6 bar, on just air. With mixed gases, they can go to 80\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100m, 9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015311 bar pressure (over 10x normal surface pressure). That\u0027s all without any form of pressure compensation suit, just a normal wet or dry suit, so the body is fully exposed to the increased ambient pressure. Lack of pressure is a huge problem, but excess pressure is something that the human body copes with remarkably well, as long as it\u0027s uniform pressure and matched to the pressure of the gas available to breathe. The breathing gas mixture also has to be appropriate, obviously, as oxygen is toxic at high pressure (compressed normal surface air with 20% O2 is toxic to humans at a bit more than 50m depth, which is why 50m is the traditional normal SCUBA safety limit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking from personal experience, it\u0027s an odd feeling, having 4\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01535x normal pressure acting in on you, but not at all unpleasant, as long as you manage the pressure changes properly.
