I figured someone else might be interested in my odd impromptu roleplay. If there is any interest I can post a mod list and such. Sorry for no screenshots, posting here was an afterthought\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDodo 1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCapsule with 4 goos. did some research on the launchpad, then Jeb got out and walked off the launchpad for a better view. This inspired him to give a good report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDodo 2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith better Experiments, Jeb told the team haul out Dodo prototype to the dirt strip jokingly called the \u0022runway\u0022 Unfortunately they must not have heard, so he woke up to find himself at the launchpad once more. Still a decent about of understanding was gained from the use of the new parts to come up with even better ideas\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDodo 3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time they actually managed to get to the runway. For some reason they could not go direct but had to go to a weird hangar first. Quick look around in the dirt grabbed a few extra points in some kind of Leger... somewhere. The scientists are looking happy. Maybe we will actual get to fly soon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFledgling 1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWoo! new capsule, new design.. Now with actual engines that go boom! Oh they are saying they shouldn\u0027t do that, BORING, UNFOLLOWED\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looks like he isn\u0027t sure he will actually leave the ground, right up to the point he \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E ignites underneath him. Then he just starts screaming that this is the best day of his life! And we can still hear him.. he must be screaming really loud, oh. That\u0027s the loudspeaker must mean the antenna is working properly. Scientists look happy and we all know that\u0027s the must important part. Oh dang its out of sight. Its also very very silent all of a sudden...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: His capsule landed in a small ravine up in the mountains. took forever to find, but hopefully he is not much worse for wear. It seems the Rocket (yes we can start calling them that now) went a whole lot higher than we thought it would. Got up over 110 km by the looks of things, but our telemetry wasn\u0027t calibrated for this. The batteries running out halfway through the flight doesn\u0027t help either. Then the angle was too steep, but Jeb was smart. He adjusted the parashoot on the way down to avoid crashing. Real natural born pilot that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFledgling 2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe tried the Fledgling vehicle design 1 more time, because the design team is still wandering around with cups of coffee and muttering to themselves. Last thing we heard was something along the lines of. \u0022what if we used 2 rockets instead of 1?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time we are trying to angle the launch towards the sea, to avoid problems with a shallow profile and get new data from a new environment (someone told me that was important, don\u0027t remember who) We also have set better radar systems to try and catch a altitude record.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the launch went off, but some dummy put the rocket the wrong way, so jeb instead steered it south, not east. It still is going to land in the water however. Looks like the batteries ran out again though we need to get better ones of those soo. Hopefully the scientists are getting some ideas about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh dang, it looks like the capsule is coming in the wrong way! Oh NO! its coming in way way too fast, the parashoot is deploying far too late......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRIP Jeb. you will be missed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFledgling 3 \u0026amp; 4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stepped up after the death of her boyfriend. She said something about wanting to finish what he started or something. Anyway, She is just a good a pilot as he was and actually smarter. somehow. or maybe just less crazy dangerous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe tried out the new crazy double stacker rocket today.. twice. both times someone forgot to figure out how to separate the stack. So it went up a ways, then Val ignited the second to try and catch the first on fire or something. Didn\u0027t work either time. we got a bit of data out of the runs to feed our scientists again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time isn\u0027t a problem we all make mistakes. There really is no excuse for the second time though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlegling 6:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the 6th (and hopefully final) Fledgling mission. We are going to try finally achieving orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Report: We Reached Orbit! The second stage did not perform very well, basically burned to completion while holding altitude. I think it was just too heavy for the engine. In spite of the issues our 3rd stage carried us safely to orbit. We went around the planet a few times, then deorbited and landed in the desert. This successfully concludes the \u0022Fledgling\u0022 program. With its conclusion we are going to transition to a more sophisticated program. We already have upgraded our reception area in mission control. Many new faces have been around with many many interesting offers. We thus will be going to a more formal mission logging system, with a proposal written beforehand, various crew reports logged during flight, and a general report in conclusion. This is not the end, we may have suffered losses, but we shall overcome. The program is alive and well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-18T14:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2020 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CastleKSide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-18T17:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats on reaching orbit. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CastleKSide","CreatedById":152662,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-19T00:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
