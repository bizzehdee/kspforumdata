The site was decommissioned and abandoned several years ago, which is why SpaceDock popped up to replace it.\n\nUnfortunately, the abandoned website\u0027s DNS then came up for grabs, and it was taken over by malicious actors who now use it as a site for hosting malware, i.e. the kind of dangerous place that tries to put viruses and things onto unwitting visitors\u0027 machines.  It\u0027s a bad place and people shouldn\u0027t go there.\n\nAlas, the KSP forum was strewn with many links to this site (from the \u0022before times\u0022 when it was legit), which put the KSP community at risk.  So we did our best to scrub the references and links, and as an added safety precaution, we added the name of the site to the \u0022naughty words\u0022 list so that it will get auto-replaced with \u0022malicious site we no longer use\u0022.  This serves a dual purpose.  First, it lets people know (who might otherwise not have gotten the memo) what\u0027s going on with that site; and, second, it helps prevent further spread of references to the site in the forum.  It\u0027s not a perfect solution by any means, but it\u0027s easy for us to do, and it\u0027s reasonable because there\u0027s really no legitimate reason for anyone to be going there anymore.\n\nOn a more serious note... **in general, please don\u0027t try to get \u0022clever\u0022 and bypass the filter, as you just did.**  There\u0027s a [forum rule](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/) about this (2.2.g, \u0022any technique that bypasses the language filter\u0022).

There *were* \u0022computers\u0022 back then and earlier, but they indeed were not \u0022personal\u0022, being closer in size to a car than a modern desktop. The one that most of the early Unix work was done on was called a PDP-7 and looked like this:\n\n![Pdp7-oslo-2005.jpeg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Pdp7-oslo-2005.jpeg)\n\nWhy is that relevant to the KSP forum? Because Unix was respected and widely regarded as high quality software, and also used in many places (though never quite universally, thanks early on to the likes of MUMPS and VMS, and later Windows), and many of Unix\u0027s conventions and design choices were adopted by other systems. Eventually it was more or less completely re-implemented in the GNU and Linux projects, including the choice of January 1, 1970 as the start of the date system. When a modern database is implemented, there\u0027s a good chance that it stores timestamps in such a format under the hood. And a forum will use that sort of database to store information about users, forums and sub-forums, and, yes, posts and replies. So when something goes wrong, you may see Unix-flavored quirks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-04T23:47:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2021 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by HebaruSan**\n  \nmissed an Oxford comma"},{"CreatedByName":"Souptime","CreatedById":204451,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T14:00:35Z","Content":"why, in all that is holy and unholy, ***is there a like limit***\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-06T01:39:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2021 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**\n  \nDon\u0027t get carried away with font sizes, please."},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T14:42:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, Souptime said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E why, in all that is holy and unholy, ***is there a like limit***\n\u003E \n\nwhy in all that is holy would you use such large text\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/4/2021 at 4:41 PM, HebaruSan said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Unix was first released in the early 1970s, and some of the earliest work on it was started in 1969\n\u003E \n\nI wonder if there\u2019s an alternate timeline where the Apollo computers used Unix. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-06T01:39:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2021 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**"},{"CreatedByName":"Le Lynx","CreatedById":208381,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T14:49:34Z","Content":"[@damonvv](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162728-damonvv/)You will make a lunar starship?"},{"CreatedByName":"Souptime","CreatedById":204451,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T14:56:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, Spaceman.Spiff said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E why in all that is holy would you use such large text\n\u003E \n\nenraged"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T15:14:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 35 minutes ago, Le Lynx said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@damonvv](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162728-damonvv/)You will make a lunar starship?\n\u003E \n\nThis is absolutely the wrong thread for that question.   \n\nedit: Ok I realize now that you may have misunderstood the thread title.
