The reality is for most players one of the key drives is going to be unlocking bigger and better parts. From a game design standpoint though you\u0027re going to be a bit stingy. You\u0027re trying to let out new parts at a moderate but steady pace so players have access to the tools they need to take the next step without grinding but are also motivated to get the next thing, which in turn unlocks new capabilities, and so on. Integrating a rewards-based LS would be similar to increasing the potential rewards if players can maintain comnet connection over a period of time for instance. You\u0027ve taken on an\u00A0 extra, optional challenge and there\u0027s a small additional reward for that.

Often we trend towards supporting a player path that doesn\u2019t reward excessive timewarping, but doesn\u2019t exclude it either. A good case study is resource extraction and deposit concentrations. There\u2019s definitely fun in seeking out and finding the best deposit for mining. Obviously though timewarp makes that kinda moot in timing. You could just start mining a hypothetically low-grade deposit and warp for 50 days. That tells us that time and rate -based mechanics need to have more to work well. A specific example here is that a newly accessible resource should be constrained differently \u2013 challenging location, resource transport limitations, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0We try to move the real player decisions to things that are interesting with and without time as a mechanic.

If you need to do something in orbit over a specific part of a planet, make it take longer than the average orbital cycle. This might encourage a player to put a satellite in GEO orbit over that place. If you do the work to put it in GEO, you get the benefit of being able to timewarp.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse binaries instead of gradients. Does ore concentration really benefit from a really detailed gradient from 0.0001% to 100%, or can you look at it as a yes/no? Trade that, see if you\u2019re damaging player stories with that simplification.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse supporting systems. Sure, you could mine that deposit at high timewarp. But the deposit is on a planet with a day length of 200 days, and you need power, and the area has no fissionables. How are you going to power it? If you solve this problem, it is satisfying and you get a cookie. You did the work, enjoy your timewarpable extraction!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are really big problems we look at for all of the more complex systems because hey, an interstellar transfer could be 100 years.

Not the best example though as it\u0027s too much different, yeah. I do agree that restrictions and constraints should not be considered as a must, in game. But it\u0027s still relevant sometimes, to elevate the gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding LS, I feel that having a metric, an assessment of what is or is not a sustainable crewed module, RolePlay will be the only way to care about it, and it won\u0027t be enough for some / most players. I do go the RolePlay route when it comes to LS : I don\u0027t use mod, I just adjust the whole living space and some drymass according to the mission duration and the crew required. But I would prefer to get some way to assess that it\u0027s OK-ish / not enough / plenty enough with a common base that would be told by the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe effective impact of this is still to be determined : bonuses ? maluses ? hard punishment / impossibility to run the mission ? I\u0027m not into a micro gestion, I don\u0027t even care about Kerbals Roles such as pilot, engineer, scientist. I just would like some very general and overviewed handle of Life Support to add some relief to crewed mission. There is clearly no separation today between crewed or probed mission, nothing that set them apart, except for mass which is way under-evaluated when it comes to crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe some very general \u0022gauges\u0022, maybe even 2 only would be enough : Crew resources and Crew sanity (excuse my english, might not be the good word) \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E- Crew resources : just another \u0022tank\u0022 that contains the whole 02, C02 recycling, food, water, etc etc etc. In one single box, one single box, that is consumed based on crew number and mission duration. You start with 500, and it decreased by 1 for each day, each member, that\u0027s it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E- Crew sanity : a second gauge that would represent the pysche of the whole crew, that might depends on plural interesting factors the real main one would be the living space. Totally fine to only get a capsule for 3 guys to reach orbit and dock, 2 days, etc. Not fine when it\u0027s for a 2 years duration to Duna. That would be a gauge that \u0022consume\u0022 space or something like this, it\u0027s full at start and decrease by 1 for each day, each member. Not perfect though, less logic than the previous one but you can get it as a gauge that is actually green from 100 to 5% and at the end it shows that you might have planned for more space. It would be nice that this sanity can be reset my simply landing and EVA on a surface, or just at 50% max except if you can enter in a ground basis that has the whole living space to reset for another 2 years \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOf course it would need some way to pre-calculate the required amount in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E !
