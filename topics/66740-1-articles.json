A crew tank would probably be too cramped for long-term missions, but for a rover or light atmospheric craft it would be all right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn MK2 fuselage can acommodate 2 kerbals sitting abreast (albeit with no aisle between them) although their helmets clip together slightly. There\u0027s quite a bit of room on the side for equipment and storage. A 2m long MK2 crew tank would probably be enough for 2 kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 2.5m fuselage, or the stock MK3 fuselage, would be similar to the S2: big enough for 2 decks, 2 abreast with an aisle and overhead storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HL2 fuselage is 3.75 meters high and just over 3 meters wide. This is enough for three decks, with seating up to 4 abreast (middle deck only). Even with only one deck occupied, a 2m long crew tank could comfortably seat eight kerbals. With crew on the upper deck, the capacity increases to twelve. A 3.75m fuselage (and I doubt the new update will be out for five minutes before people start putting the new 3.75m parts on their planes) would be pretty much the same size, just with different proportions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe S2 wide body fuselage is just under 5 meters wide, or the width of two S2 fuselages with some extra in the center. It\u0027s not tall enough for three decks, but it should be wide enough for 6-abreat seating (assuming a single aisle), with lots of extra space on the lower deck and ample overhead storage on the upper. Again, this allows it to easily seat 12 kerbals in a 2 meter long module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a special bonus, the S2-S2W adapter is 4m long, so it should seat four rows, with 2 seats in the front, 6 in the back, and at least another four in the middle for another 12-man crew tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: didn\u0027t see your post there, K3|Chris.
