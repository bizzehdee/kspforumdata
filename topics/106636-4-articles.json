The circumference of Kerbin is 3,769,911m. Your distance is showing 3,939,677. That distance is very consistent with one circumnavigation. Kerbin rotates in the direction you were travelling meaning, the distance would be even further than 3,700km. In 2 hours, it rotates 628km. So, somewhere around 4,300km would be a reasonable distance. I could buy the 3,900 if it were one, but how did you get two circumnavigations? I\u0027m not saying you didn\u0027t mind you. I\u0027ve already seen some strange numbers coming from these flights. It just doesn\u0027t make sense though. Now if you managed an average of say 1,100m/s over 2 hours that would be 7,900km which does make sense for 2 circumnavigations. I\u0027m just curious why the F3 is showing something very different.\u003Cp\u003EThe time for the speed you were travelling, that sounds about right.

I recall when I first started trying to fly aircraft, it took me days just to get one to the end of the runway without crashing. Flix\u0027s challenge was one of the first ones I completed, though I wasn\u0027t even trying at the time. His challenge spoke to me because I didn\u0027t need anything that KSP didn\u0027t provide. It was a \u0027level playing field\u0027 that I could participate in, even for me, a new pilot. For challenges designed for both old players experimenting with new designs and new players creating their first global capable aircraft, keeping that \u0027playing field\u0027 level is something I consider important. While stock physics may still be boring to you FAR pilots, there are gobs of challenges out there for FAR, NEAR and loads of other physics mods. And you\u0027re free to start one using FAR if you wish.

Juz, I\u0027ve looked at some of your other stuff and just the sheer handle you have on these data tools is amazing. One of the reasons I\u0027ve only messed with stock is I haven\u0027t committed to learning those tools yet. The more I think about doing an in - depth analysis of what the optimum application specific ascent profile would be, the more I begin to think those tools will make the process much more painless. It could be sort of a compromise between the Ricky Bobby testing method and getting a math degree. Even when optimally piloted, I\u0027m certain my craft won\u0027t approach an average speed anywhere close to 1,573 m/s during a circumnav. At this point, I\u0027m interested not only in finding the best ascent and descent profiles in this context, but also an objective and thorough comparative analysis of rapier and turbojet engines. The question remains... given the \u0022most expertly designed craft and usage\u0022 for either engine, which of those two dream craft would perform better in this application? What about a hybrid? Thus far, I\u0027d lean toward the rapiers having the upper hand, but I still have a healthy respect for turbojet potential and haven\u0027t viewed it as being inferior before.

It might become more significant for a Nerva powered SSTO where the Rapier rocket mode is not used, not sure. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Turbojet has an alternator (it generates electricity), while the Rapier does not. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Rapier has a back stack mounting point, while the Turbojet does not. The uses are limited to shenanigans, because otherwise it would block the engine, but, personally, I often end up using it. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Rapier seems to generate slightly less drag (1.299081 0.9353406) than the Turbojet (1.275294 0.9736242), I haven\u0027t tested this though, the data comes from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122595-Some-rough-test-results-with-different-nosecones?p=1966634\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1966634\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Turbojet has a better fuel efficiency (Isp 8000) than the Rapier (Isp 6400) for a given thrust level. I calculate that as using 80% of the fuel a Rapier would use. Both jets are still very fuel efficient however.

Of course, the coefficients are the interesting part. These are saved as curves in the .cfg files in your KSP directory, but for simplicity I\u0027ve rendered them into graphs below. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s start with the atmospheric coefficient. The graph below shows the relation between the coefficient and atmospheric pressure. The relation is logarithmic, however I could not figure out how to make my graph logarithmic, so apologies. According to the wiki converting between pressure and altitude is not as straightforward as it used to be, but it \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin#Atmosphere\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eincludes a handy table\u003C/a\u003E. From the graph we see the Turbojet has a better coefficient up until about 0.08, which, based on the table, is somewhere a bit below 15km altitude, and the Rapier stays significantly above the Turbojet the rest of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbojet is red, Rapier is green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J3bO6y6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022J3bO6y6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, the velocity coefficient. I\u0027ve scaled the graph to adjust for the Turbojet\u0027s higher thrust, it\u0027s easier to look at that way. The speed is in Mach, and I believe the conversion to m/s varies with altitude, but a general assumption of about 300m/s per Mach at 20-25km should hold. Here we see the Rapier overtakes the Turbojet at somewhere a bit below Mach 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbojet is... grey?

I\u0027m sure many people will find it helpful, including myself, having all that information relevant to engineering the highest speed and altitude aircraft compiled into one place. I think one of the most important things you mentioned for me or for anyone to keep in mind is that drag dominates the speed equation more than mass in this context. Of course, there are several ways to do a circumnav and not everyone is trying to be the fastest, but for those that want to have lots of nifty extra features on their craft and be the fastest at the same time, or set a lofty air speed goal, one may have a lot of difficulty having his cake and eating it too, at least at some point anyway. Interestingly, when adding mass, that will at some point require more lift, which in turn will create more drag, etc. The cold, hard numbers are right there in the config and we can\u0027t design our own jet engines.
