It can achieve up to a 105km orbit from sea level (try starting the gravity turn at 33km). Thanks to the gimbal of the Vector engine, the lift from Eve is pretty smooth.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T19:30:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T21:03:13Z","Content":"\nYeah great !
