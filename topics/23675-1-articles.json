I get it every now and then, and it\u0027s highly annoying. The first time it happened I felt like throwing the computer accross the room. I searched for solutions everywhere and the best I found was editing the save file, which was hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when it happens, I have a much simpler solution. For me, it\u0027s only ever happened when I use a tug to dock something else and then try to undock the tug. To fix it, what I do is undock the part I want docked, from the station. Back up a bit to reset the docking ports, make sure it\u0027s still lined up (normally will be after undocking), and start moving forward again. The trick now is to undock the tug before the part you are docking docks, and let the momentum carry the part on to dock by itself. It\u0027s important not to time accelerate while the dock is happening, or it messes it up and could end very badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks every time for me, except the one time I time accelerated.

I was docking a set of 4 orange fuel tanks which was being propelled by a tug. Once I docked it, I couldn\u0027t undock the tug. The only solution was to undock the fuel tanks and then undock the tug and redock the tanks, but that would be difficult because the tanks have no probe or control and the station is asymmetrical, so I had to use the tug to push the tanks into the station without docking to them. It wasn\u0027t helped by the lag and the game crashing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wayan","CreatedById":58944,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T20:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm...i tried it the way you described, but it didnt work, i still could\u0027nt undock from the part, so i deorbitet it and will bring it up again :-/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T21:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappend to me ones also and i think it has something to do with the magnetic force when docking! i turned ASAS on, tryed to undocked again and voila! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
