Similar things could be done to engines: nozzle shape would increase mass but also change (vacuum) thrust, since the effective exhaust velocity is based on actual exhaust velocity \u002B density difference a larger nozzle transforms more density into speed: this increases exhaust velocity (= I_sp/9.81). Up till the point where the exhaust pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, after that it drops. So a nozzle would be optimized for a certain density region.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr wings could be done by creating your own airfoil shape, after which something like javafoil is used to calculate the cl-alpha curves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I agree this is a different game, and not for ksp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-06T01:35:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2019 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by paul23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-07T05:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223700697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189504\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573003764\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022120544\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul23\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/5/2019 at 7:29 PM, paul23 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey could make constraints - just like real life - on the tanks..
