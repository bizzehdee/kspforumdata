Is it a techncally problem, disturbed by RealChute or somethig wrong With Physics.cfg?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joco223","CreatedById":92530,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T09:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt what speed you oppened the parachute? I use both mods and parachutes work fine for me. Try using the parachute when your speed ia lower than 320m/s. Also, try redownloading both mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hanhan658","CreatedById":157273,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T18:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt deployed 5000m over the ground, and the speed is 242m/s. The capsule hit the ground in 241m/s. I think it might not be the parachute is braking the ship, but the aerodynamics, i tested it on all the tantares parachutes, but none of them worked. Then i tried the Stock chutes or Realchute chutes, it worked perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... i have busted that might not be somethig wrong with Physics.cfg!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
