Their only base is the KSC, which has a runway and launch pad because they used to receive shipments from the homeworld there. However, a catastrophe cut off all communication with the home planet, and now they\u0027re just using the KSC to explore this strange new system.\n\nThis also explains why they need spacesuits all the time - the buildings are airtight and they can\u0027t breathe outside air. They\u0027re aliens!\n\n\\*insert Aliens meme here\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T01:48:18Z","Content":"I think if they made humans, and earth it would be a rubbish game.
