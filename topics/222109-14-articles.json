I played KSP1 for a long time and yet KSP2, in the relatively short time it has been out has made me do more and go further than I did in KSP1 and I don\u0027t think they tried to recreate KSP1 either, they\u0027ve made a sequel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for KSP1 is it the game that people think it is? In my case, so this may not be the same for you, I had a heavily modded KSP1 covering all aspects - graphics, parts, information, QOL fixes etc to make it the \u0027game that it is\u0027. Stock KSP1 isn\u0027t as good as KSP2 IMO (yes there are bugs but these will go just as the bugs in KSP1 reduced over time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have mods on KSP2, one for orbital surveys to map the regions and this could easily end up as part of the game so I may not need that one, one for maneuver controls which will be fixed at some point so I won\u0027t need that one, and science arkive which again can easily be implemented and I expect that it will too. The others are dependencies for these. I don\u0027t need all the other mods I had to enjoy KSP2 more than I did KSP1. Of course, as with these things, your mileage may vary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game \u003Cem\u003Eforces\u003C/em\u003E you to go out. You will not complete the tech tree in only the Kerbin system. I do agree that such a push is better than being able to do it with just the 3 initial bodies, but that\u0027s forcing the player\u0027s hand, a harsh design choice made out of need for people to actually play the game, since KSP2 is clearly gonna be a semi-linear storytelling \u0022experience\u0022 that\u0027ll require some lackadaisical base-building on the side to allow you to reach interstellar and progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis design vision is almost surely the root cause of the many design disagreements plaguing KSP2 between what players expected (\u0022improved codebase\u0022, \u0022new physics engine\u0022, \u0022rebuilt systems\u0022) and what the devs are getting us, which is barely a remix of KSP1 with some very \u003Cem\u003Ebad-opinionated\u003C/em\u003E inclusions. Players expected an iteration of a space simulator sandbox, but we\u0027re getting the equivalent of what were some random writers hijacking the Halo name to make a forgettable live-action as an excuse to show us their not-even-halo fan fiction tier story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you compare stock KSP1 to stock KSP2, you also have to compare the pricing, the faster updates on KSP1, the size of the dev team, and not having the biggest publisher in gaming behind the dev team. KSP2\u0027s current offering is insufficient for the resources it seems to have and the price tag. Specially almost a year after releasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you mention mods, I\u0027m not touching the KSP2 modding scene with a ten foot pole, specially since it ends up in bepinex and, god forbid, the thunderstore and similar spyware disguised as modding aids.

One of the things I think is missing from KSP is any quest rewards beyond currency (and science is a currency).

KSP 2\u0027s science play is absolutely better than it was in KSP 1. Despite loving playing through KSP 1 campaigns, they almost always petered out almost as soon as completing the Mun. Because in the end it was a boring grind. How did a playthrough of KSP 1 usually go? Spend half an hour driving around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to gather science. Flying several dozen missions to orbit and back to pick up \u0027stranded\u0027 kerbals for enough money to upgrade the buildings. Flying a dozen identical Mun landings to get all the biomes. Babysitting orbital labs for months or years to slowly trickle out the science. Because in order to build a half decent looking Duna mission or further, you basically needed the whole tree unlocked.

Not necessary for progression, but interesting to create cool and different builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother more surface level example is skins. I know, I know, but if completing a difficult challenge unlocks a cool paint job for your boosters, that could be a fun flex to unlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you could even do it where you can \u0022skip\u0022 the tech tree and discover single parts early by visiting certain destinations. So if you survey the atmosphere of Duna before unlocking plane stuff, you unlock a couple of the plane parts. If you make it to Juno you can unlock the big hydrogen engines, but you don\u0027t get the big tanks until you unlock the tech tree node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a million ways, but the key thing is just that having science be only a currency is, IMO, very shallow. And what you are saying about wanting to play the game differently every time, I totally agree. I think the biggest barrier to that is probably that most stuff is mostly the same. Big tanks, little tanks, medium tanks. They are all just tanks. Big engines, medium engines, little engines. They are all just engines. Helium vs methanox vs ion is actually interesting. But there are few things like that in the game. I think putting powerful and weird parts that have tradeoffs behind different and difficult objectives could add a lot of spice. And then depending on what kind of play through you wanted to do, you might choose to visit different planets first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369303\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709152296\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107350\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SolarAdmiral\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, SolarAdmiral said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, it isn\u0027t even realistic.

But honestly I still really just don\u0027t get the overall complaint here and in this thread myself. I think science points as a currency are overall the best way to implement it. Off the top of my head, I can only think of two science unlocking systems implemented in a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne, science points. And look, science points work. All sorts of games use science points.\u00A0 Everything from colony builders, to grand strategy. Factorio, Dyson Sphere, Oxygen not Included, Timberborn, Stellaris, Terra Invicta, Civilization. If you consider xp just science points under a different name, we can include any RPG too. The system is ideal for anything that is non-linear. It allows so much flexibility. Do what you want to get the points. Spend the points on what you want. It\u0027s resource management. There\u0027s limited science points available in each level of destination/resource spent to make it. Gather enough to unlock what you really need to get further in your own style. It lets the player build their own path through the tech. It\u0027s the whole point of having a tech tree. The problem with something more detailed and in depth, it takes way more dev time to develop. And it starts to become more linear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other real option for Tech in games, is gather these specific resources/hidden boxes and put them into a machine. And honestly, that\u0027s pretty much just science points with a step removed, more linear, less flexible. It works for some games, Subnautica, Satisfactory. But they\u0027re much smaller, able to be handcrafted. Not really something that could be applied to KSP as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy whole concern revolves around the fact that so many folks are complaining about currency science points. Yet, I still haven\u0027t heard a solution that improves it. I don\u0027t want the devs to throw out the perfectly serviceable science system, dump thousands upon thousands of manhours into developing something new, only for it to be tedious, repetitive, linear, boring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess my question is what is the alternative to Science points everyone thinks is such a great idea? We\u0027ve already ruled out going to a specific moon or planet to unlock a specific engine or part. What other progression systems exist in games? Legend of Zelda style puzzle temples to unlock nuclear engines? Snowrunner style go drag a rocket stuck in the mud out? Hacking or lockpicking minigames?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to appreciate just how much better balanced the new KSP2 science system is. I\u0027ve been finding the exact balance of how many points each location awards, what you can get and when, has been very satisfying. And wrapping up the contracts into giving science rewards is very welcome from my perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, don\u0027t get me wrong. I wouldn\u0027t mind some things added to the science system. But I think all it needs to round it out are three or four more varied and fun experiments. (Please Devs, bring back the Grand Slam from KSP1.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might even be up for parts to be locked behind destinations. But as I said before, only for future parts yet to be added. The new near future techs and engines, I\u0027d be fine if they decided wanted to be dependent on certain things. Not anything already in the game. Certainly nothing in teir 1, 2 or even 3. But even for the far future engines, I\u0027m not really sold on the idea. I\u0027d much rather it all just be points. And I\u0027d be interested to see what kind of point generating experiments get added into colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I\u0027m aware testing in field is a thing. My point is just that unlocking a new landing gear or new engine by visiting a specific moon isn\u0027t realistic, and doesn\u0027t seem like good or fun game design to me. And IRL developing new rockets relies on flying and testing new rockets on launch, but doesn\u0027t really care about where they\u0027re going or what they\u0027re carrying. Lots of NASA\u0027s rockets were tested by launching tanks full of water into orbit. And doing it again and again. Also, doesn\u0027t sound fun or engaging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd,\u00A0 I think everyone has rosy glasses memories of KSP1, but the campaign was such a grind fest. My average campaign was unlock all the science parts, drive around the KSP, unlock a multiseat pod, fly several dozen identical missions to orbit to pick up stranded kerbals to grind out the cash to upgrade, then fly several dozen identical probes to hit every Mun and Minmus biome. Hours upon hours of no thought, no effort, repeat, repeat, repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MirageNL","CreatedById":227554,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-29T10:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369387\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709179571\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107350\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SolarAdmiral\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, SolarAdmiral said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll sorts of games use science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf the games you named I only played Civilization and ONI, but in those games you need to choose a tech beforehand and then invest resources in them over time.

It requires you to make a strategic choice, which then pays off later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd KSP is a strategic choice of what you want to spend your limited points on. The choice really is the same. KSP science is limited by locations you go to and experiments you perform. Civ and ONI science are limited by how much you invest in science and time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two major differences with ONI and Civ, as well as some others, is 1) the game pauses when research completes for you to select a new one, or is turn based and 2) the science points are infinite and steadily generated over time. I personally don\u0027t think KSP would work with having to select research ahead of time. Science isn\u0027t infinite, you have to get to new locations to get new points. With the current system, you can get all the points you can from an area, see the total, and then make sure you unlock what you need to get somewhere new. If it was locked in and the points went to that like Civ or ONI, what happens if you miscalculate in your head, and then don\u0027t have enough to get what you need halfway? Science isn\u0027t being generated automatically like those games. And for 2, what happens if you get enough points to finish the selected science right as you\u0027re about to land a probe, or halfway through a burn, or with only half the science from an experiment? Do you need to pause, go to the R\u0026amp;D, select a new science, or risk wasting more points before you can land and go select a new one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the points and buying tech as you like works just fine for KSP. Timberborn has an identical system. And Factorio and Dyson Sphere allow you to build the science ahead of time, then use it in the labs while you have tech selected. Pre-selecting works for them.

But I still wouldn\u0027t want it taken too far. I don\u0027t want to have to fly in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere to unlock the Rapier, or land on the Mun to unlock the Poodle. So it kind of seems like all of those unlock requirements would be in Kerbin Atmo, or Vacuum so Low Kerb Orbit. Seems like requiring a lot of identical missions. Fly a plane with the Wheezley, Fly a plane with the Juno, Fly a plane with the Panther, Fly a Plane with the Whiplash, Fly a plane with the Rapier. So I don\u0027t see it as super engaging. Why not just throw together one junk plane, swap the engine out with each new one, fly the pointless flight mission, unlock the next engine, repeat. That\u0027s the quickest way through that path to get the Rapier. If this system is implemented alongside science points, it seems just like pointless busywork. If I already have the points for the Rapier, but need to fly all these other flights to unlock a chain of engines. And depending on altitude, each of those flights could take 10, 20 min. So is this just requiring a player to fly for an hour up to an altitude then back to land again and again to unlock the engine they actually want for the mission they\u0027re actually wanting to do?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems a lot like the worst missions from KSP1, fly this part to an altitude of 15,000km and a speed of 300m/s.

But honestly I still really just don\u0027t get the overall complaint here and in this thread myself. I think science points as a currency are overall the best way to implement it. Off the top of my head, I can only think of two science unlocking systems implemented in a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne, science points. And look, science points work. All sorts of games use science points.\u00A0 Everything from colony builders, to grand strategy. Factorio, Dyson Sphere, Oxygen not Included, Timberborn, Stellaris, Terra Invicta, Civilization. If you consider xp just science points under a different name, we can include any RPG too. The system is ideal for anything that is non-linear. It allows so much flexibility. Do what you want to get the points. Spend the points on what you want. It\u0027s resource management. There\u0027s limited science points available in each level of destination/resource spent to make it. Gather enough to unlock what you really need to get further in your own style. It lets the player build their own path through the tech. It\u0027s the whole point of having a tech tree. The problem with something more detailed and in depth, it takes way more dev time to develop. And it starts to become more linear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other real option for Tech in games, is gather these specific resources/hidden boxes and put them into a machine. And honestly, that\u0027s pretty much just science points with a step removed, more linear, less flexible. It works for some games, Subnautica, Satisfactory. But they\u0027re much smaller, able to be handcrafted. Not really something that could be applied to KSP as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy whole concern revolves around the fact that so many folks are complaining about currency science points. Yet, I still haven\u0027t heard a solution that improves it. I don\u0027t want the devs to throw out the perfectly serviceable science system, dump thousands upon thousands of manhours into developing something new, only for it to be tedious, repetitive, linear, boring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess my question is what is the alternative to Science points everyone thinks is such a great idea? We\u0027ve already ruled out going to a specific moon or planet to unlock a specific engine or part. What other progression systems exist in games? Legend of Zelda style puzzle temples to unlock nuclear engines? Snowrunner style go drag a rocket stuck in the mud out? Hacking or lockpicking minigames?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to appreciate just how much better balanced the new KSP2 science system is. I\u0027ve been finding the exact balance of how many points each location awards, what you can get and when, has been very satisfying. And wrapping up the contracts into giving science rewards is very welcome from my perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, don\u0027t get me wrong. I wouldn\u0027t mind some things added to the science system. But I think all it needs to round it out are three or four more varied and fun experiments. (Please Devs, bring back the Grand Slam from KSP1.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might even be up for parts to be locked behind destinations. But as I said before, only for future parts yet to be added. The new near future techs and engines, I\u0027d be fine if they decided wanted to be dependent on certain things. Not anything already in the game. Certainly nothing in teir 1, 2 or even 3. But even for the far future engines, I\u0027m not really sold on the idea. I\u0027d much rather it all just be points. And I\u0027d be interested to see what kind of point generating experiments get added into colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I\u0027m aware testing in field is a thing. My point is just that unlocking a new landing gear or new engine by visiting a specific moon isn\u0027t realistic, and doesn\u0027t seem like good or fun game design to me. And IRL developing new rockets relies on flying and testing new rockets on launch, but doesn\u0027t really care about where they\u0027re going or what they\u0027re carrying. Lots of NASA\u0027s rockets were tested by launching tanks full of water into orbit. And doing it again and again.

My average campaign was unlock all the science parts, drive around the KSP, unlock a multiseat pod, fly several dozen identical missions to orbit to pick up stranded kerbals to grind out the cash to upgrade, then fly several dozen identical probes to hit every Mun and Minmus biome.
