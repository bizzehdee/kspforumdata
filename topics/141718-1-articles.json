I started over in career, and I\u0027m having trouble landing planes without sploding. I\u0027ve got the LV 01s on the rear and a LV 05 in front. I\u0027m not trying to land on the runway, just on the smooth ground surrounding campus. I succeed about 1 in 20 landings currently. I slow lateral speed to about 60 m/s and try to \u00A0get my vertical speed to under -10 (-5 if I\u0027m really doing well). Seems pretty unforgiving. I remember landing planes for missions all around Kerbin a year ago where the land is not as smooth as near campus. Now I can\u0027t hardly land on the smooth ground. Any help will be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T12:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout seeing a screenshot of the plane, I\u0027d probably blame the angle of descent. 60m/s horizontal should be slow enough - I did landings without a scratch by touching down at 80 m/s. (That\u0027s with Kerbal Krash Systems, so \u0027without a scratch\u0027 isn\u0027t just a figure of speech). That 5-10 m/s vertical speed sounds a bit too much though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d try is to level out the flight really close to the ground (like 30-60m), so you have a zero~ish vertical speed. Horizontal velocity doesn\u0027t really matter at this point, as if you pitch up carefully, you\u0027ll bleed the rest of the speed without losing altitude too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough a bumpy surface means you can\u0027t always keep an ideal distance and/or angle from the ground... That could make landings really tricky. I admit, I\u0027m a lot better at picking my landing spot than touching down at a bad one... thus I kinda\u0027 almost always aim KSC or an ocean. Those are the flattest and softest spots to go for, the latter also saves the cost and weight of landing gears too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough by enough patience and f9 overuse, I\u0027m convinced that anything can land virtually anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VRisO5z.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022408\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VRisO5z.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T15:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah. Tried another 50 landings. As gentle as I can. Not really any learning curve any more. The plane just sucks. I watched\u00A0Scott\u00A0Manley\u0027s vids and it is stable and all, but just no smooth control. \u00A0Have to wait till I can unlock better parts I guess. The retractable ones have twice the impact tolerance.

Physics has been added and now they are fragile. You cannot treat them like you used to, period. Don\u0027t carry more than 200 units of fuel, in a plane massing 5 tonnes, max.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main point is that you need to learn to land like a feather. The grass at KSC is at an altitude of 66m. Scrub off your speed\u00A0by porpoising before you get there. Get to a 75m altitude, in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elevel flight\u003C/em\u003E. Cut the engines and\u00A0just let the speed bleed off little by little by itself until your plane touches down. It should be below 55 m/s. (Then hit the brakes to prevent skidding.) Do not force your plane down onto the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have smooth control, then adding length to the plane can help a lot. Reducing the \u0022authority\u0022 of your pitch controls can help.
