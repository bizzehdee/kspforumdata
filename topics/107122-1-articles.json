Parachute\n2. Pod\n3. Utility bay (closed, nothing in it)\n4. Heat shield\n5. Decoupler\n6. Some sort of launch hardware just to get on a ballistic trajectory\n\nNo parts were rotated or offset during assembly.\n\n(This setup was repeated for both 1.25m and 2.5 meter pod with utility bay, chute, and heat shield of matching size)\n\n**Test method:**\n\n1. Launch to suborbital trajectory, just to get slightly out of the atmosphere\n2. Decouple near apoapsis\n3. Turn SAS off\n4. Observe orientation in relation to retrograde marker with navball set to surface mode\n5. Repeat with the exact same setup except from utility bay\n\nAll tests **without utility bay** points to a **balanced** pod, as the assembly keeps pointing to retrograde.\n\nAll tests **with utility bay** makes the pod **tilt** slightly compared to the above.\n\nI also, just for fun and profit, did a few of the tests while reentering at 4000\u002B m/s with the periapsis set to 30km, with the same result.\n\nIs this intentional? Can someone confirm this behavior, or am I doing something stupid?"}]}
