There is an easy way to compare if transmission should work, and how well. Is the data a number, or made of numbers (digital)? If yes, then 100% transmission. Other than surface collection, it should all be 100%. Crew reports would mostly be science, not some subjective opinion, maybe photos. From the era this is roughly analogous to, high-res photos were film, so they\u0027d bring back the film (which should then improve in the tech tree, however, once digital cameras don\u0027t suck)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:41:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I never really see that as a problem...

If it reads off numbers, then 100% transmission. The gameplay and balance are an issue because the entire science system, and its interaction with tech is broken, IMO. Goo? That can be whatever the devs want. If it need to be landed, it needs to be landed. A thermometer? No, that\u0027s transmitted. Sample return, and maybe goo are the only things that should need to be returned, and I\u0027d argue they should then have 0% transmission (a later probe part might be a sample analyzer that transmits X%).\n\nAll the other stuff should transmit 100%, IMO.\n\nThe trick is that globally, the science returns should drop. Then perhaps EVA reports and sample collection can be weighted by science astronaut skill as a multiplier. So a sample picked at random is worth 20. Picked by a level 5 scientist? 100. The EVA reports could scale that way as well.\n\nRight now, the \u0022gameplay\u0022 is that you land wherever, plant a flag, take a sample, make an EVA report.
