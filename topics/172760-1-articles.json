you really have to have a \u003Cem\u003Emassive\u003C/em\u003E amount of drag coming from some part right at the top. You were facing almost directly prograde, too.

A pair of Thumpers taped to the sides as a new first stage will give this thing quite a large reach, and a tiny solar panel helps keep power available on long flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a Reliant at the bottom; the heat shield has half of its ablator; the pod has its monoprop removed. You\u0027ll also notice the battery below the main chute. I usually fly without one, but I reckon you\u0027ll be more comfortable having it. I also used the move tool to nudge the pod and the crew cabin a bit closer together, and pull the heat shield a small bit away from the bottom of the crew cabin. Both of these things make the craft look better (especially the heat shield, which in its natural state clips too deep into the cabin and ends up having parts of it clip through) and slightly improve reentry stability by modifying the mass distribution. Finally, the parachutes are set to open a little lower down, because I am impatient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch is as simple as throttling to 100%, setting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde, flying a standard gravity turn aiming at 45 degrees pitch between 10km and 12km, and casually strolling into orbit under Terrier power. Reentry is as simple as setting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Retrograde and popping the chutes when it\u0027s safe to do so. (I can\u0027t advise you on MechJeb settings, as I have never used it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/q21zc5zxsb2anz0/Rescue%20Ranger%20Mk1.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the craft file\u003C/a\u003E, if you want to try it out.

I just realized that the FL-T800 tanks aren\u0027t really earlygame.
