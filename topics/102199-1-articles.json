I go into the persistence file, change their names a few letters, by adding an extra s or taking away an extra t, and it seems to change their roles accordingly to engineer or pilot. When I leave the astronaut complex or try going to their ship though, the Kraken attacks, and freezes the game. When I re-load the game their ship is gone, and they and their crew mates are dead.
