I think the debs are intending to implement it at some point but if it\u0027s as severe as DRE it might put off less competent players such as myself. My proposed solution is this: Perhaps most parts, rather than getting obliterated by heat, could have a \u0022semi-destroyed\u0022 state, much like wheels have a \u0022popped\u0022 state. And, like wheels, could be repaired by kerbals on EVA. It would prevent that part from functioning and have some cosmetic effect, like engines having a twisted, warped nozzle or fuel tanks having a black, bent, charred look. What do you think about that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roastduck","CreatedById":98490,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T05:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there should either be re-entry damage, or no re-entry damage, with no gray area. A difficulty setting turning on certain features would be great, but I think that a save file should either have it on, or have it off. Otherwise, what\u0027s the point? The nature of re-entry damage would force you to bring replacement parts and tools, because you can\u0027t just re-inflate a tire that has been melted by compression heating. The weight of replacement parts would quickly outstrip the weight of adequate heat shielding\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T08:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last time I saw the devs talk about reentry heat, they were talking about doing it without dedicated heatshield parts, so they\u0027re probably thinking of something less severe than even current DRE.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T08:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m yet to die on reentry, and I did some waaaaaaaay too steep reentries, so.... From my perspective: they\u0027d first have to implement any reentry damage at all. Only thing I seen were solar panels breaking off, but other than that nothing seems to be destroyed on reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always hear about reentry as one of most risky procedures, you have to align your ship, pick a good entry angle, be careful with speed, watch out not to expose any fragile elements.... in Kerbal it\u0027s a joke - you watch some nice effects and that\u0027s all. Nothing seems to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey basically got rid of one of most crucial and risky stages of a space flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope current state of things is just a placeholder for real reentry damage and death to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T08:55:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that there should be some kind of damage. I dont think it needs to be as\u0022realistic\u0022(I know there are some debates around that) as DRE but at interplanetary missions u should need a heatshield of some sort for an aerobraking maneuver. Its just odd to throw a 500t aerodynamic nightnamere into jools atmosphere knowing it will glow and spin like a fire cracker, although no damage at all will happen. This is nothing that might add to the steep learning courve if u dont overdo it,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust a little more of a challenge for experienced players\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T09:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore like: immersion for a new player.

You get most science from doing things noone but expirienced players knows about - for example building capsule that\u0027s in fact a ball with all of the scientific equipment you possibly can muster being randomly strapped onto it and then getting it through the atmosphere back on a planet - something every new player thinks of as an impossible feat to do as it should burn in the reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent mechanics only add to the confusion of a new players.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T09:30:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sky_walker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T11:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roastduck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roastduck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E re-entry damage would force you to bring replacement parts and tools, because you can\u0027t just re-inflate a tire that has been melted by compression heating.
