Rather than having a high-level interpreted language ready to accept user input from square one, it would be fun to have a programmable autopilot mod that focused on assembly-level programming of an emulated CPU, where if you want an in-flight interpreted scripting language, you have to write it. Ideally, such a mod would have different CPUs at different places on the tech tree with architectures exposing more and more useful features, but it would probably be good to do a single-CPU mod with no tech tree first as a proof of concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my idea for a starting point would be an emulation of the Apollo Guidance Computer, or else an architecture heavily inspired by it. It would be really fun to be able to write software for a Munar landing on top of the historical AGC architecture (of course, the architecture of the computer\u0027s I/O to spacecraft systems would probably have to be entirely redesigned to fit general KSP craft instead of the specific hardware of the historical CSM and LEM, but otherwise a fairly faithful reproduction of the instruction set and memory bank switching architecture could probably be done).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anybody think this sounds like a fun project?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T05:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor your consideration\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/64848-pythonall-os-basagc-apollo-guidance-computer-for-ksp/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-15T05:12:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2016 05:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwbrase","CreatedById":150131,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T06:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat looks like a workalike of the AGC software in Python.
