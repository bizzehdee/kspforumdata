However, kerbals are heteroautotrops. Basically this means they can metabolize complex sugars for energy; however, they can in the presence of little food and oxygen use co2 water and sunlight to produce sugars for energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes kerbals so durable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals have amazingly durable, and flexible bodies, and i have come up with two theories on how this is possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kerbals have extremely strong, and somewhat flexible cell walls that allow greater protection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
