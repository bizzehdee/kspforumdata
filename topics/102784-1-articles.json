Modeling a Space Shuttle is a LOT harder than making a jet-rocket or rocket SSTO in KSP, though Space Shuttles have existed in our world and SSTOs not quite yet.\n\nIf you can be a bit more clear on your goals the forum can give you loads of help. Let me put it this way: describe the movie that plays in your head when you imagine your ship lifting off from the space center and meeting your station in orbit. I guarantee someone here has done something like that, and I also guarantee when you play long enough you will do something no one else has thought of. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:11:42Z","Content":"I have a performance evaluation in six minutes, so I ain\u0027t got time to type.

That\u0027s with stock aero; to be honest, I\u0027ve yet to try an SSTO rocket launch in FAR, but I imagine the procedure\u0027d be the same (1.2 is what I\u0027ve heard is recommended for general all-stages rocketry in FAR, so I imagine you could pull off a better payload fraction there...).\n\nSeriously, those links I\u0027ve posted above will help out a lot - keptin\u0027s guide is an essential for newcomers to the world of spaceplanes, while DocMoriarty\u0027s guide is good for the specifics in stock aero.

The problem I had was that I wasn\u0027t sure if it was my flying or my design that was preventing me from being successful. It doesn\u0027t help that the ascent profile for getting a spaceplane to orbit is substantially different from that of a rocket. If you continue to struggle I would recommend downloading a proven SSTO from the spacecraft exchange thread and flying that. If you fail to get one of those to orbit, at least you know you need to improve your flying skills. Once you can get such a craft to orbit is the time you can try with your own designs knowing that if you then fail with those, it\u0027s the design that needs tweaking rather than your flying."},{"CreatedByName":"Forty21112","CreatedById":125887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T11:06:49Z","Content":"@Red Iron Crown: I thought it might be more of a plane style flying.

If you try and launch straight for space you\u0027ll struggle- the trick is to keep running on jet engines for as long as possible, building up speed around 25-30km. You should be able to get a suborbital trajectory while still running on jet engines. After the jets shut down, very little rocket or RCS thrust is then needed to circularize.\n\nFor a 1-man spaceplane, you need less fuel than you might think. I built a basic jet/monopropellant spaceplane that will get to orbit using just a single jet fuel tank, turbojet engine and two of the O-10 monoprop engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Forty21112","CreatedById":125887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T12:20:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen it before, I read it when I downloaded FAR.

If so, a lot of the pointers we can give go right out the airlock--for example you cannot get a turbojet up to 2000m/s in FAR, as it (realistically) limits thrust at high Mach numbers.\n\nSee this thread for more discussion on SSTOs in FAR: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90780-FAR-jet-engines-are-seriously-nerfed](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90780-FAR-jet-engines-are-seriously-nerfed)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T13:52:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @Red Iron Crown: I thought it might be more of a plane style flying.

First it jetisoned the side-SRBs, then the huge orange tank of fuel. It\u0027s the imbalance of these and the large changes of balance that makes replicating that design hard in KSP, where our engines don\u0027t have anything like the same gimbal range.\n\nSingle Stage To Orbit just means something that doesn\u0027t jettison anything on the way up; whether that\u0027s a pure rocket, vertical-launch jet (assisted) or spaceplane is immaterial.\n\nThe ones in \u0027Exploring The System\u0027 don\u0027t work in FAR, by the way, so forget that reference."},{"CreatedByName":"Forty21112","CreatedById":125887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T13:54:47Z","Content":"Yes, I am using FAR and AJE, if that will help.
