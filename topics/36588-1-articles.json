I believe they are aiming for 7 tons to LEO instead of 11 tons. This puts the F9R in the same class as Soyuz or Ariane 6, whereas the non-reusable F9 1.1 is in the same class as Ariane 5, Delta IV or Atlas V. The plan is that the savings of reusing the first stage instead of building a new one allows for a lower price per pound to orbit. The jury is out on whether they can manage to be cheaper than Ariane 6 or Soyuz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it can be argued that the best way to reduce hardware costs is mass production of cheap elements. That is the approach of Ariane 6: cheap mass produced SRBs as a first and second stage. While the Merlin engines are cheap and simple, reusability gets in the way of mass production by reducing the production rate and adding complexity to the elements (landing gear, avionics, weight, etc...).

Satellite operators operate (very roughly) on the \u0027rule of fifths\u0027; a fifth of the budget for the satellite bus, a fifth for the rocket, a fifth for ground systems, a fifth for the payload, and the rest for various systems work (e.g. integration).

Satellite operators operate (very roughly) on the \u0027rule of fifths\u0027; a fifth of the budget for the satellite bus, a fifth for the rocket, a fifth for ground systems, a fifth for the payload, and the rest for various systems work (e.g. integration). If you somehow reduce launch costs to nothing at all, you\u0027ve introduced the world to the clearly revolutionary potential of four-fifths current cost spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the best we can hope for, even if SpaceX manages to cut the cost of a Falcon 9 launch by 50% (which I doubt) is a 10% savings for the average space project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are feedback effects within that cost structure. Make putting mass in orbit cheap, and the rest of the engineering balance shifts away from custom hyper-optimized designs toward simpler manufacturing, wider design margins, easier analysis, simpler testing, more parts commonality, more mass production, et cetera. Busses get cheaper. Payloads get slightly cheaper. Integration gets cheaper. Ground systems probably don\u0027t change much. It will certainly take time for the industry to adapt to those ideas, and some areas will have less to gain than others, but those other \u0022fifths\u0022 won\u0027t just stay fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
