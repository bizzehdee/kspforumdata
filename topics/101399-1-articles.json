Nice setup you have there, very much the setup I had in mind when I made them. \n\nI like your suggestions. You are right about the type of resource not being very clear for the darker colours.

One with Food/Water/Oxygen for when that\u0027s your only life support and a second one which also has space for waste products to be used with the recyclers in TAC-LS.
