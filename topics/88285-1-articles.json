You can run struts between the ship and the clamps themselves (you can radialy attach to the red towers). A strut or two per clamp can add extra strength if your craft is so heavy that its riping out of the launch clamps on load although you still want a minimum of 2 clamps so it does not tilt sideways. I have done the trick of girders/Ibeams on decouplers leading to the clamps for times when I needed to move the clamp towers out further from the rocket though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
