While I\u0027ve managed to get used to some of the quirks, recently, some of the bugs I\u0027ve encountered have caused some big issues in my game and I wondered if anyone had any suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 1: Adding or removing parts to a craft sometimes causes the structure of the craft to warp and deform rapidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 2: Removing a part from a craft sometimes results in the whole craft moving to the cursor throwing it around like a rag doll. Sometimes this leaves a greyed out thumbnail image for the part on the screen at a static position that stays even after reload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 3: Removing a part from a space station resulted in a structural component completely disassociating itself from the craft. The two sections then behaved like two separate craft but were still one craft. The second part (which was unpowered) then no longer reacted to physics and began to propel itself through space without any physics resulting in the station bugging out and the camera focusing on blank space between the two objects.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre these know issues that will be worked out in time, or is this a known issue on my system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play via steam on 2015 iMac OS Big Sur\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
