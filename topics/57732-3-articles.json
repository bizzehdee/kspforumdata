Or, rather, the content that they did decide to add just gets cancelled because it wouldn\u0027t be useful for little Billy who is looking into buying the game. When people complain about these actions, Squad falls back to their argument that modders should fill in those gaps. At this point the devs are just attempting to make a base for modders to add features for them.

The total abandonment of mid and endgame content really is just \u0027take the money and run\u0027 design.

We are less patient because we have already mastered things like orbital mechanics and base building, etc. The last feature that experienced players got was docking, back in 0.18. Five updates (at 3 months per update) without a fun feature can kind of make any player a little peeved. The nail in the coffin is the fact that the Devs confirmed that the most wanted endgame feature has been canned, and that the foreseeable future of the game will be devoted to new players.

Every update (such as science) adds options and new parts for the modders to make. Yes they could have made them before but apart from interstellar I have never seen a science mod. Also Interstellar mod is very different form the sort of game I want to play, it\u0027s far too sci Fictions than Science Fiction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final point is what would it take to keep people happy each update? How long would it take you to get to a new planet or 10? If 10 did last you the 2-3 months till the next update how many new ones would need to be added then? They could add procedural planets yes but their personal opinion not to is one I respect. Since they have said they will not be adding them a modder knows they can make a mod for it without being made redundant in 3 months. If they added a whole new mechanic like life support (TAC or Ironcross) How long would that last? How many BIG updates can they do while ignoring small tweaks, bug removal UI changes to handle the updates before the game is huge takes 10 mins to load and crashes half the time BUT has all the features the community wants?

Every single update we run the risk of a critical mod-maker losing interest in his work and completely losing all of his progress until someone manages to take it over.

I tend towards regarding Squad as a pretty good developer overall, but as you can see by my TL/DR, there\u0027s nothing to say you can\u0027t complain if you don\u0027t like their development style\u0027s consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelopment IS slow - Squad\u0027s team is small and personal. An art guy, a handful of coders, and a handful of QA\u0027s. They wont grow in any large way in the foreseeable future. This means we get the 3-month cycles we currently have (arguably a long time). On the flipside, this is a fairly efficient team size and structure, which shows in the relatively bug-free releases. As teams grow in size, they become disjointed and do not work as efficiently, so there is an upside to the slower, smaller team. They also happen to be VERY deliberate in their design process, so they add very few new features to the game at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey ARE focusing on Early-game (for now) - It is true that it would benefit Squad to attract new players, and a progression-based career mode helps. Keep in mind though, that career mode was a planned feature from the start. They didn\u0027t decide out-of-the-blue to implement it because they wanted to drive new sales. They needed to work on this feature sometime, and for it to be all it can be, it requires a large commitment of time and effort. Simply, they can\u0027t work on much else until it is finished. (Again, slow, small team development). They\u0027ve said numerous times that their features wishlist is gigantic, and that they want to do as much as they can. Harvester has also said that resource mining \u003Cstrong\u003Ein it\u0027s previous form\u003C/strong\u003E is not happening, but that it may turn up again in a better way when they come back to focus on wider features again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELack of deadlines - They don\u0027t know what they\u0027ll be working on 3 or more updates down the line, or how long those updates will take, or when to expect it all to be done. They work in cycles, wherein they decide what is going to be added to the game in each cycle as it comes. It\u0027s very haphazard. The tradeoff is that Squad is more flexible and does not need to adhere to a list of \u0022Must haves\u0022, instead focusing on what they feel is the best thing to work on at that time. This mostly is a benefit for things that don\u0027t work out (Resources), since they\u0027re not locked into using a feature that can\u0027t be done elegantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL/DR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Small, slow team makes less-buggy releases, slower.

We are less patient because we have already mastered things like orbital mechanics and base building, etc. The last feature that experienced players got was docking, back in 0.18. Five updates (at 3 months per update) without a fun feature can kind of make any player a little peeved.
