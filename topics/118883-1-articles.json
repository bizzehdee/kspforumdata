But if you look closely, you can find out the reasons, no magic involved. First and foremost, notice that I have 2/3rds of the engines, pushing a slightly higher amount fuel. That helps a lot with range, and it is the reason wings are actually useful, not just a way to look cool. Also, note that due to the weird way KSP calculates wings, you could put as much wing area as I have clipping wings into each other (to get closer to your replica goal). Feel free to take some inspiration form the way I put the cockpit in mine too, I posted it because I thought that would help you get it more like the goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
