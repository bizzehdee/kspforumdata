I am putting together a small craft. I radially mounted a cubic struts then added small decouplers. To these I placed an Oscar-B tank. Ran a fuel line from the tank back to the main ship to bypass the decoupler but the decoupler is preventing the tank from registering the added fuel. If I leave the decoupler off it shows up just fine.
