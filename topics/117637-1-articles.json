I am putting together a small craft. I radially mounted a cubic struts then added small decouplers. To these I placed an Oscar-B tank. Ran a fuel line from the tank back to the main ship to bypass the decoupler but the decoupler is preventing the tank from registering the added fuel. If I leave the decoupler off it shows up just fine. How do I make this work?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T20:07:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Shirt**"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T19:17:22Z","Content":"Make sure the line is going from tank to tank (not from decoupler or girder or w/e), and the right fuel type is used(Like Lqd/Oxi vs Lqd in stock, or a bajillion things with mods)\n\nMake sure that the arrows are going from the source tank to destination tank (The order you click determines which way the little arrows on the fuel line point)\n\nIf it\u0027s MechJeb/ KER that\u0027s not reading it, sometimes those just get fussy, so try sending the vessel to the launchpad, and it should count everything correctly."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T20:07:27Z","Content":"Should have checked at the launchpad.
