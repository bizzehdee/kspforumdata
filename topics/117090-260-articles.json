It will be a much more massive undertaking than the current WIP stuff, which is why it has been on hold for so long.  It will also need some of the pods and other bits that are WIP to be finished as those pods will form the CM for some of the lander variants.  Even if I were to start on it -right now-, you still wouldn\u0027t see anything useful out of it until winter/spring, as there is quite a bit of stuff that needs to be done first (e.g. the stuff I\u0027m already working on).\n\nSo basically, yeah, that is already the plan.  It is just a bit more long term and complicated of a plan than it would seem from a quick glance.\n\nThe LC rework will include:\n\n- New fuel tanks and cargo containers.  At least octagonal, possibly with a second squashed octagonal form factor.  These will be a new MFT variant.  All new geometry and textures (and recoloring support) when compared to the existing LC fuel tanks.  Hollow variants will be made available for the multi-stage lander setups.\n- New LC-POD models and textures.  The existing stuff works, but is a bit... simplistic and industrial looking.  I can do better on the textures at the very least.\n- At least one, possibly two, horizontal lander part series.\n    - Landing Module -- deployable engines w/ integrated landing legs and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters.\n    - Cargo bays, both skeletal and full-enclosure.\n    - Service modules that counter-balance the CM\u0027s, for easy COG/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECOT\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E balancing on horizontal designs.  SM\u0027s may have variants with different engines and fuels (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, hypergolic, hydrolox, LH2-nuke).\n    - Crew modules, at least two lengths for each form-factor.\n    - ? Aeroshells ? -- big maybe on this one, still some major problems to solve before they could become a reality (engine exhaust holes in a procedural mesh..., or how to combine non-procedural meshes in a usable and easy to construct manner)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-14T19:38:50Z","Content":"Don\u0027t forget to chuck one of the current LC landing windows onto a cos part ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-14T21:28:08Z","Content":"Re:  The Gemini pod sizing/scaling:\n\n![eEtWFlm.png](http://i.imgur.com/eEtWFlm.png)\n\nLeft = 1.40625m CM / 1.875m SM  \n\nCenter = 1.5m CM / 2.0m SM  \n\nRight = 1.875m CM / 2.5m SM\n\nIt looks like the only way I can put a standard docking port on the 1.5m/2m variant (center), is if I make the top conic portion a separate part.
