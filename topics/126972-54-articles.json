He blinked again and looked around, nary an ocean to be found.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thomlock! Wake up you old geezer!

It was still dark on the ice, the surface itself still in the shadow of a mountain, but he could make out a few key formations. No craters, only ridges rising out of the ice. And in the center of the valley there stood several spires, like teeth biting their way upwards out of the ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0002_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0002_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the crew was fully awake, and he wondered if any of them had slept. Gletrix was pulling him out of his slumber, collar first. Agake was taking science data and other samples from the internal sensors. Macfred was doing his usual drill of failing to contact Kerbin. Three or more years they had been gone now, without so much as a whisper from Kerbin. At this point he could only assume the entire planet was dead. And yet Macfred persisted. Commendable. Useless, but still commendable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually they suited up, crawled out of their lander and completed their usual chores. No one heard the flag planting ceremony, no one except the four of them and possibly the kerbals back at the Edge of Infinity. They grabbed some supplies, stored their first set of surface samples in the lander (ice that would no doubt be melted before they returned), and then set off into the valley.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe surface was oddly pristine, no cracks or craters to be found. Agake suggested that meant it was a new surface, that an ocean swirled deep below them. Thomlock\u0027s dream flashed back to him momentarily, the endless darkness, a soft whisper from some distant point. Or was it Macfred? Was his headset acting up? He turned to face the rest of the group, patting at the side of his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, kid, I didn\u0027t quite hear you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hear what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Didn\u0027t you just whisper something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other three traded looks and then looked at him with a bit of confusion in their eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No? Okay then, never mind the crazy old kerb behind the visor. Let\u0027s get back at it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey started off again, but only made it a few steps before the ground shook. It was just like his dream. Thomlock looked around for cracks in the ice, and was happy to find none. He noticed a thin dusting of blue ice had caked his boots and his legs, no doubt kicked up by their trek to the anomaly. He reached down to brush it off just as another whisper leaked its way into his ear. He patted at the side of his helmet, hoping to shake loose whatever was making noise. Nothing. They all started walking again, this time more carefully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pulled his wrench out and adjusted the radio contact on the side of his helmet. Perhaps that was it. No more whispering that he could tell, but maybe that wasn\u0027t it. He started on one of the microphone mounts on the other side of his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe dropped the wrench when the light show started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0064_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0064_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA blue glow, just like in his dream. Each of the teeth, each of the spire of this ice castle they were making their way towards now had an intense blue orb hovering atop it. He reached down and picked up his wrench, knocking the ice and dust off of it by pounding it on the side of his helmet. Macfred and Agake were debating whether or not to continue onwards, but he knew what they\u0027d decide and starting walking towards the anomaly again. Following the blue lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whispers started again almost immediately. They were never loud enough to understand, but they were there. They seemed to come in between the pulses from the energy show ahead of them. He tried smacking his helmet a few times, a bench-thump as one of his old friends would\u0027ve called it, but that only caused his helmet to ring. Maybe it was an equipment issue? He had Macfred check the back of his EVA suit, but everything came up green so they pressed on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#7f8c8d;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022...

Macfred started towards him and took another look. \u0022I\u0027m still not hearing anything.\u0022 Thomlock could feel him patting at the back of his helmet. \u0022Are you sure you\u0027re alright? Maybe we should head back to the ship and...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe waved him away. \u0022No way. I\u0027m fine kid, just... just don\u0027t worry about me. Let\u0027s go.

A kerbal voice. Bob Kerman, the same Bob Kerman that was presently at the Edge of Infinity. Something was up, and the closer they got to the ice castle the more answers he seemed to get. He picked up his pace.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#7f8c8d;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022...

What was he looking for? Faeries? Gremlins? Green Goo? He knew he\u0027d find none of those here, but something told him to look.

Fun,\u00A0in a weird and\u00A0frighteningly insane sort of way. If he was going to go mad, he might as well enjoy it, right?

One moment he was being lifted into the air over Vall, the next he was in this small, round room. The voices stopped the instant he arrived here, and none too soon. The euphoria he felt on Vall had faded too; his mind now returned to it usual old grumpy state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe walls felt cold through his mittens. A check of his suit\u0027s sensors showed he was still in vacuum. There was a light on the far end of the room, blinking red. A slow blink at first, but its frequency increased quickly. As the it approached one blink per second he started to hear a very low noise. A quick glance at his sensors and the room was now at one fifth of an atmosphere. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was in an airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually the blinking turned into a solid red color, its frequency much faster now than his eyes could see. The low sound he was hearing before increased in frequency until finally the light turned green and the noise stopped. A door opened on the far end of the room, opening into a much larger space. Thomlock noticed a small amount of water on the airlock floor, no doubt ice dust from Vall that had melted under the sudden pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0078_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022567\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0078_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething felt strange about this place. Something felt strange about himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe larger room was impressive. Eight walls with eight sets of doors, fourteen round and two square. A plaque and a large display monitor of some sort were above each of the round doors. All of the plaques were identical, and bore the Kerbal Space Program insignia. The monitors showed what he could only guess was the status of the airlocks under them. All but the one he had just crawled from were red, many slowly flashing an !!ERROR!! message.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe square set of doors were to his right, a Kerbal Space Program sign hanging above them. The room itself was a dull bluish-green color, nearly the color of Vall. The floor appeared to be mostly concrete, itself a grey and bronze color. A triangular platform rose to meet each of the eight sets of doors, each offset slightly to one side as it rose from the floor. This produced a pleasing iris pattern, culminating in an impressive bit of art in the center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe checked his suit sensors one final time, and then tossed his helmet back into the airlock. The air was damp and had a musty smell to it. He wondered if the walls were originally green, or if there was some sort of algae growing on them. The bronze coloring on the floor appeared to be some sort of oxidation, and felt rough under his feet. He took stock of the many doors, \u0022portals\u0022 if the monitors were to be believed, and decided the other two doors must be the exit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0070_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022568\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0070_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe guessed he must be alone, as no welcoming party had come to greet him. He called out a sheepish \u0022hello\u0022 and received no response. Just flashing monitors and the soft sound of forced air. There was nothing to give away his location, either. Almost certainly he was still on Vall. Perhaps he was underground, just beneath the anomaly? He checked a couple of the other airlock doors and found them locked. The square doors under the large flag were the only way out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0093_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022569\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0093_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hallway behind those doors was dark and wet. A very thin layer of water covered the floor, and it took a while for his eyes to adjust. He thought about going back for his helmet so he\u0027d have a light source, but decided there was no reason to. The hallway itself was large, much larger than the portal room. Another set of doors were across the hall from his, locked. A large glass wall was to the right, nothing but darkness beyond. He put his hand to the glass, trying to see something on the other side. Nothing greeted him but his own reflection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA light flickered to life behind him, beckoning him down the hall. That strange feeling returned to him; a feeling of choice. He had a choice here. He could walk down the dark, damp, frightening hallway, or he could go back, get his helmet, and wait for something to find him. Choice. He couldn\u0027t remember the last time he felt like he had a choice in anything. He shook off the feeling and made his way towards the light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe passed several other sets of doors as he walked, each set of them locked as tightly as those behind him. Eventually he reached the light, and found that it led to another hallway. This one was dry, better lit, and ended at a single, open door. It was lined by a number of other doors, fourteen or so, all of them closed. He poked his head into this new hallway and listened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, no response but the silent sound of softly circulating air. He wondered if perhaps he wasn\u0027t being led into a trap, though he had no idea who or what would set such a trap for an old kerbal such as himself. He looked back into the hallway he had just emerged from. At one end the light from the portal room glinted off of the large glass wall, at the other only darkness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat choice did he really have?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain he tried each of the doors as he made his way down the hall, all of them locked. He became aware of a deep hum, an electrical or mechanical sound that was growing in amplitude the closer he got to the open door. He slowed to an amble as he got close, as the door was obviously another airlock. He stopped just short, put his hands on the side of the door and took a look inside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe wondered if he shouldn\u0027t go back for his helmet, and was about to when the opposite door opened, revealing an even larger room beyond. He couldn\u0027t see much of the room from this angle, but could already tell that one word described it: Blue. Blue and nearly spherical.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stepped through the airlock and into the blue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0101_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022568\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0101_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA smiling and very old face greeted him; another kerbal. His eyes looked familiar, yet Thomlock couldn\u0027t quite place him. He was sitting atop a conical dais in the center of the room. The raised center appeared as though it could rotate, itself seeming to hover inside a shaft at the core of the room. A series of monitors lined the walls, sixteen in all, and a blue glow emanated from the dome ceiling and from beneath the floor. He started into the room, yet jumped and spun around when the door slammed shut behind him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello, old friend.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat voice. After all these years? He turned back to face him, to look deep into those eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Albro?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The one and only. So very nice to be remembered, especially by the famously dead Thomlock Kerman.\u0022 The old kerbal chuckled. \u0022Please, do come in, my very old friend.

Some\u00A0were \u0022paraphrased,\u0022 as the kerbals weren\u0027t directly recorded as saying anything, while one of them was said or suggested by something that was \u0022beyond\u0022 the Vallhenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are others I would have referenced, but\u00A0for this to work I needed to find some evidence of (living) kerbals at that specific place.
