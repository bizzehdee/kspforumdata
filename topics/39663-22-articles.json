It\u0027s heartbreaking to see a design you\u0027ve put too many hours into just fail and with SSTOs, there\u0027s alot of ways a design can fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after a few failed attempts that took many, many hours of my time, I realised the basic issue is problem juggling. When designing a plane you are trying to solve a number of problems at once and those solutions must all come together and go into orbit, or crash. So, I designed an engineering process in which I could focus on one problem at a time, solve it, then move onto the next. Each design stage has to logically build on the previous solution and not be dependent on the solution to a problem yet to be solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got motivated for this post because yesterday I built a small cargo SSTO and the process is now so refined that from start to finish it only took about 4 hours to roll out a high quality, reliable lifter. Below is very much the telling of the story of how this described junior heavy lifter was designed, along with the construction process, including techniques, I used to build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDisclaimer, images were taken disassembling a craft copy upon completion.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VcMDfAb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VcMDfAb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft concept: small utility cargo lifter that can do interplanetary hauls when fuel is added to the cargo hold along with light cargo. Requirements are 10 tons to Duna and 5 Tons to Laythe. The design trade offs I took were to spend nearly 10% of its loaded mass on the super structure and with about a third of its orbital mass in TWR with nuke engines. There are some pretty big delta-V performance trade-offs to get the robustness I want out of the design. But, the ease of use factor has proven worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets get on with the build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 1: It all starts with the core\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ookbl5p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ookbl5p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty basic. Start with the cockpit and probe core. The hitchhiker can is added for utility(considered internal payload) and a docking port added to it to service the payload. Standard payload goal is 20 tons which is the Rockomax 18. There will be enough capacity to add in a Rockomax 9 for additional fuel. Alternate payload strategies will revolve around a Rockomax 9 for range extension with additional base and rover payloads built around hitchhiker storage units and science laboratories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to note the girder between the cockpit and the payload. This is very important as both the short and long girders act as a spring. This is a key component in cushioning the craft from it\u0027s payload in rough landings, Duna being one of the most common and punishing. Wackjob has done a huge amount of work discovering and describing how strong and flexible girder/strut arrangements are and I won\u0027t go into that here at length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 2: Building the cage\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2hunw6M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222hunw6M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I\u0027m investing a massive fraction of my dry mass. The results are worth it. You don\u0027t have to build seven ribs, you can get away with three or four and if done right, only one. Obviously, you don\u0027t have to build a cage either. There are other styles of plane building but, you don\u0027t get the robustness a cage offers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice I\u0027ve strapped the ends of the cage together and added more struts along the spine. This is to prevent the arching of the plane under full load which can wreck take-offs and landings. You\u0027ll also note the wing spar on which much of the fuel is going to be mounted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s two approaches I take to building the cage. One is to build it with girders and use I-beams for the landing gears. The other way is basically the opposite, to use I-beams for the cage and girders for the landing gear. The first approach is alot more spongy which is good for very heavy, boxy craft. The second is more rigid and works well for craft with a long body or wide wings. Here I\u0027m using an I-beam endo-skeleton purely for aesthetics, mostly because it\u0027s a small airframe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you design a cage be aware that girders have asymmetrical joint strength. This seems to be a random property of the part which is assigned on physics load. I would say this is how girders get their sponginess so be mindful of your cage layout and strutting using a girder-based approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 3: Powerplant and fuel complete the endo-skeleton\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uP1DD8J.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uP1DD8J.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this step I arrive at a number which will be around 90% of the mass of the final aircraft. The biggest decision at this step is the required range of internal stores. If I just need to get the thing into low Kerbin orbit then, the fuel tanks will be limited and the added weight will be mostly engines. With this build, I\u0027ve got the target of Mun and Minmus in mind for the full 20T payload on internal stores and added fuel for Duna and Laythe trips using payload capacity for fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe end up at around 80 tons with 6 turbos being easily enough power to get out of Kerbin atmo. My rough guide is 15 tons per turbo without excessive air-hogging, in this build I ended up with something like six ram intakes per turbo jet. This setup will run 100 tons out of atmo no problem, especially considering the 4 nukes which supply a very sporty vacuum TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to take note of is the girders for the landing gears. Again, they use that spring principle with is vitally import for the areas that will take the biggest pounding on landing. The girders are attached to the strongest parts of the airframe. I always do this. Attaching this arrangement to fuel tanks is asking for firey landings as fuel tanks are very delicate and won\u0027t suffer much abusive before heated complaints. The strutting is also fairly important. The rules are to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStrut in physical triangles\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStrut across branches of the craft tree, or\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStrut upwards through the craft tree\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever strut down the craft tree with points of impact.

You will most likely be putting wings over, under or covering any fuel tanks hanging off the side of the payload cage. These wings will be strutted to these parts which will add to rigidity and overall structural strength so, bare that in mind least you strut your craft too tightly. The key is for it to be strong but flexible. Not floppy nor brittle. Refining this is the next step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 4: Giving your lifter the beat down\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the engine and fuel arrangement has been strapped down it\u0027s time to test structural integrity. There\u0027s two key tests I use plus a third which I will often employ on larger craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R49vesO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R49vesO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/auoD9Xd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022auoD9Xd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cPFtFN1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cPFtFN1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first test is to load the craft onto the runway and increase the physics warp. Here you want to look at how quickly the craft collapses under its own weight and which sections of the craft are weakest. I use time warp two to look for any potential breaking points on landing and make sure that the core and landing gear connections are holding up well with a flexible base. One of the things I pay attention to the most is to note how much the craft flexes. Flex is good, you don\u0027t want the caft to bounce or shatter on landing. On the other hand, a floppy craft will slap it\u0027s wings when it touches down. Keep in mind that off-world landing has added dangers being, uneven terrain giving you less effective wing clearance and, low atmopsheric lift leading to high speed, high energy landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use time warp four to look for potential critical structural weaknesses. As a general rule, if you can time warp at four without any damage to the craft then you can safely assume the craft is not going to rip itself apart when loading from a save or flying through re-entry on time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n3f6BEV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022n3f6BEV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C0ALYhj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022C0ALYhj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JrEpJjo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JrEpJjo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027m happy with the basic structural quality of the airframe it\u0027s on to the drop test. I load the craft onto the runway. Using the debug menu I hack gravity and let the craft rise into the air. Then, unhack gravity and observe how well the landing structure takes the weight of the craft on impact. I like to test higher and higher until I can get unbreakable performance at over 10m/s vertical velocity. It\u0027s not enough to do the test once or twice. You need to repeat over and over again in rapid succession so as to generate different drop angles, including some lateral velocity. This is very important as you won\u0027t always be landing in ideal conditions. Some last second adjustments are always needed when landing on uneven terrain and/or at night. So, knowing the craft will land well with sideways drift pays big dividends at the business end of flying the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important piece of information you can get out of the drop test is to see what angle your craft springs off the runway when gravity is hacked. The higher the pitch angle down, the more weight is being taken by the rear landing gears. This is an early tell for whether or not you have enough landing gears at the back or front. So you can correct this problem at an early stage of the build without having to reshuffle all the parts later on. I personally like to have about 10 te 20 degrees angle before the atmospheric drag kills the rear gear induced somersault. This tells me that I\u0027m keeping most of the weight on the rear where it should be. It also tells me that my craft is going to perform well under different landing angles at my destination after some fuel is burnt on the way. The height you get when hacking gravity will also give you valuable information about how much the landing gear springs are being compressed which translates to how much shock they are going to absorb. Very high \u0022jumps\u0022 means the springs are too compressed so add more landing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, for larger craft, I will also perform the taxi test. This is to assess the structural integrity of the craft under roll which can come into play if you over-shoot the re-entry and want to make a hypersonic course correction. It can also cover off any weight related issues with take-off. This test is simply just about powering up down the runway and getting to an estimated take-off velocity. Power down and swerve fom side to side to see how much lateral movement the craft experiences. You may roll the craft and that\u0027s OK. If it looks like a house of cards you will want to add some cross strutting to improve lateral rigidity. Laterally rigid craft are going to be more responsive in turns than a piece of jelly with wings attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 5: Doing the plumbing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027m happy with the structural strength and flexibility/rigidity balance of the craft, it\u0027s time to wire it up. The first part is to hook up all the fuel lines. How that is done is mostly personal preference and different craft have different tank and engine arrangements. I personally like to have either everything hooked up or the two sides separate. There are exceptions where I have special front ballast tanks that are not connected and require manual transfer at the appropriate time in the mission. I also make sure that cross-feed is switched off in my payload docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yrei2ZI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Yrei2ZI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4FVOOpO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224FVOOpO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above image shows a technique for getting your fuel piped around your craft. By adding small fuel tanks in the right locations you can connect lines to them which allows you to pipe fuel around payload bays and other craft infrastructure. Fuel lines always go down before air intakes and wings. Before air intakes so that you know where to put your intakes. Fuel lines and air intakes do not play nicely with one another. I like to make sure fuel lines are well out of the way of my air intake stacks. Wings can be an issue because fuel lines and wings have a special relationship. Wings can occupy the same space as fuel lines but fuel lines cannot occupy the same space as wings. Said another way, fuel lines before wings and you\u0027re set. The caveat being, don\u0027t let the edge of the wing mesh touch any part of your fuel line or the line end point will pop off. If you need to move fuel lines then just know that some wings are going to have to come off as well to facillitate that change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne quick note about fuel lines. You can attach fuel lines directly onto cubic struts and they will crossfeed without problem. The reason I like to use these small tanks is because they stick out a bit allowing you to \u0022turn corners\u0022. The added bonus is the surface area is large enough for you to make a center connection in the middle of your crafts symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FMDEoKo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FMDEoKo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second piece of plumbing is the air intakes. You can stack alot of ram air intakes together using one cubic strut and two ram intakes. First place your strut onto a craft surface and rotate. Next, put an intake on the front node and another intake on the rear node of the strut. Now copy from the cubic strut. You\u0027ll find that you are basically able to place the copy almost on top of the original. In the image above I have about seven of these subassemblies placed on the small fuel tank which gives me plenty of air. This is possibly the most part and space efficient way to spam ram air intakes without using the debug menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xqElY8z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xqElY8z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the focus of placing air intakes is about utillising free cubic strut nodes to keep your part count down, it\u0027s also a good time to find some free spaces, or attachment nodes, near the center of gravity for your reaction wheels. I\u0027m not a big fan of using reaction wheels to steer planes in atmo and I do most of my aero testing with them turned off. However, they\u0027re great for orbital manuvering and my rule is one reaction wheel per 10(responsive) to 15(sluggish) tons of aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 6: Proof of ascension\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now the airframe with payload is built, the powerplant and stores are installed, and finally, the resource feeds are all wired up, it\u0027s time to go to space today. This step is all about home delivery. You know, bringing it home. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vHtgXjY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vHtgXjY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mRSQjSG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mRSQjSG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI call this arrangement the flying pizza box. I literally slap long panels of structural wings onto the craft, strut them down, throw some winglet stacks onto the back and put it on the runway. The reason I do this is to make sure the powerplant and resources are not only enough to get to space but, more importantly, do it economically enough to fulfill the design requirements. I\u0027m looking specifically at my delta-V status at low Kerbin orbit to make sure the craft has the payload and range capability I want. If not, the whole thing gets pulled apart and I go back to step 1. I call that the anchovy surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe great thing about the pizza box is that, if you are like me, over half the time designing a large SSTO is spent on getting the wings to fit together. It takes ages. I made the mistake in early builds of doing the wings before getting to orbit only to find out that, while the plane looked nice, it could not do the job. That\u0027s wasted time. This technique really does allow me to slap some parts together and test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 7: Dressing your plane up\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lzMtHlY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lzMtHlY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you know you are reliably going into space and beyond, it\u0027s time to put some clothes on and go out. Getting the wings to fit together is pretty hard and takes alot of practice. How your plane looks is really up to your sense of aesthetics. This plane, which I\u0027ve yet to name, follows on from a similar style that my two released heavy lifters follow. You could call this the third in an epic trilogy or cargo SSTO insanity. I do have a couple pointers for doing wings, having done a fair number of heavy lift SSTO wing designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, build your wings out from the centerline, in the same way the pizza box is made. The wings will fit together much easier along the plane-form and the top and bottom(if you are doing two sides) end up alot easier to fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, make sure you stitch the wings to the airframe to prevent wing flexing, which you will see to an absurd degree in the previous step. Wing flexing is an excellent way to lose control authority and by strutting the middle of the wings to the airframe you will see a marked improvement in atmo performance. Be sure to strut your wings to any in/on/under-wing fuel tanks to firm them up and prevent a bad case of ornithoptometry on take-off and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, if you do use both top and bottom wings be sure to stitch the wings together where they come together. Also, for larger wings add stitches between each section coming out from the centerline and anywhere else you see flex vulnerability. Below are two images of stitching wings together showing some basic sewing of the top and bottom together from the inside and of the stitch of two centerline panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M6ZcHC0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022M6ZcHC0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5Mxhah2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225Mxhah2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis second shot is taken from inside the wing where you must be to get at the two edges you want to stitch together. You won\u0027t be able to go straight from one to another, you can only do this technique in a three of four wing intersection and bind diagonally through a corner wing section. The great thing about this technique is that you can\u0027t see this from the outside as the entire strut exists inside the wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cargo planes it\u0027s especially important to get a natural pitch up attitude from your lift surfaces. The key technique is to have downward slopping wings at the rear of the craft. The obvious preference is on top of the tail where you will get the most leverage out of that lifting surface. You will want to fly the plane without SAS to ensure you are either maintaining level flight or naturally trimmed up. Many of my lifters take off without SAS or hands on the controls. This pitch up is very important at high altitudes to maintain pitch authority above the prograde marker, thus giving you rate of climb control rather than suffering from that dreaded horizon sniffing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing on from the above point, you want to have the CoM/CoL markers in a good spot prior to adding control surfaces. Control surfaces can be a crutch when they appear to add lift to the plane which is all well and good while they are in the neutral position. This is often not the case during periods of heavy cargo hauling through the upper atmosphere. So, don\u0027t use control surfaces to move around the CoL or your craft is going to lose major effeciency on ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 8: Turning into a plane\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wMMtmFL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wMMtmFL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that the wings are on and bolted down it\u0027s time to finish by adding control surfaces to your craft. No doubt your craft is going to lack some of that vital pitch authority. You can fix this by hiding winglets and even large control surfaces into the nose of the craft. They will attach very easily with angular snap off. Add what you need to to the back of the cockpit or anywhere else you feel they need to be. If your craft is still nosing down despite a nice big angled tail section you can rotate your winglets down a touch to increase their lift in the neutral position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the end result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aD3lr8I.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aD3lr8I.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy lifting and landing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, I\u0027m not done.

They are pixel perfect and if I\u0027m using the three block they drain fuel symmetrically from the outside in so you don\u0027t get COM changes if they are placed at the center of your craft. As you may know, placing cubic struts dead center of a 1.25m tank is next to impossible.

The circular intake seems to have a unique mesh that doesn\u0027t collide with the node meaning, you don\u0027t get pushed off the center of the fuel tank.

I have updated this design since to carry a pair of basic jets for rapid climb and have been able to circularise at 100T which gives me the fuel fraction to meet mission requirements.

He uses the wings as part of the structure of the craft so, wings and fuel tanks are load baring parts.
