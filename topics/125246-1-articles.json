The look is great and I like how it dovetailed with USILS (Which was nicely designed as well (kudos Bob)). After a bit though I found the form-factor a bit tricky to work with in terms of actually packing parts for launch and delivering them to the surface. Like you can use the nifty adapters but I found actually mounting and constructing a Duna base sensibly pretty finicky. It also felt like a LOT of parts, not all of which would actually be necessary in stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they were thinking of using a similar idea I might recommend using half an MK3. It would just pack much more cleanly with the existing parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore fundamentally though, the habitation parts make nice scenery but don\u0027t actually engage with gameplay.
