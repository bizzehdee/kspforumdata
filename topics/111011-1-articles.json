Unfortunately, having planets scaled at 3.7 times stock and distances scaled 7.0 times stock means that moons like Minmus lie outside the sphere of influence (SOI) of their parent body.\n\nMy solution was to create a 3.7 scaled stock system which was enough of a departure from Skyrex94\u0027s original intentions to warrant a new thread. \n\n**Features:**\n\n- Stock KSC location\n\n- Stock Kerbol system arrangement\n\n- All planets\u0027 and moons\u0027 radii and semi major axes (SMAs) have been multiplied by a factor of 3.7, while holding stock surface gravity constant.\n\n**Download**\n\n[Release 02](https://mega.co.nz/#!2ldHGJKR!o9BB--exNkS0jk3QE8p50OGqkQBDlhRZYKLLl9t6jCQ) (Megalink)\n\n**Future possibilities:**\n\n- When Kopernicus gets more stable, being an author from [Outer Planets Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-0-90-Outer-Planet-Mods-Expands-the-Kerbol-system-with-new-planets-based-on-Saturn) I will probably create a separate download option including the re-scaled versions of the OPM planets and moons.\n\n**Credits:**\n\nSkyrex94 - For creating the mod that this derived from.\n\n**Licence:**\n\nCC-BY-NC-SA\n\nThis mod includes:\n\n[Kopernicus (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFree software (LGPL) license\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114649-0-90-Kopernicus-Pre-Alpha-%280-0-6%29)\n\n[KSCSwitcher (\u0022BSD 2-clause\u0022)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117893-1-0-2-regex-s-Useful-Mod-Emporium)\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n     Release 02- Moho and Tylo are now playable (thanks to KillAshley with this one)Release 01-3- Set default KSCSwitcher Location to KSC instead of KSA which was causing issues.Release 01-2- Changed Readme wording- Renamed folder containing rescale configRelease 01-Initial release\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T08:45:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eudae55**"},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:57:18Z","Content":"this is owersome man! but, to make Tylo and Moho work again I had to remove theyr rescale configs..."},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T17:01:23Z","Content":"Awesome!! \n\nI have been holding off on upgrading to 1.0.2 just because I have fallen for 6.4k Kerbin scale (With Telion\u0027s amazing OPM config).

This doesn\u0027t replace the Kerbol 3.7 scale, it just makes some further adjustments.\n\nThe solar system is still in the same arrangement as stock, but with the following adjustments:\n\n1. The Sun has been scaled to be relatively the same size as the real Sun, with it\u0027s mass adjusted.\n2. Semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination have been adjusted for all of the planets (except Eeloo, see below) and the Mun to be relatively equal to their real life counterparts.\n3. Eeloo\u0027s eccentricity and inclination equal to Pluto\u0027s, but its semi-major axis adjusted to be relatively same to the new Jool orbit.\n4. Minmus is farther out, and its orbit is now slightly eccentric, more inclined, and now orbits retrograde to Kerbin.\n5. Jool\u0027s \u0027surface gravity\u0027 has been adjusted so that Jool has a comparable gravity well to Jupiter\u0027s... I\u0027d like to see someone do the Jool 5 challenge now with this!\n6. Adjustments to eccentricity and inclination of Laythe, Vall, and Tylo to be equal to Io, Europa, and Ganymede.\n7. Moho\u0027s synodic rotation period is set to be in the 2:3 resonance with its solar orbit just like Mercury (I think stock is like this too, IIRC).\n8. Eve\u0027s rotation period is proportionally equal to Venus\u0027s, and now rotates retrograde.\n\nI just threw this together this afternoon and haven\u0027t done a thorough test of it, but what I\u0027ve seen so far, everything seems to be working fine.
