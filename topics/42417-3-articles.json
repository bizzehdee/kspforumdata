The game is in Alpha stage. Alpha is under development and, as we learned via the last update, can introduce major changes to the program to get it closer to Beta. Beta is QA/User testing. This is where bugs are discovered in what will be the final version. There is less chance for anything major being introduced and if anything major is inserted this stage everything can revert to Alpha again until that major item is fully fleshed out. Then we proceed to Beta again. QA/User testing starts again at this point as you have to insure that the new major part works well with everything else. Once all the use cases have been completed, and any bugs corrected, you can proceed to release. After release your user base can discover additional bugs. These issues are reported on and corrections are developed. These corrections are then run through a Beta stage to insure that they work well with the core game. Once it passes that test, it is released as an update. Update: fixes to the original game. DLC: Downloadable Content that can be added to the core game with little impact on the core game (sometimes these items need to be rebalanced). Not an update. There may or may no be a cost associated with it. Expansion Packs: All new functionality to the game. Almost a brand new game. Something that was not considered for the core game during development. Not an update and there is almost always a cost for it. Maybe not as much as the original game but there will be a cost. Sequel: A brand new game. Game play could be based in the same game universe but many items are changed to where it could not be integrated into the original game. A brand new game engine could be a major part of this game. Not an update. Now, from my understanding, when I bought KSP, Squad promised me free updates to the game. The wording was loose enough that many said this this would include DLC and Expansions. I watched a lot of strife here on that subject. Squad caved to that.Squad, complete KSP. Don\u0027t work on DLC or Expansion after that, but give us the best game you can on your vision of KSP. Then, once KSP is the best you can make it, based on your original project goals, then start working on KSP II. As for the poll? My answer is no. I will, however, pay for KSP II.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-11T15:30:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2013 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by BostLabs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMan, I sure want my formatting back in Safari\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T16:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course!
