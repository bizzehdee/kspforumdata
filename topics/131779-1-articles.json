Everything is connected with fuel pipes or with Wing Connectors C. The C connector is fuel aware (i.e. transfering in any direction) and the pipes point a correct direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuel then is collected\u00A0via a top-mounted Oscar acting as a fuel hub and fed directly to the engines. But the rear tanks\u00A0are not working! So, the fuel hub fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFaced the similar issues since 1.0.5 when a \u0022crossfeed enabled\u0022 pylon does not feed any fuel through the Mk3 parts. Or the fuselages themselves are not transfering the fuel despites they should. It seems that the problem arise only with Mk3 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid anybody face the same problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T15:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Astra, if you upload the craft to dropbox other people can have a look and try to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr at least put some pics on imgur for us \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Astra_","CreatedById":155195,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T17:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsal_vager,\u00A0i have already fixed it with TT-38s, but\u00A0this is\u00A0not the first time i face a problem like this with Mk3 parts... i had exactly\u00A0the same issue\u00A0with\u00A0an Mk3 engine mount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine mounted on completely refused to drain any \u00A0fuel from a tank attached via small pylon; the fuel crossfeed was definitely enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-10T17:09:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2016 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by _Astra_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
