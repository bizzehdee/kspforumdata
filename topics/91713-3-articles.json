The usual FAR setup in the CFG is very simple and has zero fine tuning involved. Occasionally a part will require custom drag parameters but that is almost never the case. Engine curves are also not very different between stock aero and FAR - FAR nerfs thrust by 50% but that\u0027s across the board and the TWR you\u0027re seeing will be the corrected TWR. It\u0027s possible your acceleration problems have to do with a part creating more drag than it should. To check this enable FAR\u0027s drag visibility and see if any one part is creating a lot more drag than the others (the nose should of course be creating more but not hugely). If it is, try re-attaching that part and everything attached to it (that\u0027s been my problem more than once). If the problem persists then it\u0027s probably a bug.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Though it might be worth adjusting the SCIMITAR\u0027s VelocityCurve to be more like the RAPIER\u0027s under FAR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[RAPIER]:FOR[FerramAerospaceResearch]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@MODULE[ModuleEngines*],0\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t@maxThrust = 100\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t@velocityCurve\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t@key,0 = 0 0.8 0 -0.00098\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t@key,1 = 170 0.7 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t@key,2 = 400 0.8 0.00049 0.00049\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t@key,3 = 1100 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 1700 0 -0.00098 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a tough thing to change.
