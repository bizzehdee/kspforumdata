The maiden flight of Orion, a.k.a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COl\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Boom-boom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was ready for launch. Along side of him were Bill and Bob. Bill was scared due to the fact the rocket was powered by 1000 nukes. Bob, well, he wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exited or scared. As the final seconds ticked away, Jeb accidently fired the LES, meaning they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t turn back. Once the rocket launched, explosions ravaged through the town. KSC staff, however, couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hear it since they were in a sound-proof bomb shelter. Surprisingly, they got into orbit in less time than most rocket launches, at 2.15 minutes. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb, how\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s everyone doing up there?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 radioed Gary Kerman, Capsule Communicator of the flight. Jeb replied with \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFine, except for Bob and Bill barfing due to motion sickness.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Ever since the first rocket flight, Kerbal 1, motion sickness has been a problem, and KSC had no idea what caused it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 50: After about 105 orbits, they could finally transfer to Duna. Even with nukes powering the rocket, it took 10 minutes to transfer. Bob could hardly wait to get to Duna, as he would pilot a lander that could land everywhere! Plus, it would be his first time being up close to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 165: Duna. Where Kartains are believe to live at. Still, Bob could never be happier. The crew finally got to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 205: It was 5 minutes until they could move to the DM to land on Duna. Suddenly, there was an explosion and the pod was spinning. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb, what the heck happened? I said not to throttle up the engines and turn to starboard!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 yelled Gary. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t me! I swear!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Jeb, confused about the situation. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUh oh, when I throttle up, we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t go any faster!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Bill, screaming his head off. Suddenly, KSC, and the crew, went silent. Then, Flight director, Gene Kerman, yelled \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTHE POD FELL OFF THE ROCKET? GOD DAMNIT, KRAKEN, WHY DO YOU RUIN EVERY SINGLE INTERPLANETARY FLIGHT?!?!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Now, everyone realized that the crew was stranded.
