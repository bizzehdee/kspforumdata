By default, a Colony could operate in a totally automated way, and the base rates reflect this. Of course, in reality you probably need people there swapping out broken parts, oiling the gears, and optimizing the process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEfficiency is affected by a few things. First - Kerbals. More Kerbals equals more efficiency (to a point). So one Kerbal running around trying to handle logistics for an entire colony will not be very efficient (but better than nothing). But maintenance crews, working in shifts (so the other Kerbals can rest, etc.) can be very efficient, up to a cap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second factor is just having enough physical space (working space, living space, etc.) to perform the tasks in as well as contribute to Kerbal comfort, etc. All MKS caps have Work Space, but you could add more so your Kerbals have some space to spread around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese factors combine to contribute to your efficiency bonus. I\u0027m tweaking the final formulas, but basically these factors combined (number of Kerbals, the amount of working space they have, and the number of modules they have to support) will work out to an overall efficiency rating that serves as a bonus to your production speed (and hence volume). The logic being that with Kerbals performing maintenance and monitoring the process (ideally in multiple round the clock shifts), you will increase the up-time of the equipment and produce more resources. And since this applies to the entire colony, it does not throw the ratios out of whack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor folks looking to boost these numbers even further, there will (eventually) be some larger modules in 3.75 and 5m versions, as well as (further along the tech tree) better automation modules that can replace Kerbals and WorkSpaces but at some pretty hefty resource costs (in both energy and ColonySupplies) for those cases where you are willing to pay for faster construction but don\u0027t want to risk Kerbals out of the gate for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I\u0027m doing the final pass on masses, storage capacity, etc. For masses, I am going with a combination of EL an TAC to keep in line with their masses, and working through the volume calculations for MKS modules and caps (reflecting that caps have to keep workspace available). This will result in two new inline style storage pods (a tall one and a half-capacity short one) that will replace the current Storage Hut. The old Storage Hut will still work, but will not be in future releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, per several suggestions, I will be either adding or modifying a module (probably adding, since the menus get pretty ugly when you have too many generators and resources) that will convert a combination of Liquid Fuel or Kethane and Oxidizer or Oxygen into water. You still have to haul stuff in, but it gives a use to excess LFO, and also lets you combine greenhouses and Kethane deposits to get more water (or haul in your oxygen since it would be a lot lighter than water). In the event that you are on a planet with Oxygen in the atmosphere (i.e. Laythe or Kerbin) you would not need the oxidizer or oxygen for the reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T05:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERover, are you planning a hook with KSPI or not at all on KSPI?
