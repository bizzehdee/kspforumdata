Also, people wouldn\u0027t be surprised by accidentally triggering unexpected behaviors by happening to choose program names used by the boot loading process. This VAB description technique makes it so that the only way you get boot loader behavior is if you know the feature exists, and deliberately type in the right stuff into the description field to use it. It also has the advantage that when sharing files with others for the sake of showing how you ran a challenge mission, you don\u0027t need to have manual instructions for exactly what to run to get it started - that would be something that\u0027s embedded inside the vehicle\u0027s craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very good solution all around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know if the c# code in kOS can query the vessel description field and read its contents?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-24T02:10:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2013 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T02:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is no fewer steps than just not even having a boot program and copying some arbitrary program manually.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe we are not understanding each other, but I do believe it is fewer steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) No bootfile on archive or local drive: the situation is the same as it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No bootfile on archive, bootfile on local drive: local bootfile gets executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Bootfile on archive, no bootfile on local drive: bootfile gets copied from archive to local drive and executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Bootfile on archive, bootfile on local drive: local bootfile gets executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said before, people usually work on the same craft for a while, making it worth while setting a specific bootfile for that craft on the archive.

It broke the ability to make comparison tests against literal strings, requiring the addition of pointless extra lines of code to replace all such instances with comparisons against string variables. Since my code happened to be near the 10k limit already, and has a lot of comparisons to literals, this is a nontrivial change to make, and its a rather bad idea to make that change for a thing that is clearly a bug introduced by somebody\u0027s recent edit of the code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
