Big difference there. Glasses are some of the toughest materials you\u0027ll encounter in your daily life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe X200-8 has a total fuel mass of 4.0 t for 800 liters of fuel (360\u002B440). That\u0027s 5,000kg per cubic meter (average), which is handily twice that of fused silica glass. In other words, a solid chunk of aerospace grade glass the size of the X200-8 fuel tank would be under 2 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cupola isn\u0027t solid glass, of course. But it does have other things... like 9 kNm of torque and 200 E of electrical charge capacity. If we compare those specs to their dedicated counterparts (reaction wheels and batteries) we\u0027d add 0.225t and 0.01t respectively... so 0.235t of that mass can be accounted for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seats one Kerbal, so we can give it everything a Mk1 Command Module has and add 0.8t. Total mass so far, unjustifiably rounding up, is 1.1t. We can be generous and double that because hey, they have Snacks on board! 2.2t. We\u0027re still half of what it currently is. You can\u0027t blame this on the glass, because even if it were entirely made of solid glass and added it to that 2.2t we still would not be 4.5t in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Yeah, I agree the Cupola module is too heavy for what it is. 3 tons sounds reasonable to me, maybe even 2.5, without any further justification for where that extra mass is hidden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T15:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a big window on the hitchhiker can.
