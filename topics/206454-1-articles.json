Duna, Ike, Mun, Minmus, it didn\u0027t matter. It was like the legs had no friction. So I opened up the part file for the LT-2 landing legs and looked for anything friction related. I had no idea what I was doing.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI changed a few values (in bold) but the one that seemed to work was \u0022autoFrictionAvailable = false\u0022. \u00A0If you set it to \u0022True\u0022, a friction slider control becomes available for the legs on your vessel (I\u0027m talking about the heavy LT-2 legs but the other legs might be the same).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then tested a vessel by landing it on Minmus on a heavy slope. With the friction slider set to 0, the vessel kept sliding. With the slider set to 1, 1.5 or 2, the vessel eventually stopped completely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFYI Here is the section where I made the edit/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0name = ModuleWheelBase\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0wheelColliderTransformName = wheelCollider\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0useNewFrictionModel = true\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0wheelType = LEG\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0adherentStart = 0.01\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0frictionAdherent = 0.5\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0peakStart = 2\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0frictionPeak = 1.0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0limitStart = 7.0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0frictionLimit = 1.5\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0// setting this to true will override the radius and center parameters\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0FitWheelColliderToMesh = False\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0radius = 0.12\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0center = 0,0,0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0mass = 0.040\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0autoFrictionAvailable = True\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0clipObject = piston_collider\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0TooltipTitle = #autoLOC_502076 //#autoLOC_502076 = Landing Leg\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0TooltipPrimaryField =\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0groundHeightOffset = 1.37\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0}\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was reading the patch notes for 1.12.2 and Squad claims they\u0027ve finally fixed the landing legs. Well, they haven\u0027t. By fixing one thing they seem to have introduced another issue. In all my time playing KSP I\u0027ve never had this persisent sliding problem until now. All they had to do was turn this value on by default and there wouldn\u0027t have been a problem. Yes I know this setting is meant for wheels but in the part file it treats wheels and legs the same. Both wheels and legs still need friction! In 1.12.2 they (at least the LT-2 legs) don\u0027t have friction!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway I hope this helps anyone else having this issue.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome on Squad, add this part edit to the next final patch.
