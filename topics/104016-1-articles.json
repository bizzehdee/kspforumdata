A couple of examples include:\n\n - Cpt. Kipard was recently involved in a discussion on how to hypothetically implement a NASA Docking System style-docking port\n\n - I myself spent a good part of the past weekend looking for mechanical dimensions / interfacing standards for the International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) and the Shuttle Middeck Locker.\n\nMost of this information is often available as PDF documents hosted on academic, corporate or space agency websites (e.g. NASA); however, it was felt that a consolidated source for such information would be very useful to add-on authors.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe intention is to essentially create a thread similar to the [Mod Development Links Compilation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638-Mod-Development-Links-Compilation-START-HERE), but one that focuses specifically on **mechanical design / engineering standards** that could be applicable to making models / plugins in KSP. Add-on authors could contribute links to posts, threads, documents or pictures covering aspects such as:\n\n - Types of mechanical linkages / joints\n\n - Devices, such as stepper motors, linear actuators, hydraulics / pneumatics\n\n - Design of structural components or pressure vessels for crew compartments\n\n - Design / operation manuals of historical spacecraft and space systems\n\n - Human / Kerbal ergonomics in spacecraft\n\n - etc.\n\n**Early Questions**\n\n- NASA often makes technical manuals and standards specifications available for public access over the internet; however, these are often hidden behind obscure URLs, or are hosted on subdomains operated by NASA sub-departments that periodically get merged with other groups or shut down, meaning that such resources are lost forever. Would it make sense to host copies of these images / PDFs on a centralized archive, assuming that licensing / redistribution issues could be worked out?\n\n- Should the thread also act as a general consultancy thread, where an add-on author could submit a question for other authors to provide advice on?\n\nComments and offers to contribute are welcome.\n\nEDIT: Moved to The Science Labs subforum - the actual thread will eventually be created in Add-on Development\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T23:50:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arron Rift","CreatedById":113722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T03:52:06Z","Content":"Very good idea!
