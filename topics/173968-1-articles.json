That\u0027s not really the question. I\u0027ve been really meticulous and placing them within 1-2 meters altitude of each other. This is pretty easy with a tiny sat with an RA-2 relay and worth the time if I never touch them again. Now I have 2 relay sats and a station with a relay antenna around the Mun at 660km. This works great but every time I dock/undock with the station it changes altitude and sometimes by a lot which is understandable. It\u0027s getting close to 50 tons now and even though I have plenty of fuel and thrusters it\u0027s still kind of a bear to maneuver. Am I worried about 50-100 meters for nothing or will I notice it advancing/retreating? I\u0027m betting there\u0027s some math that can answer this but might be over my head without a little explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this become too much of a problem my backup plan is just to undock the relay sat and forget trying to have them combined. But combined is still fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS, I\u0027ve been getting great answers to other questions.
