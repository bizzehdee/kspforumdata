With the introduction of the ability to transfer science from an experiment to the command pod, I was considering just dumping my experiments when I prepared for my return, transferring the last bits of data to the command pod. I was curious if this had any effect on the amount of science returned? Is transferring science the same as returning the experiment, or is it just like transmitting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used: FAR, FASA, TAC life support, TAC Fuel Balancer, Crew Manifest, KAC, DRE, RealChute\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T20:50:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 08:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Taki117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T20:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if the mods you are using would make a difference, but in stock there will be no change in the amount of science you receive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T20:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETransferring is just transferring.
