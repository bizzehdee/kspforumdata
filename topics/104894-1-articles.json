Maybe add some normal or anti-normal component so the game shows you the closest approach (if it doesn\u0027t already) or just burn to an orbit that graze\u0027s Kerbin and do a correction once you leave Jool\u0027s SOI?"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T01:36:05Z","Content":"Alright, I\u0027m going to execute the burn as if Laythe was my spacecraft, so everything is in line.

A transfer to a more inner planet is applying the right amount, at the right time, of dV to retrograde) and see what you get. Once you leave Jool\u0027s orbit, you can adjust the solar orbit?

You solve for V in the equation above (and use 2800 m/s for V(escape)). You\u0027ll get the answer 3215 m/s (note the squares).
