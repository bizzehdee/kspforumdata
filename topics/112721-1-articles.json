I know no female engineers and scientists (VAB/SPH) exist in-game yet, but they must surely exist! EVA Kerbal and Stargazing Kerbal at the very least!\n\nI am not a fan of how female Kerbals seem to be being left out lately, Val is not in the gamer\u0027s edition, there are no female KSC staff in-game.\n\nUntil I have the money to get Bill and Bob as prints, I don\u0027t want to be forced to get another orange-suit to keep Gregoly (An EVA Kerbal) and Jebediah on IVA company.\n\nIt would also be cool to have the Administrators. We already have Linus in the form of Kerbal Intern and Gus in the form of Kerbal Mechanic. It\u0027d be nice to have Mortimer and Walt as well. And maybe a few others such as Bobak Kerman."}]}
