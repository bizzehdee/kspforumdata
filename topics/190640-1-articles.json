I present the Wraythe Mark 9. A hydrofoiling amphibious \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E intended to operate from orbital stations around Laythe or relatively close Jool orbits, the Wraythe can land and take off from anywhere on Laythe, although due to the rear wheels being a bit far back from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, it takes off better in water.\u00A0 It carries an abundance of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E for use in biome-hopping, but still makes orbit with at least 800 delta V remaining; you can use more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E on the surface or take less with you for more delta V if you need it. Carries all science in the short cargo bay forward of the command pod. Can also operate in Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere and oceans quite well; but as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E it is intended for Laythe. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and oxidizer reserves are both on the low side for Kerbin, although, at least a couple versions ago, it still makes orbit there too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 toggles Rapiers\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 toggles Rapier mode\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 deploys/retracts hydrofoils\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen landing in water, keep your landing speed at 60 m/s or less to avoid unplanned disassembly. This can be achieved by leveling off around 10-25 meters at no throttle, and then deploying the hydrofoils with action group 3 once slow enough (quicksave till you get the hang of it). They will act as flaps/airbrakes, and you should be able to hit the water at maybe even less than 40 m/s if done really well. After landing, hit the gas; foiling starts around 30 m/s, and the Wraythe will gain speed to a bit more than 60 m/s or so in the water. Taking off from there requires a boost from the Rapier closed cycle mode - hit 2, hold the nose up, and as soon as it lifts out of the water, hit 2 to switch Rapier mode back to airbreathing, then 3 to retract the hydrofoils. The Wraythe will penetrate Laythe space on air-breathing mode, and all remaining oxidizer can be used for circularizing your orbit/orbital maneuvers.
