Was forced to do a hard reset. Upon rebooting my pc and reloading the game ALL settings have been reverted to default and no save games show on the main menu. Although it does appear that I can select a campaign that doesn\u0027t exist??? As in I can select the spot it should be in and click the start game, delete game buttons. It wont start the game because theres no save file to select or start, but deleting it deletes whatever is there.\u00A0 the game save file folder for my science campaign still exists with some files inside, but I also had a sandbox campaign from day 1 that is completly gone....as if it never existed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a more personal note, I\u0027m not out much having to start over. I\u0027m loving the game and looking forword to the road map. keep up the great work KSP team!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
