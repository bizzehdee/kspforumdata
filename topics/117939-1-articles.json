The Kakar is quite competent in it\u0027s own right but what I would actually use it for is a mystery. I needed a break from hinges and since I had been testing rover suspension components recently I decided to build a rover. Lots of nebulous goals, 70\u0027s muscle car replica, Elcano challenger, new suspension for The Dunation rover. What I ended up with looks a bit like a Paris to Dakar rally car so that\u0027s what it is.\n\nI was testing RevanaCortanas and Azimechs suspension and decided to combine the two. Revana\u0027s was great for smaller lighter rovers and Azimechs helped larger machines. Together they make this 5t rally car quite easy to drive. When things go wrong they are easy to recover from. I would not say it is the best suspension ever in KSP (![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)) but t\u0027s pretty good.\n\nSo besides the suspension what else has it got?\n\n4 wheel drive, two wheel steering.\n\nBrake Lights, Bright Front lights\n\nGood ground clearance will handle up to 2x time acceleration (3x if you are prepared to suffer cosmetic damage), 4x is a no no\n\nIntegrated Roll Cage\n\nFront and Rear Protection Bars\n\ntop speed 21.5m/s (adding ion engines makes hardly any difference, do not do)\n\nTop Speed turning without rolling unless you have just completed some fast plane changes and are trying to then reverse direction of turn. Even then cease steering input and it will return to level.\n\n4 RTG\u0027s just in case you too decide to do the Elcano challenge, easily removable in case you too decide not to do the Elcano challenge (Hint go North to the ice, turn right follow ice coast till you hit the next continent, head South/West? sorta until back at KSC.\n\n[**Download**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8-nkDP75eETdTV6RGVvdHJWRk0)\n\n![malMTrR.png](http://i.imgur.com/malMTrR.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T09:27:28Z","Content":"Nice!

The stock wheels are well known for being \u0027flippy\u0027, with these types of suspension systems the rovers are much better behaved. The batteries are part seat recreation and part preparation for the Elcano Challenge that I then decided was just too long/hard to accomplish."}]}
