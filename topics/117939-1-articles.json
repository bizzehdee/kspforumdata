The Kakar is quite competent in it\u0027s own right but what I would actually use it for is a mystery. I needed a break from hinges and since I had been testing rover suspension components recently I decided to build a rover. Lots of nebulous goals, 70\u0027s muscle car replica, Elcano challenger, new suspension for The Dunation rover. What I ended up with looks a bit like a Paris to Dakar rally car so that\u0027s what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was testing RevanaCortanas and Azimechs suspension and decided to combine the two. Revana\u0027s was great for smaller lighter rovers and Azimechs helped larger machines. Together they make this 5t rally car quite easy to drive. When things go wrong they are easy to recover from. I would not say it is the best suspension ever in KSP (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E) but t\u0027s pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo besides the suspension what else has it got?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 wheel drive, two wheel steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrake Lights, Bright Front lights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood ground clearance will handle up to 2x time acceleration (3x if you are prepared to suffer cosmetic damage), 4x is a no no\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated Roll Cage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFront and Rear Protection Bars\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etop speed 21.5m/s (adding ion engines makes hardly any difference, do not do)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop Speed turning without rolling unless you have just completed some fast plane changes and are trying to then reverse direction of turn.
