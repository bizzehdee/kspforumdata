In contrast, after the initial planning stage for Apollo, everyone involved settled on one mission architecture, one booster, one program. Everyone had their job to do and everyone got on with it. The Soviet program suffered from in-fighting between designers (especially once Korolev died)\u00A0and a lack of clear direction and political buy-in for a Moon program. A lot of the political support from the Kremlin was fairly opportunistic and the I don\u0027t think the will was there to fully back a project of that size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically, the N-1 was right on the very edge of what could be done at the time. I think a lot of their problems were down to the KORD system for controlling all 32 engines (or whatever the number was) in the first stage, and at that time control systems were just not up to the task. Funding was also an issue - the resources weren\u0027t there for a methodical test program, so effectively each N-1 launch was an all-up test flight. In particular - or so I\u0027ve read - each of the engines could\u00A0only be fired once with any sort of reliability, so they weren\u0027t tested individually before integration with the booster. Finally, quality control was an issue, probably due to a lack of resources and political pressure to get the job done regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-23T17:48:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2016 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T17:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines were outstanding.

It was designed to monitor five critical variables and shutdown engine open seeing signs of trouble - combustion instability, bad cooling, that kind of stuff. Should be obvious it cant do nothing if perfectly working engine just exploded out of blue. Which is what usually happened. \u00A0When it was given time to act it worked well. Only serious problem with KORD was that one time it let whole stack fall back at launchpad. And even in that case it worked correctly (engines did \u00A0really fail) and it was resolved by adding simple inhibition that prevented engine shutdown until stack was clear of pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for engines, let me share a little bit of historical trivia I learned from Chertoks memoirs about how they were tested: Kuznetsov\u0027s melody boys delivered batch of six engines and their deputy sworn to state commission by party, his mother, holy icon or \u00A0whatever that they were made with same tooling, same people, same procedures, same schematics\u2026 you get the idea. State commission then picked\u00A0four engines at random and have them test fired. If they performed ok, they were scraped (see the \u0022non-restartable\u0022 part) and remaining two were cleared flight ready. If any problems occurred, whole batch was scraped. Event if problem was known and could be remedied. Fun part is that from standpoint of testing, failure of all four engines was better then if some worked well, which is kinda scary thought. End result was that party higher-ups complained about wasting money on throwing away perfectly good engines, and OKB-1 engineers complained about insufficient testing. And of course everyone involved knew this is stupid waste of money, since Kuznetsov already had restartable version in works that could be tested in less silly way. But waiting 2-3 years for their development was out of question and rest is history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for \u0022stupid russian engineers who could not be bothered with proper testing\u0022 meme, this is just nonsense. Stacks were routinely tested, even upper stages of N1. One and only reason why N1 first stage was not tested was that it would require really huge test stand and lunar program was not given enough money for that. People at OKB-1 knew they are taking big risk and were not happy about it, but they were out of options. What I think also affected them was idea that they could test systems of whole stage, but not actual flight hardware, because non-restartable engines again.
