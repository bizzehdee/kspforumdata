For info, scatterer no longer uses depth buffer for the main scattering effect, but instead adds the effect to every object in the scene, this allows it to play well with anti-aliasing (as there is no good/correct way for depth buffers to handle anti-aliasing). The second pass scatterer adds still needs to compare it\u0027s depth to the depth of the object in the scene, and with limited precision you get those artifacts, the solution on my side would be to trick the depth value reported by the scatterer effect to be a bit smaller.\n\n3) The menu is only really intended to flag changes for when you change scenes, behaviour in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E scene itself is undefined and could be anything so just ignore it and change scenes when you changes those settings.\n\nThis is not a bug, it\u0027s just not a feature.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 hours ago, Beetlecat said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sparktacular!!! my goodness. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ------\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I know it may be *gauche* to speak of $$ -- but is your paypal supposed to point to a French portal?
