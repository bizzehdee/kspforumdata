Now it\u0027s not discipline and tons of skill what\u0027s left to explore ir Rey\u0027s charachter Development OTHER THAN LORE. By lore I mean parents, Jakku, what ever. Even if she was the daughter of luke I would be more forgiving but still mad that she was that powerful with no training. She just needed training and Disney gave us none. Why does Rey get to be more powerful than anyone else in all of Star Wars. Imagine Rey when she is trained. She could implode a small moon... This would be fine if she was the chosen one BUT SHE ISNT she is a nobody charachter who is Force sensitive. That level of force sensitivity is reserved for special force weilders like Bendu, Anakin, and the Mortis Charachters of SWCW. Bendu is pretty much a rock so... I would throw Luke in their too but he is he son of the chosen one so it\u0027s understandable. I want a reason we got none! I wanted her just to be trained! Nope. I\u0027m only asking for a scene in the force awakens showing her training or something she just can\u0027t self teach! Come on. Why now why wasn\u0027t she born during the Republic Era. If she is so powerful why wasn\u0027t she the chosen one. Ehh! Why now in the story of Star Wars. The only reason is that Disney wants her to be a Hyper powerful person. With no explanation. No training. No linage which isn\u0027t even nessicary just a nice way to explain something. No prophecy. No Discipline. That\u0027s it. Just a Disney Princess with a lightsaber. No reason for her power. It\u0027s frustrating. All other Jedi are force sensitive but it only comes out in training and they can get bested by Clones with Guns. The select few were lucky, extremely powerful like Yoda, Well trained Like Obi Wan... Or the chosen one so yea. Might I remind you all of those Charachters have been trained for DECADES. Yoda almost for a millennium. Mace used his high skill and aggressive nature to counter Palpatine with Vapad. He trained specifically in it. Now Rey beats Kylo, the long time student of Snoke who obviously is a Palpatine level charachter of not more. Sure Snoke paralyzed Rey but she was dumb in her decisions and honestly Kylo did it too in the force awakens. And they he turns around and beats him. These are force powers YODA DIDNT KNOW!

First would be when Luke lost his hand to Darth Vader. The Second when Anakin lost, practically his life, to Obi-Wan Kenobi. When Qui Wan Ginn and Obi-won face darth maul he essentially dominates both of them before killing Qui Wan Ginn and barley falling to Obi-won. Both Anaikin and Obi-won lose to count Dooku only having their lives saved when Yoda arrived (Count Dooku escapes with his life) Then we get the Ren chick who has absolutely no training go super saiyan jedi and wipes out a syth all by her self...... Come on! The dark side has more power than the light side. The only jedi I can recall having the power to use force lighting was Yoda. All the syth have that power.- This is the old movies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the new movie we have Ren who lord knows isn\u0027t in any danger of loosing her life. She can kill a syth who has been groomed to assume the empire in her sleep having never so much as touched a light saber before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone knows Ren is going to win.
