If it has no problem correctly running a pair of docked ships, then that\u0027s a benchmark to note.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t work I\u0027ll go up in releases until I find one that does. Hopefully somewhere in there is one that will correctly switch throttle control when the user changes control pod and active engines from one side of a docking port to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do a test without any custom combined parts, put together a version of the upper stages of my Duna core with stock RCS blocks (though this issue isn\u0027t affecting RCS) and a plain Clampotron on top then dock the Two-Step lander to it, minus the strut guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm. I could try turning the strut guns off and see if that makes any difference. The Quantum struts will rigidly lock a ship\u0027s orientation if they\u0027re mounted on or the beam intersects the little Cubic Octagonal Struts*. Could be the strut guns are bugging MechJeb due to them connecting to the ROC custom part. \u0027Course the other time this cropped up with docked ships didn\u0027t involve strut guns or quantum struts, though I think those may have the three in one combined docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*This can be a feature, locking the rotation even better than Kill Rot in smartass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"triffid_hunter","CreatedById":61814,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T02:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs I understand it, it is possible to get SMARTASS to track the surface-relative prograde/retrograde in the advanced mode, but I\u0027ve never played around with that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have, you want SURFACE_VELOCITY, BACK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould really love a couple of buttons for easy access to surface pro/retrograde \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m at it, any chance of moving the aerobrake prediction out of landing autopilot?
