At first I thought this might be a good way to stop my bases/ships from jumping into the air whenever physics engages on a low gravity world like Gilly, but I\u0027m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks like they are meant to be attached to the ground, then you build something on top of it, then you put a docking port on that, and now finally you attach [whatever] to the anchor by docking with what you just built? Honestly that sounds like too much of a pain to be any fun, given how much of a complete hassle it is to line up docking ports for ground bases in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I build a ground anchor and then just attach a strut between it and something nearby? Guess I should experiment, but suggestions welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelatedly, can I now use EVA construction to connect base add-ons with struts?
