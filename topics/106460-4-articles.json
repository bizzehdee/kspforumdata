I\u0027d turn off the temperature indicators (F10) if you have them on, since they start flashing like mad before the LV-Ns or heatsinks are even halfway to overheating. You don\u0027t need to worry about it until you see the overheat bar in the staging area show up, and it will usually fill about three quarters of the way before it slows down significantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiators glow only faintly until they hit about 900 degrees, and that would require the heatsink to be well over 1000. If you feel so inclined, you can turn on thermal data in the right-click menus via the Alt\u002Bf12 options. Go to physics, then thermal, then click the aforementioned box. This will show you actual temps on your parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my best guess without seeing it happen, I\u0027m not getting the same behavior so I can\u0027t say for certain what the issue is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Megan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Megan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for making this mod.
