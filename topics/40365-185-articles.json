At any rate, there are lots of places to go! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the warp drive is not as cheaty as it first appears. If jool is on the other side of Kerbol, you can expect to need like 17k delta-v to get in orbit around jool. That is multiple times the delta-v required to normally travel to Jool, but this one of the most extreme cases. Normally you can get by with something like a 2k-5k delta-v burn if you warp when your starting point is closest in its orbit to your destination. The trade off with using the warp drive is you typically spend more delta-v to circularize at your destination, but you can get to Eeloo, perform a landing mission, and then return your samples to kerbin in less than one in-game day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SnappingTurtle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SnappingTurtle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JVbUV6u.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/JVbUV6u.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the radiator I\u0027m using. It has a deploy action that doesn\u0027t do anything (it\u0027s only visible in the VAB action group menu, or with the action group manager plugin). Waste heat builds up unless I toggle the resource flow off like I\u0027ve done in the image. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s supposed to be this way or if it\u0027s a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat model of radiator works just by slapping it on your vessel. There is no need to deploy. As long as waste heat doesn\u0027t cap out and cause stuff to shut down, you are good. Think of waste heat bar like your avg temp bar. As long as it doesn\u0027t cap out, you are good and stuff won\u0027t shut down. The more radiating capability you have, the lower your avg temp will be, the lower the waste heat bar will be, and the more efficient your generators will be at generating MW from thermal power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning off waste heat flow on the part like you have shown in the pic used to basically turn off waste heat. I\u0027m not sure how that works in 0.9 now. At any rate, don\u0027t toggle it off if you want to play the mod as intended. If you want to turn off the waste heat, there is a setting in the WarpPluginSettings.cfg file you can tweak. Change \u0022ThermalMechanicsDisabled = False\u0022 to \u0022 ThermalMechanicsDisabled = True\u0022 and that should turn off waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T03:40:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 03:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astronomer","CreatedById":18673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T03:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new megajoule display button does not disappear with the rest of the UI when pressing F2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027ve come up with a temporary fix - I found these icons that serve as a more appealing replacement imo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall (*recommended):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://zak.wubook.net/zimgs/fast.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fast.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedium:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://sitra4g.com/sitrawimax_zend/images/about/img_energy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022img_energy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://impossible2possible.com/bolivia/images/start.png\u0022 alt=\u0022start.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust save them and replace the \u0022megajoule_click.png\u0022 with them in Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\WarpPlugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*they have the same size in-game as they appear on your screen right now assuming this is the same resolution you use in KSP\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T04:03:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 04:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Astronomer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T04:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I was about to ask about that icon.
