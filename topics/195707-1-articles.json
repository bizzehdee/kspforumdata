My deep space network is finally nearing completion this year and I will soon want to start showing off the various facilities but I wouldn\u0027t feel right doing so without the 200m Arekibo radio dish.

Delivery would be anytime by the end of this year. I\u0027m very flexible when it comes to artistic vision and don\u0027t need to stick very close to Arecibo\u0027s design, but that would be simplest with lots of easy reference material.
