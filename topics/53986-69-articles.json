Chaka Monkey, on the other hand, is made of several already rescaled parts, so rescaling them becomes a part by part ordeal to find the right sizes. The 4m pod is actually the stock Mk1-2 pod rescaled by stock RO. The base of the pod is 4m in diameter, which is basically the new stock size as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I even read somewhere that the FusTek docking ports only can be docked to each other no matter size of any other potential docking port, but nevermind.

Like ThorBeorn said, make an adapter, shoot, the PMAs on the ISS are there just as an adapter, and will soon have new adapters installed on those adapters in order to fit yet another docking port design. As for the stock Mk1-2 pod, it was ok...when there weren\u0027t about a dozen other pods out there.
