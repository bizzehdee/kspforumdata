It\u0027s a career mode save, and it\u0027s been my experience so far that the little OX-SAT solar panels will still work whether the doors on the service bay are open or closed. I think it\u0027s fairly self explanatory to repeat, just get a service bay, stick some solar panels in it, and look at the electricity flow on the panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lyjlvl2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lyjlvl2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DTOzpY5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DTOzpY5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m just assuming this is a bug, since closed doors should block light, but I suppose it could also be something that Squad already knew about and just didn\u0027t have time to get around to taking care of.

My setup was a 4x symetry X made of gigantor panels. The part of the x that was pointing towards and away from where the sun was didn\u0027t produce power (i know for sure that one of them didn\u0027t, can\u0027t really remember the other but i don\u0027t think it did) while the two sides of the X that were roughly perpendicular to where the sun was reportad a sun exposure of 0.99 despite beeing aimed roughly 45 degrees downwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid a little bit more testing, and it looks like it\u0027s an issue with the the 1.25m fairing as well. I made a probe core with a single OX-SAT panel on top, enclosed both inside a fairing, and stuck a whole bunch of lights on to drain the power. As soon as I turned the lights off, the probe core started recharging, even though the panel is inside the fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CDD7V8z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CDD7V8z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RpX6yi5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RpX6yi5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
