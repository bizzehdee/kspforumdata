Are these bound to defined variables? EG: Alarm when fuel is less than 10%, etc?\n\u003E \n\nAnswers in reversed order:\n\nThe alarm variables that are built in to RasterPropMonitor are hard-coded.  That would include any IVAs that are part of the RPM distribution.  Alarms found in other IVAs (my Yarbrough remake, alexustas\u0027 ALCOR and Mk1-2, possibly others) use custom variables that are defined with a particular threshold.  Changing it is trivial, once you figure out the variable name, and which config file it lives in.\n\nAs far as the KSP API: yes, there\u0027s a \u0022get all parts\u0022 method.  The trick then is to iterate over every single part and look at each of its modules and decide \u0022do I know how to take action with this?\u0022  And it gets a little more convoluted by needing to check each module to see if it can have action taken on it (eg, you can\u0027t typically turn off SRBs, some solar panels can\u0027t be retracted, etc).  The menu structure would probably need to be organized by modules (Solar Panels, Retractable Gear, Decouplers, etc) first, and then individual parts second (maybe with a \u0022deploy all\u0022 / \u0022retract all\u0022 option at the top of the list).  So, yeah, it can be made as usable as the other parts of the menu.\n\nThe main roadblock is that I really need to tear that menu apart and rebuild it, because it currently uses polling to refresh its tables of components instead of a callback system, so the menu is more expensive than it needs to be."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T19:43:21Z","Content":"Just letting you know \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E has been updated.
