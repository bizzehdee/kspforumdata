The most recent official forum note on the matter was the release of the PartTools version for Unity 5.4.0p4, which is findable on the Unity website, but there\u0027s a more final version, 5.4.0f3 when you first look for 5.4.0. Is there an official word on the download of Unity and version of PartTools for creating something for 1.3.1? Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchwinnTropius","CreatedById":165170,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-19T04:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make parts for KSP, you only really need at least Unity 4; Unity 5.4.0p4 and its PartTools is required only if you intend to make KSPedia pages (to my current understanding). Personally, I like to use the Unity version KSP is currently running (5.0.4p4), but it\u0027s not strictly required to run parts through it for the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
