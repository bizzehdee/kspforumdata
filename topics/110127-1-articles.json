I have been putting up heavy equipment for an orbital space station and its so lopsided that my ship will spin out of control if I let Mechjeb create my orbit before 28km : p It is entertaining the first time, but after that I always make sure I have enough reaction wheels so my ship can control itself and I don\u0027t pres that autopilot button until I\u0027m up high enough with enough velocity to have control maneuvers. Hope that helps! Happy flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
