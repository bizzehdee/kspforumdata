I had originally been planning to wait for the Galaxies Unbound home system but it seems like that\u0027s still a bit far out from release. Currently I\u0027m mostly torn between JNSQ, GPP, or KSRSS. JNSQ is one I\u0027ve always wanted to try for a while, either on its own, or mashed together with OPM, but there\u0027s a few small issues that keep pushing me off from it - I\u0027ve heard people say its boring, theres a weird visual bug with Kerbin\u0027s shorelines that I don\u0027t like, and the big visual mod for it (Ad Astra) seems to have some funky glitches. GPP seems really awesome, and challenging too, but it also definetly seems to be a bit dated (especially I remember some of the planet textures being kinda low res last time I tried), and I\u0027m thinking I should probably just wait cause I remember hearing some rumors about how there might be a revamp at some point. KSRSS is really cool, especially the new Reborn version, but I\u0027m not sure if I should start a playthrough there either because reborn still is in development and I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027d be better to wait for it to be fully released so that all the visuals are as good as they can be (especially cuz it seems like a lot of the outer planet moons still look a tad fuzzy). What do y\u0027all think - which one do you think I should try (of the three, or a completely different one entirely), and do y\u0027all think I\u0027m being a little too harsh with worrying about the visuals as well? Ik its not ever gonna get to real life levels of quality, but sometimes the textures just seem very off-putting to me if they are slightly lower res)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-12T14:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSRSS 2.5x and JNSQ are excellent and worthy of playing even if you just get to Mun/Moon and stop. Teleport to other bodies to see them. JNSQ is mature while KSRSS Reborn is coming soon, maybe do JNSQ now, and when KSRSS is ready you can reevaluate whether to change. I haven\u0027t used GPP and I agree it\u0027s dated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotable differences between JNSQ and KSRSS:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain launch site inclination: JNSQ launches at the equator by default and you can fly to Mun/Minmus any time. KSRSS launches from Florida and the Moon orbit is inclined from Earth\u0027s equator, so you get daily launch windows for Moon missions. In other words, KSRSS can help you understand more how real flights work, it\u0027s a fun challenge, but adds a small extra step to each Moon flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternate launch sites: JNSQ has developed extra KK bases around the world; you can fly from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway to other bases that each have a unique look. KSRSS only has 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; you can use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Switcher to teleport it to new launch sites but you can\u0027t fly between different airports. IMO this is a big JNSQ advantage *if* you like to explore Kerbin with planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-12T21:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

not an option.\u00A0 First off, JNSQ is built to a different scale (OPM is stock size while JNSQ is 1/4 real scale).\u00A0 And while JNSQ is based on the stock solar system, it also adds several new bodies.\u00A0 In total there are 30 planets and moons in JNSQ, while stock plus OPM gives a total of 31 (with JNSQ actually having more bodies that you can land on).\u00A0 So the large number of bodies really makes it unnecessary to add an OPM-like expansion pack.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

uninspiring, you can easily uninstall it and try something else.\u00A0\u00A0I don\u0027t recall the shoreline issue necessarily being something unique to JNSQ.\u00A0 I know little about Ad Astra as it

right now I don\u0027t think you can even download it.\u00A0 The mod dev is in the process of revamping it, and it\u0027s my understanding he has removed the download link until the new version is available.\u00A0 Based on what I\u0027ve read, the revamp includes changes to the scale of the system (with 1/4 and 1/9 real scale versions).\u00A0 No word on when the revamp will be

in its secondary mode as a secondary star system.\u00A0 While JNSQ and GPP are built natively to different scales (JNSQ 1/4 real scale and GPP 1/10 real scale), optional mods are provided to rescale one or the other so they can be played together.\u00A0 You can either make JNSQ smaller or GPP bigger, depending on what you prefer.\u00A0 You can even add in GEP if you\u0027d like.\u00A0 Of course, if the idea of making the long journey to a neighboring star system doesn\u0027t appeal to you, then this really isn\u0027t an attractive option.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
