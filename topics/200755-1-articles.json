The main issue with them in KSP1 is that without some kind of stage recovery mod they get deleted as you fly the rocket to orbit, unless you design them specifically so that you have time to switch back and fly them home before that happens. It would be very nice indeed if KSP2 manages to lift this restriction.

As soon as you hit the boundary between your pale blue dot and the inky black, it\u0027s just \u0022GO LAND ON THE MOON\u0022. Challenges ramp up way too fast and seeing stuff like that is pretty intimidating if you\u0027re new or if you just suck (like me). I think a more gradual early game is needed,\u00A0 incorporating sounding rockets, prop aircraft, and less contracts telling you do do more than we have in 80 years of space exploration within 2 hours of starting your fledgeling space program.

I\u0027m really glad they\u0027re completely ditching it and redesigning an \u0022adventure mode\u0022 from scratch. I don\u0027t know if sounding rockets or prop aircraft are the solution, but the early learning curve certainly needs smoothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy biggest early difficulty hurdles were RV and docking. The docking tutorial in particular was just plain bad and wrong \u2013 it featured a stationary target craft that you had to dock with, whereas it\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0easier to have both craft controllable so that the target craft orients its docking port towards the approaching craft. I was also doing a lot of other stuff extremely inefficiently for a really long time because nobody pointed me at better ways \u2013 for example, Minmus trips were really expensive and complicated because I was correcting inclination rather than burning for the An/Dn and encountering there. Never even mind interplanetary transfers. The \u0022how to reach orbit\u0022 tutorial also got me doing some hilariously inefficient burns, basically going up and sideways and sometimes even down to circularise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with the relatively recent improvements like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts, the game is still too opaque with information too. Landings for example are simply more enjoyable with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s suicide burn indicator, I really don\u0027t see any reason that shouldn\u0027t be stock \u2013 if you like, associated with more advanced command pods or probe cores, but nevertheless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood thing that Intercept have said that smoothing out this early learning curve is a primary objective, and they want to do it with better tutorials. Sounds about right to me. If the tutorials are bundled with missions that support them, it could work really well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
