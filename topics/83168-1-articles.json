If you want reliable colour reproduction and great viewing angles you should go with IPS. If you need a high refresh rate and/or superb response time, TN can provide that at the cost of reduced fidelity. This is most relevant for gamers that place fast paced games like action shooters, otherwise the gains diminish quickly. And, of course, TN is generally a bit cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe sure to pick a decent TN screen though, as the budget segment generally has horrible properties. I have a screen that is a perfect demo of what is wrong with the technology and I think you would want to avoid that is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
