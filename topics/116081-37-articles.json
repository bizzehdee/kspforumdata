Should not be a problem, but I already know from driving the Kranefly/M7 that the KER dV numbers are not to be trusted for this rig. So I will have to manually figure out just how much fuel (and oxidant, which is at this point useless to both ships) to distribute to make sure everyone can get to Gilly orbit when that very annoying little potato comes back around. \n\nETA: Calculations complete, now it\u0027s up to the execution. I really wish I could drive both ships at the same time in stock... as it stands I think I\u0027ll send *Kranefly*/M7 on this set of burns and either find a second solution for *Evestation* (e.g. starting with a burn at the descending node) or just wait until Gilly comes around again. It\u0027s still 11 days until *Mortingale* reaches Eve SOI so there\u0027s no hurry...am really hoping that *Mortingale* has enough in the tank to make Gilly in one go, because I do not want to do all this again!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You never really explained why Val and Lisa joined the plot to save Tedus and that science guy... what was his name again?\n\nWhat plot?
