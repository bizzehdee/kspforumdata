Basically when the warning came up that it can mess with the parts or whatever, I tried to click the Ok button or whatever it says. The button did nothing. I could click it, the game was still running, but the button did nothing, esc did nothing; I had to exit the game. After that the warning never popped up again and I was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:12:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t see anything obvious in the logs StealthPlatypus, can you do it again and get another log please?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StealthPlatypus","CreatedById":141902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably be crashing planes for the next little while so if it happens again I\u0027ll post another log.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
