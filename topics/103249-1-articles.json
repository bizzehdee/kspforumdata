That\u0027s where most of your mass is, and remember the game calculates drag as a function of mass. So especially when the lower stage tank is near empty, the drag vector is like a string pulling the top part of your ship towards the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words it\u0027s like you built an arrow and put all the feathers on the tip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may be able to fix this by putting some fins on the bottom of the rocket... that will give you more drag on the back end and help to keep the ship pointed in the right direction. But ultimately I think you will have to redesign the upper stage so that the drag from all those hanging bits is managed. Moving everything closer to centerline may work... if it were me, though, I would launch those big rovers separately and assemble the thing in orbit. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T17:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Kuzzter,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info with the mass, i did not know that. But i forgot to say this happens when the rocket is around 70-100 km so well out of athomsphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T17:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh! Well, in that case you may have a center of mass/center of thrust problem. Try this: in the VAB, pull all the lower stage parts off until you are left with the ship that spins at 70-100km. Right-click on your tanks and adjust the fuel to whatever levels you have when the problem occurs. Also right-click on any engines that do not get used when the problem occurs, and reduce their thrust to 0%. Now when you click the icons in lower left of the window to display center of thrust and center of mass, you will see how the vectors line up at the critical moment in your flight. If they are not aligned, then that will explain your spinning and you can move things around to avoid the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T17:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow super expained and i learnd a lot, i did not know many of those things!

If so, why stage 5 has 5 engines? Are you sure you dont have 6th engine misplaced in later stage? Also are these engines above your center of mass? If so, they are gimbaling wrong way. KSP always assumes engines are bellow COM. Lock up their gimbals and try again. Impressive stack of equipment. Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T19:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes thats the config. Yeah these rovers are basicly build out of tracks and science enquitment :-) Stage 5 has only 5 engines. I think this is enough. If staged the engines are not above COM only when the last booster stage is active but then the engines are off.

Now im going to try TAC Fuel Balancer and i will put one tank as weight. Also adding some boosters for a bit of a kick in orbit but i think they will not be so efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
