During long automatic maneuvers (like moving a tug from one end of a station to the other) I find this handy because MJ is somewhat opaque as to what it\u0027s actually doing. In other cases, MJ can sometimes try and approach with (IMO) too high a lateral velocity, this mod lets me detect that, disable autodocking, and tap \u0027H\u0027 (or \u0027N\u0027 as appropriate) to kill the closing velocity and allow for better lateral alignment before re-enabling autodocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIgnore the folks who try to tell you how to play.
