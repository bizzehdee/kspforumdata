These missions are randomly generated, so some are going to be almost impossible, others will be incredibly easy (and maybe still give a big reward). You\u0027re probably going to need a really big lifter for this mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You can drain most of the fuel out of the liquid booster to make it weigh less and make the mission easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You don\u0027t need to activate the part through the staging process to complete the contract. You can already be using it, then right click the part and \u0022run experiment\u0022 and you\u0027ll also complete the contract even though you\u0027ve been using the engine for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Billyk88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Billyk88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi everyone i could use ur help to design a rocket to complete this contract.

However, if you want to take on the challenge, send the booster there minus its fuel load. Given that it has no attachment points at the base, it can always be mounted upside down on your lander. Do land in the sea since that is much easier then landing on a hill. A lot will depend on the tech unlocked as to how much you will need for the mission. Do use low cost SRB for the first stage and use enough to get to about 10,000 meters before relying on liquid engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep us informed on how it goes once you accept the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:18:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost contracts have extremely long expiration dates.

Establish an orbit around duna (after aerobreaking), then decouple the lander to do the duna mission, get back, dock them together, fly to Ike and do the same. Getting from the surface to Duna back up into orbit takes a lot of delta-V, so keeping most of the weight (in fuel and nuclear engines) in orbit will make your spacecraft a lot smaller. \u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, just launch two missions (spacecraft) at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T23:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo complete the mission you have to activate it under the required conditions using \u0022staging\u0022.
