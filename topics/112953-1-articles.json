In case you didn\u0027t know, a dissonance is two non-resonanting sounds, e.g, it sounds unpleasant. I\u0027m not sure how much you know about composing, e.g doing it by \u0022feel\u0022 or actually intentionally doing it by the books, but you may want to take a look at perfect 5ths, etc.\n\nEdit 2: I do like the last one, being a player of [double bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass) myself.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T17:50:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by waterlubber**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T22:37:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They all sound great! What seemed to be a bit of dissonance around 0:18 in the overture, but it was well placed if intentional. Good to know we have successor to Kevin macLeod\n\nIt was intentional, and I typically don\u0027t listen to music as I compose UNTILL I am completely finished, then I go back and make revisions to it. Unless it is something large like my 22 minute symphony, in which case I would write the movements one by one and then listen back. It\u0027s all theory. On my level of theory knowledge, I have been offered composing lessons by a known composer... After only being able to read music for 1 year. On the other hand, my music is completely emotionless, I derive all of it via methodical mathematical processes, which yes sometimes turns up dissonance as a chord progression, but very rarely do I use dissonant intervals that are more dissonant than a major second or minor 7th. Especially tritones.\n\nBut thank you for your kind words!\n\n(Should I upload my 2 symphonies?, they\u0027re quite long, the first is 16 minutes and the second is 22. If so, should I break each down into each movement as a different video?)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T22:55:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceSphereOfDeath**"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T16:36:31Z","Content":"You should probably upload them to soundcloud, or as 360p or a lower resolution to save bandwith.
