My best answer for that is that the craft is extremely low drag. Drag, of course, also has an intimate relationship with the lift of the craft - if I don\u0027t have enough lift, then the aircraft has a harder time holding straight and therefore the angle of attack would increase even more. And indeed, before I angled the engines and the pre-coolers on this prototype 2, those engines would overheat. In 1.0, drag wasn\u0027t as severe, and thus heat problems weren\u0027t nearly as severe. This aircraft will easily overheat if not flown properly. Just ease up to 26,900 meters or so steadily, not going too fast, and maintain your momentum, gradually increasing your speed and keep an eye on the flames. Once you get to 26.9 km, just try to hold level and keep the throttle up. It should work just fine. One of the features that avoids heat quite a bit is the nose cone, it is so pointy that it greatly reduces the drag and friction. It is also angled in a way to line up with the velocity vector at that altitude. Without that, it would likely overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fengist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fengist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have no need for the craft file, though others may want to have a look.

In previous versions extending the landing gear at high speeds or torques caused the craft to disassemble, take care.

I don\u0027t think I can solve that with the ram intake still being mounted on the service bay (it\u0027s there for thermal reasons). Currently the craft contains - 1 mk1 inline cockpit, 2 rapier engines, 1 ram intake, 1 long mk2 cargo bay, one mk1 service bay, 6 mk1 lf tanks, 4 mk1 SAS units, 4 small structural wings (angled 15 degrees I think), 2 400 batteries, 2 RTGs, 2 ladders, 4 structural struts, 3 old school landing gears, 1 basic antenna, 1 radial parachute, and the rest should be cubic struts. Two of the lf tanks are stuck on the back of the rapiers and offset forward all the way, the rest of the stuff is just good old \u0027mount things on cubic struts and place them so that they overlap other parts because KSP only checks the placement of the strut itself\u0027 trick with offsetting to lesser degree only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022juzeris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022juzeris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, the whole point of the craft is to generate as little drag as possible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand why you did it and it obviously works.
