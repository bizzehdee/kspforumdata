Good luck and godspeed.\n\nTemperature Gauge Bug - For those of you attempting this, there is an unconfirmed bug in 1.02 whereby temperature gauges cause a memory leak. Several people have reported it and the workaround appears to be, turn the gauges off by hitting F10. If your game is crashing while attempting a circumnavigation, try turning the gauges off and see if that alleviates the problem.\n\n**The Challenge** - Circumnavigate Kerbin non-stop with an aircraft.\n\n**The Rules -**\n\n- Stock parts only.\n- Mods that do not change game physics (Jeb, KEnginner, Kerbal Alamr Clock) are allowed.\n- Air breathing engines only. (Jets, TurboJets and R.A.P.I.E.R)\n- If using R.A.P.I.E.R engines, a screenshot at takeoff showing 0 oxidizer will be required. No switching modes on R.A.P.I.E.Rs\n- No cheating. (gravity hacks, infiglide, etc.)\n- All debug settings that modify the game should be at default. You may turn on settings that provide information only.\n- You must not exceed 30km. 30,001 meters and you\u0027re disqualified.\n- You must take off from the KSC runway. (VTOL\u0027s and STOL\u0027s are acceptable.)\n- You must land back at KSC (runway landing not required but you must be close).\n- You must show at least one clear screenshot of your aircraft. (Phoenix screenshots do not qualify.)\n- You must show an F3 screenshot at the end of your flight.\n- You may not lose any parts (i.e. you burn a part off, you\u0027re disqualified).\n- No drop tanks.\n- Your aircraft must be Kerballed.\n- You must list your flight time and the number of complete circumnavigations in the body of your post.\n- You must either follow the equator (heading of 90 or 270 degrees) or you may do a polar circumnavigation.\n- Any other rule I haven\u0027t thought of that breaks the spirit of this challenge.\n\n**Rule Changes**\n\n1. **Due to the fact that F3 screenshots are no longer showing accurate distances,** you must have at least one map-view screenshot showing your craft on the opposite side of Kerbin from KSC. Either the continent with KSC and your relative position or the continent you\u0027re flying over must be on the \u0027light side\u0027 and visible. The F3 is still required.\n\n**Re-attempts -** \n\nYou are free to attempt this challenge as many times as you like. However, in order to preserve the uniqueness of the \u0027advanced\u0027 challenges, you will only be listed under one class. Thus, if you have both multiple circumnavigations and a speed that qualifies you for the \u0027velocity\u0027 badge, in either one or multiple attempts, you\u0027ll need to let me know which you desire to keep.\n\n**Additional Challenges -** \n\n- The fastest completion times will be listed under Velocity Circumnavigators.\n- The most non-stop circumnavigations will be listed under Expedition Circumnavigators.\n\n**Badges -** \n\n- Those completing this challenge will be entitled to display the Circumnavigator badge in their signature.\n- Those completing 2\u002B circumnavigations will be entitled to display the Grand Circumnavigator badge in their signature.\n- If at any time, anyone is listed for the number of circumnavigations under Expedition Circumnavigators they will be entitled to display that badge in their signature. Only the top circumnavigators will remain on the list.\n- If at any time anyone is listed for their completion speed under Velocity Circumnavigator they will be entitled to display that badge in their signature. Only the top circumnavigators will remain on the list.\n\n**How to update your signature -**\n\n1. Click on your login name at the top of the page beside \u0027Welcome\u0027\n2.

And it\u0027s definitely efficient enough to do multiple laps. Mostly, I kept between 10 and 11km and my speeds were 180-220 ish most of the way. I intentionally went East from KSC knowing full well I\u0027d be chasing it around the globe which is evident by the fact that I went almost 4,500km to do a circumnavigation. However, if you check my fuel on the F3 screenshot, you\u0027ll see I had more than half left. So, if you have the patience, the J-33 has the efficiency.\n\nYou\u0027ll note I\u0027m also facing the wrong way on the runway for an East-West run. I came in a bit too hot on my first pass. And then (this is my first landing with the new gear) discovered the gear doesn\u0027t turn all that well, which is why I\u0027m sitting half way off the runway... grrrrr.\n\n![Circ1-1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Circ1-1.jpg)\n\n![Circ1-2.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Circ1-2.jpg)\n\n![Circ1-3.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Circ1-3.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T04:27:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:42:42Z","Content":"Hello!

At that speed it\u0027s impossible to have all your parts completely cool.\n\n![85rHacI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/85rHacI.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:12:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You obviously have no reentry heating enabled.

My best answer for that is that the craft is extremely low drag. Drag, of course, also has an intimate relationship with the lift of the craft - if I don\u0027t have enough lift, then the aircraft has a harder time holding straight and therefore the angle of attack would increase even more. And indeed, before I angled the engines and the pre-coolers on this prototype 2, those engines would overheat. In 1.0, drag wasn\u0027t as severe, and thus heat problems weren\u0027t nearly as severe. This aircraft will easily overheat if not flown properly. Just ease up to 26,900 meters or so steadily, not going too fast, and maintain your momentum, gradually increasing your speed and keep an eye on the flames. Once you get to 26.9 km, just try to hold level and keep the throttle up. It should work just fine. One of the features that avoids heat quite a bit is the nose cone, it is so pointy that it greatly reduces the drag and friction. It is also angled in a way to line up with the velocity vector at that altitude. Without that, it would likely overheat.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have no need for the craft file, though others may want to have a look. I believe you did the circumnavigation.

Yeah, my 1.0 craft and the run I made with it in the 1.0 client, and the associated slide show, appeared to have been scrutinized in the new 1.0.2 - which is a different ball game - someone said 33% more drag, 44% more lift (are those accurate? sure feels like it). However for my 1.0.2 version of the craft, in an absolute worst case scenario for Serassa\u0027s sake, I could even make a youtube video showing me actually going into the menu in realtime, showing that the heat is set to 100%, and then going up and doing said performance, and then just paste it whenever and wherever it\u0027s needed in the forums. I do have fraps. However, I\u0027m figuring the issue has been resolved.\n\nAs far as your game crashing, I was figuring you\u0027re probably aware of the memory leak associated with the temperature guages, and that is likely what caused it. It can be disabled by pressing F10. Or, maybe you were already aware of that and were simply using the guages to make observations. Anyhoo figured I\u0027d mention it just in case. Slashy was kind and attentive enough to relieve me of my frustration with that and explained it to me several hours ago, breathing new life into me and allowing me to make my second prototype.\n\nI\u0027m hoping to see some nice entries emerge as a result of any bars of performance being set, and it\u0027s great to have this community where we can all learn from each other.

The time is 43:19 or 44:02, depending if the time I spent taxiing to the runway from landing next to it counts or not.\n\nThe craft is capable of sustained flight at 1725\u002B m/s, it would overheat if doing two circumnavigations in a row without a break, but one circumnavigation is just fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It has lots of witchcraft inside, like cubic strut radiators (contaminated testing, not sure if works), parts attached to weird locations and offset to manage thermal conductivity (seems to work), I also added an antenna like Fengist proposed, but either it\u0027s not sticking out far enough, or it has no significant effect. When launching, sometimes it has a bit more drag, sometimes a bit less, I blame this on some part (couldn\u0027t find which) sometimes being in the cargo bay and sometimes not due to wobble, but until I figured that out lots of testing went to waste (I even thought that Bill is faster than Jeb at one point, crazy, I know). It also uses less than half of it\u0027s fuel for the circumnavigation, but dropping two tanks (3 tons or about a quarter of the mass) increases cruising speed only by about 5 m/s (1726 to 1731), and those tanks are useful for their thermal capacity. I tried angling the intake down 5 degrees, but it ended up slower, of course that\u0027s due to the above issue (contaminated testing).\n\n[Here\u0027s the craft download link](http://kerbalx.com/juzeris/ResCav-Bay-7-5.craft) if anyone\u0027s interested. It\u0027s an experimental aircraft, thus the weird name. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1 toggles engines (will turn off but won\u0027t turn on while the bay is closed), 2 opens/closes the cargo bay, 3 opens closes the small service bay in front (for extra drag and better control), 6 toggles the ladders, 0 opens the chute and 9 cuts it, the chute also won\u0027t open with the bay closed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Liftoff: believe it or not, it actually has wings somewhere in that mess, so leave the bay open for take-off. When you leave the ground, retract the landing gear, only then close the bay, gyroscopes are enough to control it while in the air. If it turns to the side while taking off, the landing gear pushed the service bay out of position, and now it\u0027s crooked, revert to launch. If you get up to 22km, and it reaches only 1650m/s or so, you got that issue described above, some part is crooked and sticking out of the bay. Do an inspection if you can find it and revert to launch. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) You will overheat before completing the circumnavigation (you have enough fuel to do it at this speed if you do not mind slowing down to cool down at some point).\n\u003E \n\u003E Cruise: I found the best cruising altitude is about 21-22km, keep it at about 8 degrees pitch and it should fly level. While building speed, at anything above 18km it should not overheat while you ascend. The engines will flame-out while climbing, so watch that throttle, but once you get up to speed, the engines are nerfed so bad one intake is enough for two.\n\u003E \n\u003E Reentry: Do not reenter by angling down or just cutting throttle, you\u0027ll overheat and explode. Open the bay, this will produce so much drag you\u0027ll slow down rapidly, which will bring you to safer speeds for descent. In previous versions extending the landing gear at high speeds or torques caused the craft to disassemble, take care. It is actually possible to land it without the chute, but you\u0027ll have to hit the runway at at least 80m/s to have a reasonable control over the vertical velocity, so go in shallow. It will probably break something if landing just with the chute with the tanks full, but with them half empty it\u0027s fine as long as you hit the ground with all four wheels at once (also open that service bay).\n\nI also keep crashing with this craft, but mine is a little less annoying crashing type of crashing into the runway.

The plan was to have just the cargo bay and the ram intake generating drag with everything else inside the cargo bay. That did not work out, so the service bay also generates drag. I don\u0027t think I can solve that with the ram intake still being mounted on the service bay (it\u0027s there for thermal reasons).

Two of the lf tanks are stuck on the back of the rapiers and offset forward all the way, the rest of the stuff is just good old \u0027mount things on cubic struts and place them so that they overlap other parts because KSP only checks the placement of the strut itself\u0027 trick with offsetting to lesser degree only."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:29:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, the whole point of the craft is to generate as little drag as possible.\n\nI understand why you did it and it obviously works.
