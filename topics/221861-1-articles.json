Maybe, in a dlc we could get the Saturn V launch tower, the SpaceX launch site, or even the original KSP1 launch pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would just be cool to decide what you launch from based on your craft.

They could also limit the width (not parts) of the rockets that could be launched. Progression of launchpads could be coupled to the tiers of the tech-tree , so upgradable (with science points) when going into a new tier.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EWe will get more launch locations later (with multiplayer update). Would be cool if they would all have an unique style/layout and players can choose from which one they start. Maybe some not located on equator, making the game a little harder.

In the game kerbin has unlimited supplies and this would give a realistic limitation to automated transport routes from the surface of kerbin, without limiting players to launch unique/cool rockets.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-24T13:13:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2023 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 24\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lowi_Sace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
