I remember slapping my first boosters together, and diving for the sky only to bellyflop on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was when I discovered the best part about this game: \u003Cstrong\u003EFailure was FUN.\u003C/strong\u003E Not many games can do that, make you laugh and clap when things go absolutely, horribly bad. The variety of failure was constantly entertaining. I would flip, roll, break apart, explode in mid-air or just get launched into deep space with no control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had friends tell me to look up guides and watch Scott Manley, but a part of me refused. I was having more fun learning it by trial and error. I Did massive rockets that couldn\u0027t lift themselves more than a few feet off the ground before toppling over, then lighter ones that shook themselves to pieces with hilarious SAS wobbles. Each time I learned about weight, force, resistance, structure... only I didn\u0027t know that at the time! I flailed my way skyward to a Mun landing fairly early, but it was horribly inefficient and wonderfully ridiculous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/901005634774755877/702BFE4CC74FE72892B78E342F563F9AE70F1931/\u0022 alt=\u0022702BFE4CC74FE72892B78E342F563F9AE70F1931\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did break down and learn the basics after achieving Mun. I needed to learn more about maneuver nodes and how they worked. I still kept to my philosophy, though. Learning the tools but being wary not to learn too much, or I might spoil the fun of learning it through the game. Now, I can say I\u0027ve done great things in this game, and finding interesting ways to do them all. I would stumble and explode and learn HOW to rocket, then stop and look up why it worked that way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have been to every world but Tylo, built space stations and moonbases, arranged huge missions with gigantic motherships... and I started to become afraid of losing the joy of learning as I master the last bits of the game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I remember the spirit of space exploration, to keep reaching, keep going and setting your imagination first then filling in how to do it second.

There\u0027s a little something that makes a world of difference between doing your first Mun landing with all the skills and knowledge required, and plummeting out of the sky to a safe touchdown while wondering how the hell you managed that. I didn\u0027t learn to dock until I\u0027d already gone to Duna and Eve, and when I did, I just slapped together a craft with RCS and SAS and spent two hours learning by trial and error how to rendezvouz, how to use the controls and naval better, and when the two ports connected, I spent several minutes dancing a jig around the room. I put together my first in-orbit mothership today, and my sense of ignorant adventure is stronger than ever.
