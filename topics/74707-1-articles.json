The thrust ratio comes down to economics - in the Atlas, politics requires them to have lots of separate manufacturing, so two very different engines will get ordered. As such, with no restrictions, the second stage engine is very low thrust, intended to build up velocity slowly rather than fight gravity, and save fuel by increasing mass ratio. In Falcon, and Russian rockets, the engine manufacturers are generally the same. As such, since they already have to make a kind of engine, they\u0027d like to use a similar engine on the next stage, so that parts can be duplicated to save costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn rocket launches, what you find is that fuel cost is negligible, consistently less than about half a percent. When you have to use separate manufacturing anyway so you can\u0027t save cost by sharing engines, it\u0027s preferable to make the rest of the rocket slightly smaller and save a little fuel, as with the Atlas. When you don\u0027t, what you find is that most of the cost is in the rocket, and a large fraction of that is in the engines. So, rather than save on fuel or rocket size, it turns out more profitable to save money by duplicating engine components, as SpaceX and the Russians have been doing. If you look at the stage stats, you\u0027ll notice that despite the very different thrust ratios, the two stages will cover about the same ranges in terms of dv ratio, and thus contribute about the same getting into orbit regardless of second stage size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T02:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about delta-v?

The Saturn V\u0027s lower stage gets about 3800 m/s (using the vacuum ISP stats) and as I said, Delta IV and Atlas V both get over 6 km/s from their lower stages.
