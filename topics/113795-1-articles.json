Before this point anything I tried just failed to cut down the wave drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured that based on my experience, if you need a turbojet for the design to work, it need only be thrust limited to 50% so you can\u0027t just crash through the sound barrier regardless of how good your design is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt still needs a separate leaderboard, since when the turbojet gets going at high mach the thrust output increases, consequently it has a range of super cruise speeds depending on how much fuel one feels like spending. Mach 1.9 is just about the limit for cruise which for a turbojet is 1/3rd throttle on a 50% nerfed jet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/005xntS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022005xntS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed was also determined by how crazy Jeb feels, mach 3.1 on a mediocre day\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V3l5guC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022V3l5guC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that the design has a TWR of greater than 1 but only at speeds which are already high, so it was difficult to measure accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is pictured here pulling 10 g\u0027s at mach 1.7 and can pull more instantaneously in some situations. pulling more than 9 g\u0027s is worth 5 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qedjOPc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qedjOPc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the most serious test, landing, it\u0027s absolutely mandatory (for obvious reasons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pQ1p0mr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pQ1p0mr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe breakdown so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-22 points for a top speed of mach 3.1 somewhat north of the 10km altitude target, so maybe I need to redo this test.
