I decided that, since I\u0027ve been building such ridiculous ships with antimatter propulsion lately, that Thud posed enough of a challenge to be a good destination. I was not disappointed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first, I was planning on doing this mission like most of my others: a large transit vehicle, a lander docked nose-to-nose with it, and the whole business flying out to the destination before undocking and the lander descending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched the GGSS Rising Spring, one of my Thalassa-class torchships. It\u0027s a true monster of a vessel with over 250 km/s of unloaded delta-V thanks to its plasma-core antimatter drive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7BdXHrj.png\u0022 alt=\u00227BdXHrj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AGjgZbD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AGjgZbD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I launched my lander, the infamous and loathsome GGLS Mjolnir, Descender of the End Times, the Lander To End All Landers. It made it up without a launch vehicle. The torchship could technically have done that too, but I was bored and felt like making a big rocket for it. The lander was flown by intrepid pilot and physicist Chaduki Kerman, who is my first female kerbalnaut since installing Texture Replacer, and co-pilot Herberry Kerman, a plucky planetary scientist rather new to the space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mjolnir lander uses the same propulsion system as the Rising Spring, but carries much less fuel and payload. While the torchship has 250 km/s of delta-V and accelerates at just under 1.5 Gs, the lander has under 100 km/s and accelerates at nearly 5 Gs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RSRO94I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RSRO94I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, trouble happened: I\u0027d forgotten to put forward-backward translational RCS on both ships! I tried my best to dock them with help from MechJeb, but eventually MJ gave up and started pointing the ships at random angles whenever I brought them near each other. Eventually I disabled MJ completely and tried manual docking, but before I finished, it occurred to me that the lander probably could just make it to Sentar on its own without any transit vehicle to dock to. Plasma-core antimatter propulsion is... maybe a little overpowered. the antimatter usage does check out mathematically, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, I started burning for Sentar with the help of MJ\u0027s transfer computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mjo9917.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mjo9917.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rising Spring decided to follow, just for the science. If the Mjolnir struck the surface in a multi-megaton antimatter fireball, someone had to be there to figure out why, right? It lit its torch and tossed itself out onto a slightly faster transfer trajectory than the Mjolnir, allowing it to arrive at Sentar about 170 days ahead of the lander and give itself time to get into position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H7rOo9d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H7rOo9d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little over two and a half years later, the Mjolnir arrived in orbit around Thud, joining the already-present Rising Spring. Wasting no time, Chaduki fired off a few short, intense burns to line up the lander\u0027s trajectory with a nice flat crater bottom on Thud\u0027s surface, and the ship started falling towards the massive moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fuz9BZA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fuz9BZA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VnBHqfn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VnBHqfn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt soon became clear just how incredibly strong Thud\u0027s gravity really was. The lander did most of its descent at nearly a kilometer per second, almost two at one point. Fortunately, the engine was still stronger, and Chaduki managed to kill the horizontal velocity and get into a nice vertical descent over the crater bottom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ecpvbn9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ecpvbn9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JP2WpZy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JP2WpZy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding! Chaduki was the first out of the ship as it touched down, and struggled her way down the ladder in the three-G gravity. The Rising Spring captured the historic planting of the flag on telescope video, and a great cheer went up Kerbin-wide as the transmission was received back in the inner solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NElwS6W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NElwS6W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hIDFdJ0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hIDFdJ0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nl989DN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Nl989DN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as Chaduki declared the surface safe, Herberry hurried out to join her. He had a little trouble with the ladder (protip: DO NOT climb down ladders headfirst in 3 gravities!), but made it out alive, and enjoyed amazing views of the Sentar system and the rest of the solar system from Thud\u0027s slowly-revolving surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ruHNJA4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ruHNJA4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XZB5FJT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XZB5FJT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HW7UPaz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HW7UPaz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iH6anrs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iH6anrs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XKKkf7X.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XKKkf7X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, the sun set on Thud, and Chaduki and Herberry became cultural icons of persistence and accomplishment across the whole solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow they have a three-year trip home ahead of them, but they can at least make it in triumph and, more importantly, alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T22:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarted a new game with FAR, Deadly Re-entry and B9.
