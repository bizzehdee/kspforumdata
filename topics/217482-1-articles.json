Even if that didn\u2019t happen on the ground on Kerbin, the wings might\u2019ve been close to that point and are failing in the higher gravity of Eve. Try adding struts to make them more rigid- that should fix it. Alternatively you can move the gear to the fuselage but that might come at the cost of stability during landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-05T19:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224289695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217482\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221685719249\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222975\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Juno_Atlas_Saturn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/2/2023 at 11:20 AM, Juno_Atlas_Saturn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively you can move the gear to the fuselage but that might come at the cost of stability during landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it extremely helpful to mount the gear to the fuselage, never mount to wings. \u00A0If you need your gear to be wider for stability, you can use the offset tool to spread them out. \u00A0Doing that you get the best of both worlds- game still thinks the gear is attached to the fuselage, and you still get the stability benefits of wider gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
