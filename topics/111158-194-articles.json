So, without anymore adieu, here\u0027s why the forum really went down.\n\nBefore I tell you what really happened, I need to apologize to my fellow moderator, [@James Kerman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160462-james-kerman/). As you may recall, a few posts ago, I claimed it was his fault the forum was broken for a bit. That\u0027s not quite true.\n\nBeing a moderator is difficult work. Sometimes things are easy to deal with. We have to clean up threads. Sometimes, that\u0027s accomplished by tossing them into the thread cleaner, put in the anti-viral detergent, and turn on the contraption. Out comes threads shiny and clean - all the off-topic strings, forum rule violation strings, and all the other things you can imagine get taken out of the threads. But here\u0027s what most of you may not know - sometimes the strings get a little restless!\n\nThe wayward strings - those which violate the forum - can grow out of control if they are not handled exactly the way [@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/) and [@Snark](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/) have taught us younger moderators, things can get pretty crazy fairly quickly. And to be honest, it was my fault the forum crashed! I was taking the clean threads out of the thread cleaner, and hung them all back up nicely, right where they belong. But the problem was what I did with the bad strings from the thread cleaner... Instead of putting them into the reinforced container where we put those unruly threads in, I decided to toss them into the trash can. And that\u0027s where the fun begins!\n\nSee, the bad strings soon take a life of their own. They trigger other bad strings, and soon, before you know it, they can infect any thread they come in contact with. I wasn\u0027t paying attention to the threads but was watching some Scott Manley KSP videos with [@Geonovast](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/) - you know, to perfect our landing techniques. [@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) was over on the couch, taking the opportunity to take a nap, and [@Dman979](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/) was sitting in the recliner trying to do some last-minute studying for the exam he was taking that week. [@James Kerman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160462-james-kerman/) and [@Deddly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62955-deddly/) were over at the ping-pong table recently added to the moderator\u0027s lounge. It was kinda funny listening to Deddly\u0027s rant, \u0022See, back in my day, being a moderator meant being in the forum, looking for rule-breaking strings and threads... not hanging out in the moderator\u0027s lounge!\u0022 And the entire time he was going on  his rant, the rest of us were making a face similar to ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022) and ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022). About the time Deddly caught us making faces at him, that\u0027s when things took a turn for the worse!\n\nWhat we couldn\u0027t tell you at the time was why things happened the way they did. As we sat there behind Deddly\u0027s back, making faces at him, the bad strings began to grow and take on a new life and identity all their own. Soon, it began to grow, adding aluminum cans, candy wrappers, and even empty potato chip bags to its form. All James Kerman could say was,\u0022I\u0027m gonna ping Snark and Vanamonde,\u0022 to which we all added a healthy and loud \u0022NO!\u0022 See, James Kerman is one of the newer guys here and he loves trying to get us older moderators in trouble with the bosses.\n\nSo, myself and [@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) sprung into action. After all, we are notorious for taking action first and then wondering if we did the right thing. So, we simply did what we normally do with forum issues. At one point, he asked me, \u0022Do we know who did this act of great stupidity?\u0022 And I did the only thing I could do... I passed the blame on to [@Starhawk](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/131400-starhawk/). After all, that\u0027s what I was told to do by [@goldenpeach](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/34566-goldenpeach/) - whenever you screw something up, never take the credit for it... always blame Starhawk.\n\nWell, about that time, Geonovast decided to spring into action. He decided to provide us some time by pretending to give Vanamonde-type answers. And many of you called him out on it. So, he began to panic and that\u0027s when Vanamonde came back into the moderator\u0027s lounge. And needless to say, he was quite mad. When he responded why the forum had been down, he simply didn\u0027t have all the facts.

Do you have a bot or something that helps you flag ones for human inspection?\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s actually a great question!\n\nIt\u0027s basically impossible for any sort of simple bot to reliably spot \u0022things needing moderation\u0022.  Insults, threats, license violations, flamebaiting, trolling, political rants-- these are all things that require human intelligence to discern (well, until/unless AI gets a *\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E* better, anyway).  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nAnd there are only a tiny handful of us moderators, and we\u0027re just part-time volunteers, so it\u0027s not even vaguely possible for us to read everything in the forums, and we don\u0027t even try.  The only posts that reliably get a moderator\u0027s attention are from folks who are \u0022queued\u0022 (i.e. the first few posts of new users, or occasionally if there\u0027s some user who\u0027s been temporarily queued for repeated bad behavior), and that\u0027s a tiny minority of total traffic on the forum.\n\nSo the fundamental dilemma, here, is that it\u0027s basically impossible for moderators to actually fully moderate a forum that has any sort of reasonably large user base, like this one.  Which is why your question\u0027s such a good one.\n\nThe answer, as Vanamonde mentions above, is:  we rely on reports from the users.  If something doesn\u0027t get reported, there\u0027s a strong chance that no moderator will ever see it, regardless of how heinously rule-breaking it might be.\n\nSo... in other words:  in a manner of speaking, yes, we *\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E* have\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Arco123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E a bot or something that helps you flag ones for human inspection\n\u003E \n\n...and that \u0022bot\u0022 is *\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003Eyou\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E*.  Yes, and *you!*  And you over there.  And you, too.  *\u003Cu\u003EAll\u003C/u\u003E* of you!  (...okay, sorry, this is starting to sound like a scene from *[It\u0027s A Wonderful Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life)*)\n\nWe basically have to rely on the eyes and ears of all the users of the forums.  There are only a few of us, but there are *\u003Cu\u003Etens of thousands\u003C/u\u003E* of you.  You guys, in the aggregate, are *\u003Cu\u003Efar\u003C/u\u003E* more vigilant than we can ever possibly hope to be-- the math is just overwhelming.\n\nSo, the way it works is:  \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E fine folks supply most of the eyes and ears, and \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E supply the judgment call.\n\nIt generally seems to work out pretty well, largely because most of you are really, well, *\u003Cu\u003Enice\u003C/u\u003E*.  If there were tons and tons of bad-behavior posts, we\u0027d get bogged down dealing with them all.  However, because the vast majority of folks here are so darn nice, then our workload dealing with the small number of \u0022strays\u0022 is fairly manageable, and we can properly devote time and attention where it\u0027s actually needed.\n\nSo: on behalf of the moderator team, please allow me to say a big \u0022thank you\u0022 to all of you for doing so much to keep an eye on things for us... and also for being such good people, in the aggregate, that there\u0027s not all that much stuff that actually needs to have an eye kept on it.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-28T23:40:37Z","Content":"Question for any mod: how do you personally play KSP?

Other days, We\u0027re busy enough that I don\u0027t get into the forums on a casual level.
