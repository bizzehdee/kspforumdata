Within atmosphered planets and small moons, excluding the gas giants carbon dioxide is one of the most common gas. It is relatively common on Venus, Mars, comets. The conjugate salt of carbon dioxide is also common on Earth. In space in general we talk about how to get rid of it, as on Earth. But carbon dioxide is a resource for self-sufficient colonization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAspects of the cycle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCH\u003Csub\u003E4 \u003C/sub\u003E\u002B 2O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E = CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B 2H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO.

Its difficult to increase the rate because even though hydride donor proteins are rather unstable, carbon dioxide is one of the most stable forms of carbon when oxygen is present. CO can also be made from Zn and CaCO3 (limestone) and\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several reasons to have carbon dioxide in space, one is that hydrogen (liq) has a relative density of 0.07, much less than other fuels and as a consequence is difficult to store in a pressurized form in the vacuum of space. Converting carbon dioxide to methane (liquid) improves its storability (0.42262 grams per liter). While the mass fraction of a rocket that runs on methane is higher, the energy can be compacted to about 66% of the space as liquid hydrogen, it has a lower boiling point (\u2212161.49\u00A0\u00B0C versus\u00A0 \u2212252.879\u00A0\u00B0C) and lower rates of leakage loss. One of the problems with a liquid hydrogen system is that there are few gases the boiling points below hydrogen that can be used as refrigerants to cool hydrogen under pressure and liquefy it. There are several gases that can be used as refrigerants for methane and thus keeping it liquefied is also easier.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the presence of methane on smaller bodies and on mars (30 parts per billion) it is not sufficiently present to justify extracting it from the atmosphere. And the problem with Mars is water, but there is water in space it is just difficult to get to. Water can be locked into Carbon dioxide CaO\u003Csub\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u002B H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0 \u002B 2CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E -slight acidity-\u0026gt; Ca(HCO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E)\u003Csub\u003E2\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/sub\u003EUnder basic conditions it generates free carbonate and become Calcium Carbonate. The Carbonate can be removed easily and water extracted and CO2 released. On comets there is a relative abundance of CO2 ammonia and water. THese can be used to form Ammonium Bicarbonate, which is relatively stable excepting in water (in space frozen hydrates ammonium bicarbonate would simply lyophilize at a very slow rate).

The captured CO2 and NH3 can be used to make water and Oxidants for space craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem with CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E largely revolves around recycling it.

Alkylmagnesium bromides and Alkyl lithides are not the easiest compounds to work with (sensitivity to oxygen donors) or store, thus and as a fuel, methane is probably a better option than ethane, propane or butane, since these don\u0027t greatly increase density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf one does manage to get to carbon mono-oxide cheaply the tyranny of carbon dioxide can be broken.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCarbon monoxide with chlorine gas can be used to make phosgene which can then be used to make acid chlorides which is useful for making ethers (which might be useful as fuels). Also used to make polycarbonate plastics.\u00A0 CO can extend the length of a carbon chain by hydroformylation reaction creating an aldehyde of an alkene one carbon shorter in length. The aldehyde can be reduced with hydrogen and dehydrated to form an alkene with an additional methyl group. CO can also be used to create methanol.\u00A0 CO \u002B 2 H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u2192 CH\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003EOH, while methanol corrodes aluminum and is not suitable for storage, the CH30H can be converted about to create Methyl Ether which could be used as a fuel. CO2 can also be used with methanol to create acetic acid, which is a very stable 2 carbon compound that can be stored and later hydrogenated to form ethane, ethanol and ethyl ether. Methanol or Ethanol can be reduced to produce methane or ethane.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, despite its bad reputation,\u00A0 carbon-monoxide production in space would eventually be a thing\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting carbon-monoxide cheaply from CO2 has its challenge.

The reaction is two part, Part I a two water molecule gives up their hydrogen and creates O2, these then attack the oxygen of CO2 creating water and CO. The rate of reaction is about 12.7% efficient which using solar panels at 30% efficiency is 3.81% ensolance efficient. But this is about many times more efficient than plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T20:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjpew/scientists-turned-carbon-dioxide-into-oxygen-by-zapping-it-with-a-laser\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjpew/scientists-turned-carbon-dioxide-into-oxygen-by-zapping-it-with-a-laser\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T20:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223244403\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168541\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513282044\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DAL59\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjpew/scientists-turned-carbon-dioxide-into-oxygen-by-zapping-it-with-a-laser\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjpew/scientists-turned-carbon-dioxide-into-oxygen-by-zapping-it-with-a-laser\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPowering the laser with electricity created by burning carbon-rich minerals and turning them into carbon dioxide...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-14T20:17:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2017 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
