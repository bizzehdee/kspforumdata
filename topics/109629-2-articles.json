However my complaints about it still stand from that past. They are all nit picky and they are mostly aesthetic complaints. First of all the Orbiter itself is a wonderful model. No complaints there. However my issues are with the external tank and the SRBs. The external tank my only complaint is the red ring at the top. I just don\u0027t like that its a total nit pick! I am not trying to sound like some people on these forums who complain about paint shades and precise measurements of fairings and engine assemblies. Im just saying I don\u0027t really like the redish/pink ring around the top. Second I have never really liked any of the iterations of the SRBs in this pack they just seem wrong. They always separated wrong and they just never quite look right. You have to reach out to this mod maker. He has done some great work and has made the best looking SRBs in my opinion ever. Atleast they are the closest looking. They are very high detail so maybe he could make you new ones or maybe you can just scale down these.

I don\u0027t think they are large enough, look at the side by side you posted. You can see how much taller they actually are. The nose coint are pointy but not pencil point. Still they come to a point not rounded as the current ones are. The nozzles are a bit wrong. Also I need to be clear, this doesn\u0027t dimmish my experience to much. I am very happy to have a STS in game and it is also pretty close to the real thing. However these are tweaks that I personally would like to see, and I think it would be good for everyone.

Which means im unofficially taking over the project. But happy to do so. I want the css fans to really enjoy this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we can all agree that it would suit better srb\u0027s and have the pink ring removed. I can do this tonight and include the boosters from spice launch system as well as the origional boosters and I wil check scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust remember ive only had what the 0.9 pack offered me to work with but ive learnt so much so I can do alot more now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo are you all keen and ready for the next visual update?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly your work on this, thus far has progressed more in two days than the other CSS thread has in almost half a year. I am excited about your hard work and energy and it is honestly where the best work on this forum gets done-when the modders are fresh and excited. Just don\u0027t burn yourself out. That being said I would talk to the original people and see if you can officially (only if you want to) take this over because your work is stellar. I think they had a new orbiter model ready, and new models for the ET and SRBs in the works, but Dragon was supposedly gonna take a few months to do work on them. If you can do it sooner and better by all means I vote that you take a go at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDisOrder","CreatedById":143952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T20:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI vote that you take a go at it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eseconded\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJust don\u0027t burn yourself out.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espeaking of which, isn\u0027t there talk of a move to UNITY?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould this effect mods installed now or what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m totally ignorant of this\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T20:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 08:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by iDisOrder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the licence he issued with it it allowes me to modify it provided I acknowledge him awesome work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new bits coming soon ( srb and fixed main tank and srb ejectors) I also will impliment his origional planned addons and bits and pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mike-NZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mike-NZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBased on the licence he issued with it it allowes me to modify it provided I acknowledge him awesome work. \u003Cp\u003EWith the new bits coming soon ( srb and fixed main tank and srb ejectors) I also will impliment his origional planned addons and bits and pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you know dragon had nothing to do at all with the mod other than config maintenance.
