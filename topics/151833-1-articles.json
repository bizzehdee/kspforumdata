So you take a graphics program (GIMP is a free one), and paint them/cobble them together from photos/sacrifice a virgin to summon them. Finally, you export them in the file format that the program using the texture expects to receive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to find out what that format is, download \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, and examine its default textures. Load them into the graphics editor to find out how they look. Perhaps you can even use them as a start and apply your changes to them, for practice.
