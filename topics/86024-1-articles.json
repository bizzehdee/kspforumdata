I have found that some people\u0027s concerns with Workshop are true with ES and Fallout. For example, the popular mod manager: Nexus Mod Manager, support more mods than Steam Workshop, because most mod creators don\u0027t want to maintain their mod on both (for whatever reason that may be). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I wonder about is: Nexus Mod Manager or Fallout Mod Manager or Oblivion Mod Manager or Freelancer Mod Manager are all community made mod managers. What is stopping an ambitious person from writing a standalone Kerbal Mod Manager that works with both versions of KSP. I know with Nexus/Fallout/Oblivion MM, there is always a way to take a mod that wasn\u0027t made for the MM and convert it over by the end user to make it compatible / managed by the MM. I know a fan made KSP MM might not support auto-update, but it would make it a little easier to look through your mods and see which ones need updating and install updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-04T13:23:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2014 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by VirtualCLD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T13:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am 100% sure that if somebody would a proper mod manager the modding community will adapt and incorporate it in their future releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing happened with Blizzy\u0027s toolbar.
