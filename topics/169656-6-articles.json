I thought the idea of early access was you stayed there while you wanted/needed community feedback and then moved to the actual release when controls schemes, documentation/tutorials/info, features, and content were complete, stable, and in their final state. I guess the console version, much like the PC version, should be considered and treated as if it were still in early access for an extended period of time after release. How long?

5 new bugs and confirmed or provided additional details on 10 others that someone else reported first, and those are just the ones that crashed my PS4!\u0027 to be much more persuasive than \u0027This

I\u0027m not going to continue playing a game that I can\u0027t save. As such, I won\u0027t be reporting more bugs. That\u0027s not my job. That\u0027s not why I play games. Is this difficult to understand?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. I don\u0027t need to give you any evidence if it\u0027s in the tracker. Then I\u0027d be doing the work twice.

I buy the game to spend my time playing\u00A0it not working around functional bugs that really should and easily could have been found by any professional tester employed to create a test plan and write and execute test cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are multiple stages these bugs should have been found, just taking\u00A0the save issue alone; any decent functional, system and integration testing would have found this. \u00A0Failing that any kind of UAT (User Acceptance Testing) would have found this. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it was just the odd minor bug, then\u00A0Yes I would probably inform the Devs but this is a broken game with multiple game breaking\u00A0bugs and missing\u00A0fundamental features (physics warp is one example). Its a disgrace the game got released in this state and that people are still spending their money on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I just called Microsoft support and \u00A0got my money back.
