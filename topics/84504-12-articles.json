The bug happened in 0.3.1 when starting a flight, opening the map view, then exiting to the space center, then going back to a flight, and at that point trajectories weren\u0027t displayed anymore. Version 0.3.1a seems to actually fix that issue. I\u0027ll wait for confirmation before releasing it to Kerbal Stuff though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-12T10:29:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2014 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Youen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Ace","CreatedById":77819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T11:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESplendid - I had problems with 0.3.1 as well - it didn\u0027t work together with Mechjeb 2.4.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.3.1a fixed that problem however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is peachy again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T16:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was not seeing the trajectories consistently in 0.3.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a few test flights in 0.3.1a, and not had any issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
