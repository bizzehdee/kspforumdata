The parts and mass limits make it hard to do multiple testing contracts at the same time, so I\u0027ve mostly avoided them. Forget reusability; with the parts available early-on in stock it would be hard to recover very many parts, and at their prices it\u0027s not worth worrying about. Make your vessels as simple and small as possible, which will also make them cheap and allow you to do more before upgrading the launchpad or VAB. Use SRBs for your first stage (and second stage when the thrust levels make sense). They\u0027ll give you lower part count than a stack of tanks on a liquid-fueled engine and they\u0027re cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first building upgrade was the mission control. There may be better approaches to upgrades, but that worked well for me (so far). With the upgraded mission control I could take on all the early exploration contracts (Mun, Minmus, Ike, and Duna) and get their advances, and since those contracts don\u0027t have deadlines I don\u0027t have to scramble to fulfill them and can do other contracts while I work up to them. I was able to get a craft to go around Mun before upgrading the launchpad. I just used a 30-part vessel (made in the tier 1 VAB) to land on Minmus and fulfill that exploration contract; with the funds from that I can upgrade the astronaut complex. Now I can EVA and do the rescue contracts, and future missions will start bringing in better science returns (EVA reports).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdited to add: OP, you mentioned grinding a lot. I haven\u0027t had to grind much at all so far. I took a \u0027science from space around Kerbin\u0027 contract maybe thrice; nothing else has repeated yet.

It is capable of launching a manned craft to Mun or Minmus, where this manned craft will land, perform science, take off, land in a different biome, perform science again, take off again, return to Kerbin and land safely. It\u0027s compact enough that it doesn\u0027t even need any struts, and probably wouldn\u0027t blow up the launchpad either...

Just as an example: solid rocket boosters are extremely cheap and great for launching a craft, but if you have an expensive radial decoupler for every SRB, it\u0027s going to eat into your funds. This can be avoided by having your launch stage decoupled inline only, and the SRBs taped directly to the sides.

Or science around Kerbin missions, which are also easy. At the same time pick good landing spots to do science once you land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this should be enough to buy the next level launch pad, even on Hard. But this is just an estimation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t vouch for hard difficulty, but its called hard for a reason. Im sure its possible to get through, but a true challenege. Or a massive grind. I always believed hard was the most realistic setting for KSP. It takes a lot of missions to even get to the moon, and any long distance mission is a true endevor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI give it to squad, making career difficult is a good thing. I personally am enjoying myself playing moderate with limited mods. The lack of manuver nodes makes things very interesting, and the next contracts keeps me active by putting up satillites. Before funds went to more rockets, but now funds can go to more missions or better support. That sort of dynamic is interesting, especially when your strapped for cash haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T13:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frank327\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frank327\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom my experience with moderate you have to really cherry pick the contracts to make good money.
