I use... ellipsis when I skip part of the quote. I also skip ums and ahs.\u0022\n\n*These are my asides, mostly about how he\u0027s playing the game.*\n\nI put 10:00 interval breaks so if you have questions you can get a better idea of where to jump in the video to see.\n\n0:00\n\nHe\u0027s on 1.0.4\n\nbacks Reddit mods. squad has an opinion but no acutal say\n\nUnity 5 work is continuing.\n\nit\u0027s been a massive amount of work.\n\nsurprising with cool things and optimizations, but it\u0027s a \u0022nontrivial\u0022 amount of work.\n\nlots of stuff just being redone, to make them work the way they did before.\n\n3 ui systems in use now, because Unity 4 did not do what they needed.\n\nUnity 5 ui system allows them to do all the things, but that means they have to redo them all.\n\n\u0022Not from scratch, but pretty close to from scratch.\u0022\n\n*Max isn\u0027t throttling his \\*7\\* \\*engines\\* up from 50%. It\u0027s driving me nuts.*\n\n*Finally he does, and then lets his rocket flip*\n\nq: New screenshots of new shaders? a: When they are presentable.\n\n10:00\n\nThey can\u0027t say that as soon as they\u0027ve got U5 done, they\u0027ll have 64 bit. However, that\u0027s the goal. They will do \u0022everything we can\u0022\n\n64 bit is relevant to those who don\u0027t use mods.\n\nWhat\u0027s in 1.1? \u0022Wouldn\u0027t you love to know.\u0022\n\n*Max comes in for a direct landing on Mun. He seems a bit low on fuel.*\n\nOne of the great things about U5, is a 64 bit editor.\n\nTheir project is large.\n\nCompiling takes a long time, and crushes the non-64 bit editor.\n\n*Max realizes during deceleration to land that he doesn\u0027t have the fuel to get home.*\n\n*The slope looks bad and he\u0027s using a tall lander...*\n\n*He lands, it\u0027s about a 20 degree slope. THe lander falls over. The lack of fuel to get home turns out to be immaterial* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nMax is discussing why 64 bit works for some people but not others. Feel free to jump to about 16:00 or so and listen yourself.\n\n*He tries to take off even though he\u0027s sideways, and blows up all the ship except the command pod.*\n\n20:00\n\n*Most of this is Max converting his rocket to land on Minmus. Which the rocket was fully capable of before, even considering poor flying* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*He puts 6 unidirectional RCS thrusters around the craft. I\u0027m going to call that a unique way to put them on.*\n\n*He launches with Bob at the controls, and the rocket predictably flips uncontrollably.*\n\n30:00\n\n*He gets to orbit anyway, but is down to just his lander\u0027s fuel. He presses on regardless.*\n\n*He wastes a ton of fuel fixing his AN/DN in LKO.*\n\nq: will the gimbal be nerfed? it\u0027s way too fast moving also the sas always overshoots the nodes\n\na: \u0022we might go back into sas and gimbal speed in the future. it\u0027s not in the short term plans but is part of the gameplay polishes we have taken a peek at.\n\nright now they can react too quickly... more than the sas wanted them to move and then has to compensate an it\u0027s not hyper-efficient. It\u0027s not top priority but it\u0027s definitely something we can look into\u0022\n\n40:00\n\n*He opts to flyby and get science to return to Kerbin.*\n\nq: have you thought to add KER to the game?\n\na: \u0022we\u0027re not adding kerbal engineer entirely as it is but there definitely is a plan.\u0022\n\nBased on Kerbal skills.\n\nIf everything works out we can have it in 1.1\n\nPlayed around with it for 1.0 but it didn\u0027t come out right, no matter how much they tried.\n\n*He has a heat shield at least, but he has no PE marker meaning his PE is underground. From Minmus.*\n\n*He realizes his re-entry is too steep hen he\u0027s maybe 500km above the ground. He burns to fix it.*\n\n*He runs out of fuel with the PE right under ground. Less than 100km.*\n\n*He transmits all his data, separaetes the spent stage, and comes down on his possibly aerodynamically stable return vehicle.*\n\n*52km, fire.*\n\n*44km, his spent stage explodes off camera.*\n\n*31km, he gets below 3km/s, heat gauges start popping up on the ship.*\n\n*20km, he\u0027s giong 2km/s, talking about how RCS is actually saving the day. I suspect it may be pod torque.*\n\n*15km, he\u0027s going 1km/s. I think he\u0027ll actually make it.*\n\n*...and he does. Nothing exploded on the main ship!*\n\n*...then he hits the chute going 400m/s and it breaks.*\n\n\u0022I forgot that I\u0027m a dumbass.\u0022\n\n*130m/s splashdown, everything dies.*\n\n50:00\n\nq: ksp for android and ios?\n\na: no. it\u0027d have to be a totally new game. try Simple Rockets.\n\nU5 is not ready to show.\n\nq: physics on multiple cores?\n\na: U5 allows you to break up calculations over multiplecores. He doesn\u0027t know how it does it or specifics. All they know is it works on multiple cores.\n\nq: Holo Lens?\n\na: That\u0027d be cool. he saw the minecraft demo and his mind went pop.\n\n*He launches the same ship he launched the first 2 times, this time with a pilot and a couple more fins.*\n\n*It flips anyway.* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) *The rocket is inherently unstable because of all the (unneeded) mass at the back as fuel drains.*\n\n*He goes for a powered landing back on land...*\n\nWorking on U5 is fantastic, but it\u0027s a lot of work.\n\nSteering system for wheels is good enough to be in a \u0022proper car game\u0022 now.\n\n1:00:00\n\n*He gives up on trying powered landing, but does hit the chute under 250m/s.*\n\n*Landing is successful.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T04:21:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T04:23:20Z","Content":"Thanks for the summary!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E q: New screenshots of new shaders? a: When they are presentable.\n\nOoo"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T04:47:31Z","Content":"Ah thanks Horsemann."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T04:55:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022I forgot that I\u0027m a dumbass.\u0022\n\nThank you for giving me a signature worthy quote. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Note: Maxmaps said that, not 5thHorseman.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T17:44:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Robotengineer**"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T04:56:22Z","Content":"I quite like the ten minute sections you did; it breaks it up to sort of get a sense of how long Max spent talking about one thing (or building/crashing rockets ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ).
