Since he was the first kerbal in my game to ever set forth on another planet, I thought it be best to bring him back home. As you know, with a gravity 1.7 stronger than kerbin\u0027s, and a bigger and thicker atmosphere, getting off the planet will be a challenge. So any suggestions on getting into orbit from the surface of EVE?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just need it to get in orbit, another vessel will rendezvous with it later to bring them home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy initial thoughts were to use a spaceplane design with srb boosters. However, if there is a more economical design that saves on weight ill go for it. Remember, i need to bring this thing from kerbin to EVE.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apotheosist","CreatedById":9399,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T16:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on this.

You would probably have to use the shuttle-like spaceplane cockpit, since it can hold more than one kerman. don\u0027t forget to put a few parachutes on decouplers to safely and efficiently descend. if you plan on launching 2 rockets (one for rescue, one for orbital rendesvous and return mission), be sure that each one has the 3 man cockpit, but with only one kerbal in each. that way you can fit all 3 into one return rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Max Grant","CreatedById":3166,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T23:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave none of you guys tried setting foot on EVE?
