Since the game does not know how integral that part was to the design, it just refuses to load the vessel at all rather than loading it minus the one mod part, and then when it auto-saves to the persistence file, it\u0027s saving a version of your universe with that vessel missing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chemieglennie","CreatedById":60180,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T21:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s great.
