(seems like a good time since I\u0027ve heard .21 will break saves anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I have this issue where no matter what I build, no matter how many or few parts - it quickly veers to the right when attempting a takeoff. I haven\u0027t been able to go for more than 2-3 seconds before it kicks in, regardless of engine. I\u0027ve used double symmetry on everything so I don\u0027t think it could be a weight issue. I\u0027ve added control surfaces, various wings, different engines, different wheels. Doesn\u0027t matter, it quickly turns right. Very frustrating, I usually like to figure things out by myself but I can\u0027t help but feel like I\u0027m missing something very important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced this and what was the solution? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKris\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-05T09:51:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2013 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Krisism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T09:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan we get some pictures of the plane?

I tried putting the front ones on the wings to test that theory and low and behold, it was the first time it got down the runway. Takeoff was pretty funny (total backflip into the ground), but it made it to the end without veering. I think that was it, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T11:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming this veering is happening while you\u0027re still on the runway? If so, then it\u0027s probably because you\u0027ve attached the front landing gear to the command pod. This causes some sort of glitch resulting in the hard turn to the right halfway down the runway. Simple to fix: attach the nosegear to some other part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if this isn\u0027t what you\u0027re talking about, then this won\u0027t help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XenonSpark","CreatedById":34525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T20:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETex_NL just helped me solve this exact problem in another thread. Ensure that your landing gears are perfectly aligned forward. Any variation will cause instability as your speed increases. Minimize the number of landing gears you have (3, unless more is necessary for some reason). And keep your rear landing gears just barely behind your CoM to allow for better taxiing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
