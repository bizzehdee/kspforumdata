Since there\u0027s nothing there actually using it, it\u0027s just for show. I personally just have a dish in orbit around Kerbin and a dish in orbit around the planet they\u0027re landing on and that\u0027s all I worry about. It\u0027s all a matter of preference and how hard you want to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T18:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESatellite parts do nothing as of 0.20.

While maybe not directly answering your question the wiki even has some pictures of basic satellites and a great picture of how you would go about positioning those basic communication satellites around Kerbin to setup a bare bones relay network. Remotetech assumes the dish style antenna are long range directional antenna, meaning point to point. The other antenna are much shorter range and are omnidirectional meaning they don\u0027t have to be pointed at anything to function. If you mimic Remotetech using stock parts you could just keep those two assumptions in mind and build your own satellite network that functions like the real ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemotetech Wiki (located within the Kerbal Space Program Wiki) : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:RemoteTech#Basic_Relay_Sat_config\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:RemoteTech#Basic_Relay_Sat_config\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother great source for some satellite positioning would be here :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24646-0-20-Figaro-Global-Navigation-Satellite-System-Launch-a-Working-Kerbal-GPS-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24646-0-20-Figaro-Global-Navigation-Satellite-System-Launch-a-Working-Kerbal-GPS-System\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, even though you are not wanting to use mods this mod has great information for positioning your satellites. The YouTube video in that forum post has some great shots of satellite networks above Kerbin as well. Every time I see those perfect orbits setup just right I drool!
