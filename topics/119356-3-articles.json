I remember there being a woman with a wrench outside (who\u0027s name went into my head as \u0022Cam-something or other\u0022, but I think it was probably Kelney. Or maybe Fercan?), and I remember Loden going from room to room, and the names kept coming, and at some point my mind just gave up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a scene some time later where the Rockomax flight crew arrives at the airport and meets KIS for the first time. That\u0027s a great scene, and it sets the stage for really highlighting the differences between the two groups. But when I read it the first time there was no power to the scene at all. It wasn\u0027t until almost the very end of that chapter that I realized who James and Sherfel were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a scene at the very beginning of \u003Cem\u003EOld Man\u0027s War\u003C/em\u003E by John Scalzi (good book!) where the character goes to a recruiting office. The premise of the story (printed on the back of the book, no spoilers) is that people on Earth can sign up for an off world military organization and then, when they\u0027re 75 years old, they have the option to leave Earth forever to join the war. How exactly that works is a mystery. The scene plays out something like this. . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohn Perry (main character) walks in, and the recruiter says \u0022You must be John Perry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How do you know who I am?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have three people on my list turning 75 today. One called in to say she wasn\u0027t coming, and you don\u0027t look like \u0026lt;female name\u0026gt;.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt goes on from there for twelve pages, paragraph after paragraph of fairly dense world and character building. Some of it is internal monologue, some of it is conversation, but at no point is the recruiter given a name. At the end, John Perry stands, shakes the recruiter\u0027s hand, and leaves the office. On his way through the parking lot, he passes an elderly woman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0026lt;Female name\u0026gt;?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, how did you know?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

And I would bet good money she turns up in a sequel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, the recruiter was a throw away character. She had a ton of lines, took up twelve pages of the book, and was critical in setting the stage for the rest of the story. But the reader will not miss her when she\u0027s gone, nor need to remember her at some later point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Kerbin Interplanetary Society alone, you have an Ornie, an Ordrie, and an Ordun. I remember Jeb (I love your take here), Ademone (the scene with her puzzling out the satellite signal is really good), Lodan (though he tends to merge with Nelton in my head) and I remember Jonton. And, honestly, that\u0027s pretty much it. Even Bob, Bill and Wernher have kind of melted into the background. I can reference the list and pick out their job titles, and I can often (but not always) remember the character in the context of the organization they serve. But I don\u0027t remember the characters themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst Flight is a \u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E story, better than a lot of published stuff I\u0027ve seen. It stands on it\u0027s own merits and I cannot wait to lay my hands on the next chapter. But I think your ocean of characters has cost you some missed opportunities. The character who works for the Kerbin Space Agency, the one whose job it is to map out the spread of the blight and find out how long they have? My goodness, that\u0027s a wonderful opportunity. Here you have this character (I thought it was Shermal, but looking at the list it may be Joefen. I can\u0027t tell. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E ) who is completely isolated from the disaster, holed up in a lab, and yet they can see the whole thing unfolding in numbers, and may be the only person on the planet who can truly wrap their brain around the scope of it.
