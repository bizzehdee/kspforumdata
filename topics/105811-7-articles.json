You don\u0027t have to do that, however, you can collect the same experiments again in the future, and load them into the lab even if their traditional science value has dropped to 0. You just can\u0027t load the same (experiment\u002Blocation) combo twice into the same lab. That said, go do something more interesting while it slowly processes data; please try to avoid just abusing the lab via an endless stream of warp-\u0026gt;load-\u0026gt;transmit-\u0026gt;warp-\u0026gt;load-\u0026gt;transmit-\u0026gt;etc. It might unlock the tree easily, but it\u0027s really missing out on a huge chunk of the game, might as well just edit yourself 100,000 science points into your persistent.sfs file, in my opinion.

You don\u0027t have to unlock the tech tree before leaving Kerbin SoI, that\u0027s just one option. Really though, unlocking the tech tree is only the start of the game. Others will view it differently, but I view tech tree completion as getting my space program fully established. Once established, I\u0027ve got the full set of tools available for exploring greater distances properly. Subsequent science gains can be converted into funds and/or reputation, once the tree is complete and you bank a little extra science to unlock any extra nodes added later by mods (or possible future official expansions) or to spend in the admin building to enable a policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter tech tree full unlock, the game is all about exploration, completing contracts, pure self-satisfaction of building up a complete collection of science reports, and playing around with different designs and types of craft; in whatever proportions you prefer. To me, that\u0027s the real main game, an open ended sandbox simulation, the tech tree is only the introduction and first phase. It\u0027s also the long end game, much like other games where you initially are focussed on levelling up, then enter the long end game at max level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has parallels in the real world, with NASA (and others) effectively having to unlock their tech trees, but eventually reaching a point where they had mostly unlocked everything and were then able to use it for exploration. Sure, they are still inventing new stuff, but it\u0027s more like variations on existing themes and refinements of existing tech, rather than unlocking completely new tech. It would be difficult within KSP\u0027s current framework to simulate those variations and refinements to any great extent. Perhaps a future version of KSP might find a way to reasonably unlock enhancements to tech (e.g. performance upgrades to the same parts) after tech tree completion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T09:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarkGravity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarkGravity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can unlock the entire tech tree without going farther than Kerbin\u0027s moons?!

You can\u0027t \u0022win\u0022: the game ends when you get bored or run out of ideas, no sooner or later. Completing the tech tree is a means, not an end. There\u0027s enough traditional science points in the game to complete the tech tree several times over, but previously it was a finite resource. According to Roverdude somewhere early in this thread, the point of the lab is to provide infinite science even after you\u0027ve turned every stone in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get a bonus if you process the data where it was collected, but you will not miss or lose anything if you don\u0027t utilize a lab to it\u0027s fullest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T09:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you load in experiments even over the 500 limit, and they just sit queued up?

By researching the current data stored the data is transformed into science (as a counter in the MPL) in a 1:5 ratio. This decreases data at a rate and increases science at 5 times the rate. Importantly, the rate is proportional to the current amount of data (meaning the function of data decays exponentially through time if left alone). The rate is also proportional to the skill of scientists on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 3: Do the scientists need to be in the MPL or just the ship?

Any science done anywhere can be stored in an astronaut or a pod. If the astronaut walks up to or flies (eva) up to the MPL, or if a pod with experiments docs with the MPL, he (or it) can give the experiment, any experiment, to the MPL for processing (provided that the MPL is not already full of data). A minute after receiving the experiment, the MPL gives it back to the astronaut while the MPL keeps the data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow lets say the data buffer is full (and it will be full surprisingly quickly and once full, it takes a longggg time to drop). In that situation, the astronaut can just store the experiment in the MPL and walk away, just the same as he can do with any pod. The MPL will get around to converting that experiment to data later, provided you come back later and tell it to do so. Having 2 scientists in the MPL helps. More stars the better. The more exotic the experiment, the better. If the MPL is in the same biome that the experiment came from at the moment the MPL converts the experiment to data, even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just put a MPL with 2 (one star) scientists on to Minimus. On the way there, they took a crew report in space, worth nothing normally since this has already been done many times. They started processing this data, and the buffer was still mostly empty. Every 6 hour day, the MPL was generating 0.05 science. When I got to the surface of Minimus, after about 8 or 10 experiments were loaded, the data buffer was full. Now every 6 hour day was generating like 0.5 science. After flying back to low Kerbin orbit, I noticed I was getting 1.1 science per day from the same lab. (not sure why, maybe because they had finally stopped working on the crew report from space near Kerbin and started working on the more exotic Minimus data). Now 1.1 science per day probably doesn\u0027t sound like much, but Minimus is 50 million km away from Kerbin, so during the flight back, time acceleration can make the science add up.
