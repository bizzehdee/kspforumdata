It seems like the center of mass is randomly being projected far from the real center of mass and the camera follows it, but I do not know how to fix it. Without Telemachus installed, there are no camera problems on either install of KSP.

It doesn\u0027t actually seem to be the COM moving, as the controls still actually work correctly and respond appropriately, if you switch to IVA. It happened to me when I was trying to build an external app to display a lot of data. I was using constant http polling, as I\u0027m fairly novice at programming and couldn\u0027t figure out how to make the websockets work from inside my c# based client. I don\u0027t remember what frequency I was polling at, but I was trying to drive an external PFD, so I would have been grabbing orientation, speeds, and the basic orbital parameters several times per second, and the \u0027camera flyaway\u0027 wasn\u0027t happening every flight, but it was consistent enough to make me abandon what I was doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt like, after watching the demo web apps just work, if I could have switched to websockets it would have been fine... but I knew Rich wasn\u0027t finding oodles of time to keep working on this, so I went ahead and coded my own way to get data out of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did, if it matters to you, was inspired by the Go At Throttle Up plugin (also doesn\u0027t seem to be under active development anymore.) I made KSP just http POST all of the variables I wanted at the frequency I wanted them, then I put together a really basic webserver that ran as part of my client. That way I offloaded the server duties outside of KSP - all it had to do was shout out the info I wanted, and I was in control of when it did that in the part update cycle, instead of making KSP handle requests from the outside world whenever the client demanded them. It seemed, in my less than scientific testing, to make KSP dilate time less, and it fixed the camera fly away bugs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t post about it then because I figured it was the way I was abusing Telemachus, and the fact that I wasn\u0027t smart enough to use the more advanced interface that were at fault, not the plugin, but if Rich is looking into it, I wanted to provide all the info I could remember.
