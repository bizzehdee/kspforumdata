He then dies because the hull breached near him. I tumble and am thrown out of the station at a high speed. I grab my jetpack controls and manuver to a debris field nearby. I grab an orbit-displayer, and plug it into my EVA suit. It shows me on a suborbital trajectory. I clip it to my back so I can make sure I know what my altitude and speed is. I jetpack over to a 1-man open escape vehicle. I get in the seat, strap myself in, and check the power supply. It is fine, so I shut the doors behind me, and make sure I\u0027ve got the door ready to open and the parachutes ready to deploy. I strap the orbit display to a bar that comes down so I can see it. I prepare for re-entry to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
