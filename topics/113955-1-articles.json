Are you planning on fixing it at all or do you figure that you\u0027re scott free now that you\u0027ve released the full game. I had a feeling that support for this game was going to go absolutely downhill the moment that you went gold, see if you get a cent of my money or any of my friend\u0027s money, who were planning on buying the game. I recommended against it because of this, and I have a feeling that if it takes over a month to fix this this game is going to go downhill incredibly quickly.
