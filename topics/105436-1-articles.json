If you did have a pilot on board (in a second capsule), perhaps the game is only looking at the pod that\u0027s \u0022in control.\u0022 You can try right-clicking on the pod that has your pilot on board and selecting \u0022Control From Here.\u0022 See if that fixes it? If so, then it\u0027s probably a bug.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
