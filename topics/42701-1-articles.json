I am trying to experiment with lithobraking but I can\u0027t for the life of me get this thing into orbit. Rearranging of the parts is fine, I just want it to get into orbit. If the craft can also carry it to the Mun, that would be nice, but it is not a requirement.

It had a little trouble getting off the ground due to my ridiculous payload, however. The Kerbin test worked well and the probe survived, but the Mun test failed. The probe smashed to pieces on the surface. Basically, lithobraking like this is stupid, as in an atmosphere you could just add parachutes, and it doesn\u0027t work well outside of atmospheres unless you slow down a lot. You might as well land normally.
