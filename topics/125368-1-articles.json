However, you need not worry about either of those problems, due to the magic of clipping and flight reversion. My first version had a more accurate hull, however the water drag was far too high, so I swapped in some structural fuselages, and it was able to take off from water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, here\u0027s some pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z7Jkgln.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z7Jkgln.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6m8RhG5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226m8RhG5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JDI8ZmX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JDI8ZmX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jNQ2tOa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jNQ2tOa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/utpmBNO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022utpmBNO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lRUqPy8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lRUqPy8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might notice that this page loaded faster than usual for this number of pictures.

The closest I could come to it was airbrakes set up so that they were pointed out a bit close to where the hydroskis would be.
