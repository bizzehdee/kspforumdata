So in the end we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get an app which hopefully meets everyones needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I want you guys to actively give me feedback and suggestions during the process of making this app. This might take a while since I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also studying and working elsewhere, so hang in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo how do I want to do this?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the wrong question here, how do we want to do this would be more fitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all we have to think about an idea on how to involve you. Easiest and fastest way would obviously be via the forums, with images and text describing my problem, or you describing your ideas. Which, as it is, is a a good thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut besides this I thought about releasing the app step by step, a new version whenever a milestone is reached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are possible milestones?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all a list of features I think would be quite handy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDelta-V Planner (of course)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPreflight-Checklist \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 So you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget anything during your building-phase\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience-Checklist \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 To keep track of what you already achieved and what not\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMission-Planner \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 A combination of the above. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe modules above should be easily accessible to quickly make a calculation or check if you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget anything on your ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe missionplanner will allow you to combine several checklists/plans to one mission, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nicely organized.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Having multiple game-saves. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 So if you have multiple games running parallel in your game, you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mix up missions from different games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Be able to import your current game (especially science-info) (Not sure whether this is realizable at all)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Obtain information about planets etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are possible milestones, after each I could release a version of the app in the playstore for you to test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood news are: The app will of course be free, there are no costs, in-app purchases or anything.
