The tool differs in many ways, besides being a command-line only tool (altough development of a GUI is planned), the user has a lot of flexibility in specifying the constraints of the rocket, and later only the \u0022best\u0022 designs are presented, where the best ones are determined using the relation \u0022A is better than B iff\u00A0A is better than B by any of the user\u0027s criteria\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, I have to state that, at this early stage of development, kspalculator has some drawbacks, which we are going to eliminate during the next weeks.\u00A0Especially not considering asparagus designs, it is not yet capable of producing good launchers for very heavy rockets. Other planned features are support of Bi-, Tri-, Quadadapters and -couplers, better support for Xenon and MonoPropellant engines (support is currently limited by not considering all available tanks for these fuels), as well as improvement of some minor details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is about to design a stage of a space vessel, it produces very satisfactory results yet.\u00A0You might see its \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140434-kspalculator-determine-best-rocket-propulsion-designs-ie-engine-and-fuel-quantity-for-given-constraints/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eforum post\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0where its homepage is linked.
