Today I\u0027m a purist in a sense that I stick to mostly stockalike modding or simple gameplay enhancing mods, don\u0027t use part mods that much anymore.\n\nThat said, when I found an issue with 64bit it could easily be fixed or addressed myself and I was fully aware it\u0027s not the mod\u0027s fault. I don\u0027t use 64bit now because I really don\u0027t need to(my mod list has shrunk significantly) and ATM does fine for the cloud pack I have. I think there needs to be an understanding between the two groups, because there are plenty of harmless 64bit users out there and putting that entire community in exile is completely insane. Do what you want and I highly respect the modders, but there needs to be some consensus where the two sides meet. 64bit users have the recognize the 64bit KSP is highly unstable and that bugs in the game are not due to mods but using a highly unstable version of the game. Then again, modders could recognize that some simply prefer to use it and without it, they would not be able to play the mods they create.\n\nThen again, it\u0027s up the modders and it\u0027s their mod\u0027s, if you don\u0027t want to serve anyone using 64bit that\u0027s up to you, cool.\n\nah yes...you smell that...segregation ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Lumaan","CreatedById":120286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T04:15:32Z","Content":"@ArkaelDren - No matter what then we (mod-user) don\u0027t have any right to demand what mod-maker do to there mods.

On the other side, I can definitely see why people want to use the 64-bit version of KSP. I, too, have spent MANY hours and days researching, reading, and experimenting with ways to cut ram usage so my game didn\u0027t crash when my ship loaded on the launchpad or when I returned to the space center after a mission. Everything from using ATM, playing with opengl and dx11 flags, constantly pruning my list of mods to the bare essentials that I felt I could not do without. Even converting my Windows PC to dual-boot Ubuntu for the sole purpose of trying to get a couple of hours of actually PLAYING Kerbal Space Program instead of researching ways to keep it from crashing. Then researching and squashing all the bugs and hacks I had to put in place to get Ubuntu firing on all cylinders on my PC...driver issues and such.\n\nI was at the point where I was about to uninstall KSP and just check these forums from time to time waiting for the stable 64-bit release from Squad and then start playing again but I just love this game way too much to let it go. At that point in time is where I discovered this thread and Unfixer. I tried using the 64-bit workaround for Windows before but always got terrible results. So I gave it a try once more and then using Unfixer. I started with a small handful of mods and then started adding more when I felt things were stable enough to do so. I\u0027ve been playing the 64-bit version for about 2-3 months now and I really can\u0027t think of any bugs or problems that I encountered just because its the 64-bit version. In fact, I can actually spend time PLAYING KSP instead of getting frustrated with the game crashing constantly in the middle of re-entry only to load up the game again to find my ship and crew burned to a crisp in a scattered debris field after returning from an epic journey to Duna and Ike.\n\nI am a mature adult however, and I do understand that all the modders on here are doing what they do for the love of the game. They are trying to share that with others and they don\u0027t have to do this at all. I\u0027m sure they struggle often to justify their time investment and fight off notions of the cost outweighing the rewards. Those of us that play KSP on Windows that enjoy many of the mods they make and wish to enjoy the game along with the mods and not have to spend so much time figuring out how to keep their game from crashing share the same struggle....weighing the enjoyment of the game and having to devote hours to figuring out how to make it run better and for longer before the inevitable crash. Everyone has a limit to their patience and how much time they are willing to invest to try and make this game work, even hardcore space and computer junkies such as myself.\n\nIn the end, we all want the same thing...a fun KSP experience free of frustration. As someone who has worked in IT my whole life, I know first hand how many ignorant users there are out there. There is always going to be someone that uses something in ways that the creator did not intend for it to be used and did implement in their designs support structures to handle whatever the user is doing. People at my office will call me and chew me out for their computer running slow and programs crashing blaming \u0022that upgrade you guys did last week\u0022 as the culprit to their computer problems, but when you remote in and in as polite a way as possible point out that the reason their system isn\u0027t working as well as it should is because they installed software that introduced malware and spyware to their computers added a dozen search toolbars to their browser, they try to deflect the blame and tell you that the problems started after the \u0022upgrade\u0022. One of my favorites is when a user calls and says their computer is running slow and I ask them if they rebooted their computer recently. You always know when someone is lying because they will usually say \u0022I rebooted 3 times\u0022, I don\u0027t know what it is about the number 3, but that\u0027s the number of times the lying users say they rebooted. My favorite part of that is remoting into their systems and pointing out in task manager that actually their computer hasn\u0027t been rebooted in over a month. \u0022No ma\u0027am, turning your monitor off and back on does not constitute a reboot.\u0022\n\nSorry for the long post, I guess my point is there\u0027s always going to be \u0022users\u0022. No amount of roadblocks will change that.\n\n![PgtS59j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PgtS59j.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T14:06:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am sorry to bring it back but aren\u0027t u kinda still sad now? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)))\n\nAre sure it is wise to rattle my cage ?"},{"CreatedByName":"bartof","CreatedById":132556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T11:05:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are sure it is wise to rattle my cage ?\n\n[**Maxmaps** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2@**Maxmaps**](https://twitter.com/Maxmaps) \n\n We got like... 64 reasons to be excited about 1.1\n\nLOLZ!!! now let the new bugs and modders rage beggin:)\n\nedit: And as I\u0027ve just noticed you are mechjeb dev, I bow before you sir!

I think we can safely assume that KSP 1.1, whenever it comes out, will use Unity 5 and support 64bit. I think we can also assume that any intermediate versions will be 1.0.6 and maybe 1.0.7. I\u0027m not expecting an 1.0.8. I think it\u0027s also safe to assume that Squad is making very good progress with Unity 5. If I had to make a bet, I would say that we\u0027ll see this happening in the first half of 2016. If we\u0027re \\*very\\* lucky, not much longer than 1 year after KSP 1.0.0 came out. I think it\u0027s a realistic expectation.\n\nSo. Let\u0027s assume that 1.1 will be exactly 1 year after 1.0. Just as a working hypothesis. What will happen then on April 27, 2016 (hypothetical)? Users will start up an **official** 64bit KSP, and they will expect that their mods will work from Day Zero. Some minor glitches because of changes that Squad made, will be excusable. But if there is a mod that actively blocks (official) 64bit users, because they check for 64bit and they didn\u0027t have an update ready from Day Zero without the 64bit check, then there will be some people who will be rather unhappy. I predict that when there will be an official 64bit KSP, that this Unfixer tool will suddenly become very popular. Simply because some mods are low on maintenance, because of whatever reason. Which is normal, and understandable.\n\nBefore 64bit official, it\u0027s the users\u0027 problem.  \n\nAfter 64bit official, it\u0027s the modders\u0027 problem.\n\nMy two cents.

We had an official win64 KSP version back when 0.24 was released.  It continued to exist up through 0.90, and then ended with 1.0.  The win64 locking only started once the official win64 versions were out due to the increase in users on it and all users making the same assumption you\u0027re making: if the 64-bit version of the game is unstable at high memory usage, clearly it\u0027s the modder\u0027s fault, they can magically control the stability of the underlying engine despite having no access to the code.  I mean, hell, there was the 0.23.5 win64 hack that *no one* locked their mods over because at least the user didn\u0027t cause widespread issues; it was the official version that started the locking.\n\nWhether mods are unlocked when another official win64 KSP build comes out will be based on whether the build is more stable under high memory usage and churning than previous versions.  Same as it was for the last official version.  We\u0027ve done this before, we all know how it plays out, and doing a dance that it\u0027ll be socially acceptable to throw flak at modders once the official win64 version comes out won\u0027t change the calculation in your favor."}]}
