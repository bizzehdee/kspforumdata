I wrote a little utility that calculates when you need to burn full retrograde while landing on a celestial body in order to conserve the most fuel during landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn true Kerbal fashion, it makes a lot of assumptions about your ship and its orbit.

I will be adding support for more celestial bodies soon. I have not tested every configuration in game (except the default one) and it worked pretty well. More to come!
