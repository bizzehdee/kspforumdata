Would it be possible to have multiple sets of exceptions. In other words, one set of exceptions that comes with the converter and another one that is only for custom arguments.

However, that feature would be really useful when converting multiple folders. For instance, say I want to resize all textures by 1/2, but I don\u0027t want certain folders or parts to be resized at all. Setting a resize factor in a customizable config for specific folders would be great!
