Can I help please?\n\nWant to test this as a ~~victim~~  volunteer  ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022). Have got a mod idea for testing that will not cause any harm if it goes horribly wrong. Basically just a flag to start off from Github before moving onto other sites variations. Plus adding dependencies or weird folder structures later on. If I break my own mod with this. No harm done.\n\nHonestly the actual .netkan is easier to write manually for this one. However I want to know if someone can do this automatically without support from the CKAN people. Already seeing a few problems in the old version and have a snag with new pre-release. Minor stuff really that does not require an issue report on Github. I rather have a chat to you directly just now.\n\nCan I send you a PM with the details?"},{"CreatedByName":"Blauerdaemon","CreatedById":68734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-05T09:57:36Z","Content":"Sure, PM me as much as you want.\n\nI am glad you want to help. The current version generates a netkan file and enters it in a github-issue for you. Then these would be added to the netkan-index by one of the CKAN people. Generating a complete pull request from the tool is planned (so the CKAN people would just have to OK it) but not yet implemented.\n\nIf you want you can try a slightly outdated testing/preview version on [https://ksp-ckan.github.io/metadata-webtool/](https://ksp-ckan.github.io/metadata-webtool/)\n\nI just want to mention that I am not a member of the KSP-CKAN team so nothing I might say should be regarded as \u0022official\u0022 in that area."}]}
