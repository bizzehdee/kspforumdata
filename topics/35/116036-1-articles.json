It converts .ckan files into a formatted Text file or a CSV file which can be imported into most, if not all, Spreadsheets viewers/creators (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, etc.).\n\nUsing the program isn\u0027t the easiest thing to do at the moment, however if the interest is high enough, I will work on a version with a GUI as well as a version that I can host on a website, both of which would greatly increase usability!\n\nThe source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jwolff52/CKANConverter)!\n\nIf you find any issues or have a feature request please report them [here](https://github.com/jwolff52/CKANConverter/issues)!\n\nSimply follow the instruction in the ReadMe file (also below) for your Operation System and you will soon have a pretty mod list that you can show off.\n\n**Windows**\n\nUnzip the .zip you downloaded to any directory then double click convert.bat\n\nA command prompt will open and ask you for some info, once provided the program will convert your file then exit.\n\n**Linux/Mac**\n\nUnpackage the .zip file\n\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl\u002BAlt\u002BT on Linux) and navigate to the folder where you unpackaged the .zip\n\nType the following into the console\n\n    $ bash convert.sh\n\n**Other Info**\n\nAlternatively you can pass all of the requested info on the command line using the following syntax\n\n    $ java -jar CKANConverter.jar \u0022inputPath\u0022 \u0022outputPath\u0022 [-c|-t]\n\nEnsure that the paths are in quotes, especially if there are spaces in the path names.\n\nThe last two parameters are optional, however if you do not specify -c (CSV) it will default to -t (Text)"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T07:43:39Z","Content":"Should probably be in [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/36-Tools-and-Applications](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/36-Tools-and-Applications), if you ping a mod they can move it.\n\nNeat tool, what do you use it for?"},{"CreatedByName":"donald10101","CreatedById":146437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T07:50:28Z","Content":"Well I got tired of having to redo my mod list for my stream so I did this, I\u0027ve only put about two-four hours of work into it, but like I said will do more with it if people are interested.\n\nIn hindsight outside of streaming/YouTube I don\u0027t see much use for it, but I guess thats for everyone else to decide ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T08:12:13Z","Content":"So moved!\n\nAnd, nifty! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"donald10101","CreatedById":146437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T08:14:50Z","Content":"Thank you, and thank you!
