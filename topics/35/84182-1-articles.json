I\u0027ve tried many times and it seems that only when the mods are exactly the mods that are in the save file that it will load up and not crash, at least for me that is. I don\u0027t know how many others have this problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I was thinking of a way that someone could fix this and I cam up with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple gamedatas! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two basic ideas that can be applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) On load, the game will ask you which gamedata you will want to have open. You will be able to create custom named gamedatas. So like I might have \u0022Interstellar with B9\u0022, \u0022KSO with Fustek\u0022, \u0022All Bobcat mods\u0022, and \u0022KW, Novapunch, Tiberion shuttle system, Aies, Fasa, Laztek, etc\u0022 as my gamedatas. Say I want to play my KSO gamedata. I would choose that one and the gamedata would load as normally. Then I just choose the save file for \u0022KSO with Fustek\u0022 and it would open it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The save files have the gamedata folders inside them. The way I see this working is you leave the main gamedata folder clean except for the stock files. It would load the stock files and then when you go into your save, it would load the gamedata inside the save folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBroken down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)Load KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Choose save file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a)KSP returns to the loading screen and loads mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3b)KSP stays on the transition loading screen until all mods are load\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)You play KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it might take some real work, but I\u0027m really hoping someone takes up this request/challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post more details if I come up with any.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T07:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there was a discussion somewhere like this from the Alternis Kerbol back then but I forgot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MSD","CreatedById":59320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T23:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I correct in thinking that you want to be able to select what mods is used in what save?
