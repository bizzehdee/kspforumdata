You can use this on arch or any of its derivatives, just put your zip in the same directory as the PKGBUILD, and run\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E$ makepkg -si\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the PKGBUILD here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sprunge.us/BXgf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sprunge.us/BXgf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to submit this to the Arch\u0027s User Repository so that other people can install KSP on Linux easily, but I won\u0027t do that without the express permission of an official representative of KSP, since I don\u0027t want to violate any copyrights or anything.
