That approach let me plot out the Latitude over Longitude for both Spaceship Eve and Spaceship Moho, as well as Latitude over Time for Eve. Compare the Latitude plots to locate the line of nodes visually and identify the latitude of crossing, then look up in the time date for the when Eve is nearest that latitude. That identifies the times to within less than 6000 seconds. Interpolate the points, and I can get an estimate that should be accurate to within a few hundred seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, Eve descends through Moho\u0027s orbit at time ~3936400 seconds UT and latitude 1.9909\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 N Latitude. Eve ascends through Moho\u0027s orbit at time ~6799500 seconds UT and 1.9909\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 S latitude. Later nodes occur every 5657995 seconds. These closely align with my eyeballed numbers, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of which brings me to 15252390 seconds UT, which is when Eve descends through Moho\u0027s orbit and can be reached in a 2.6km/s transfer.
