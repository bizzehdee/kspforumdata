I started working on this when I tried to use [LordStimpy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Campaign ruleset](\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cforum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/11778-Stimpy-s-Campaign-Mode-Budget-Rules\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2) (more up-to date thread lost in forum crash). I really liked the idea of keeping track of money and trying to build the cheapest rockets possible to achieve a goal. However, I did not want to keep track of it all on a sheet of paper, some means to keep track of it digitally (and I do not mean Word or Excel) was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat can I do with it?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, It allows you to either start a new mission on your own with an OK mission reward, but no penalties on failure. Alternatively you can request 3rd Party contracts. Third parties have modifiers to reward, time limit, advance and penalties on failure that are applied to missions belonging to those parties. Usually that means a bigger reward for completing a mission, but less time to do so and a penalty should you abort the mission. Once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve created a mission you can assign Flights (for lack of a better word. Launches? Rockets? Attempts?) to them. Those have a cost (building a rocket obviously costs money) and can either succeed or fail. A successful flight automatically completes the mission, but if you fail with a flight you can try again. You can also specifiy the amount of kerbals that died on a flight and the amount of debries dropped on those poor kerbals below for added penalties. To give you a bit more control over how much a mission pays, you can specify a custom amount of money you wish to receive or loose at the end of each flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does it integrate into the game?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not. You create a campaign, missions and flights ond the website, then go into KSP and try to fullfill whatever goals you have set. Once your launch was succesfull or failed horribly, you go back to the website and enter your results. Writing a plugin that does all that for you would be somewhat out of my league - or would at the very least require way more time than what I have ony my hands right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDo I need mods/plugins for it to work?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee above.
