I\u0027m guessing MU is significantly faster at loading in KSP then raw textures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, is there, or will there be a compiler to package your mod assets via MU format? I have a mod I am working on with real-world CAD designs for equipment (Sky crane) but it\u0027s so complex that I can\u0027t even get her to load without either it crashing when navigating to the parts, or when trying to select them and load the part for view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T21:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP PartTools.
