Note that \u0022safe pe\u0022 for the highly eccentric orbits is a minimum of the Atmo\u002B5 or 15 km. Safe may be higher or lower depending on your celestial body.\n\n\u0022Orbital Period and SMA\u0022 is a set of calculators that give the orbital parameters when given a ap/pe, a SMA, or a orbital period (\u002B optional ap/pe)\n\n\u0022Hohmann Transfer\u0022 computes the delta v requirements for each stage of the transfer, the transfer time, as well as the slide phase time and slide phase angle, which is useful for positioning a satellite behind or in front of another in the same orbit.\n\n\u0022Surface Longitude Change\u0022 tries to calculate the appropriate target apside in order to arrive at the target longitude on the next orbit. I\u0027m not sure I have this working right yet though.\n\n\u0022Body Distance\u0022 gives a very, very rough estimate of the minimum and maximum possible distances between two celestial bodies, which assumes complete circular orbits (obviously wrong with moho). I just use it to help me estimate the appropriate remotetech dish I need.\n\n\u0022RemoteTech\u0022 has a vessel EC requirement calculator given darkness time (which can be calculated for a circular orbit in the Orbital Period and SMA tab). It also includes a Cone Calculator which tells you how far away you need to be from a specific body in order to cover that body (or a specific altitude above that body), with a specific dish. Also, if you use MultipleAntennaMultiplier, you can set it and it will tell you how far out your omnis will go.\n\n\u0022TAC\u0022 is in progress. I\u0027m working on a comprehensive calculator for TAC life support (including possibly simulating the generators over time) which will eventually end up here, I hope.\n\n\u0022DataForMapSatAltitude\u0022 and \u0022ScannersForMapSatAltitude\u0022 are for inputs into the MapSatAltitude script\u0027s text files to help generate the scansat charts, tables, and graphs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T04:16:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 04:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by westamastaflash**"}]}
