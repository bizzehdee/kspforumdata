I created this because I did not find an app with these features on the google play store.\n\nThe store page is [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evandisoft.multistagedeltav.app).\n\nThe features include:\n\n1. Saving and loading of entire rockets or individual stages.\n\n2. Calculation of accumulative deltav and mass of rocket down to each stage while also showing individual stage deltav and mass.\n\n3. Autosave functionality.\n\n4. Can insert new stages anywhere on the rocket.\n\nThere is nothing KSP specific in the app. It merely takes numbers of total mass, dry mass, and isp for each stage (and optional name of the rocket or stage). However, I play KSP without mods and find it very useful.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n[![Screenshot_2015-04-03-01-03-59_zpsrw6oyn4f.png](http://i1066.photobucket.com/albums/u415/evandisoft/Screenshot_2015-04-03-01-03-59_zpsrw6oyn4f.png)](http://s1066.photobucket.com/user/evandisoft/media/Screenshot_2015-04-03-01-03-59_zpsrw6oyn4f.png.html)[![Screenshot_2015-04-03-01-04-18_zpstz7pe097.png](http://i1066.photobucket.com/albums/u415/evandisoft/Screenshot_2015-04-03-01-04-18_zpstz7pe097.png)](http://s1066.photobucket.com/user/evandisoft/media/Screenshot_2015-04-03-01-04-18_zpstz7pe097.png.html)[![Screenshot_2015-04-03-15-13-30_zps1i0den7f.png](http://i1066.photobucket.com/albums/u415/evandisoft/Screenshot_2015-04-03-15-13-30_zps1i0den7f.png)](http://s1066.photobucket.com/user/evandisoft/media/Screenshot_2015-04-03-15-13-30_zps1i0den7f.png.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Niemand303","CreatedById":119422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T09:48:14Z","Content":"Looks good!
