I like the part that you can see the Intercept Angle and even the time in your Hohmann Transfers part. But I think the angle is only usefull if your Target is something that you can actually see on your screen so you are able to read the angle from your HUD. But if you want to intercept e.g. an other ship its quite hard to figure out the angle since messurements on the map are quite....wrong, i guess. I figured out a nice little formula that can estimate, based on your intercept Angle, the distance between you and your target to start your intercept burn. Since you are able to see objects in space at about 100km distance at your HUD this is a nice alternative to intercept another spaceship or station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me show you: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A = sqrt[ (Rb \u002B Rk)\u00C2\u00B2 \u002B (Rc \u002B Rk)\u00C2\u00B2 - ( 2(Rb \u002B Rk)(Rc \u002B Rk)cos\u00C3\u0178) ] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA is the distance between you and your target to start the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERb is the targets orbital radius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERc is your orbital radius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERk is the radius of Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u0178 is the interception angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso if you are on an orbit at about 680km and you want to intercept another ship at 700km you need a distance of 50,7km between you and your target to start the brun.

In the single-impulse case, you stay at your initial/final orbit altitude and simply \u0027crank\u0027 your orbit to the desired inclination angle with a single delta-v. In certain cases, specifically when your desired inclination angle is greater than 38.94 deg (see graph below), it makes sense to perform your \u0027crank\u0027 maneuver at an altitude that is greater than your target orbit. This is due to the fact the that the amount of propellant required to execute an orbital plane change (i.e. the delta-v) is linearly dependent on the orbital speed at which the maneuver occurs. Conservation of angular momentum (or equivalently Kepler\\\u0027s 2nd) requires that our speed decrease as our altitude increase (i.e. constant areal velocity). Thus, the three-impulse maneuver takes advantage of the fact that the delta-v required to \u0027crank\u0027 our orbit to a desired inclination will be lower if we move the location of the plane change out away from the target orbit altitude (where we will be travelling at a lower speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your specific question, the mid-course impulse altitude is simply the altitude at which this theoretical three-impulse maneuver takes place. The total maneuver would work like this: (1) utilize a co-planar transfer (delta-v) to get yourself on a transfer ellipse out to the mid-course impulse altitude; (2) once at this location, perform the orbit \u0027cranking\u0027 maneuver; (3) execute another co-planar transfer (since you are now at the desired inclination angle) back to the target altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that for inclination angles between 38.94 (deg) and 60 (deg), the three-impulse maneuver is the minimum-fuel option; additionally, there is an optimal mid-course impulse altitude for each inclination angle in this region (it\\\u0027s actually a radius ratio, but the mid-course impulse altitude is known once the initial/final orbit altitude is specified). For desired inclination angles less than 38.94 (deg), you\\\u0027re better off performing the single-impulse maneuver at the original altitude (i.e. option (a) above). For angles greater than 60 (deg), we are limited to the bi-parabolic optimum solution. Otherwise stated, this scenario means that your efficiency will reach an asymptotic limit as you increase the mid-course impulse altitude (the theoretical limit occurs at R -\u0026gt; inf).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Orbit Mechanic will determine the optimal maneuver based on your desired inclination angle and will specify the ideal mid-course impulse altitude for the orbit data provided.
