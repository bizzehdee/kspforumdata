{"TopicId":59024,"ForumId":35,"TopicTitle":"[All OS][Java][0.2.19] DataSwitcher- Instance Manager","CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T02:24:10Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T02:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDataSwitcher is a Java program for every OS that allows you to have multiple instances of KSP (currently just the folders). How is this useful? It allows for multiple sets of mod installations that you can quickly and easily change between. For example, say you regularly swap between playing stock and playing with a bunch of mods, but occasionally you play on a KMP server. Each time you want to change between them you have to either copy GameData folders that you\u0027ve backed up or you have to delete/reinstall the mods. With DataSwitcher it\u0027s as easy as selecting the instance from a list and pressing Activate!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made DataSwitcher because I needed it for that very reason. I had previously written a batch script to handle my multiple mod sets, but it wasn\u0027t easily expandable if I wanted to add another. DataSwitcher is written so you can have as many instances as you would like, can add more quickly and easily, and can swap between them with ease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t want to reinstall all your mods when you try DataSwitcher? Don\u0027t! The new version lets you import any folder into newly created instances on a per-instance setting! You\u0027ve got nothing to lose by trying it out. Though, make sure to remove the instance if you decide not to use DataSwitcher anymore (or copy the folders back to the KSP folder) as the newest versions use symbolic links.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Probable) FAQ:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What is DataSwitcher?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: An application to manage multiple folders for different sets of mod installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Why Java? Java is slow and bulky and annoying and nobody likes it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Because it\u0027s multi-platform and I know it better than C\u002B\u002B (thanks to playing around with Minecraft modding).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Will this run on (Linux, Mac OS, a toaster)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: It has been tested on Windows and Linux, but is written primarily on Windows. It should run on anything that runs Java.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Isn\u0027t this just like [insert addon/program] but lacks 98% of the features?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Maybe, I\u0027ve never used any mod managers or anything like that for KSP. I wrote this because I needed it and thought it would be fun/a good learning experience. I uploaded it for others to use in case they also wanted a tool like this, and to possibly learn from my source code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Can I view the source/fork this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Yes, DataSwitcher is open source and I am allowing forks without asking, as long as I receive attribution.

That link is an SVN repository, and can be checked out just like any other svn repository (using tortoisesvn, or the subversion client in linux)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: I looked at the source, this is not written all that well. What gives?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: I have never been formally trained in programming, so it\u0027s all self-taught. As a result, I\u0027m not the most efficient or even that good at programming. But it\u0027s fun to do, and when I\u0027ve got the need for something I can usually write something functional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: I found a bug! How can I report it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Probably here on the forum is easiest. I can\u0027t promise to get to it right away, but I will try. Send me the log.txt file that gets created and let me know exactly what you were doing when the bug popped up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What else are you planning on doing with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: I\u0027d like to allow full KSP instances to exist, so you can run multiple versions. Also, save game backing up would be good. I will primarily make changes based on what I need/want, but please offer up your suggestions!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Where does this place the instances/settings.cfg/log.txt?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: As of 0.1.10, in the DataSwitcher folder that gets created in the same folder as the executable. Previously it was in ${HOME}/DataSwitcher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: My instance didn\u0027t load into the list when I started DataSwitcher? What gives?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Check the log.txt! Did you use an illegal character in the name? ; \\ / are all forbidden (probably more), but it doesn\u0027t actually prevent you from using them in the name. If it\u0027s a semi-colon, open the settings.cfg.bak file in notepad and remove the extra ; between the instance name and the game path. Then rename the instance folder to not include the semi-colon and rename settings.cfg.bak to settings.cfg. It should work now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What does each button do again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: The \u0022\u002B\u0022 opens the create new instance dialog, the \u0022-\u0022 deletes the currently selected instance, and the \u0022Activate\u0022 button will apply the current instance to the KSP install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: How can I select multiple folders to import? How about viewing what folders I have selected?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Use the control (ctrl) or shift keys to select multiple files/folders. You can view the current selected ones by hovering your mouse over the \u0022Select Items to Import\u0022 button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: So I can import any file or folder? Even saves and KSP.exe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Yes. However, as of 0.2.16 importing KSP.exe or Launcher.exe won\u0027t allow the game to run (not sure why yet). If you import the saves folder, DO NOT USE FALLBACK MODE or you will lose information. You can tell if fallback mode is active by checking the settings.cfg or seeing if there\u0027s an arrow on the icon for the folders in the Kerbal Space Program folder (steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program for steam installs). If you don\u0027t want conflicts, every instance should have the same files and folders, if not then switching from one to another may leave links to instances that aren\u0027t supposed to be active (which may be useful somehow).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What is Fallback Mode and why does it suck?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: The normal mode of operation uses symbolic links to reduce the amount of time and space required when activating an instance. As a happy side effect, any changes the game makes to these folders are actually made to the instance (such as saving the game). Fallback mode is for when the system doesn\u0027t support symbolic links or the user is not running as an Administrator. It works by copying the folders directly, which works great for things like the GameData folder as long as no mods or the game make changes to the folder. The instance will not know that changes were made, and so when the instance is changed the changes will be overwritten (in the case of the saves folder, all progress since the instance was created will be lost). In the future I want to try to fix this issue, but in the meantime don\u0027t use fallback mode unless you absolutely have to. If you get the message about insufficient privileges, simply exit and right click DataSwitcher-0.x.y.jar and click \u0022Run as administrator\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: I enabled Fallback Mode and want to disable it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Locate the settings.cfg file in the DataSwitcher folder. Open it with wordpad/notepad/etc. and change \u0022FallbackMode;true\u0022 to \u0022FallbackMode;false\u0022. Start DataSwitcher and you\u0027re done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: I told an instance to Always/Never autostart the game and want to change it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Locate the instances.txt file in the DataSwitcher folder. Open it with wordpad/notepad/etc. and find the name of the instance you want to change. At the very end of the line is a number, it controls the default action for launching the game. 0 means \u0027ask\u0027, 1 means \u0027always\u0027, and 2 means \u0027never\u0027. Change it appropriately (it is always safe to set it to 0 and make the selection from the popup)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Alright, I\u0027m interested. \u003Cstrong\u003ESo, how do I use this?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Simple! Run it (might require java 7), then click the \u0022\u002B\u0022 to add a new instance. You will have to enter a name for the instance and browse to the \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder. For steam on Windows and Linux it should autodetect the folder (if anyone knows the Mac steam folder let me know what it is!). The path is saved per instance, not globally. You can optionally import existing folders into the new instance (I highly suggest selecting at least the GameData folder!). Locate the newly made folder and merge the stock GameData folder into the GameData folder located in the instance (already complete if you import it). Add mods into the instance GameData folder as desired. Then press the \u0022Activate\u0022 button with the new instance selected and it will replace the folders in the game directory with the ones in the instance. You can have multiple instances and they won\u0027t interfere with each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures (v0.0.1.6), slightly outdated but the GUI is mostly the same:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BaXhT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This should fix issues with trying to import with symbolic links.\n\n-- 0.2.16 --\n * Added fallback for if the user has insufficient privileges to make symbolic links. Falls back to copying the directory. Fixed by running as administrator.\n * Split settings and instances into separate files (I want to add more settings in the future, without conflicting with the instances)\n * Removed Instance Activated popup because of concurrency issues (it would popup before completion)\n * Added progress bar that indicates the progress of copy and delete actions. No longer will you be left wondering what\u0027s going on.\n * Enabled support for any file/folder to be copied/linked to. Currently only GameData is officially supported. If you make/import a saves folder inside each instance, they will also be tracked. ONLY DO THIS WHEN SYMLINKS ARE FUNCTIONING (sufficient privileges), OR ELSE YOU WILL DEFINITLY LOSE SAVES WHEN SWITCHING INSTANCES. This will hopefully be fixed in later versions.\n * Added ability to import any files or folders from the game. Select using the \u0022Select Items to Import\u0022 button. Use shift or control to select multiples. If you hover over it, you can see what items are currently selected. Seems to have issue with the KSP.exe and Launcher.exe.\n * Added support for converting old single file system to two file system\n * Added ability to autostart game after activating an instance. Wait until the main buttons come back before choosing \u0022yes\u0022 or \u0022always\u0022!\n\n-- 0.1.10 --\n * Switched to using symbolic links instead of copying during activation of instance. Saves time, space, and writes!\n * Added autodetection of Steam KSP for Linux (HOME/.steam/...)\n * Changed directory for instances to the DataSwitcher folder created in the same directory as the executable. If you want this to be a configurable parameter, let me know.\n * Added file chooser to the New Instance dialog for Game Path selection. Select the \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder (not GameData)!\n * Began adding a status indicator to the main window. Not totally functional yet. \n * Redid versioning. Major-Minor-BuildNumber\n * Copying and deleting is performed on a separate thread now. All buttons are disabled during file operations but the GUI won\u0027t lockup as much anymore when performing file operations.\n * Fixed issue with New Instance dialog in Linux not showing content.\n * Added tracking of the current used instance, which opens the door for save backups. As a result, the current instance is now displayed below the instance list.\n * Small changes to the GUI to widen the instance list and the current instance notifier. New instance is in the bottom left, delete is in the bottom right.\n * Fixed a bug with log.txt creation on first run due to the DataSwitcher folder not existing yet.\n\n-- 0.0.1.7 --\n * Added log.txt file which contains any text that is normally printed to the screen. Send me this along with any bug reports!\n * Added option to import an existing GameData folder from the Game Path\n * Added the version to the log.txt file on startup\n * Prevented creating two instances with identical names.\n\n-- 0.0.1.6 --\n * Initial release. Currently only supports multiple GameData folder instances.\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just recently discovered that you can have CKAN manage each instance independently by importing the CKAN folder along with the GameData folder.
