I think we can safely assume that KSP 1.1, whenever it comes out, will use Unity 5 and support 64bit. I think we can also assume that any intermediate versions will be 1.0.6 and maybe 1.0.7. I\u0027m not expecting an 1.0.8. I think it\u0027s also safe to assume that Squad is making very good progress with Unity 5. If I had to make a bet, I would say that we\u0027ll see this happening in the first half of 2016. If we\u0027re \\*very\\* lucky, not much longer than 1 year after KSP 1.0.0 came out. I think it\u0027s a realistic expectation.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So. Let\u0027s assume that 1.1 will be exactly 1 year after 1.0. Just as a working hypothesis. What will happen then on April 27, 2016 (hypothetical)? Users will start up an **official** 64bit KSP, and they will expect that their mods will work from Day Zero. Some minor glitches because of changes that Squad made, will be excusable. But if there is a mod that actively blocks (official) 64bit users, because they check for 64bit and they didn\u0027t have an update ready from Day Zero without the 64bit check, then there will be some people who will be rather unhappy. I predict that when there will be an official 64bit KSP, that this Unfixer tool will suddenly become very popular. Simply because some mods are low on maintenance, because of whatever reason. Which is normal, and understandable.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Before 64bit official, it\u0027s the users\u0027 problem.  \n\u003E \n\u003E After 64bit official, it\u0027s the modders\u0027 problem.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My two cents. Did I overlook anything?\n\u003E \n\nIn my opinion KSP 1.1 is going to be a mod-breaker: Unity 5, multi-threading, x64. It will be a massive update and it will take a while for the modders to implement a 1.1 release. My bet is... \u0022finger crossed\u0022 this tool will become irrelevant with a beautiful KSP x64! hype hype!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 27/1/2016 at 2:43 AM, Furious1964 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does this still work?

I got that too but it was a few months ago. If you are using Steam just verify the game cache. Back up your 64bit .exe and the mono.dll you used to get 64bit on KSP somewhere else so you only have to drag and drop those back in. In steam go to Library - Kerbal Space Program(right click) - Properties - local files - verify integrity of games cache. If you got the game some other way, just a fresh install should do.\n\nI left my original comment because I have yet to fix the problem and not yet willing to go in CKAN and write down all the mods I downloaded.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-24T23:02:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2016 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by farnayway**"},{"CreatedByName":"winged","CreatedById":143617,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T03:48:40Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tried this today, it works, thanks [@jrodriguez](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/130617-jrodriguez/)!"},{"CreatedByName":"FiiZzioN","CreatedById":108954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T16:18:14Z","Content":"Been using 64 bit with the unfixer for more than 6 months. ModuleManager is removed from the whitelist and that has resolved the nyan cat issue before. For some reason, out of the blue I might add, I restarted my game and the nyan cat has seem to reappear? KJR, Ferram, MM, RealChute, etc all seem to be working just fine, but the nyan cat has just started showing after 6 months of using this... quite odd.\n\nI tried unfixing just incase I hod forgotten that I had updated something, but there was noting to unfix. As stated, nothing has been changed for aver two weeks, and this has randomly appeared yet the plugins are still working... I have no idea what causes this, but I thought I\u0027d let you know.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-01T16:19:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2016 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FiiZzioN**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T16:20:37Z","Content":"[@FiiZzioN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/108954-fiizzion/) Nyancat appears for everyone using MM on April 1, 64-bit or not. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"}]}
