The unstable nature of x64 is such that it is almost impossible to determine whether an in-game bug is due to the stock game itself or from interactions with add-on plugins.\n\nHave things evolved since then? It works almost flawlessly for me... Though I do occasionally wonder, when minor issues occur (so far: tweakscale parts not correctly scaled, and RCSFX sometimes not responding properly to inputs, and of course mouse click issues as reported by other players), if it is due to the 64bit version or not.
