If this does not occur, you\u0027ll get an error message and nothing will happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) This is easily the most challenging GUI I\u0027ve ever built, on account of the fact that I have to build each of the components from scratch and there can be a variable number of components in the dialog.

I\u0027m not sure why, but basically it looks like the spacecraft was started inside Minmus (the body itself) but with the starting SoI set as Kerbin. This produced some wierdness that ultimately made MATLAB try to form an array a few hundred billion rows long. I\u0027ve added a check to prevent that from happening in the future (max number of states per propagation limited to 10000, normally it doesn\u0027t exceed 1000).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, I\u0027d prefer to keep the edit event dialogs model. I know it\u0027s a pain, but if the mission script gets out of sync with the dialog box, serious problems can ensue.
