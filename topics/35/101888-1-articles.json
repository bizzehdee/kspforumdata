I decided to do this app because I\u0027m using more than 17 mods like Realism Overhaul, RSS, Real Fuels,... and it is a bit painful to go one by one removing the compatibility checks in order to play x64. \n\nThis tool is not going to make you x64 more stable, but at least it will allow you to try all your mods without the x86 memory limitations.\n\nLast Release here:\n\n[https://github.com/jrodrigv/KSPx64TotalUnfixer/releases](https://github.com/jrodrigv/KSPx64TotalUnfixer/releases)\n\n**Changelog**\n\n**v2.2**\n\nModule Manager added to the White List\n\n**v2.1**\n\nContract Configurator mod added to the white list because it has specific support for x64.\n\n**v2.0**\n\nWhite List support for mods like GCMonitor\n\nBackup and Restore functionality (new extension \\*.unfixerbk)\n\nBetter UI to show the results of the unfixing process.\n\nNew method to unfix \u0022tough\u0022 code.\n\nKSPx64TotalUnfixer is in the public domain.\n\nLicense: [https://github.com/jrodrigv/KSPx64TotalUnfixer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/jrodrigv/KSPx64TotalUnfixer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\nKind Regards,\n\nJesus\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T09:13:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jrodriguez**\n  \nRelease V2.2 hotfix"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:59:49Z","Content":"Again ?
