Your appreciation means a lot to me, and help is always welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretically, there\u0027s no reason why it shouldn\u0027t work. Of course, make sure the game in which you\u0027re trying to edit the extracted ship has the mods already installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt one point, the Craft Extractor was taking some part data from the game database -which thereby excluded mod parts- but now it doesn\u0027t. It only looks at the parts in the ship, and attempts to put them back together as they were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of my last testing, the only ships it seemed to have a problem with were multiple ships that were assembled(docked) in flight - I think because they have more than one root part. Even then the entire structure seemed intact, but the player could not interact with any parts in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I don\u0027t use mod parts, I haven\u0027t done much testing with them. However, if you want to send me your .sfs file, I\u0027d be happy to take a look and see if there\u0027s something obvious to tweak. Even if there isn\u0027t much demand for such a tool, we may as well make it the best it can be. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T20:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ezriilc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ezriilc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...make sure the game in which you\u0027re trying to edit the extracted ship has the mods already installed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood point!
