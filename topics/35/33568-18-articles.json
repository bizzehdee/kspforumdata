Thanks for using KSP TOT. I could, but it would probably take me a while. Might be faster for you to simply post what questions you have and I can answer them that way. It should be a fairly straightforward application to use: select your starting body, your fly-by body, and your arrival body, along with the time range you want to look at fly-bys over, and push go. Go get a cup of coffee or something, it usually takes a few minutes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tavert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tavert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat question reduces to, can you formulate the problem in such a way that the objective function and constraints are differentiable? Logic and switching could make that rather complicated, but it depends on the specifics of the objective and constraint functions. If you can write Matlab code to evaluate them in the first place, then you should have enough information for an automatic differentiation library to do the rest of the work. It\u0027s not something I would try to do symbolically, I would use an AD library. For C\u002B\u002B ADOL-C and CppAD are very good, I\u0027m not so sure if there are any good open-source tools for doing the same thing entirely within Matlab.
