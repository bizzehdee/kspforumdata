The Delta-V calculator, also, I\u0027m considering setting the calculators up for the option to read data directly off your computer to make the process quicker. It would have the ability to read the ship files that you have and tell you the information about them such as each stages delta-v, weight, and thrust to lift ratio. That section is still a conceptual thing right now though but please let me know if that\u0027s something that would interest you. The other project I\u0027m working on is creating a custom GUI for the DMPServer.exe which if I can get it to work will reduce the knowledge necessary to run your own server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESloth\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mastereryx","CreatedById":114152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T18:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V Calculator is now on the calculator site also, there are other useful calculators that have been added.
