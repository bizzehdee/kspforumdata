There will also be a landing probe on Duna itself. Is there a way to coordinate all of that through KSPTOT, and if so, how?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is definitely doable with KSPTOT. Based only on a single mission I\u0027ve planned to Duna that successfully inserted into a pre-planned polar mapping orbit (no Ike flyby), you have two options once you plot a trajectry from Kerbin to Duna polar orbit (see the included Kerbin-\u0026gt;Laythe tutorial which outlines the same steps):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFinagle the departure time from Kerbin to reach Duna at an appropriate time for an Ike intercept\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInsert a mid-course correction burn while in Kerbolar orbit to adjust your trajectory to intercept Ike\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure which would be easier to work out or better for efficiency. But anyways after doing the initial trajectory switch to the event view where you hit Duna periapsis and click the options to show child bodies so you can see Ike\u0027s position at that time. You want it to be somewhere close to directly behind Duna along your SOI entry trajectory so you can adjust course a bit to travel higher over Duna and hit its SOI. Then use the optimizer to search for a periapsis event within Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGaaahhh maybe that was a crappy explanation but bottom line is its totally possible and if you really can\u0027t figure it out I could prob work up a simple example...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T05:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222305571\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002233568\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449111621\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaiiden\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Gaiiden said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is definitely doable with KSPTOT.
