Thanks for the suggestion! I\u0027ll look into it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I decided to work on something a bit different tonight. As some here know, I am professional astrodynamicist for a major provider of commercial communications spacecraft. While planning maneuvers in the transfer orbit phase of the mission, we generate what are called \u0022maneuver messages\u0022 which are used to tell the mission team and the spacecraft how to perform a particular type of maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to do something similar in KSP TOT. I thus present a new feature, \u0022Reports.\u0022 Reports will eventually be generated from each of the main applications embedded within KSP TOT and generate predefined data (usually a subset of what\u0027s shown in the application itself) that is to be used for executing a maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight I created the general GUI and implemented Reports for the ballistic transfer application (the Compute Departure button the main GUI).

The middle section will always contain two text blocks and two image blocks, which the application will fill in or not as needed. A notes block that users can fill in with notes is also included. Finally, the footer block is for role-playing. If you\u0027re pretending to be in a mission control environment, then typically various people would be responsible for generating the report/maneuver message, checking and approving it, executing it, and observing the execution (this is how we do it in the Real World). I\u0027ve included this in case anyone wants to get a group together and do things a bit more formally. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe report is designed to be printed, which is why you seen a printer icon in the upper left.

There\u0027s no reason I couldn\u0027t (MATLAB can actually do it easily enough), but I\u0027m not sure it would actually add any value. What I really need to do is figure out how to get MATLAB to render true type fonts, which doesn\u0027t seem to work too well.

I\u0027ve been working on getting reports implemented for the other \u0022applications\u0022 within KSP TOT. Tonight I\u0027ve completed the 2 burn orbit change and the (new!) rendezvous module reports. This just leaves the flyby maneuver sequencer. The maneuver execution assistant (also new) may or may not get a report.

It sounds like a fun challenge for this weekend lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Lots of people have been asking about the ability to save the location where SFS files are retrieved from when pulling orbits from them. I\u0027ve been refactoring code to make that much easier and something like this should land in 0.11 (if I don\u0027t just up and do it for 0.10).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Probably some more bug fixes as well. 0.10 has two good fixes and I\u0027m looking forward to finding more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen question to the KSP TOT community: what else do you guys want to see that we haven\u0027t already discussed? If, after 0.11, I run out of ideas, I\u0027ll probably take this to the v1.0 level. But you guys use the tool, so suggestions are always welcome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pina_coladas","CreatedById":9346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T00:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll second the maximum total flight time suggestion - sometimes I don\u0027t want to wait a year to get to jool.
