It is necessary so that the site can subscribe the the data via Telemachus Websocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit is my first html5/javascript project, so there will be bugs. I\u0027m pretty sure my code is not optimized and should not be used as an example on how to make a proper website. I just wanted it to work. The site might be a bit slow on older computers, adjust the connection rate if it seems to be to heavy, because it uses quite a lot of variables and has to draw many things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnection Rates lower than 100 or 150ms can result in strange camera shaking in KSP. It is a bug of Telemachus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe prograde and retrograde markers might be off under circumstances I haven\u0027t encountered so far. I use the change in longitude and latitude to calculate the heading and the horizontal and vertical speed to calculate pitch. I haven\u0027t found a way to calculate it based on the orbital parameters, which would be better. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also haven\u0027t found a way to calculate target position, so right now I can\u0027t show target markers. That would require even more fancy orbital calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the current usage of resources, like liquid fuel and so on seems to be broken as well in Telemachus. So I calculate it on my own. When the game is paused, you don\u0027t get usefull readings, same with pro and retrograde markers. Currently it only works when the game is running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe orbit display might show the wrong orbit, if the orbit is hyperbolic (escape orbit), I\u0027ll try to fix it as soon as possible.

Look at KSPTOT to see what I mean. I personally think you can get no better Trajectory Optimization tool than KSPTOT and it even pulls data from and sends data to MechJeb but CKAN won\u0027t host it since it\u0027s a MATLAB program techincally. As such, I do not believe this one will get on there either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo rob3110 - I just recently started using Telemachus since it finally is working properly again and this looks to be a much better interface.
