I thought that the licences are connected to the GGJ accounts, but Sarbian tried the link yesterday, and it\u0027s not connected. Anyone can take the licence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the link you should follow: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://unity3d.com/gamejams/ggj2014?utm_source=Twitter\u0026amp;utm_medium=social\u0026amp;utm_campaign=ggj14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://unity3d.com/gamejams/ggj2014?utm_source=Twitter\u0026amp;utm_medium=social\u0026amp;utm_campaign=ggj14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis GGJ trial is NOT connected to the 30-day trial that Unity normally offers, you can still use the official trial after 9th February.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd disclaimer for moderators: I hope I don\u0027t get punished for posting this, this is not a commercial, just a chance for everyone to try Unity Pro for a few more days. GGJ is officially supported by Unity. And KSP is already using the same software.
