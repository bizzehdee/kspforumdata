{"TopicId":117693,"ForumId":35,"TopicTitle":"KSP 1.0.x Complete Printable Stock Science Checklists","CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:20:45Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:20:45Z","Content":"I\u0027ve now updated the old [0.90 printable checklists](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/100999-ksp-090-complete-printable-science-checklist-updated-06-mar-2015/) for KSP 1.0.x.\n\nSince many experiments need to be performed twice to get 95% (or so) of the available science, those experiments that need it have space to check them off twice. Each planet/moon gets a sheet to itself (except Kerbin/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, which needs 4 all told) and is designed to be printed on a single page for ease of use. Each sheet also has some space for notes, which comes in especially handy for planning science-mop-up missions.\n\nThe zip contains 3 identical versions of the checklist, in .ods, .xls and .xlsx formats.\n\nChanges from the previous version are:\n\nThe *Sensor Array Computing Nose Cone* has had its instruments removed and been renamed to the *CH-J3 Fly-By-Wire Avionics Hub*. The instrument package it used to contain is now a separate device, known as the *Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer*. Accordingly, \u0022Sensor Array\u0022 in the checklists has been changed to \u0022Atmosphere Analysis\u0022.\n\nThe Barometer can now be used on the surface, and even in low and high space, in all biomes, on all bodies, regardless of whether they have an atmosphere or not. The checklists have been modified accordingly.\n\nI\u0027m still not entirely certain if I have things totally correct for all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E special biomes. If anyone spots any errors or omissions, please let me know.\n\nThe zip file can be downloaded from:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/rrb117aiuhubmb4e0fehtx12e9odp57a](https://app.box.com/s/rrb117aiuhubmb4e0fehtx12e9odp57a)\n\nIf the above link isn\u0027t working, it means my monthly bandwidth limit with box.com has been exceeded.
