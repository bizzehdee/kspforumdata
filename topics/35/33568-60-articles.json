Though I\u0027m a bit surprised to learn determining the Sun location would be expensive, I\u0027d have guessed it could be done with just some reuse of the functions required for computing longitude on the rotating body and right ascension of Sun. However, looking at some raw data (not yet able to conduct extensive thermal data collection on all atmospheric bodies in KSP) I have to concur about the reasonable approximation even leaving the diurnal variation factor out. Temperature diurnal excursion seems to be marked (~ 30-40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C) only at very high altitudes, where density is low enough that its change would minimally affect drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the old .mat files format (being not compatible with the new 1.5.0 MA), hope you may soon release newer example mission files also.
