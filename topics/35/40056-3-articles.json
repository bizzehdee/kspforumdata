In some of the models, such as this fuel tank, for some reason the texture has an area where it is transparent. This transparent area leads to it rendering out pitch black. If you apply the texture in a decal fashion with an underlying colour on the entire model, then the black areas will be coloured according to the underlying colour. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning the black areas i recommend not to use the shaders used by the Blender importer. Use the Blender shaders themselves, instead of those of the importer. To correct the black areas, delete the material that comes with the part, create a new material, go to textures menu and create a new one. Apply the texture \u0022image or movie\u0022 and select the used image to \u0022model000\u0022 or whatever is the name of the tank texture. In texture box select the UV map used by the part. Don\u0027t use tha alpha maps in the part! (Go to \u0022image\u0022 and uncheck \u0022Use Alpha\u0022 Checker box).
