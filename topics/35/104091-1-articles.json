PLUS, when you\u0027re trying to pick a landing spot on the Mun, who the hell wants to:\n\n - Jump to the Spaaace Center\n\n- Jump to R\u0026D\n\n- Click around a bit, decide on a biome\n\n- Jump back to your spacecraft\n\n- Figure out if you can easily land in any of those biomes (\u0022Wait, crap, was it East, Farside, or East Farside? Bloody hell, back to R\u0026D!\u0022)\n\n**With parseScience.pl you can easily generate:**\n\n- A full list of all science in the known universe\n\n- Excel and CSV formats\n\n- Sort by biome, what you have left, or have accomplished\n\n- Summary statistics by planet/moon, test, and condition (flyingHigh, etc.)\n\n**Requires:**\n\n*Perl* - Comes bundled with OS X and Linux, Windows users will need [Strawberry perl](http://strawberryperl.com/)\n\n*Excel::Writer::XLSX* - Only if you want an Excel file output. Install it via \u0022*cpan Excel::Writer::XLSX*\u0022 in the terminal, or get it from [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Excel-Writer-XLSX-0.78/lib/Excel/Writer/XLSX.pm) or [GitHub](https://github.com/jmcnamara/excel-writer-xlsx)\n\nYou can find a full rundown of features at the Readme on [Github](https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp), but in short, just run the script with a local copy of ScienceDefs.cfg and persistent.sfs and you\u0027re good to go. You can easily set the location of your KSP folder and save file, though, so there\u0027s no need for local copies. There are plenty of options, including scansat integration, defining a personal config file, extra data, and more.\n\nProject page on GitHub: [Amorymeltzer/ksp](https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp)\n\nLatest release: [https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp/releases/latest](https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp/releases/latest)\n\n**Direct download**: [Version 0.97.3](https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp/archive/v0.97.3.zip)\n\nLicense: [BSD 2-clause](https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n**Note**\n\n- Perl is a hobby and is by no means my profession so I will do my best to fix any bugs or errors you may find, either here or on GitHub. Pull requests welcome!\n\n- SCANsat is the only non-stock mod I use, but I am willing to add others if people would like.\n\n- I use an old Mac, don\u0027t use steam, and my only access to Windows or Linux are VMs of XP and Ubuntu, which is to say **the default KSP locations are probably lacking**. I have no idea where most people keep their KSP folder, so **please tell me** and I will update this with those in mind.\n\n- There are a few other scripts in the GitHub repository, feel free to have fun with those.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T02:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by amorymeltzer**\n  \ntweak title"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:16:27Z","Content":"Should be good to go for KSP 1.0!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T11:05:26Z","Content":"Nice work mate, appreciated"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:30:38Z","Content":"[New version (0.97.1)](https://github.com/Amorymeltzer/ksp/releases/tag/v0.97.1) includes:\n\n- Biome sorting\n\n- Report a matrix of planet/moon versus condition or test\n\n- Ignore pesky asteroids!\n\n- Fixes for Tylo MajorCrater biomes\n\n- Fix TrackingStationDishSouth biome"},{"CreatedByName":"oab2","CreatedById":151584,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T01:37:36Z","Content":"Is this working with 1.0.4? When I run the script it spits out a excel file but it says I have not gotten any science from any place.\n\nI am running this on linux mint, copy the win persistent.sfs file over and run the script. So in a temp folder I have: persistent.sfs, parsescience.pl, sciencedefs.cfg. I then run the parsescience.pl script in terminal and it spits out the correct file but it shows I have not found any science.\n\nAs far as KSP mods: mechjeb, kerbal engineer, Alarm clock and docking indicator."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T13:22:24Z","Content":"Hey oab2, sorry it\u0027s not running right! It should work just fine on 1.0.4 so can you upload your files so I can take a look at what might be happening? At the very least I\u0027d like to check your persistent.sfs and ScienceDefs.cfg, but it wouldn\u0027t hurt to have the others as well.
