This is due to  eliminating the use of fzero() for both elliptical and hyperbolic cases.

This is basically a Mass-only Set State: you tell it what your post staging dry mass, fuel/ox mass, etc masses are and it sets them for you. Useful for when you\u0027re dropping partially used stages, and very complementary to the existing MASS_DUMP event.\n[*]Added commentary to the bodies.ini file.\n[*]Added the KSP v1.0 atmospheric model to KSP TOT Mission Architect.\n[*]Some performance optimizations related to the redo/undo menu and its backend data.\n[*]Four new DV maneuver types, all of which use spherical coordinates. Spherical coordinates use an azimuth (angle in a plane) and elevation (angle out of the plane) and DV magnitude to define the maneuver. There are inertial and orbit impulse maneuver types as well as inertial and orbit finite burn duration maneuver types. The best use for these new types to allow you to specify the min and maximum delta-v magnitude for the optimizer.\n[*]Resolved an issue where the GUI would rapidly slow down after running the optimizer multiple times. This issue was around since v1.0.0 but was exasperated by v1.4.0. The actual root cause of the issue is probably a bug in MATLAB\u0027s memory management, but I actually like the fix better than the old way I was doing things, so I\u0027m going to keep it permanent.\n[*]Resolved an issue where variables not marked for optimization in a burn (or any multi-variable event) would get changed by the optimizer.\n[*]\u0022Re-optimize Mission\u0022 in the Mission Architect Optimization menu now actually serves a purpose and is useful.

Btw, I\u0027m assuming that the delta-v provided is for the full round trip: departing one place and arriving at another. If I just use the departure dv, that could make things a bit optimistic in some cases. Do you guys have any thoughts on this? Which delta-v (the departure \u002B arrival delta-v or just the departure delta-v) would be more intuitive for you?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also going to rewrite the Lambert solver at some point using the code I gave to R4m0n for MechJeb (yep, that\u0027s my Lambert solver) as a base. The current solver I have now is fine, but it seems to die at odd times and I\u0027m sick of troubleshooting it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the great suggestions/ideas, guys.
