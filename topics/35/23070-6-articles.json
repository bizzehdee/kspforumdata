Makes selection difficult. But, I\u0027ve noticed the fairing factory parts also have this issue. At first, I thought it was the lack of a mesh, but now I\u0027m pretty sure it has something to do with linking with KSP/Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*sigh* Actually, what I just said with linking is probably also false. If anyone knows how to make a part glow green for selection purposes, please let me know. I\u0027m thinking it needs to go through Unity, using PartTools, but, I can\u0027t find any set of easy instructions to do this, and frankly, the Unity interface sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T09:33:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 09:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tek_604\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited because I wanted to sigh.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mic_e","CreatedById":60757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T22:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, have you considered putting this awesome tool on Github or some other source-code hosting platform?
