The problem you\u0027re running into is that Constraints aren\u0027t the best way to direct the optimizer to what you want to achieve. In general, optimizers like this will have Constraints, which must not be violated, and an Objective Function, which should be minimized or maximized as much as the optimizer can manage. Solutions can be characterized as \u0022feasible\u0022 or \u0022infeasible\u0022, depending on whether the Constraints have been met. The MA optimizer has a hard time working if the starting point is infeasible, particularly Central Body constraints, which is what you\u0027ve arranged. Think of the constraints as the edges of the playing field, and Objective Function as the direction you\u0027d like to move on the field. If it starts way off the field, the optimizer has a hard time finding the field. Once it\u0027s on the field, it can push things around towards your goal.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003EIn this case, a better approach is to set the Objective Function to \u0022Minimize Distance to Body\u0022, set the Applicable Event to \u0022Event 4: Coast\u0022, and the Applicable Body to \u0022Eve\u0022. Remove the Central Body constraint, and hit \u0022Optimize Mission\u0022. It\u0027ll think for awhile, and should eventually come up with a solution that crashes straight into Eve.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got a solution that crashes into Eve, add an \u0022Altitude of Periapsis\u0022 constraint of 100km (just above Eve\u0027s atmosphere), and a Central Body constraint for Eve, then rerun the optimizer. That\u0027ll get you a fly-by that doesn\u0027t crash into Eve, but probably isn\u0027t anywhere near the inclination that you want.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003EThe Central Body constraint is most useful for when you\u0027ve already got a solution that reaches Eve, and are trying to adjust the inclination, which is the next step. Add a Central Body constraint to prevent the optimizer from moving outside of Eve\u0027s Sphere or Influence. Look at the Event Information for Event 4, and you should see an Inclination, it may be larger or smaller than your desired inclination. Add an Inclination constraint that goes from the current inclination to your desired inclination. Change the Objective Function to either Minimize Inclination or Maximize Inclination depending on which direction it needs to move, and run.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003E-bk2w\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartan_MiniMe","CreatedById":121855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn average, how many iteration should the computation take?

My suggestion is to stop the optimizer and accept its solution. Once you\u0027re back to the MA window, take a look at the variables that you\u0027ve enabled for optimization in Event 2 and Event 3. In general, I try to have no more then 5 variables being optimized at a time; since this is such a short mission, you\u0027ve got no more than 4 variables total. Most likely one of your variables is near a limit. MA may even be telling you in the status pane at the lower right that some variables are near their optimization limits. You\u0027ll need to find them and increase the limits to give the optimizer some more room to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-bk2w\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T21:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats Arrowstar happy to hear the NASA shot panned out for you.
