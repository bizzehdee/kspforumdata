It is very slick; I\u0027ll let you know how use goes. I did notice one thing: the \u0022launch this installation\u0022 button at the top of the interface launches the x64 version. Is there a way to make it default to the x86 version?\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Another feedback. Jebretary doesn\u0027t really work at all with Kerbal Construction Time, maybe because the launch button is not the default KSP launch button. I had two crafts that I built, hit the save button in the VAB and not only did they not show up in Jebretary, they weren\u0027t saved at all in my saves directory. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s Jebretary\u0027s issue or an issue with KCT. I\u0027ll have to test more to find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: It\u0027s Jebretary that\u0027s preventing my ships from saving. Ran KSP without it and they saved fine. I\u0027m sure this is ultimately a conflict with KCT; just thought you should be aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes currently if there are both x64 and x86 .exe\u0027s it will choose the x64 in preference. (I will add a setting option for each install so you can set which one you want).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not used KCT (infact, I\u0027d not heard of it before now) but from looking at what it does I think that it would cause a problem for Jebretary. Jebretary assumes that a craft will be written to when you hit save and then waits for there to be a chnage in the persistent file (signifying a launch) before commiting the craft. I guess that KCT affects that process so is confusing Jebretary. I can\u0027t understand why Jebretary would be preventing a craft from saving thou, it doesn\u0027t lock the directory or anything, infact all the craft checking actions are handed off to git, which is an industry standard tool so I don\u0027t think its likely to be cause that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried using Jebretary without KCT and seeing what it does? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shall get KCT and have a look at what it does.
