I noticed that when I add some extra lines in the part.cfg file, it suddenly works. So now I am rewriting my program to add these lines to every part.cfg file as it won\u0027t hurt to have them added. However, christmas and 0.23 are delaying the progress a bit.

Please try to run it outside the cmd and check if the App creates a .log file and a \u0027data\u0027 folder.

There are plenty of unsolved bugs which I can\u0027t seem to solve. Therefore, I decided to write a different way of searching and I will recheck with KMP how to correctly name the parts with spaces etc. I will also include a fail-proof option to scan and add parts. This option will act as the V1.0 KMP Mod Builder. It will search through the KSP log files. Downside is, however, that you have zero control of the mods you want to add as it will include every part that you have loaded into KSP and you have to run KSP at least once before you can use this option. However, it works without any glitches as far as I can tell. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got some other (building a table with laptop implemented) projects I am working on as I have a few days off. Probably finishing the new version next week. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Just remembered, sometimes the app doesn\u0027t scan all the Squad parts correctly as well (it is kinda random for me) and I hardcoded some parts but it\u0027s possible I missed some. So it might be Squad being the prohibited parts instead of KAS. But please hang on until I release the new version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
