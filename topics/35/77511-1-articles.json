All you have to do is enter the URL to the mod webpage, and TinkerTime will do the rest of the work for you. Alternatively, you can add local mod zips. Tinker Time will even manage Module Manager for you, providing the latest bleeding-edge builds directly from sarbian! In addition to this, TinkerTime now has full support for multiple KSP installations, and can switch between them on the fly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ewJpMzk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ewJpMzk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownloads\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://andrewohara.io/TinkerTime/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://andrewohara.io/TinkerTime/\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/243\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/243\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/oharaandrew314/TinkerTime/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/oharaandrew314/TinkerTime/releases\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWiki\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the Tinker Time Wiki \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/oharaandrew314/TinkerTime/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/oharaandrew314/TinkerTime/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T01:19:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by oharaandrew314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdate for 2.0\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T01:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is great!
