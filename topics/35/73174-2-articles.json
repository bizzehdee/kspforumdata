The chart below shows what the lowest delta-V path is from Kerbin to Duna on a given day during the first synodic period between Kerbin and Duna.

In this path you go less than 1 orbit around the sun during the trip from Kerbin to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK-E-D flies by Eve on the way to Duna. This repeats roughly every 170 days- the synodic period between Kerbin and Eve. This is because Eve has the gravity to throw your ship to Duna wherever it may be, however the shape and magnitudes of the trip vary a lot from window to window. The windows have finite width, unlike the K-D windows which are continuous. For long periods you can\u0027t fly K-E-D for any starting dV. (Well, without a big thrust at Eve, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-1-0-Flyby-Porkchop-Plotter!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETOT\u003C/a\u003E can find those paths for you.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK-E-K-D flies by Eve and Kerbin on the way to Duna. This repeats very roughly every 170 days and varies a lot from window to window. Same comments as K-E-D.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK-D 2 Orbits flies directly from Kerbin to Duna, but goes around the sun twice during the transfer. So the first time it crosses Duna\u0027s orbit Duna is not there then it coasts back to where it left Kerbin\u0027s orbit (but Kerbin is not there anymore) and then goes on to intercept Duna. This dark red line repeats every 227 days and has roughly the same shape as the bright red line, it just has a longer minimum travel time, in this case around 240 days instead of the 66 days that a less-than-1-orbit transfer has. I see there are times where it has both a lower dV and a shorter travel time than the other options and so would be the best path by either standard, assuming you had to leave Kerbin on a particular day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to how this affects Flyby Finder. FF only searches for single orbit solutions, it does not use what is known as a multi-orbit Lambert algorithm, so from one encounter to the next you can\u0027t go more than once around the sun. (For a whole flight with many encounters you can end up going many times around the sun.) Why not? First consider this- If you are willing to go 3 orbits around the sun when going from Kerbin directly to Duna then there is another line that would have the same shape as the K-D one orbit line, but its minimum dV would be located at the 177 days departure date and have a value of 1067 m/s and a minimum trip time of 366 days. If you are willing to go 4 orbits then there is yet another line, this one centered around 116 days and around 500 days long. And so on. If you are willing to travel long enough then it is possible to get directly from Kerbin to Duna for less than 1100 m/s when leaving on any day! This sort of defeats the whole purpose of a pork chop plotter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now, if FF was to look for multi-orbit paths it would probably be best to do it for every step. So for instance for the Kerbin-Eve leg there are 1 orbit, 2-orbit, 3-orbit etc. solutions, then for the Eve-Duna leg there are another infinite series of solutions. One can decide to look no more than, say, 2 orbits, but then with K-E-D there would still be 4 solutions to pick from, and with K-E-K-D there would be 8 solutions to pick from. It would take much longer to find and check them all for the lowest-dV or shortest one. The total travel times would usually be much longer. So I have elected not to have FF search for multi-orbit solutions at this time, though I bet there are some great ones....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-18T16:32:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2014 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PLAD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T18:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PLAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PLAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomething that has been weighing on me lately is that Flyby Finder does not find multi-orbit solutions in its searchs. ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you explained that very well and I am in agreement with your points. I had not proposed anything like multi-orbit searches, but sure that would be useful if done within some limits. If different orbits have comparable solutions in terms of required Total Delta-V and Total Flight Time, I would certainly like the possibility to have them shown together, would help choosing when and how to make a mission. The best I can do currently is to figure myself what kind of orbits may do the job and have FF or KSPTOT find solutions for each one, than put the best solutions from all different orbits together by hand (in a sort of agenda of launch opportunities). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, in particular for manned missions, I never like trips that take too long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that, with reference to the Kerbin-Duna transfer, I want to arrive on Duna using the least DV possible the earliest as possible: as the synodic period is 227days and the best transfer time 66 days, I can\u0027t have to wait longer than 227\u002B66= 293 days to arrive; then, any orbit that takes more than 293 days is not of interest. Actually, I would also discard orbits taking longer then the time left to arrive on Duna (taking in account the current day, so to know how long it is before the optimal window for direct transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith other planets, the situation may be somewhat different. If I want to arrive on Eeloo, there may be a lot of different trips to consider, most using less DV (thanks to grav assists) than a direct transfer. And quite possibly some of those trips may also take less time. In that case, I may be fine with waiting that \u0022perfect alignment\u0022 so to use Eve, Kerbin and Jool as waypoints, even if it takes years to come (while the direct transfer window, not counting the eccentricity of Eeloo, represents every 113 days). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my rule of thumb is to use the most massive planets as waypoints, and see what solutions they give: if the trip duration is acceptable (not too longer than the direct transfer), that trip is useful and the relative windows get into the agenda. Other trips may be even better (e.g. K-E-K-E-K-J-Eeloo ?) but what tool is able to find solutions with 7 different passages? So, there is another limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all those limits are to be observed (let say: no more than 5 passages; no more DV required than a direct transfer; flight time not much greater than direct transfer; and total time to arrival no greater than what would be required for direct transfer, unless of very significant gain in DV) than probably a logic could be built for a tool that implements multi-orbit searches. However, it would be a lot of work and require refinements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowstar","CreatedById":2521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T05:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

Arrowstar: yes, MFMS does find one best solution (as DV minimum) in the range of dates/Flight Times allowed (never tried MFMS with more than 5 bodies before, excellent). Actually, the K-E-K-E-K-J-Eeloo was just one example of a more complex trip that a multi-orbit searcher could consider. Those different trips are useful to check in case they provide feasible solutions at different dates than the direct transfer window does. Manually finding solutions for all possible multiple-bodies combinations and all possible dates of interest is part of the problem, where a multi-orbit searcher may come to help if feasible. Those solutions you showed are very interesting to demonstrate how good MFMS actually is, but then I have to see if those solutions may come useful instead of using a direct transfer. In this case (sorry but didn\u0027t use Flyby finder, as it can\u0027t provide solutions for direct transfers) I used KSP TOT to find a very good solution for direct K-Eeloo transfer (not shown, but arrival DV = 1,81 0Km/s, for a total DV of 3,88 Km/s, and Total Flight time of 469 Earth days):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aFZrtf9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aFZrtf9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared with your first solution, the direct transfer uses less DV and much less time; with the second solution, about 880 m/s more DV but still much less time. The K-E-K-E-K-J-Eeloo was just one example of more complex trips, but in these cases they don\u0027t fit my requirements: I would still prefer to use the direct transfer instead (of course, such solutions may still be of interest to find other dates for departures than the windows for direct transfers). What would really be useful (but, I reckon horribly complex) would be a tool able to automatically find those different trips , but show only the ones really useful. I am certainly going to use MFMS to find some of those, though it takes time and I may miss some (as, I must actually state what waypoints to consider, while a multiple-orbit searcher should try all the feasible ones automatically). That is where another tool, showing how different trips compare in Flight Time and DV expended over a wide range of dates, would come useful if it was possible (a very serious problem for what I could see, could be possible but very complex). Was this quest limited to find the single best solution with a specific trip, MFMS is certainly the tool to use. Checking how different trips compare over a wide range of dates, it would require to plot the minimum DV and Flight Time with any trip - a problem you teached me is very difficult to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T21:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting exercise. First let me say that being able to calculate a 7-waypoint mission is impressive. However I\u0027ve found making more than one K-E-K run is not useful, since to go K-E-K-E you have to lose energy to go back to Eve from Kerbin, since if you go outward after the 2nd K your periapsis will be too high to get back to Eve. In fact on this K-E-K-E-K-J-Ee mission the first K-E is unnecessary, see the pictures below.

The cheapest way to get to Eeloo or Dres is via Jool because it is closer, energy-wise, than any other planet to them. The problem is that if you arrive at Jool from the inner system you have a lot of excess speed relative to Jool, but to get to Eeloo or Dres the lowest-dV way possible you need to leave Jool with a lot less speed.

I\u0027ve hit a wall in writing something that works AND is still reasonably fast. The problem is that there are many possible ways to do a double flyby. There are 2 key parameters- how many orbits does the planet make between the flybys, and how many orbits does the ship make between flybys. In doing experiments with the Lambert spreadsheet I found that useful flights could be found where those numbers were as high as 5 and 5, and the algorithm I have in mind needs to search 19 of those 25 possibilities, where for a standard flyby it would only search one. Ugh! So I\u0027ve been playing the game a while and using v0.50 to see what is most useful and what needs to be improved, and hoping for a revelation. Then I got to noticing that it would be really nice to allow multi-orbit flybys with at least 2 orbits in between since this would double the stuff you would find, and deep-space maneuvers dramatically improve your solution field but I can\u0027t think of an algorithm for that! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m in a bit of a funk right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should release version 6 soon, but it won\u0027t have double-flyby.
