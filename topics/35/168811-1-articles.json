At this stage, I\u0027m not even sure how much we _can_ throw this processing into the background, It\u0027s all pretty pie-in-the-sky at this stage. What I\u0027m thinking is that with the progressive version, when you select a mod for installation, there may be a period of time when a mod that conflicts with what you just selected or one of its dependencies remains available for selection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
