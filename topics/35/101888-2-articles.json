I have used KSP with x86 \u002B openGl \u002B the popupwindow addition and was able to play with most of my desired mods. The only reason for this is that I have 4 GB VRAM on my Graphic Card. Still I could not use all the wanted mods because it slowed down the game to much or crashed while loading due to reaching the 4 GB VRAM. Furthermore it looked ugly although I used all the surounding tricks like Nvidia Inspector and stuff like that. \n\nThe only reason I did not use x64 was a couple of mods that were blocked but at the same time essential for my fun. Thanks to you I now play with all my mods (147 folders in gamedata), beautiful graphics (for KSP at least), stable (ON MY COMPUTER) for hours and with so much more fun.\n\n@modders and other complaining guys\n\nI fully respect and understand your opinion and decission to block your mods for x64. There are just too many kids out there which are too lazy to narrow down an issue or even think about where a problem might come from. \n\nI have absolutley no clue how to recompile a .dll but STILL I know when and where to report an issue with a mod. That is, if at all, after I tried the mod on my heavy modded x86 KSP version, on a vanilla KSP version after exchanging different mods etc. Usually I will test for hours before writing in the forum (As you see I don\u0027t have much posts! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) to do a report. So please do not judge everyone due to some misbehaving lazy kids.\n\nLast but not least my x86 version used to crash after 4-6 scene changes while my x64 version has not rashed even once so far.\n\nSo once again thx jrodriguez.\n\nCheers\n\n(Please excuse my bad english)"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T20:30:09Z","Content":"Question: If I still see Nyan cat, does that mean the unfixer did not work?"},{"CreatedByName":"JohnWildman","CreatedById":133657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T01:31:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Question: If I still see Nyan cat, does that mean the unfixer did not work?\n\nWhat do you mean by Nyan Cat?
