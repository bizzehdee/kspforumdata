It also does pork-chop plots. It only finds ballistic trajectories, that is, ones where you do one major boost when leaving your start planet and then coast past all other planets you encounter (allowing for small course corrections). Real world examples of this are Pioneer 11, Voyager 1\u0026amp;2, and the New Horizons Pluto probe. I also use it for planning opposition-class missions to Mars. It does not handle deep space maneuvers or multiple flybys of one planet, like the Mercury Messenger probe or Galileo or Cassini.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tested it with up to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E version 12.0 used on KSP 1.2.2.

It doesn\u0027t warn you of the error if you do enter a planet twice in a row, and the output will be wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) There is limited input checking- make sure to only enter decimal numbers in the input fields! The program just refuses to do the search if bad entries are made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) If the initial departure orbit shows an inclination of exactly 90 or -90 degrees then the departure equatorial prograde and departure vZ values will be wrong. Okder\u0027s addon (mentioned below) gets around this! High-inclination transfer orbits are very tricky to fly in any case, I try to avoid them if I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Paths that fly by gas giants more than 3 times get clumpy. (See FFRSS guide for example.)My problem is that setting precision parameters good for Mercury makes them bad for the big outer planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) When doing searches with more than 3 bodies the program sometimes stops updating the screen (though it is still working and will finish the search eventually). The problem is that I don\u0027t have it update the screen when it is deep in nested loops since it could be a big hit to run time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) The new \u0022Search steps per period\u0022 (SSPP) feature is handy, but remember that increasing it by a factor of 2 increases the run time by 4x. It is also best to keep (Search Period/SSPP) higher than 12 hours or so or it slows down even more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the links. I\u0027d call 0.85 a beta version. 0.85 has only one change from V0.83- a pair of radio buttons have been added to select between Earth\u0027s SMA from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E Version 12.0\u002B (default) or Earth\u0027s SMA from all older versions.

To Carlo and anyone else getting lots of blank screens, it\u0027s not easy to find that first window, most of the time there is no path between the selected planets at the selected times.

I\u0027ve got to figure out how to be auto-notified when something is posted here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth-Venus-Jupiter is a very difficult trajectory. To get from Venus to Jupiter requires a V infinity at Venus of about 11500m/s, which is about 17000m/s at 200km above Venus. At this speed Venus can only bend your path a few degrees, in essence you are making a high-speed shot from Earth to Jupiter that passes close by Venus on the way. Because of orbital inclinations there are only some very small points in their orbits that all three planets have to be at where this will work. Here\u0027s a sample of this rare alignment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanet Earliest Search Date Search Period\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth 2250 150\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus 2315 200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter 2800 2000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV at SOI max: \u003Cstrong\u003E16000\u003C/strong\u003E m/s (!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe V at SOI is so high because you are shooting at a high angle inward from Earth\u0027s direction of orbital motion to pass by Venus in the right spot. Notice the two arrival times, in one you hit Jupiter flying outward from the Sun, in the other you go way out pass Jupiter and then catch it coming back in towards the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In real life this path would never be used but paths that fly by either Earth twice or Venus twice could be used. I\u0027ve looked for Earth-Venus-Earth-Jupiter paths, but those are almost as rare as E-V-J. It\u0027s the same problem, flying from Earth to Jupiter requires a V inf at Earth of around 8800m/s, and Earth can\u0027t change your flight path much at that speed, so the alignments have to be very precise and thus rare. E-V-E-E-J is more possible since the two passes of Earth double it\u0027s ability to turn your path, but FF can\u0027t do double flybys.

If the departure orbit was inclined 90 degrees then you would have to kill all of that 7787m/s and add vZ for the departure. So the program would say you have to add -7787m/s in the equatorial prograde direction (and something over 11200m/s in Z.)

It is true that the planets all orbit in planes within about 7 degrees of the ecliptic, but transfer orbits to the planets are usually more inclined than that. So having your parking orbit around Earth be precisely in the plane of the ecliptic might not be a particular advantage. What makes it so bad is adding the Earth\u0027s velocity to your Earth departure velocity. Imagine that you need an interplanetary transfer orbit inclined 7 degrees to the ecliptic. So you leave in an orbit inclined 7 degrees to the ecliptic relative to Earth. Your v leaving Earth\u0027s SOI is, let\u0027s say 4000m/s. Once you leave Earth\u0027s SOI and your reference is now the Sun, the 4km/s is now added to Earth\u0027s orbital 29km/s, and your 7 degrees relative to Earth becomes 0.85 degrees relative to the Sun. So in this example, with a Vsoi of 4km/s, leaving more or less prograde from Earth, your Earth start orbit inclination has to be about 8 times more inclined to the ecliptic (relative to Earth) than the interplanetary transfer orbit\u0027s required inclination (relative to the Sun). In summary, I think you can often save a lot by launching into an orbit that is not necessarily in the plane of the ecliptic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Your other question is an intriguing. If I use the ecliptic plane as the plane to put the test probe in then it is trickier to put it there, since you will have to specify the inclination and the longitude of the ascending node precisely. When I use an equatorial test orbit no LAN is necessary. If you\u0027re hyperediting it up there I suppose it\u0027s no big difference. Then I would give Vprograde and vZ relative to that orbit and you could see what plane to launch into, same either way. But I wouldn\u0027t know what the inclination of the departure orbit is relative to Earth\u0027s equator, since vZ and Vprograde would be relative to a specific point in an already-inclined orbit and wouldn\u0027t add together simply. I\u0027d have to figure out the ejection time exactly, beforehand, to give the inclination of the orbit to launch into. (Right now I just set vZ and vprograde into a maneuver editor and adjust the ejection time back and forth until I see the orbit prediction hit the target planet.) There would be one big advantage to using the ecliptic plane though- it\u0027s a lot closer to Canaveral\u0027s latitude than the equator, and it would be much less common for the test orbit to be less inclined than Canaveral. (When that happens my current way breaks down since you can\u0027t launch from Canaveral into a, say, 10-degree orbit.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have to think about it for a while. My way of defining the departure orbit is not nearly as good in RSS as it is in stock KSP (unless you launch from Kourou:)), and it\u0027s not perfect anyway.

I didn\u0027t think enough about it, but yes, if you want to leave SOI with 6 deg rel. to ecliptic your initial orbit has to be *far* more inclined relative to the ecliptic than 6 deg. That of course limits the use of always launching into the ecliptic massively. (Which I do, BTW by launching into the orbit of a test craft that I edited in that orbit.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I do think that on average a start orbit in the ecliptic plane should be beneficial and the method you describe of setting v_z and v_pro and then adjusting the time should work, IMHO, just the same.
