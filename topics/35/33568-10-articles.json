It\u0027s quite easy. For now I would envision only being able to send a fixed length double array from my KSP TOT to the KSP plugin, which in turn would have to create the maneuver node. So basically KSP TOT would send something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[gameTime, X deltaV, Y deltaV, Z deltaV] (where this is a double array with four values)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin could then interpret the double array and go from there. Those X, Y, Z values could also be prograde, radial, and normal; whatever KSP wants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone out there a whiz with C#? If so, could you cook me a up a simple stand alone console program that listens for input on a specified port and dumps it to console? The input would be a double array from MATLAB/KSP TOT. It would be useful to test the functionality I can work with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-01T05:20:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2013 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Arrowstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mefi282","CreatedById":63817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T09:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are awesome sir!
