To get the most use out of it, you\u0027ll probably want a few mods such as Kerbal Alarm Clock to keep track of the current time and Kerbal Engineer Redux or MechJeb to monitor your orbital characteristics. Please note that there is a bug in the current version (6.0.3) of Kerbal Engineer: when performing a transfer to a body with a smaller orbit, the \u0022Angle to Retrograde\u0022 displayed is actually your angle \u003Cem\u003Efrom\u003C/em\u003E retrograde, so you\u0027ll need to subtract it from 360 degrees to get your actual angle \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E retrograde. I also calculate the phase angle slightly differently from how Kerbal Engineer does so it may be off by a few degrees for inclined orbits.

The Kerbin-Duna plot (which has very little relative inclination) is mostly one large window with a very narrow line at transfers very close to 180 degrees that are slightly more expensive.

The Hohmann transfer works for Duna even though it is inclined because the inclination is low enough that its sphere of influence always intersects the ecliptic. I find it interesting that the lambert problem finds a solution of 1046 m/s delta-v at a transfer angle of 165 degrees vs the Hohmann transfer\u0027s delta-v of 1043 m/s with a small mid-course inclination correction required, so I think they end up being very close in delta-v required.

For example, you could set up a bi-elliptic transfer with an inclination change at apoapsis which would end up being cheaper (assuming the bi-elliptic transfer is cheaper than a two-impulse transfer in the first place). However, I think it should be optimal or close to optimal in nearly all reasonable cases since it minimizes the angle of the plane change required for intercept and it makes the math dramatically simpler because the plane change does not otherwise interfere with your transfer orbit (whereas at other angles a plane change will also change the radius of your intercept point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m getting a weird error with the new planner.
