All of our maneuvers are based off the spacecraft separation time and then, to compute a launch window, we just assume \u0022x minutes\u0022 to orbit. In fact, my primary mission planning software for \u0022real life missions\u0022 has no knowledge of spacecraft launch time at all. It relies on the user to do the subtraction if needed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel there is an under-appreciated relevance to this question.

This results in an ideal orbital position for the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we launch at the proper departure time \u0022minus a bit so we have time to get to orbit and set up the burn\u0022. This gets you into an orbit which may have the shape of the dummy orbit entered while planning, but you will be in a random phase, i.e. position for a given time in this orbit (true anomaly at epoch is undefined). This results in situations where you\u0027re nearing the ideal departure burn time, but you\u0027re on the opposite side of the planet... Although you explain that \u0022You can enter in this new departure time into KSP TOT, get a new set of delta-v values, and re-enter those into MechJeb\u0022, this may be quite sub-optimal. But getting the most bang for your propellant is what KSP_TOT is all about, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I propose a procedure which takes two launch parameters: lambda, the angle from the launch pad to the circular orbit insertion point and DeltaT_L, the time elapsed from launch to circular orbit insertion. (You may obtain these empirically, e.g. by test launching)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal would be to resolve the phase of the parking orbit, so you arrive at the correct true anomaly at the ideal departure burn time, or at least close to it....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes sense. I could at least not replicate the \u0022about 13 seconds early arrival\u0022 for the tutorial example. For me, it was more like 15 minutes and that seems to matter in terms of delta V.
