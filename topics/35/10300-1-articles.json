Potentially it will allow there to be a \\\u0027general format\\\u0027 that all addons can use.\n\nThis project is still **in development** and any suggestions should be mentioned here in comments (or PM me. Your choice.)\n\n03/07/2012\n\nThis project is back in the development stage again! I have found some new stuffs and so I\\\u0027m going to use Zlib compression for this project. Basically give me a week or two and I should have a mod-makers release with some testing features.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Currently I am just creating a simple GUI for mod makers to use to pack their mods, but eventually I\\\u0027ll get some screenshots up and we\\\u0027ll see some progress. The basic idea is that you\\\u0027ll no longer need to copy-paste everything into and out of the mods folder, or make sure that you have a plugin installed as the manager will handle all of this before starting KSP (this should be launched first so that mods can be configured.) Currently the method of packing mods does **not** preserve the file system, so I\\\u0027ve decided to use a .ZIP format instead and encrypt it so that it can\\\u0027t be modified.\n\u003E \n\u003E Another feature that could be possible is automatic updating. For users that use Dropbox to host their addons, I can get a download from it of the file requested. Possibly this would be a version file that would be used simply to check the version, then, if the addon is outdated, the user can update to the new one. The existing information would be deleted and the new version put in it\\\u0027s place.\n\u003E \n\u003E Let me know what you guys think, otherwise I\\\u0027ll discontinue my current work. This page will be updated when I remember. If I remember.
