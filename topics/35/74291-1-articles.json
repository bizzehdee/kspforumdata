It calculates each value using real authentic orbital mechanics, and allows you to tailor the settings to your skill level. The app also includes a Mission Planner feature, allowing you to select a series of planets/moons you\u0027d like to visit, choose whether to simply orbit, land and return to orbit, or just land, and the app automatically calculates the delta V you\u0027ll need to complete your journey, each step along the way. You can access topographical and biome maps from the planet info screens, which I\u0027ve found super helpful when trying to visit all the biomes to collect all zee Science.

Let me know which device and version of Android is experiencing the trouble. Also let me know if any of the math looks wrong. The math is calculated assuming Hohmann transfers from circular orbits and aerobraking when possible. For a transfer between a moon and a different planet, it\u0027s assumed you burn retrograde from the moon\u0027s orbit and then use the Oberth effect around the parent body to send you on your way. Arriving at another moon while skipping the planet assumes you aerobrake at the planet and set your apoapsis for an encounter with the moon. Landing around bodies with atmospheres are assumed to use parachutes, and takeoffs are calculated with the atmosphere factored in. In settings, you can choose how high you want to orbit above the minimum safe orbit (scraping the atmosphere or the tallest mountain), what sort of additional fuel margin you\u0027d like to bring, and how efficient you foresee your inclination changes being. Note that these changes will be reflected in both the Mission Planner and the Planet Info screens. If the values look weird, check your settings before you report a bug- choosing 90% extra fuel margins will make for rather excessive figures. It\u0027s possible to beat the inclination change values I\u0027ve included if you are very good and you try a polar orbit departure, and it may be possible to save deltaV using a bi-elliptic transfer or gravity assists in certain circumstances which are not modeled due to excessive complexity. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Amagi82/KerbalSpaceApp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource code\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture plans that may or may not happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Science descriptions for each item in the planet info screens (not everyone knows the difference between Sidereal and Synodic orbital period!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Aerobrake calculator.
