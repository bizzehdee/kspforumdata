Hopefully, this is the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I open my save game, refill the resources on any one ship in an orbit using the context menu, and save it back, it essentially breaks the save game by doing the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Before loading: The \u0022age\u0022 of the save game as displayed in the in-game save game selection screen becomes negative, usually around -67 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* After loading: All but one ship (not the edited) are removed from the Space Center selection menu, despite the save game selection menu still stating \u00229 ships\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I check out the resources on empty or non-full tanks, the editor does regularly display non-sane \u0022current\u0022 values, instead it shows very long integers, where the first couple digits would make sense, but it kind of gets screwed up because of this mantisse-style appendix. So i.e. for an oxidizer reading it would not show like 1286/3520 (current/max), but 128612939245729103/3520, where 1286 would be a value correlating the factual value from the in-flight UI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResetting this to 3520/3520 screws up the save game, and also resetting something like 0/3520 to 128612939245729103/3520 screws up the save game. Even refilling the fuel on a mono tank from 0/40 to 40/40 screws up the save game.
