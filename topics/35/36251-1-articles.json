I\u0027ve checked out literally one hundred mods, and have found one common problem. There doesn\u0027t seem to be a standard packaging method. Especially if one wishes to use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ksp-mod-admin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Mod Admin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E application. I\u0027ve found myself repacking mods to get them to work correctly in there. My suggestion is simply this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPackage all mods using the same format used in the SQUAD folder. ie: FLAGS, INTERNALS, PARTS, PROPS, RESOURCES, SOUNDS, SPACES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the root of the zip folder started with a Gamedata folder, or just the main plugin folder it would be fine. One that I tried most recently that gave me issues was the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/space-shuttle-solid-rocket-booster/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster\u003C/a\u003E mod. It seems like a great mod. It confuses \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ksp-mod-admin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Mod Admin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E and requires either special handling or repacking due to it\u0027s folder structure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we can get most mods to have their .zip file start with either the \\Gamedata folder or the \\Gamedata\\\u0026lt;plugin name\u0026gt; folder, this will make it less time consuming to ensure proper mod installation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for all the great work out there.
