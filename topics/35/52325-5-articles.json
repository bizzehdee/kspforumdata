This is a specific Windows problem I suppose, because I only came across this in Windows. However, if you open it with something else then notepad (or whatever Windows default text viewer is) it is printed on separate lines. Not sure if that causes any issues on Windows if you opened it in notepad. I\u0027ll try to find a way to make sure this won\u0027t happen in Windows as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start working on the v3.3 now. Please do realize that this application will be less maintained after KMP 1.6 is released (unless there are many bugs there) because as of then they include their own part list generator. So I have more time for my other projects =].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next update will include the old legacy feature and I\u0027ll try to do some bug hunting. I\u0027ll start developing as of now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**Progress Update**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why some parts are still missed by the Application is, as suspected, due to wrong encodings of some of the .txt files. I am now trying to find a way to scan the file, no matter what encoding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old legacy feature is already working and does not miss any parts I believe. It detects 19 parts more then my application currently does when including the mods: B9_Aerospace, DYJmisc, Firespitter, HullCameraVDS, IDiCEr1, MagicScmokeIndustries and obviously Squad stock parts. I will do my best to score a 100% accuracy before I release the update. However, it is always nice to have the Legacy feature as a backup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**Progress Update 2**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after fiddling with some parameters to check for part names I have now an above 100% accuracy. Not sure if that is good actually. The legacy mode detects 527 parts while my normal process detects 528 =]. This might be happening, because I added a part after I run KSP itself thus the KSP.log file is not fully updated. I think it is pretty safe for me to say that it now detects \u0027almost\u0027 everything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when running some tests with the Legacy mode I noticed that KSP does not connect part names with spaces. This means that, I am making a coding mistake somewhere, or I should ignore spaces as well just like KSP. Will take a look at that before releasing. I also already take a look at the saving. I hopefully have fixed this. I will send some builds to some testers. So some might keep an eye on their inbox.

I forgot to close the file scanner before deleting the file, thus the file is still open and used by the program when it is deleted. I made a quick fix, however, I am unsure if this really fixes the problem as the problem does not occur for me. I hope that it works for you guys.

After that it kinda depends on your OS. For example, my OSX version can run them by just double clicking it like a normal program. However, I believe that for Windows and Linux you must run this by using the cmd/terminal with the command \u0022java -jar \u0026lt;jar-file-name\u0026gt;.jar\u0022 (including path). This will start the app and from thereon you can continue with the applications GUI. I hope this helps you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the 2 day delay though, did not expected any replies anymore as the app was on the second page already.
