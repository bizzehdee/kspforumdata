So the answer is that in the \u003Cem\u003Ereleased\u003C/em\u003E version of Mission Architect, the answer is no. There is no way to import asteroids into the application. In fact, right now, the best way to figure out how to get to an asteroid is to use the Rendezvous Maneuver Sequencer application. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHowever,\u003C/em\u003E in the \u003Cem\u003Edevelopment\u003C/em\u003E version, well, that\u0027s a different story. Two days ago I anticipated this very need (along with trying to dock with other ships, and RemoteTech users trying to come up with optimal comm constellations) and developed a concept in MA called \u0022Other Spacecraft.\u0022 These are really just points along an orbit that you can use for various tasks. For example, lets say I wanted to meet up with a vehicle in Low Kerbin Orbit. I can use Other Spacecraft to \u0022add\u0022 this vehicle to my Mission Architect mission plan, and then use the optimizer to minimize the distance between my spacecraft and this other vehicle. Then, to verify I\u0027m getting what I expect, I can use a completely new application within Mission Architect called Graphical Analysis (so called because it generates plots \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E) to produce the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WhvmIre.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WhvmIre.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how the distance to the reference spacecraft drops?

There isn\u0027t enough here to call it 0.12.3, but it features a few bug fixes and improvements that I\u0027d like to push out to the community. The change log is below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorrected an error in Mission Architect wherein \u0022Reverse Time Errors\u0022 could be encountered while in an elliptic orbit.

This was really throwing people off and people were wondering why the rendezvous maneuvers weren\u0027t actually getting people to where they needed to go... \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBurn delta-v vectors are now shown in Prograde-Normal-Radial order.
