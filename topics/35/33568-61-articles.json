Its not kopernicus, as ive removed that (actually just kopernicus tech, required for kerbol plus mod) so ill look for the cause elsewhere. perhaps theres a way to query the game file for this info on sfs load, and cut universal time out of the computation?. also i can see why youre getting the jool question alot, having fiddled with it it seems that \u0022earliest departure\u0022 and \u0022earliest arrival\u0022 simply declare the plot area that the algorithim searches for a min dv within, rather than (as the uninformed user such as myself would assume) simply the earliest dates youre happy to work with.

It then uses a small 50,000 km dish to talk to a relay satellite (inner dot), which then uses a 2500 km omni antenna to talk to KSC or, when KSC is not visible it bounces signals off any of 7 other satellites with 2500 km omni antennas (only 3 of my dedicated comsats are shown here - see the whole picture \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/KSA/Flights/body.asp?r=true\u0026amp;db=bodies\u0026amp;body=Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I depict these three satellites is because they also contain 50,000 km dishes to talk to satellites around Mun and Minmus.

So if the craft around Ike can\u0027t see its IP ComSat, it should try to route through the craft around Duna to the second one. However MA will just connect it straight to the second IP ComSat it\u0027s not supposed to be talking to if it can see it.
