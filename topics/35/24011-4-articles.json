Has this been fixed? Are the \u0022selected mods\u0022 and \u0022all mods\u0022 buttons toggles? do they actually install on the first click and then uninstall on the second click? If this is true, then you will definitely want to use \u0022Install / Uninstall:\u0022 instead of just \u0022Proceed:\u0022. This way the user is informed that clicking the buttons below will perform a specific action, and not have to wonder what might happen if they just \u0022Proceed\u0022. You also might want to put a \u0022legend\u0022 in to show what the colors mean (or what the green dot on the folder means), or an \u0022Installed / Not Installed / Removed\u0022 column to help. Don\u0027t get me wrong, colors are nice, but there can be issues with all kinds of things when looking at colors (colorblindness, laptop LCD acting funny, strange color scheme in windows, highlighted programs don\u0027t display correctly...) that can make it difficult or impossible to see. Sometimes it\u0027s just nice to see a bit of text saying \u0022Installed\u0022 or \u0022Removed\u0022 or \u0022New Mod\u0022 or \u0022Installed with problems\u0022 or \u0022Could not install\u0022, something to make it a bit easier to understand what just happened when you clicked the button. I realize that there is the bottom text area, maybe if there is an error, the column says to refer to error number in list below. Just some thoughts. Anyways, good work, I think I\u0027m going to stick with your program, it seems to be way better than KSPMM.
