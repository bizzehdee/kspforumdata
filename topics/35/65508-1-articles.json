Especially becuase savegames have dependencies on mods (even though it may be untenable to track them ourselves). But git is perfectly stable on all KSP platforms, and it would make a better add-on manager than any of the existing ones.\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps if you\u0027re interested in this route I\u0027ll join you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had considered doing that but I\u0027d worried about the overhead, as the initial commit of all the mods would basically double the size of your KSP install. And then as the mod files are mostly binaries (at least the big ones!) it wouldn\u0027t be able to track the differences just the whole file changes so the size of the repo would balloon with each mod update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that being said I\u0027ve very little experience of using git to track large files so there might be some tricks to make that work better. Sounds like you might know a trick or two as your thinking on these lines. Would be really interested in talking to you on this. It would be wicked to be able to rewind your saves to any point regardless of changes in mod versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all mods where maintained in git and up on github then we could do some really cool things. It might be possible to just track the specific commit ids of mods and then pull the required versions from github rather than have to store them on the users machine. The ultimate goal would be to enable craft sharing that automatically fetches not only the required mods but the right versions, but that would require all mod developers to settle on some standards (for version numbering etc) so that might be a challenge.

The idea being that you can go into one campaign and select 1 or more other campaigns to mirror. Then whatever changes/additions you make to sub\u0027s in either of those campaigns will be propagated to the other selected campaigns. I often find I want my subs from one campaign in another so I copy them over, but then I\u0027m sometimes left wondering which was the more up-to-date version. This way it will be like having a single pool of subs that all campaigns have access to.\u003Cp\u003EWith sub\u0027s I\u0027m thinking that the option will effect all subs in the selected campaign. Or would you prefer being able to mirror just a few select subs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also planning on enabling mirroring of craft, but that will be per craft. So you can go to a craft in one campaign and select which other campaigns to mirror to. That craft will then appear in the all the selected campaigns and if you change it in one it will be updated in the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play on a few machines but I currently use syncing software to keep my craft and persistence the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060d like to optionally mirror the whole campaign, all my craft, saves and subs but I can see the value to being able to select just the ones that are mirrored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I could select a few installs (across a network) with Jebretary and then all the changes would propagate through that would be amazingly handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there could be a \u0060mirror the entire campaign/install\u0060 button that would be cool.
