I\u0027d like to create something similar to that, where there is a controlling instance assuring the quality of the packages (or mods in our case) in terms of respecting defined standards. Like supplying a proper license, documentation, meta-information, etc... End-Users could ultimately add different repositories to their managing application, but that would be something to think about later. In the first step I\u0027d like to follow a centralized approach, to ensure everything works as expected and to define said standards in a proper way. Once we accomplished to get the system working properly, we of course could enable other people to easily create and maintain repositories as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also love to work hand-in-hand together with KerbalStuff. We could provide all the information, and KerbalStuff could build upon that data and provide a great web-frontend for managing, indexing and manual downloading of the mods.

That includes the source as well as proper pre-built binary releases. But as you might know that will not be possible for many mods, as long as they do not provide a proper license allowing us to do so. That\u0027s why I intend to support these mods through so-called meta-packages which would simply point at the original location of the mod, so the client-application can easily download it from there. The meta-information would in this case still be hosted by us and maintained by some volunteer maintainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs in the example repo I put up and linked earlier (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ksprepo/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/ksprepo/\u003C/a\u003E) I\u0027d like to keep it all together where possible, but split it into three branches:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* upstream: the original modders branch, where we keep track of the \u003Cstrong\u003Eunmodified original\u003C/strong\u003E content. So it would basically be a mirror. That would also allow us to easily send patches / pull-requests upstream to the modders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* develop: the branch maintainers actively contribute to, like creating meta-information, merging updates from upstream, applying hotfixes, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* master: the actual \u0027release\u0027 branch keeping track of versions we release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth develop and upstream will almost always be exact copies of upstream, except the additional meta-data as well as (eventually) additional documentation and changes in directory-structure (if necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeddyDD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeddyDD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyway in my opinion, the first thing to determine is the same look and feel of files that store metadata.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat truly is something to specify early, but first we need to find out what data we actually need and how it should be organized.

Instead this field was meant to list optional mods that extend the functionality of this mod in any way. The popular \u0022Toolbar\u0022 for example would be a candidate for \u0022optional\u0022 as most mods do not depend on it, but make use of it when it is available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u002B KSP version can be a substitute for distribution version, ie instead of stable, testing and unstable, we can have 0.23, 0.23.5 and 0.24 so people keep the choice of moving from one KSP version to another as smooth as possible (maybe similar to what they have with Steam), with the ability to find and auto update mods to another version.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you will get may modders to keep up support for more than one target version.
