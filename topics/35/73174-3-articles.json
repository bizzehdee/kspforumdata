I have been using the Realism Overhaul mod set for about a month now, it\u0027s been so fun I haven\u0027t touched Stock in that time. I always felt a bit guilty when aerobraking at Jool with a ship that had legs and struts sticking out all over the place, or sending a Kerbal on a 10-year mission to Eeloo with no food or air. For those who might take this as criticism of stock, it\u0027s not- I like the way one can start with most real-space difficulties turned off. It let me have a lot of fun learning the astrodynamics without having to worry about other aspects of space flight. Now I\u0027m ready for more.

That\u0027s 1358.5-932.4=426.1 days, 4 Kerbin years. Anything that is not a double flyby can\u0027t be more than one orbit of the sun because LambertE.exe and FF don\u0027t use a multi-orbit Lambert algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct, LambertE can\u0027t do more than 5 encounters. I get around this by taking the last two encounters and entering them as the first two encounters in a 2nd LambertE. So for instance here I would take the K1358.5-E1394.9 that end the first 5 encounters and use them as the first two encounters in a 2nd instance of LambertE. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I search for monstrosities like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the V SOI when leaving Kerbin must be at least 2750m/s to make it to Jool under the best conditions. In practice Jool will be a little further away, or out of Kerbins orbital plane, or your path won\u0027t leave Kerbin in exactly the direction of Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit, so something higher than 2750m/s would be better. 2750m/s at Kerbin\u0027s SOI is about 1950m/s from a 75x75km orbit. This means you can search for K-E-K paths using Flyby Finder and eliminate all of the ones that have a \u0027braking dV\u0027 of less than 1950m/s. This limits the windows in which the K-E-K-K can start, though it\u0027s still a lot of possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I find the windows where you can go K-J for less than, say, V inf 3100m/s. For instance the first window departs Kerbin from about day 40 to 80.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I look for a good K-E-K that ends an integer multiple of Kerbin years before a good K-J. For a direct KEKKJ it seems to me that there should be 2 Kerbin years between the two K\u0027s, though I am not positive that three years won\u0027t work, I just haven\u0027t found it. So I search for a mission with the parameters of K(a)-E(\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E-K\u00A9-K(c\u002B213)-J(d). I enter the numbers into LambertE and tweak the dates and \u0027dbl\u0027 flyby parameter until I find something that works. It takes a long time. The Kerbin departure windows are very thin, maybe 2 or 3 days, and the Eve flyby window is even thinner, so you have to look carefully to find a good path. In the spreadsheet I set the 2nd Kerbin double flyby date to equal the first one plus 213 so I don\u0027t have to change that number constantly, but that\u0027s still 5 parameters to tweak. I often find a path where the incoming-outgoing V SOIs match but it will fail because one of the Kerbin flybys would have to be below its surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the KEKKEKKJ path I have still never actually flown it, that many flybys would be a real chore and I think the course corrections would overwhelm the start dV savings, so I never searched for another one. If you pull it off I would love to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy coming-soon version of FF allows you to sort the graph by braking dV which will help at bit at identifying good start windows. (ETA about 2 weeks) Still no double flyby finder though. Making a general double flyby finder proves to be quite unwieldy, lately I\u0027m toying wth the idea of making one that only does KEKKJ as that would be far simpler. That\u0027s many months off though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taio","CreatedById":131170,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T19:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to give some of these a shot - one thing - how do I work out ejection angle from the LambertE spreadsheet?

I believe KSPTOT used a plugin that could output a file describing all the bodies and orbits, there may be other ways.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, I\u0027ve thought about it. I admire TriggerAU\u0027s in-game adaption of AlexMun\u0027s pork-chop plotter, it just grabs the orbital elements straight from the game as it\u0027s running, so it can handle any system. So can TOT, I believe. Not FF, to add a mod system to FF I open up the mod config files and find the orbital elements and convert them to what I need for FF using Lambert.xls, then write them into FF, rather than somehow generating config files that FF would read at runtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But I have some reasons for wanting control of what systems FF is used for- the algorithm uses linked conics rather than patched conics, which means it assumes the planets change the direction of the ship all at one point, rather than noting where the planet enters the SOI and where it leaves it. For the stock planets this is plenty good enough because the SOI\u0027s are puny compared to the distances between the planets. But for something like flying between Jool\u0027s moons this would be too crude and there would be major errors. I also used a 5th-order approximation to determine the planet positions at a given time, rather than iterating some sort of Newtonian until it converges, and this would become inaccurate if the eccentricity of an orbit exceeds about .25. I do both these things to speed the program up, but it means I have to check every system to make sure my approximations aren\u0027t leading to bad outputs. There are also some tricky systems, like that one where Kerbin is orbiting a gas giant, that FF would be unable to deal with, since you have to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and the gas giant\u0027s SOI before you are in Kerbol\u0027s SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I could write an app that read and checked a mod system\u0027s parameters and aborted before generating a config file if the system wasn\u0027t safe, but that would be a major project that would push everything else aside, so it\u0027s not in my plan for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TranceaddicT","CreatedById":73653,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T18:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of a Linux port?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T21:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TranceaddicT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TranceaddicT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny chance of a Linux port?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, no, at least not by me.

I shall assume you use Kerbal time (426/6) and not Earth time (365/24). For instance is it Y1 D22 5:45:03?\u00A0 Then compute what that is in what I call \u0022UT\u0022, the number of days elapsed since the game started. There\u0027s a little converter in the lower right corner of the FF screen that can do the math for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow use that number as the search date to search from. In the example below I start from day 3800 (roughly Y9 D400). No need to be precise, the search window will be hundreds of days wide. Start FF. Change the \u0022Start at\u0022, \u00221st encounter\u0022, and \u00222nd encounter\u0022 planets to be Kerbin, Eve, and Moho as shown below. Now the tricky part in any search is to pick the right \u0022Earliest Search Date\u0022 and \u0022Search Period\u0022 to use for each planet. So I\u0027ve given you good values below. In the \u0022earliest search date\u0022 for Kerbin enter the current day in your game. (3800 in this example). In the \u0022earliest search date\u0022 field for Eve enter the Kerbin day plus 400 days. In the ESD field for Moho enter the Kerbin day plus 450. Now enter the \u0022search period\u0022 numbers as shown below, 500 days for Kerbin, 400 for Eve, and 700 for Moho. Change the field called \u0022V at SOI\u0022 to 3000 as shown below. You might want to increase the \u0022Search Steps per Period\u0022 field to 200. Leave everything else in its default state. Now hit the \u0022begin search\u0022 button. It should search for a few seconds. When it finishes, if you see any \u0027hits\u0027 in the table, hit \u0022Show Graph\u0022 to get a graphical representation of when Kerbin-Eve-Moho flybys are possible within the constraints. If you\u0027re having trouble, try entering the numbers below exactly as shown and see if you get the same search result. These are by no means the only values that will find results by the way, they are just pretty likely to find results anytime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tK3ksuX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022574\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tK3ksuX.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow is it going so far? What is your search start time? Once you start getting solutions it will be time to winnow them down to the best one for your plans. Is travel time more important than total dV expended? Do you have a dV limit? And what Kerbin orbit will you start from, I usually start from a 75x75km orbit but you might have a space station or some other orbit you like to use. To use all of Flyby FInder\u0027s information you are going to need a test probe that is in a circular, equatorial orbit around Kerbin, will that be a problem? If you don\u0027t want to use a test probe then FF can only tell you good times to leave from Kerbin and flyby Eve to get to Moho, but it can\u0027t help pinpoint the best start orbit and exact maneuver to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T17:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first attempt I tried to go by the graph and go by a date which looked good, but it ended up not working very well since I was coming in from the wrong place (on the outbound path rather than inbound from the suns periapsis), but in using the SlingShotter thing to look at planetary positions, I THINK there might be a chance to alter the inclination at apoapsis to meet Moho.
