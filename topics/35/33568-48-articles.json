I usually do all these calculations in the game, but since the Kerbulator mod doesn\u0027t seem to be supported anymore it might crap out on me at some point (1.0 and beyond) so I\u0027d like to begin using the MEA more often. Anyways, in particular I\u0027m referring to my previously-described scenario where I\u0027m executing a maneuver with two different engines and a large change of mass in-between when I dump the stage, currently I have to set up the MEA for two separate burns then add the burn times together to get my total burn time/split\u003Cp\u003ESome more MEA usage notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is there a way to save the system level properties between runs of the program?

I would say if you\u0027re looking to execute an impulsive maneuver in KSP, convert it to a finite duration maneuver by right clicking the mission script and selecting \u0022convert impulsive maneuver\u0022 (when you have the correct maneuver highlighted). Then just execute that (if you upload a finite duration maneuver, the node is created at the start time). MA does everything MEA does but without the annoyances you pointed out above. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
