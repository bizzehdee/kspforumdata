Vast underground cities were dug out, super-fast underground transportation systems were developed, thermoelectric generators were created which used the very warmth of the planet to keep our civilization going. Our meat animals, pets, domesticated flora were brought into underground barns and farms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe learned to live, work, and love deep under the surface believing that by doing so we were helping our dear planet, Kerbin, and while away from Kerbol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s loving sunshine we thought we were doing the right thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver 30 years ago it was decided to send a surface team to check out how lovely and rich the new biosphere of the planet had become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they found a waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout us much of the animal life on the surface had died out. The wild creatures had lived off our trash, they had sheltered in our buildings during the coldest of months and the hottest of seasons, and millions lived off our very bodies. When we buried ourselves we doomed them all to die out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe soil had been destroyed by our chemicals and farming methods even while we retreated to the caverns. Only a few plants were found to have survived here and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe oceans were lifeless. Our waste, which we had dumped into the waters, had fed many of the bottom feeders and one-cell animals. They were the roots of the food chain. When we cut off their food we cut down the tree of life within the oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe very air was so bad that we now have to wear spacesuits on the surface of our own planet. And those birds you hear are mostly scavengers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to understand what had happened, we created the Kerbal Space Center to carry out a study of our planet and the other nearby worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have explored Kerbin and placed stations around it and Mun. We have flown to the North Pole and scouted out the ruins of our past. We have gained much knowledge and great glory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut two weeks ago new laws were passed, against my will, designed to limit our impact on the surface of Kerbin and other planets. One of these laws will be effecting the industry dealing with fuel production. It will force them to decrease it over the next few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need the KSC staff and those involved with the Kerbal Space Program in general to do their best to deal with these troubling times. We need to find new methods, new designs, and new equipment to overcome the barriers that have been put in front of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esigned with respect,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF.

As you know, this sometimes causes quakes on Mun and causes all kinds of havoc with our equipment. Our A.I units always, ALWAYS, go off line and need to be replaced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the fuel problem MAY be overcome soon. Our Science guys and those other nerds, the engineers, have found that many planets and their moons have material that can, if properly processed, can give us the fuel we need. Lately, most of our craft have been launching with half empty tanks anyway, to decrease their mass, so a shortage in fuel may not hurt us until later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we are soon to be getting more hands to help in our labor in the form of female crewmembers. Yes, girls, so start shaving and using deodorant. They are still in training but I want you to start acting normal NOW. Think of it as your training. No more shirtless video calls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need from you guys are four things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Find ways to make craft that can be used multiply times in multiply ways - no more decommissioning a craft just because you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need it for the next few weeks. The Fuel Trailers and the program to develop the Space Tugs as the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMule\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of space are a good start. We also have a Orbital Tug that is being tested as I write this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jR94dWr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jR94dWr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Science Station around Kerbin, the ISS C.J.Cherryh, must be reconfigured to be used as a high traffic Fueling Station and Base of Operations for Kerbin orbit. That means that some modules may have to be removed or replaced. I want a careful study on all choices - we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t waste any material or any fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nek5iP4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Nek5iP4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. We have a small base on the Mun and a orbiting Science Station. We will have to search for spots on the Mun where we can find the material we need for the processing of fuel. Mining Craft, Transport Craft and other craft will need to be designed and created for this. The Science Station, the ISS Lisanne Norman, must be used as a Base of operations and a Fueling Station. I want it ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uwJJg2g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uwJJg2g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As we will only launch craft and fuel when we NEED to, we must do our best, with every launch, to deliver skilled crew to our station and bases. I want engineers on the spot to repair equipment and trained pilots to do the flying. I want our scientists to record and study and give the KSC feedback on everything we do - so as to improve on it. See Point 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you also may know, the Stephen Baxter, our working Space Tug, had two A.I units attacked to it with ports. The idea is damaged units can be replaced when needed. Or even moved to second ship if not needed by the first one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WDuITUV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WDuITUV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo more wielding the things to the hulls of the ship and having to destroy half the craft just to get them off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s get on it!

I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153t care. Once again I protest this action.

Not much to say. I man the Ranger Station here at the Historical landing site, where Bill Kerman, the first Kerbal to walk on the Mun, landed. Funny, we sometimes use man or Kerbal. Sorry, I always get off track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztRSFdx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ztRSFdx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I am, watching over the flag and an old T-Rover from the time period. It looks small compared to my T-Buggy but they both handle badly on the Mun. They have a habit of not wishing to turn, even when you turn the SAS off. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been told it is the tires they both use. No reason to drive anywhere anyway, nothing to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, if I was a scientist and the base has science stuff, I might drive about and collect samples. But I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m an engineer. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here to make sure the equipment is kept in order and that visitors don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe site is in the Mun Highlands. I guess it is better then being on one of the flat boring plains. But landing here can be a tad dangerous. Slopes all over the place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey say there may be mining on the Mun in the future and I am not sure but it may happen near me. While I am in the Highlands I also seem to be in a crater - maybe the hills around me were created when a large asteroid hit the Mun? Either way, it could be the material needed for the creation of fuel may be all around me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YXnrtpJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YXnrtpJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ranger Station is really just a lander with a two-crew command cabin. It gives me more room to relax or move around than some of the other command modules. The A.I. unit was decoupled and the engines turned off. It is now a base for the rest of its life. Funny, in a few years it will be the only space craft of its kind. All others will have ports for A.I. units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a model very much like it that landed the Buggy and will likely be used in future landings. But those will all have A.I. units to help direct their operations and senior ports to carry cargo. I wonder if they are fun to chat with? The A.I. units, I mean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a small library of music I like, audio books I enjoy, and of course can send you letters when the Mun is facing Kerbin or when the station is in the proper position. Stocked up with all the food cubes, tubes of paste, and packets of flavored drinks a person could ever want. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry Mom, I watch my weight and don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t over do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the day and night cycle is a tad weird. I have to use an alarm clock to tell me when it is time to get up or go to bed and I have a blanket I sometimes put over the viewing window. I like to keep active when I can - the low gravity forces you to keep exercising. I jog in place, do push ups and twists, and all kinds of other weird zero-gravity moves to help keep my muscles healthy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zm4GopJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zm4GopJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get much in the way of visitors, to be honest.

I have some news for you from the research and development front of our little machine guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, all the math says our SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit) craft, named \u0022Buzz\u0022 can make it to stable orbit with a few drops of fuel still in the tanks. We just don\u0027t know how well it can come down. I mean, a Space Tug would have to meet it, take off the passengers and refuel some of the tanks, in order for it to reenter the atmosphere. But while we worked long and hard to make a small craft able to get into the vacuum of icy, deadly, harsh space, we only put on some heavy duty landing gears and some chutes. We don\u0027t know if Buzz, that\u0027s the name we gave the machine intelligence attached to the hull (don\u0027t you think the term artificial intelligence is mean?), can bring it down safely. So, I suggest when you use it the first time, only send up two Kerbals, no pilot, so when it comes we don\u0027t lose anybody. You dig?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fSEVt9U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fSEVt9U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that you can send anybody else up, I hear the station already has eight people. Unless you have people sleeping in the command cabins, that\u0027s the limit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, even if \u0022Buzz\u0022 (the SSTO not the A.I. unit) works now, we don\u0027t know what future solar activity will, like, do to our atmosphere. Like, every time we get hit by the big bright guy in the sky, our planet reacts with the ocean releasing all kinds of isotopes and all kinds of chemical reactions. What do they call it - the \u0022flower shed\u0022 effect or something? I forgot. The problem is things will get worse and we may have to start thinking about protecting returning craft from the massive heat build up during reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other project, the A. I. controlled Rover program, was doing badly at first. We inserted one of those portable A. I. units and it worked up to the point where it started just driving in circles. That kind of spooked us, to be honest, and we had to retire it. It seemed a slight slope freaked it out or something. It was sad really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we made a simple rover, you now, with a low, wide body, reactors, a probe body, rechargeable bank, and a docking port in front. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M2m27do.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M2m27do.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It gives the A. I. unit a sense of direction. Then we mapped out a path for it to follow and let it go! We, of course, made sure the route selected went around any big mountains - even a crewed buggy has problems with those big boys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zFeupUI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zFeupUI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we watched its progress, took some photos. At two hours, twelve minutes, and fourteen seconds, on the way to its second waypoint, it exploded. Have no idea why - can\u0027t even find any pieces. Total mystery. It\u0027s if the planet itself was trying to kill us or everything we make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sobsjKb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sobsjKb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes explain why most Kerbals stay inside when off duty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we now know WHY the first one freaked out. We were telling it go somewhere without telling it where to go. Like, it got confused and had a nervous breakdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, that Mun ranger has been sending us data about the two cars he has up there. I think one is a T-Rover (though not sure why it is called a rover) and the other one is a Mun Buggy. Seems the Rover handles a tad better and has a longer charge. Somebody forgot to give the Buggy solar panels. But both seem to handle well as long as you keep it around 4 meters per second. Kind of slow but, hey, low gravity, you dig? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5O4br5F.png\u0022 alt=\u00225O4br5F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur Rover was doing a nice 10 meters per second. Course...it exploded. So it was doing badly at second too. HA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn return for his data we gave him some advice on piloting the ship. No, don\u0027t worry, he didn\u0027t do anything outside his skill level. He just moved it about three meters, so the flag could get some of that light from the lamps. Looks a tad better, don\u0027t you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I3Pu6uR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022I3Pu6uR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, well, I have to test out some new ways to use our friendly little metal minds, so try to chill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elovingly,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDUDE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN.

I. units were not failures. No test is a failure unless WE fail to learn from them. We already have two A. I. mobile units at work on Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne manned Buggy heading north - testing out how well a portable unit can handle a Buggy with a crew member in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also have another version of the A. I. controlled rover, this time shielded, exploring the land south of KSC. It\u0027s assignment is to find a safe, flat area for the future SSTO to land for servicing and refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D0uWqJP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D0uWqJP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also reopened the airfield hanger - had to clean out all the rusting aircraft and a colony of terror birds - so we could have a work space for our project of making a ground truck to refuel the SSTO. The CLAW system will be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESection 9 is doing a wonderful job and I all hope you send a letter to encourage them to keep up the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTO should be ready for a live test any day now. The computer simulations show it reaching orbit, where it will need refueling, and being able to land near KSC, well within range of our ground crew to transfer crew and fuel it up. The drop tank was replaced with a permanent tank with the same fuel set up. So it is truly a Single Stage To Orbit craft that can carry three passengers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, we\u0027ll send up a replacement for Jebediah Kerman so he stops sending you all whining letters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Orbital Tug has had a slight change made to it. When Jebediah pointed out how much mono he used in docking just a few times we realized that the Orbital Tug will be doing a lot more docking then the Space Tug as it will be helping in space not just to move cargo but also in future orbital construction. We doubled the mono it carries. We doubt this will effect the launch in anyway as it is using the same launch assembly as the Space Tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7hU7ffI.png\u0022 alt=\u00227hU7ffI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also noticed that while the Space Tug costs $183,432.4 the Orbital Tug only costs $171,784. As the Orbital Tug can likely also carry cargo and parts to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons we feel, strongly, that instead of one Orbital Tug and two Space Tugs we should have two Orbital Tugs and one Space Tug. A small savings but every pence counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison one Portable A. I. unit costs $44,840 and the SSTO costs $41,177.2. Remember that ships or stations with Portable A. I. units will have two so you would want to add $89,680 to the cost of each Tug. The SSTO will have a built-in A. I. unit, which costs $750.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as we have learned a great deal about using jet engines, and in fact have be using them for the first stage of the launch system for the Fuel Trailers, our costs may start going down as we apply this knowledge to future launches of the Tugs and payloads. The large cost of the Tugs comes mostly from the fuel and the launch system. Once we perfect the launch system and, we hope, start producing fuel outside the gravity well, costs should drop greatly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QicJyM5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QicJyM5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KtEIIbC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KtEIIbC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact Fuel Trailer Four was launched, after some issues, with a new improved launch system. One that the A. I. unit found easier to handle. In fact, after replacing the de-coupler on the last booster stage with a senior docking port, to allow for fuel cross feeding, it was pointed out that this would also be a way to recycle rocket engines for future use in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ENlRbfg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ENlRbfg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eGC07wZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eGC07wZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs plans for interplanetary missions are drawn up, and distances become as important as cargo, we may increase the number of Space Tugs (if needed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs our methods and designs improve the choices for future growth increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esigned,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.

Units, named \u0022Ted\u0022 and \u0022Bill\u0022 were able to handle it well, though they did complain about it being sluggish when attached to Fuel Trailer Five.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gtqyU0X.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022gtqyU0X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe heat sinks worked like a charm. \u00A0And may I say the \u0022Skipper\u0022 engine on the last stage is a very useful engine when working in orbit. \u00A0May I suggest any future orbital buses or people movers use this engine? \u00A0The LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 Atomic Rocket Motors are good for inter-orbital travel between planets or to the moons, but the RE-15 seemed great for getting the job done in short, powerful, spurts of power. \u00A0Just the thing needed to moving between fast moving stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCourse, we only have one station right now. \u00A0But, let me continue with my report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ibBkx2T.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ibBkx2T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy T\u002B 1 Day, 1 hour, 12 minutes, and 8 seconds, I had docked with Fuel Trailer Four, head first, and drained it of all its fuel. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gooo2BE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022gooo2BE.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2qeG4l0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222qeG4l0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ISS C.J. Cherryh, the Second, was only about 15 minutes away. \u00A0Once again, I can\u0027t praise the \u0022Skipper\u0022 enough. \u00A0Then we had a problem. \u00A0I had to drain and release my own booster, because it was causing wobble. \u00A0This is the flaw of using regular docking ports, or any ports, extended from the hull of a ship or station. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I undocked from the station if took me another five hours to find and attach to Fuel Trailer Five. \u00A0I did something stupid - I attached to the wrong end. \u00A0Which is why the A.I.
