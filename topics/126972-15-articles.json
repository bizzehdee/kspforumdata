Their old ship. Their ship. The space agency had assigned them a bit of busy work to complete at Kelgee while they idled... busy work none of them were particularly interested in. So news of the launch of Sulphur 1 was reason for celebration. A small celebration, as they didn\u0027t have much in the way of spare snacks aboard the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mission destined to be misspelled, the Sulpher, no, Sulphur, or was it Sulfur? 1 was the first in a series of small, system-scale shuttles. Packed with enough boom to reach anywhere in the Kerbin System and come back, one Sulphur shuttle also includes seating for 4 plus a pilot and enough food and supplies for at least three M\u00FCnths (~19 days).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160305_ksp0119_s-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160305_ksp0119_s-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch vehicle for this mission was an LV-06A Cadence, upgraded to replace the glitchy AIES engines with LV-T45s. This reduced the maximum lift-off mass of the rocket somewhat, but made up for it in increased pitch authority. (Just having working gimbals was enough, honestly.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough the Sulpher (or was it Sulphur?) series of shuttles were designed with a pilot in mind, they also allowed for fully autonomous control. The reasoning being they could then be sent out to \u0022rescue\u0022 up to 5 kerbals, none of which would need to be a pilot. It also made it much safer to launch, as the craft was not intended to ever renter the atmosphere. No abort procedures needed for launch if no pilot was required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160305_ksp0129_s-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160305_ksp0129_s-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis Sulphur shuttle, the first of its kind, would not accompany the crew of the Silicon DSV on their trip to Jool - that would instead be used by a later craft. This one would instead fly with them and the Si-DSV-1 to the M\u00FCn, and would then return the crew to Kelgee Station. A newer version of the shuttle would be launched with a few small adjustments for use at Jool.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo save fuel, the second stage of the S-1 tagged along all the way to Kelgee. The docking, as with half of all things in the space program, happened at night. As is only right and proper. Which might explain why the craft was docked to an inaccessible port, forcing the crew to EVA over to it. Before long they had all collected their things, said a short goodbye to Kelgee, and pushed away from the familiar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160305_ksp0137_s-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160305_ksp0137_s-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second stage was spent during the burn up to the Si-DSV-1, and was discarded into an orbit with a periapsis above Station Orbit but below 300km. \u0022Safe\u0022 orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess than an orbit later and the Sulphur 1 was dancing with the Silicon DSV 1.

No station logs or any other operational data as was seemingly the theme, but plenty of notes to pick up on in the lab. And quite a few ongoing experiments in its racks.

Macfred and his crew became quite possibly the first kerbals to ever change directly from a retrograde munar orbit into a prograde munar orbit.

One accidental erasure had already wiped out munths of data in the lab, so they had to devise a sure-fire way for telling when their blutonium pellets were exposed to the void without any shielding.

The larger of the dishes he left deactivated, as the mid-tier was sufficient for reaching Kerbin. Of the three ships docked at the station, one appeared to be a construction bot nearly identical to \u0022Gerty\u0022 at Kelgee Station, one was apparently a shuttle not dissimilar to their own (if a bit bulkier and less attractive), while\u00A0the third was a strange mess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160310_ksp0300_mot.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160310_ksp0300_mot.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a strange mess it was. Macfred slipped out to take a look at it.\u00A0Apparently intended to serve as a fuel tanker, it featured two strange engines strapped to its side with explosive decouplers. And they were hot.

Were they burning straight rocket fuel and oxidizer with this? To what end? He made sure to take plenty of pictures to send them back to the interns in the lab (and Wernher, who would no doubt be drooling over it), and even attempted to disconnect an engine from its frame before decided it was best not to wake sleeping dragons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160310_ksp0311_mot.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160310_ksp0311_mot.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe did however take the liberty of relieving the docked vessel and the station of three RTGs.
