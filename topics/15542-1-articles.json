Never actually got serious about a rendezvous. Tried several times, but didn\\\u0027t quite grasp that brute force didn\\\u0027t accomplish the feat. Would always end up WAY overshooting the target, or never even coming close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done multiple Mun and Minmus landings (even both on the same flight), and I have become rather decent at basic orbital flight mechanics. So, with the .16 parts and EVA-ing, I finally decided to build a Space Station in orbit around Kerbal. I made it with all stock parts (except a tiny little MechJeb module on its underside and the crew tank). She\\\u0027s big, weighs in at quite a bit. Got it into orbit (that was difficult, my computer would spontaneously disassemble the entire craft at various spots in atmosphere). Raised its orbit to 125km, circular. She has plenty of SAS, an ASAS, way too much RCS (thrusters and fuel), and a heap of fuel for her half-size LFE. Also has the Mk2 command pod and the 5-Kerbal crew tank. She is ringed with several ladders, going in many directions, making it a space-jungle-gym of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I decided after I put this into orbit, that I would make a small space-ferry to ferry the first extra crew member aboard Kirr (I know...not original). Lo-and-behold, it was good ol\\\u0027 Jebediah! I fashioned a single-seat, throw-away intercept craft, launched it, and proceeded to use the awesome intercept table available on the forums here. First try, and I got to within 1.5km of Kiir. A little RCS maneuvering, and I was on top of her. Within about 20m, I EVA\\\u0027d Jeb and hopped on over to the station. Jeb meandered about and then boarded the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst 2 attachments are the Space Station, last is Jeb\\\u0027s personal ride arriving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I really do feel that .16 is a helluva improvement.

First stage is ALL engines going except for the station\\\u0027s. SRB\\\u0027s should seperate around 5000m. First \u0027pack\u0027 of LFE\\\u0027s should seperate rather early in the flight, but don\\\u0027t be worried, as her speed REALLY picks up at that point. You should be out of the thick atmosphere at that point, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou NEED Damned Aerospace \u0027Crew Tank\u0027 part (you don\\\u0027t need the whole DA pack, but, whatever, if you have it, it\\\u0027s not used). You also need the newest iteration of Mechjeb. Have fun, let me know if any of you try it. And, if you still can\\\u0027t get her into orbit, I could post my persistence file. So far, it\\\u0027s minimal, a little debris in orbit, SS Kiir in orbit at 125km. Jeb\\\u0027s \u0027Space Ferry\u0027 floating relatively nearby. Oh, and a larger size lander near the nearside Mun arch, with a single Kerbalnaught \u0027Kerby\u0027 standing all alone at the peak of the Mun Arch. That was over a 5km walk for the guy, and he lost his two crew members enroute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh yes, before I forget, some of the ladders don\\\u0027t seem to be working as intended.
