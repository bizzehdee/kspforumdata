And is A a \u0027better\u0027 engine if it has an ISP of 3s? Ignore weight, placement, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask because when I consider the difference between using one engine and two, I consider the two engines as one. To that end, I take the thrust of a single engine and double it while halving its ISP. For example, my model predicts that three LV-N\u0027s produce 180kN of thrust at an ISP of ~233. A single Poodle produces 220kN of thrust at an ISP of 390s. Issues of placement aside, should a single Poodle therefore be substituted for tricoupled LV-N\u0027s? Its thrust and ISP both exceed that of the group, so doing so seems logical. However, plenty of builders on this forum use not three but \u003Cem\u003Edozens\u003C/em\u003E of LV-N\u0027s on their spacecraft, so I wonder if my logic holds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my hypothesis is correct, then substituting a Skipper for the Poodle becomes profitable if the necessary thrust is even slightly greater than 220kN, and the same for a Mainsail because their ISP\u0027s differ only slightly relative to that of the LV-N. But this idea is counter-intuitive when applied to high-flying orbiters: aren\u0027t tiny, extremely efficient engines the order of the day in deep space? One could even argue that a single, short burn from a Mainsail would be preferable to many long burns from an LV-N.

The first is the support module, which contains RCS, batteries, the engines in question, and a huge load of fuel in detachable tanks. The second is the lander module, which is designed to take two Kerbals down from 50,000m AGL (hereinafter known as Low Dunar Orbit or LDO) to the Dunar surface and back again. Ideally, the lander engines would double as the main engines, but the mass of my original design ran up into the scores of tons, so an extra one or two isn\u0027t a huge matter for me.
