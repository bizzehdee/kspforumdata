I\u0027ve made attempts to work on Kerbcam in the past, and have found myself not delivering - at least in part because of a lack of energy/enthusiasm/time and a codebase that got nasty and hard to change. So the intent is for a rewrite, leveraging the lessons learnt from the original Kerbcam, and maybe selected code, but leaving the bulk of it behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m doing right now is experimenting with ideas for a rewrite. Even if I never execute on this, then maybe it\u0027ll be of use to someone else that might want to do this.

A\u003Cbr\u003Econstraint being that operations that overlap in time cannot exist within the\u003Cbr\u003Esame track. An operation exists in exactly one track (maybe zero tracks in a\u003Cbr\u003Etransitional state if there are copy/paste mechanics).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA track may or may not be named for convenience.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E### Operation\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESomething that manipulates the camera (or potentially part of the scene) as\u003Cbr\u003Etime progresses. This uses points in time referenced from the timeline. An\u003Cbr\u003Eoperation may be instantaneous, or cover a range of times.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EExamples of operations:\u003Cbr\u003E* Interpolate camera zoom (field-of-view).\u003Cbr\u003E* Interpolate camera position.\u003Cbr\u003E* Interpolate camera look-at point.\u003Cbr\u003E* Control time speed.\u003Cbr\u003E* Invoke an action on a part (e.g activate an engine).\u003Cbr\u003E* (Maybe) Force GC cycle for perfectionists - maybe this point in the sequence\u003Cbr\u003E  isn\u0027t too (subjectively) sensitive to GC pauses, but a part that *is*\u003Cbr\u003E  sensitive is coming up.\u003Cbr\u003E* (Maybe) Set camera visible layers. (This should allow for a IVA view)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOperations *might* have sub-operations in future, but that\u0027s just a\u003Cbr\u003Especulative feature idea for now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E### Actuator\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA general set of interfaces for something that acts as a proxy for modifying\u003Cbr\u003Ethe camera or scene. This is distinct from modifying the object(s) directly so\u003Cbr\u003Ethat the actuator can:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Cleanup after playback.\u003Cbr\u003E* Reduce the number of places that Kerbcam interfaces with KSP\u0027s own API, thus\u003Cbr\u003E  limiting the impact of breaking changes in KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E* Be used as a stub to create preview visualizations. (E.g a stub object that\u003Cbr\u003E  implements a camera actuator can record camera position etc. over time and\u003Cbr\u003E  then be used to render an object showing how the camera moves)\u003Cbr\u003E* Potentially be used as a fake for unit testing actuators etc.\u003Cbr\u003E* (Maybe - future speculation) Further use in layering operations. E.g a\u003Cbr\u003E  camera looking direction operation transitioning to another by a\u003Cbr\u003E  interpolation might delegate to both looking-direction sub-operations and\u003Cbr\u003E  smoothly interpolate between the results on stubbed cameras and apply that to\u003Cbr\u003E  another actuator that applies to the actual camera.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EActuators should exist to support for the various types of operation that\u003Cbr\u003Eexist.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E## Misc thoughts\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETime.captureFramerate - potentially useful to set a framerate if we\u0027re going\u003Cbr\u003Eto capture at a given rate, might make the framerate more predictable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECreate lights to move around a scene as an operation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E## User Interface\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMockups made using [ASCIIFlow](http://asciiflow.com/).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOpen questions:\u003Cbr\u003E* How should things be grouped into windows?

A couple of them are\u003Cbr\u003E  named, but they all exist at specific times, and are kept in order of\u003Cbr\u003E  increasing time from left to right.\u003Cbr\u003E* Each row below that is a track, in this example they just have default names.\u003Cbr\u003E* Each track row contains operations. In this example:\u003Cbr\u003E * \u0022Track 1\u0022 contains operations that move the camera, the first operation is a\u003Cbr\u003E   movement of the camera position starting at 0.00\u0022, and finishing at 7.50\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E   Immediately following that, the camera starts from a new position at 7.50\u0022,\u003Cbr\u003E   and continues moving until 20.28\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E * \u0022Track 2\u0022 is similar to \u0022Track 1\u0022 but contains camera \u0022look-at\u0022 operations\u003Cbr\u003E   instead of camera positioning.\u003Cbr\u003E * \u0022Track 3\u0022 contains a single operation at 10.23\u0022. This operation (like the\u003Cbr\u003E   others) has a default name. It has been configured to invoke the \u0022activate\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E   action on some rocket engines on a vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUI decisions made by this mockup (not necessarily set in stone):\u003Cbr\u003E* Things can optionally be named (specifically \u0022time keys\u0022, \u0022tracks\u0022 and\u003Cbr\u003E  \u0022operations\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E* The column widths are determined by the time key names, but not by the\u003Cbr\u003E  operation names. Not clear if this is a good idea or not, or if it\u0027s\u003Cbr\u003E  practical within Unity3d.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E### Path editing\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen editing/viewing paths (particularly camera positions, look-at positions),\u003Cbr\u003Ethe path should be visible by the flight camera, so its position can be seen\u003Cbr\u003Erelative to the environment/vessel. The nodes should also be visible (and\u003Cbr\u003Eideally clickable to select). The position of each node should be adjustable\u003Cbr\u003Evia controls in a window. A node\u0027s timing is determined by a referenced time\u003Cbr\u003Ekey. Minimal controls would include X,Y,Z adjusters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIdeally the position of each node would be adjustable via something akin to the\u003Cbr\u003Emanuever node interface that KSP players are familiar with. While this seems to\u003Cbr\u003Ebe possible, that\u0027s regarded as a stretch/later feature (not a high priority).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA node\u0027s position (or the entire path) should be relative to a reference frame.\u003Cbr\u003EExamples of reference frames:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Selected vessel/part/object\u003Cbr\u003E * including rotation\u003Cbr\u003E * ignoring rotation\u003Cbr\u003E * reference position relative to object\u0027s position, plus some multiple of the\u003Cbr\u003E   object\u0027s velocity vector relative to the SOI (rotating/non-rotating SOI).\u003Cbr\u003E   Questions remain open as to when the position and velocity are sampled. The\u003Cbr\u003E   intent is to help with fly-by effects, but some clarity is needed here.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-06T12:06:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2014 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by huin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate design code\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"glen.mack","CreatedById":75413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T14:05:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, while I fully accept - \u0022No promises\u0022 I am super excited at the concepts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll only comment on the things that I fully understand and feel need comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Timeline: I\u0027m not sure if this is covered in something later that I can\u0027t quite wrap my head around with layering operations.

The original KerbCam worked by interpolating the camera orientation (via \u0022slerping\u0022 - spherical linear interpolation), which had some jarring effects when transitioning from one \u0022segment\u0022 (i.e the time between keys) of the sequence to another, and it also didn\u0027t track objects terribly well (which I suspect was the primary use case for directing the camera). There was a better mathematical model to interpolate smoothly, but I burnt a lot of time prior to the first KerbCam 1 release trying to work out how to do it, but eventually failed and just released something which felt \u0022good enough\u0022, but which I was never happy with.
