I\u0027ve made several attempts just to build plane huge enough to carry one someday. My latest attempt is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/STndug4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/STndug4h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022STndug4h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is capable of going into LKO and returning with enough fuel to at least try a landing. (Actually you see it here returning from Orbit, heading home. Didn\u0027t make it though, not enough liquid fuel left)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on reentry it flips to it\u0027s back (actually to its tail). I observed this behavior now several times with different spaceplanes, but on the first ones I didn\u0027t take too much care about CoM or CoL, they should fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on this one I had the CoM right in the middle of the cargo bay and CoL was almost next to it. As you can see there\u0027s a fuel tank in front of the cargo bay and one in the back and they\u0027re getting emptied evenly. The liquid fuel tanks are also balanced out around the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt only happens on reentry when hitting the thicker atmosphere.
