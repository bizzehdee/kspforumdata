Let me be clear, right now I am brainstorming ideas on a direction for this mod, if any. One direction is retiring it altogether, which I\u0027m ok with. Multipurpose Colony Modules served a need at a time when we had no custom part categories, no Mk3 space plane parts, and at that time, MKS/OKS didn\u0027t have stock textures. All that has changed and change is good. Change happened before with this mod, when the Mk3 MKS/OKS modules were introduced. MCM kept with the spirit of RoverDude\u0027s mod by offering new efficiency parts. \u003Cp\u003EWith 1.0, new change is afoot. Now, I love the idea of space camping, and I may just create a mod to do that as colony modules in small form doesn\u0027t fit the spirit of MKS.

Or worsen them. It won\u0027t be guaranteed, so if it doesn\u0027t work out then it\u0027s time to pack up and move.

Centering it on explicitly known resource levels would imply mid-to-late game which seems directly at odds with the connotations of the placeholder names offered thus far. It would be neat to see early-game imprecise resource scanning! Like perhaps a sensor that only returns presence/absence of a resource on the body as a whole while in orbit, but can also be used while landed to confirm/deny for that particular location. Heck, for extra fun you can require a kerbal (or perhaps a tiny drill part for probes) to deposit a surface sample before it can work properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could even have multiple sensors that return only the Ones digit of the concentration for a given resource; this even ties nicely into the concept of settling in a place only to find a better spot upriver and moving camp \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E allows that to be a negative outcome! The X2% concentration you abandoned for your spiffy new X7% was in fact a better 52% to a surprisingly dismal 27%.

Removing your parts does not in fact add more play options, in precisely the same manner that removing the Spark upon unlocking the Skipper doesn\u0027t. Instead, it forces gameplay upon a prescriptive path; Voyager analogues must now be built on a 2.5m scale. Yes there is quite a challenge in that but I am quite glad to have both engines available simultaneously!
