If you\u0027re looking for optimizations, here\u0027s a couple things I\u0027ve found that have helped a great deal:\n1) figure out an average angle of attack during your flight, and angle your \u0022wings\u0022 up by that amount in the SPH. That way, your cockpit, fuel tank, engine, etc will be more occluded by the air intake, and you\u0027ll have less drag. For my craft (which is admittedly probably 2.5 times the length of yours), my 5 degree AoA was causing my tail end to drop below the front by nearly a full diameter, effectively doubling my fuselage drag.\n\n2) do you really need the inline reaction wheel?

I used elevons as canards on quite a few designs in this thread and even as primary lifting surface on a few. They can be a bit finicky, though, lending \\*too much\\* control authority in many cases. (Basically no caps lock mode can equal instant death and landing chutes become less about stopping fast and more about not becoming a flaming mass of debris. Then again they are rather tough and can survive some rather severe g loads... Well beyond what would necessitate removal of the pilot from the cockpit via garden hose and shop vac.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T21:25:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**"},{"CreatedByName":"Andi8P","CreatedById":149611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T20:03:37Z","Content":"I will try it.![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\n![njbuhvf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/njbuhvf.jpg)\n\nReady to take off!"},{"CreatedByName":"BenG","CreatedById":150816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T12:41:14Z","Content":"After many failed attempts (most of which were perfect right up until the point I tried to land ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)), here is my entry for Velocity Circumnavigator.
