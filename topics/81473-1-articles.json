I had found an example of a rescue SSTO for all those kerbal in orbit missions, copied the plane from the screenshots and failed horribly. You were all extremely helpful in that regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then took the stock Aeris-4A, and modified it for my rescue SSTO. It has flown to great success and I feel far more confident at flying. I can get in orbit, snag the kerbal and land on the runway every time now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also added some mods, notably:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEAR (not ready for FAR quite yet but wanted something better than stock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESplaceplane\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS/OKS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in building my OKS station, and playing career, I am trying to save costs where I can. I have also been enamoured with the parts from spaceplane\u002B. So I have wanted to build 2 new SSTO\u0027s. A Kerbal shuttle (using the SP\u002B crew module) and a light cargo shuttle, using the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first question is in building. I have found the SPH to be utterly maddening so far. Getting wings to snap on just so and line up takes far more effort than it seems like it should. It seems like i can spend upwards of 30-60 seconds sometimes getting a wing section to \u0022go green\u0022 only to then try and adjust forward or back a little and screw it up. So I didn\u0027t know if there are any tips/tricks/helpful mods I am missing or it is just a clunky interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, with these larger planes the issue is compounded. If while building up the wing I realize it should really be shifted a little, there is no way to grab all the wing sections as a unit. So it seems I have to end up tearing it all down and starting over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the actual ships, my main question is the viability of a horizontal takeoff SSTO cargo hauler. Using tweakscale I can shrink 2 of the MKS cargo cans so that 2 fit perfectly in the spaceplane\u002B cargo bay. completely full they come in at just around 10 tons. Is it possible to build a SSTO to handle that kind of weight without being some huge monstrocity? Or should I consider a more shuttle style rocket assist takeoff/plane landing type of setup?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there any way to get an idea of wing loading/lift characteristics, or is designing the wing a pure trial and error experience?

Crank the control authority to max (back it off if they start tearing off, though), set the rudders to yaw only and the rest to everything but yaw. Set some control surfaces both front and rear as maxed-out spoilers; they\u0027ll flip up to act as downforce-generating airbrakes when you hit the brakes on landing. Also useful for getting canards clear of the ladder you should be putting under the door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The original had RAPIERs on the wings and a turbojet in the middle. This lets you keep the turbojet (only) running at extreme altitude without worrying about asymmetric flameouts or premature mode-switching, and the pure air-breather can take advantage of the ram-air effect when the RAPIERs switch to rocket mode. Plus, turbojets sound a lot nicer than RAPIERs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Run struts from the underside of the wingtips to the fuselage. This doesn\u0027t matter so much in NEAR, but if you switch to FAR you\u0027ll have to deal with the possibility of your wings tearing off if you let your angle of attack become excessive at low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Don\u0027t forget to unlock the steering on your front gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The lights on your landing gear are good enough for a ventral docking port, but you may want some upwards-pointing lights if you\u0027re using the Spaceplane Plus inline dorsal port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Spaceplane Plus includes a supply of RCS fuel in both the cockpit and the inline docking port. Stick a pair of linear RCS thrusters (spaced evenly around CoM) on each facing for use in docking. They can also sometimes save you if you lose control at high altitude. You can stick a linear thruster in the centre of a RAPIER without it getting fried by the exhaust. Make sure you\u0027ve got some pointing forwards as well; rotate them if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Make at least some of your tanks pure liquid fuel (no oxidiser). Because you\u0027re using atmospheric oxygen on the way up, you\u0027ll always have unused oxidiser if you don\u0027t do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Consider putting nacelles behind the intakes. Extra intake plus liquid fuel = bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use fuel lines to control the order in which your tanks drain, and to make sure that you can keep running all engines until the tanks run dry. I usually run a pair of lines from the lateral tanks to the core, then another pair from the core to the lateral engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Vernors can do awesome things for planes. Vectored thrust massively expands the performance envelope, and a few Vernors on the underside will let you do VTOL landings on the Mun or Minmus (hit \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port to orient the navball for this). Keep them turned off until you need them, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use lots of action groups. One to toggle the turbojet, one to toggle the RAPIERs, one to switch modes on the RAPIERs, one to toggle each type of intakes, one to extend your solar panels, one to release whatever\u0027s in the cargo bay, one to toggle the Vernors, one to run a crew report and trigger all the scientific instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Including the Spaceplane Plus drone core segment will let you rescue Kerbals with a single-seater. Alternatively, stick a Stayputnik in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you have high-speed handling issues, just behind each intake is a good place for an ASAS unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Try flying from IVA sometime. It\u0027s a hoot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T14:52:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The original had RAPIERs on the wings and a turbojet in the middle.
