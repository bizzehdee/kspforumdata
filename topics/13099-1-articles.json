Primarily a mining megacorp, Kerbi Ind. dominates the interstellar trade of raw materials, mining equipment, and planetary geologic research. They own huge mining facilities from Minmus to the Teltimus System. Kerbi Industries is a mining empire, worth over 890 billion kerbs and employing millions of kerbonians throughout the cosmos. Estabilished in 2067, Kerbi Industries also had interests and stocks in research and colonization. Until 2094, the company owned a monopoly on colonization research. However, Kerbi Industries was brought to the supreme court at Yibble City in 2094. The monopoly was destroyed, and Kerbi Industries was now rivaled by the government-created Interstellar Research Administration (ISRA). The ISRA is a branch of the Kerbal Space Program. In 2116, the KSP and Kerbi Industries entered a partnership. The partnership was meant to be the most efficient way of colonization possible, and to eliminate animosity. The KSP, and its ISRA, were in charge of research and colonization, while Kerbi Industries was in charge of mining and geologic research. As of 2129, this partnership extends to 56 planets, out of the 498 total planets that have been colonized and settled by the kerbonians.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompany Logos: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g417/cookiedamage/kerbi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbi.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g417/cookiedamage/Kerbonian.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kerbonian.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g417/cookiedamage/kspart.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kspart.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote: Just something I wanted to share.
