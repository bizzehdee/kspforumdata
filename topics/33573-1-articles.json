The name\u0027s Warbird and I\u0027ve been playing KSP since around version .11 or so. My proficiency with KSP is lacking and I have no experience with modding or modeling to speak of. So naturally I\u0027ve decided to develop a mod that needs good amounts of both and lord knows what else! I thought that someone might find the process of me making every possible mistake in existence amusing or possibly educational in a \u0022that\u0027s why you don\u0027t put a fork in an electrical socket\u0022 sort of way, so I\u0027ve decided to document this comedy of errors for future generations. Knowing my luck, this is going to end up being the Boatmurdered of KSP.\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s get started shall we? I may as well be trying to pilot real rockets into space, but you have to learn sometime. No time like the present I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 1: \u0022Oh God What Have I Gotten Myself Into\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the plan. I\u0027m a bit of an aviation fanatic and the idea of subsystems and unnecessary and overcomplicated dodads excites me. I\u0027ve decided that the game needs something similar to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Altitude_Parachute_Extraction_System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELAPES\u003C/a\u003E system.

Why start with a static fuel tank when I could make something completely outside my ability and overly complicated? Let\u0027s get started shall we?\u003Cp\u003EAccording to some wiki pages and posts I sorta half read I\u0027m going to need something to make 3D models and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://unity3d.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnity\u003C/a\u003E or something like that. As I\u0027m cheap, we\u0027ll be forgoing 3DS Max for something called \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.blender.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBlender\u003C/a\u003E. I\u0027ve gone ahead and installed both and some \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/34013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epart tools loader\u003C/a\u003E that I have utterly no idea how to use.

As cubes are not known for their agility or aerodynamic properties, we\u0027ll need to do something about that. After 30 minutes of trying to figure out how to move around and about 12 Google searches later, I\u0027ve got an idea of how to manipulate the object into something more appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YjQUaB3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YjQUaB3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t going to be easy. I\u0027d say I was about as good at this as Jeb is at piloting, but that would be insulting ol\u0027Jeb. Thankfully it turns our that Blender has the ability to automatically import premade shapes, \u0022meshes\u0022 they claim, into the editor for usage. After a good hour\u0027s work I now have something \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Evaguely phallic\u003C/span\u003E more aerodynamically feasible. However, it appears to be solid, and that\u0027s not terribly conducive to storing payloads for dropping off. We\u0027ll have to look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V9GwEww.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V9GwEww.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter an hour and a half of searching, looking for buttons, and multiple attempts to write Python scripts to hollow out the shape (without knowing Python of course), it seems that you can get what I\u0027m aiming for by simply deleting a face of the cylinder. The stupid thing wasn\u0027t hollow to begin with. I want to cry. No time for that though, we have to purdy this thing up a bit. Namely by altering the shape and adding a \u0022door\u0022 to the back of the \u0022plane\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eTau24G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eTau24G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 45 minutes of meticulously planting and plotting each face and point on both the body and door of the plane juuuuuust right, I find something called a Snap Tool. Which does a better job of what I spent the last 3/4ths of an hour doing in less than 5 minutes. My life is pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s if for now, I\u0027ll update in a little bit when I have more to show.

Long term we\u0027re going to be making drag chutes, thingamajiggers to hold payloads in place, animating the whole mess, some god awful textures, and who knows what else. Assuming we even get past me modeling this thing and importing it into the game without putting a fist through my screen or or sobbing in a corner. Anyway, back to the updates, which are going to be sporadic and varying in length, so fair warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 3: \u0022I Reject Your Reality And Substitute My Own\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027re likely thinking, \u0022Warbird, now that you have a rough model worked out, surely you will make a very rough proof of concept animation or something like that?\u0022 And the answer to that would be a resounding \u0022But doing that would make sense!\u0022 We\u0027re adding hinges to this sucker and animating the entire mess at once. \u003Cem\u003EI play Dwarf Fortress for fun\u003C/em\u003E, I am not the sort of person that responds well to rational thought processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sQr3ceX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sQr3ceX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we\u0027re adding some protohinges for the door. How will they work? Don\u0027t know. Am I likely wasting my time? Probably. Am I going to have to throw this out and start over anyway? Most likely.

I threw some cylinders in there to connect the hinges for now. The plan was to have something similar to the lander legs that were first put in the game doing the moving. Heck, it seems pretty Kerbal to me to have them welded on there in typical jury rigging fashion. So we may see them show up if I figure out how to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShorter update today, I got caught up watching a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUCKeEwirZ8\u0026amp;feature=endscreen\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emovie\u003C/a\u003E and got distracted.
