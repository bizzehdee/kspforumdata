Your first planet has no tilt and your first moon is in an equatorial orbit. Beyond that, the difficulty can be scaled up. I\u0027d like to see an axial tilt on the other planets or moons beyond Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T12:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Kerbin isn\u0027t earth.

Right now its quite easy to get into e a nice straight stable horizontal orbit, in line with a lot of the other cellestial bodies like the Mun and some other planets. But if you tilt the planet, the equator moves to a position where that becomes a lot harder to do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact if you want to get into an perfectly horizontal orbit around Earth (considering horizontal as the point where the suns rays hit the earth at 90 dagrees on the equator), there are only a couple of days a year where this is pobbile, in the spriing and in autumm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that would sort of scare away a lot of people, this is still a game not a simulator and it shouldn\u0027t be to complex in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
