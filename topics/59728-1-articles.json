I have had several successful landings on KSC\u0027s runway both from orbit and with regular aircraft, and not once have I have a altitude problem with clearing the mountains.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T07:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never actually had an issue with the mountains... You might be coming in a little too low, too early. If you\u0027re dangerously close to the mountains, it sounds like you\u0027re going to fall quite short of the KSC runway...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vonar","CreatedById":55997,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T07:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the ideal landing approach is to place your periapsis at around 20 kilometers above the Kerbal space center. Presuming your orbit is equatorial generally this will bring you down right on or near the centerline without too much of a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikecorp11","CreatedById":66940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T08:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou guys are right, I did a few more flights with a different plane and noticed that I only hit it with the other plane. I was just using a flawed plane design that could only fly at low altitudes. Thanks for the advice Vonar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever a moderator gets the chance, feel free to close the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T09:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill do.
