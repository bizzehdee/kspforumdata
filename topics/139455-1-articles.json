Due to the way it works, you can (and in fact must) explicitly set up every change you want to make. Everything not explicitly changed remains at default values. The advantage of that is that it won\u0027t change anything you don\u0027t want changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111412-105-ksi-astronaut-complex-overhaul/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAstronaut Complex Overhaul\u003C/a\u003E, as the name suggests, only mods the Astronaut complex. It is simpler to set up and use than Custom Barn Kit. However, it also makes more changes - it changes not only the cost, but also the whole hiring process. This may be something you want, or it may be something you don\u0027t want, I don\u0027t know. Also, unfortunately, this mod is not yet updated to 1.1.2, while Custom Barn Kit is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cornholio","CreatedById":94349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T19:12:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the excellent answer!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
