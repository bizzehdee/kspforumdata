I say \u0022cautiously\u0022 only because the eventual completion of any complex project\u00A0 is uncertain. Nevertheless what I\u0027ve seen in the first 2 patches and in the dev communication so far encourages me. I\u0027m having fun in the game right now, and look forward to a lot more fun as they continue to address bugs and add features.

they\u0027re a part that leverages the aerodynamics feature, and if its anything like KSP1, they\u0027re not greatly different from a control surface, they just deploy and cause a lot of drag because the control surface is deflected so far that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E is very high.\u00A0 You can do all of that with tuning curves in KSP1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I can see why some people would actually expect both more communication about actual feature development -
