For example, my standard abort setup is a tower that fires sepratrons and pulls the capsule free of the main stack. This gets it away from the explosion in a jiffy. However, usually my parachutes are high on the staging list, and I don\u0027t like to waste an action group on them. So, for low altitude aborts, I have to resort to spacebar mashing and hoping that I can get through like 5 or 6 blank stages (as the rocket\u0027s exploded and separated) after the capsule separates just to get the parachutes. I\u0027m normally very safe and never launch without an abort system. My only fatality was from a near-pad abort, where the capsule escaped properly, but I couldn\u0027t mash space fast enough to deploy parachutes. A timer could have been set up to deploy after the sepratrons cut out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a timer would have saved lives! Lives, I tell you! There\u0027s Kerbal blood on my hands!

To have sepatrons or something similar to kick in once you have moved to a safe distance, because of the force from the decoupler, would be nice i think \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T23:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good idea.
