Instead of having to search the internet for it (as I did just now), maybe it\u0027d be nice to have a smiley for it? Like :root: or :$: or something? Likewise, the \u0022dV\u0022 we all use is also actually wrong. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice if there was an easy way to type \u0022\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u0022 (Thanks Astropapi1 for the suggestion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are likely other symbols that we use a lot that would be nice to be more easily typeable.
