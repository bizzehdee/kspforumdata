The gimbaling works flawlessly but to toggle flaps / airbrakes it acts like it is in radial symmetry. Strangely enough, I imported a craft from 1.0.5 grabbed an assembled wing in mass off the plane. Reattached in mirror symmetry and some control surfaces work as they did in 1.0.5 but other are borked.
