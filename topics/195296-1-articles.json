AppData is a hidden folder so you may need to enable \u0027show hidden folders\u0027 to see it; if it isn\u0027t there, try just searching through all your files to find it, which will take longer but should make it show up. Player.txt has much more information than KSP.txt so is more useful for finding out why/how things broke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
