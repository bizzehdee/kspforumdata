But after a disc wipe i decided to stick to mere or less stock parts. Currently I have MechJeb, Crew Manifest and Chatterer for some ambiance:).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo moving to the actual topic: my first project in brand-new loads-of-parts-free KSP is to build a modular system capable of constructing space stations and interplanetary ships. It resulted in quite sturdy piece of space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECharacteristics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECupola cockpit; ASAS module*3; large remote control module*4; jumbo tank*2; large solar panel*2; 1x6 solar panels*4; large docking port*4; common docking port*4; Hitchhiker module; MechJeb module; Jebidiah Kerman. Max Electric charge: 8755; Max Monopropellent 1290 (851 left); Max fuel: 6660; Max oxi: 8140. My main problem is that engine module consisting of 4 atomic engines had fatal design flaw resulting in ripping it apart during final staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Whole thing in orbit currently has mass of 108.10 t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question to the experienced spacejunk engineers is what engine block can make this trash bin reach other planets without killing Jeb with old age? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso how many fuel will i need? I had a kethane drilling munbase before so I have at least some experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: I know my rocket is ugly but i wanted to put whole thing in orbit in one run without whole rendezvous routine. Was kinda cool, Apollo style too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hI8hzTx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hI8hzTx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B20AmxU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022B20AmxU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T01:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the welcome aboard forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, welcome aboard! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, make sure to read the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48073-Forum-FAQ-%E2%80%93-Answers-for-New-Users\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eforum FAQ\u003C/a\u003E to net end up posting your thread twice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheIV","CreatedById":84045,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T08:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your kindness, sorry for double post - it was a hiccup in mah browser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso here is a fresh photo of Bill chilling at north pole after orbital drop test of my new control, escape, landing and survival module for large crafts.
