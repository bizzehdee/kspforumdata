Both airlock doors open inward. When the airlock is pressurized, the force holding the outer door closed is far greater than what the door actuator can overcome. Likewise when the airlock is depressurized, the inner door is held shut by the air pressure in the ship. You need to close the inner door and depressurize the airlock before you can open the outer door, or close the outer door and pressurize the airlock before you can open the inner door. It\u0027s a simple failure-safe physical method of preventing both airlock doors from being open at the same time. Overriding this would require the actuators that open the doors to be strong enough to overcome the force of the ship\u0027s air pressure on the door, but the designers of the ship would have no reason to do that, especially as it would make the ship less safe if a software failure could open both doors and depressurize it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
