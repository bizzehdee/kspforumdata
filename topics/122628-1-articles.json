It was made because mk3 parts, I have found out, have VERY weak joints for their size. It flies like it wants to be a fighter. It glides as slow as a turtle yet does not plummet like a rock. It is SO fun to fly for me. It has a lot of bombs as you can see. I have yet to test it very heavily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T00:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour bombs won\u0027t do a lot of damage, it requires somewhere between 10 and 16 tons to actually damage a building.
