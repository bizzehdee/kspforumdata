Can I do this or does it just work with either MAX and MIN values?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-16T09:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way that I can think of is to use a KAL-1000 controller. You can set two different (or not!) values at the start and the end of the (shortened) sequence and then put: \u0022Play Sequence\u0022, \u0022Set Loop Mode to Once\u0022, and \u0022Set Play Direction to Forward [Reverse]\u0022 on an action group to select the setting at the end [or start] of the sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vjaas","CreatedById":200787,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-16T10:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the swift reply Hans \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems slightly more convoluted than I initially thought. It would be so much easier if you could just type in a value in the same vein as you would, using the max or min parameters that you can add to the action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight there be any mods that add this functionality to pistons, hinges and the like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, I assume the KAL would be necessary to get some more complex things going anyway.
