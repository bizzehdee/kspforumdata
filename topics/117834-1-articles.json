(essentially moving the CoM far from the CoL.)\n\nAngle of incidence pretty much allows you to have a different AoA than what your current attitude would permit."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T01:34:25Z","Content":"A variable incidence wing can help with low speed approach and control, see F-8 Crusader.\n\nTilting the tailplanes or wings of a craft can also help to maintain a proper trim angle for certain configurations that would be \u0027uncontrollable\u0027 at zero incidence.\n\nIt can also be used to affect the flight attitude of a craft - Fw-190 for instance had a famous nose-down flying attitude due to angle of incidence. This gives better visibility from the cockpit, as otherwise some frontal view would be \u0027blocked\u0027 if flying at positive angles of attack.\n\nI also change the incidence to ensure proper positioning of CoL for a given payload rating. (Yes this ship is unstable for a reason - I need the CoL right there both for STOL performance, and to allow this design to cruise at 15,000m close to Mach 3.0 to match original source material)\n\n![Pf4hN9J.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Pf4hN9J.jpg)\n\nNotice the wings have a slight *negative* angle of incidence. This is because I am maximizing body lift as the wings are extremely short! The F-35 has stubby wings and a blended wing design, so does this (somewhat!)\n\nIf you look very closely there is a set of very small basic fins mounted on the nose. They have a large positive angle of incidence to optimize airflow and supersonic trim. \n\n![XbHthhS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XbHthhS.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T01:43:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 01:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T01:41:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve noticed that tilting a wing pulls the Center of Lift icon towards the wing in question.

Be careful of Mk2 fuselages though.\n\nLift surfaces only generate lift force if they have an AoA to prograde. Wing incidence increases AoA which increases lift. However, since it has a greater AoA than other surfaces, it will also stall earlier. Furthermore, since it has a different AoA than other surfaces, CoL will migrate depending on craft AoA! In fact, migrating CoL is one way to visualize how control surfaces give control authority."},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T08:17:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If most of your lifting surfaces have the same incidence you should have a craft that\u0027s just as predictable.\n\nI would argue that. When building an airliner in KSP, I usually add some positive incidence to the main wing to get more lift from that wing while cruising. By default, the aircraft will want to pitch down now. To counter act this torque, I usually have to add some negative incidence to the tailplane. That doesn\u0027t cost me much in terms of lift (because the wing area of the tailplan is small compared to the main wing) but makes the craft fly straight at its desinged cruising speed. \n\nWhen you are not going at cruising speed, it will still want pitch a little but not as bad as if I only add incidence to the main wing."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T11:51:36Z","Content":"The current CoL is fake.

Without positive incidence, a lot of subsonic designs with higher wing loadings require excessive elevator trim to maintain cruise attitude. They also look silly flying at excessive angles of attack and incur a drag penalty that way.\n\nPositive incidence wings ftw ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:08:17Z","Content":"Lol, that big one reminds me of the Caspian Sea Monster.
