I built and now fly a quadcopter (shown in my avatar), and I can tell you, wind is their worst enemy. They\u0027re pretty durable (a 40 dollar arduino-based flight controller can usually run in the -15C to 40C range), but they are easily gusted by wind. Another issue is that if the flight controller encounters an error, there is a fair chance of the quadcopter doing a \u0022flop\u0022. This has never happened to me (luckily), but when it does, your quadcopter will flip upside down and stop working. One of those bugs that will always be there. Finally, there\u0027s the whole radio frequency thing. My quadcopter runs on 2.4GhZ and 900MhZ frequencies, and both of those only go for a relatively short distance. What would you do if the quadcopter was on the wrong side of the planet? You can always set it to do a position/altitude hold, but position hold requires GPS. You could land it, but who knows what will be down there? You could send satellites up to control it, but that would cost a HUGE amount of money. I love the idea, but it\u0027s flawed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T19:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe range of the radio has more to do with transmit power and receiver sensitivity than frequency. consumer grade parts are not going to have the range of some of the space/military grade equivalent hardware. those consumer grade parts are also limited by fcc regs and aren\u0027t very powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
