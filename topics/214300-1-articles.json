So a high setting is like giving it a crunchy rusted bearing, and setting it to 0 turns it into something like a really high quality and lubed up bearing?

So with zero friction, the nosewheel loses its ability to ruin your takeoff run by turning you off the runway. I suspect the wheel in its current state is modelled as a vertical peg with the wheel attached dead centre. There is no natural tendency for the wheel to return to a \u0022straight ahead\u0022 condition if modelled this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit for the plane nerds: Yes, usually aircraft achieve caster by different means than a typical shopping cart wheel, usually the big metal uses dampers, etc to achieve the same effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-03T20:39:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2023 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Meecrob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
