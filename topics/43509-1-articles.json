There were some stability issues, the planetary stage was over powered, it was short on RCS (mostly because of the instability), and took forever to refuel in orbit because of all the little tanks. So I think I would rework it with a heavier launch vehicle from kerbal to limit the refueling, remove some nuclear engines, and strengthen the linkage between the two halves.

The lander has right around that, its very tight. It also jettisons all its parachutes before takeoff to shave off mass (you can see they are all on radial decouplers). Once in orbit, what remains of the lander returns to the interplanetary stage, fills back up on fuel, crossfeed is disabled, and the remainder of the fuel on the planetary stage is burned on the way back to kerbal (there wasn\u0027t much left), the lander then finishes the burn and lands under its own power on kerbal (parachutes are too expensive to take off with), I think I only had 130ish or so dv remaining when falling into kerbal\u0027s atmosphere, which fortunately is all you need, thanks to the drag (even without parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I can take some screenshots of the two parts in the hanger:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PCRrcgP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PCRrcgP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nv5TVgb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nv5TVgb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-23T02:53:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2013 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Entelin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T06:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see your lander use a lot of Aerospike engines.
