That would be awesome. But many of the problems mentioned in my thread still apply - it would be a lot of effort on Squad\u0027s part. I wouldn\u0027t count on it, but who knows? Maybe one day this actually will be implemented. I\u0027d love to move my Kerbals\u00A0around with tunnels and walkways instead of having to send them out into space and awkwardly shift them around. It would make space stations a thousand time more interesting a thousand times more interesting as well. The possibilities are endless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
