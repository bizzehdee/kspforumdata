Unless you have a really good reason to go retrograde (such as a rescue mission on a pod that is also retrograde), always go prograde, as your motion relative to the surface will be less, and landings will be easier.\n\n\\* if you don\u0027t see the predicted course, then zoom out.

As long as you\u0027re not ham-fisted and are far away, you can do this very safely.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T11:41:20Z","Content":"As other said, focus on the target body.
