It mysteriously lost contact after a few days in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 2034 AD: Many space crafts have been sent to all planets and moons. Many lose contact similar to Kerbnik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 2035 AD: The cause of the loss of contact of ships is found to be the Deep Space Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 2037 AD: A crew is sent to Bop to kill the Deep Space Kraken, along with 20 other Kerbals for back-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 2038 AD: Almost all of the Kerbals die in the war against the Deep Space Kraken, but eventually, in a deus ex machina, the Kraken is killed when a reinforcement ship crashes into the Kraken\u0027s mouth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 3465: Kerbin is a very peaceful planet with advanced technology, and loves to travel in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 3468: A asteroid is spotted heading torwards Kerbin. KSP, the richest company in the world because of Kerbal\u0027s love for space travel, begins work secretly on Force Fields, cloning, gentic improvements, and a massive underground city to help the Kerbalnaughts and other KSP employees survive the asteroid, which was named Mortis, after the kerbal god of death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 3470: KSP completes its research and puts a force field up around KSP. KSP starts choosing people to live in the underground city. Most other Kerbals evacuate to a distant solar system, never to return. KSP takes in the people who couldn\u0027t make it into the evacuation ship, out of kindness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 3471: The bunker is closed down. Mortis hits kerbin, and creates a large crater, which can still be seen on Kerbin today. The dust and smoke blocked out the sky, killing off most plants. Kerbals were sent out to investigate, and came back with a virus and died quickly before spreading it. KSP sealed of again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 1 SE/Year 3671: Kerbals sent out to investigate the world. No life remains, the virus killed off all life but the grass, which is immune to the virus. Suits are required to go out on the surface. A new era is founded, SE, or space era, because KSP is now focused on space travel, in memory of the old ages, and almost all info about the other planets and moons was lost. Despire researching gentic improvments for Kerbals, they never used them. They use the gentics on the Kerbalnaughts. The space age has begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-21T13:14:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2013 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ninjakids\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded much more content\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinduli","CreatedById":14639,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T11:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had assumed this would go back to when Kerbals were evolving.
