He was holding a small portable radio and was wearing a deep blue officer uniform with a crimson regulation tie. He looked young but had an old look in his eye which was focused on the small brown radio. The radio spat out the announcement with a tinny, poor quality and it irritated the kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We are at war with -[sTATIC]\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Crap! God damned radio never works!\u0022 The kerbal screeched with frustration. He had a strong voice. There was a knock at the office door and another kerbal appeared. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb! Have you heard the news?\u0022 asked the anxious young Bill Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aye, but I never got all of it \u0027cause of this poor excuse for a radio...\u0022 said Jebediah Kerman. He proceed to drop the radio on the floor and stamp on it repeatedly until it was a smoking mess of wires and circuits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022C\u0027mon Jeb, we need to go down south anyway for combat training.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Since when?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Since five minutes ago when I was phoned by Fighter Command HQ.\u0022 said Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay then...just, just gimme a minute...\u0022 said Jeb, whose eye was now twitching ferociously. He ran across the room to the cupboard and threw on a life-jacket and a flight-suit. The two kerbals stepped outside for the small office hut and sitting next to the hut was a multitude of different fighter aircraft. There were single engined, twin engine, quad engined aircraft scattered around the airfield. Sleeping on a small deck-chair next to a large \u003Cem\u003EInferno\u003C/em\u003E fighter was the third-in-command - Bob Kerman. The majority of the squadron had already left for the south. Bill walked over the the sleeping Bob and tickled his feet. Bob started giggling, then he abruptly woke up spouting the words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who is there, huh?\u0022 He was breathing heavily and immediately fell back to sleep. Jeb slapped Bob as hard as he could along his green cheeks and Bob again woke up with a scream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, what...wh-\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You need to get up you lazy bigot. We\u0027re at war. How long have you been sleeping?\u0022 interrupted Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A few hours..what do you mean war?\u0022 he roared. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just get in your plane and follow us. We\u0027ll explain it on the way there.\u0022 said Jeb. The three ran to their respected fighter planes. Bob got into his plane, Bill awkwardly clambered into his \u003Cem\u003ESpiteful\u003C/em\u003E twin while Jeb wielded the new \u003Cem\u003EComet\u003C/em\u003E fighter. It was sleek and all-metal. It\u0027s wings were long and slim and it\u0027s performance was amazing in every possible way. He tapped a few switched and levers as the engine sparked into life. The three-bladed propeller started to rotate slowly, then started to pick up pace and just as it became a blur. The whole aircraft shook as the flames danced from the exhaust like little ballerinas. The instrument panel shook with the immense power of the engine. Slowly but surely he started to open the throttle. Once he found himself on the dirt runway he rammed the throttle forwards and the plane almost immediately leapt skyward heading towards the setting sun. The three formed up and set a course down south. They were distressed and uncertain of their future..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-09T14:41:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2014 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MightyDarkStar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MightyDarkStar","CreatedById":115126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T18:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was dark, very dark. Three small aircraft flew at fifty feet off the deck at top speed. The four engines roared as they skimmed across the grassy valleys of southern Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three aircraft were three that we have in our own world. There was a \u003Cem\u003ESpiteful\u003C/em\u003E \u0027Four-Cannon\u0027 fighter with two powerful \u003Cem\u003EPheonix\u003C/em\u003E engines generating 885 horsepower each, giving it a top speed of 380 mph, and as it\u0027s nickname suggests, is armed with four heavy cannon in the nose just in front of the pilot. The pilot was the average-Joe in the trio, Bob Kerman. He wasn\u0027t great but he wasn\u0027t bad either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second aircraft in the formation is an \u003Cem\u003EInferno\u003C/em\u003E bomber-destroyer. Armed with \u003Cstrong\u003ETWELVE \u003C/strong\u003E.303 calibre machine guns and harnessed the awesome power of a \u003Cem\u003ECentaur\u003C/em\u003E engine - with around 1,200 horsepower - driving a four-bladed propeller which gives it a top speed of roughly 340 mph. It is the largest aircraft in the trio with a metal forward fuselage and wings while the rear body is of wood and canvas construction. Piloting that plane was the naive and inexperienced young Bill Kerman. He excelled in pilot school and is second in command only to the final pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last aircraft, leading the pack is a \u003Cem\u003EComet\u003C/em\u003E I. It was all metal with sleek lines and gorgeous elliptical wings. It is armed with two heavy cannon and is dragged along by a \u003Cem\u003EMirlyn \u003C/em\u003Einline engine. The plane is by far the fastest and most manoeuvrable of the squad, able to bat along at around 400 mph and can run rings around any racer. Only the best of the best get to fly it like the venerable Jebediah \u0027Jeb\u0027 Kerman. There is more more for me to say is there? Its Jeb!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir country had declared war on another who was run by an evil and racist dictator that ordered the invasion of many allied, and defenceless countries. The three pilots were great but they need proper combat training. They were flying towards the south where apparently there was a new training school planned to be set up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was very dark, too dark. Jeb looked towards the last failing inch of sunlight over the horizon. He spotted something, it was just a dot but it was moving. He called out to his wingmen through the RT system,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, boys. D\u0027ya see that? There on the horizon?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh god yes! Do you thing its an enemy plane? \u0022 exclaimed the excited Bill\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A\u0027right. We\u0027re gonna go investigate this. Bob! You awake? Said Jeb softly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah yeah, keep yer trousers on.\u0022 replied Bob rather bitterly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb pointed his Spitfire towards the aircraft with ease and rammed the throttle to full power. The others did the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dot became more defined as he closed in. He flicked a switch and a large orange ring with four crossbars appeared suspended on front of his face. He aimed at the banking aircraft just beyond the horizon. Squinting, Jeb focused on the tail of the plane..it had a Cross printed in bold black on the tail. It was an enemy fighter. Grasping onto his control column, he pulled in into his stomach to catch the aircraft as it pulled out of its turn. The harness bit viciously into his shoulders as he struggled to keep behind the fighter. The plane was clearly defined and was a \u003Cem\u003EMonsoon 322\u003C/em\u003E. Jeb rammed the rudder left and pushed the control column forward praying for luck.. that he got. His fighter ended up hardly twenty metres behind his foe. He brought his aircraft to bear only to pull the dreaded trigger, hoping he wasn\u0027t too late. He heard small boom sounds rapidly repeating,with a satisfying shudder off went the tracer shells. At once he noticed blinding explosions on the fuselage of the enemy and then.. There was a huge explosion of smoke and flame. As Jeb looked in the opposite direction he saw shrapnel and debris fly past his cockpit canopy. When he looked back there was no enemy to be seen. Had he destroyed him? He rolled upside down to look up. A terrifying explosion hit the ground at that instant. Jeb was overjoyed! He had shot down his first fighter within a matter of hours after the declaration of war!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe pulled off a satisfying victory roll and rejoined his little formation. In the distance he spotted a white tarmac airstrip. He glanced at his map, then back at the environment. They were there. The aircraft dropped their gear and flaps while lowering throttle to 50%. The three lined up with the runway and one by one, bounced down on to the new runway. With a bit of a wobble, Jeb taxied to the dispersal and proceeded to shut down his powerful Merlin engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe slid back the perspex hood over his head to find a sight he was not expecting to see...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-09T14:48:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2014 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MightyDarkStar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERewriting Basic Grammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MightyDarkStar","CreatedById":115126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T22:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb threw open the small exit hatch to the left side of the cockpit. He scanned the airbase but there was no one. There was only Bill, Bob and himself. Jeb stepped onto the metal wing and jumped down into the damp, muddy ground surrounding the dispersal area. His wingmen did the same as he began wandering around searching for at least \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Eform of life, be it an officer, a pilot, a farmer, a schoolboy, anything! There was absolutely no one.

It turns out that a huge convoy transporting the majority of the qualified pilots had been utterly decimated by Zerst\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6rer fighter-bombers.

Bill clambered onto the wing of his old \u003Cem\u003EInferno\u003C/em\u003E and clumsily climbed into, almost fell into the cramped cockpit. The fitted jumped up onto the wing of the plane and tied up the harness for Bill, whose head was aching from hitting it off of the canopy trying to get into his fighter. Jeb helped out with the fitter by attaching a 500 lb bomb to the fairing bolted onto an attachment point a bit earlier. After that, Jeb walked up to his own plane - a new \u003Cem\u003EBull CAS \u003C/em\u003E- , broke open the side hatch and sat in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill flicked on the fuel pump, lowered flaps, applied the parking brake, primed the engine, checked the pressure, flicked on the magnetos, done! He pressed a button on the side console to his left, which opened up the ignition and supercharger staging toggles for start-up. He reached over to the two buttons and held them down for a couple of seconds. The prop slowly began turning to the left, then sparks flashed from the exhausts and then a the engine gave a mighty roar and started. The huge engine shook the whole aircraft, the torque blowing over the fitter standing only a few feet from the plane. This thrill is what Bill loved, the noise, the power, the almost elegant danger of it all. Bill shut the canopy hood, and opened the throttle a bit so as he could taxi out of the hanger to give Jeb some room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESat in the frankly tiny cockpit of the Bull was Jeb, flicking many switches, holding down buttons, etc. He reached over and pressed the starter button. Immediately the engine screamed power and let the prop rip. Just before, the fitter had fitted eight Air-Ground unguided rockets under the wings and a single 500 lb bomb under the fuselage. He opened up the taps to form up with Bill by the runway edge. Control gave them clearance for take-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines roared as, at full power, the planes ripped down the runway and effortlessly leapt into the almost dangerously blind weather.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a half-hour or so flying very low, very fast over the western landscape Jeb spotted a platoon of tanks slowly rolling east. He could easily tell they were enemy tanks, even in that weather as enemy tanks had a specific hull shape that was very different to allied ones. The Bull stubbornly curved round to line up with the column. Jeb tapped the low-altitude supercharger toggle as he approached 300 mph and the engine screamed like never before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWHOOOOSSHH!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rockets went off flying straight towards the vehicles.
