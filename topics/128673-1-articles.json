launcher 90 degrees, and then reattach to the payload.\u00A0 Don\u0027t rotate the pod or probe core because this will change the orientation of the pitch and yaw axes on the launch pad.\u00A0 For example, suppose you rotate the pod 90\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E clockwise in the VAB.\u00A0 Now to perform an eastward gravity turn you have to pitch down using the W key rather than yaw right

default line of sight in the VAB is different than on the launch pad.\u00A0 When you are in the VAB and looking out the door toward the launch pad, you are looking east.\u00A0 When you click the launch button and move your rocket out to the launch pad, the default line of sight is now looking north.\u00A0 So if you want your SRBs on the north and south sides of the rocket, they need to be on the left and right sides of the rocket when in the VAB and looking out toward the launch pad.\u00A0 This is just the opposite of the way they will appear on the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would contend that doing the separate-and-rotate-just-the-rocket that you suggest would be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E confusing, at least to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe case where it mattes how the rocket is facing is when the rocket has either bilateral or radial-two symmetry, e.g. has \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etwo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E radial attachments that are on the left and right (not top and bottom) sides of the rocket as it heads east.\u00A0 Essentially, this means you\u0027re flying the rocket like a plane-with-really-crappy-glide-ratio.\u00A0 For me, at least, this is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efar\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E less confusing to have a command pod (and navball) that lines up with the left and right boosters, so I\u0027m doing a pitch-down maneuver rather than a yaw-right maneuver.\u00A0 Maybe other folks would do better, but for me, a procedure such as you suggest would get stuck sideways in my brain and cause cognitive dissonance.\u00A0 It would be like trying to fly an airplane that has the cockpit mounted such that it\u0027s rolled 90 degrees relative to the rest of the plane:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ephysically\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E just as flyable, but \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ementally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hard to cope with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also means that I have a consistent experience with those cases where I actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eam\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E launching a spaceplane vertically off the pad-- that\u0027s one where you really do want to be doing pitch-down rather than yaw-right.\u00A0 Planes handle pitch maneuvers much more gracefully than yaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing what is (for me) the less confusing path of simply rotating the whole rocket kit-and-kaboodle so that it faces east rather than north, it does mean that I have to remember that for this ship, the gravity turn needs to be \u0022pitch down\u0022 and not \u0022yaw right\u0022.\u00A0 But I find that the lesser of two evils, here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your other point, concerning line of sight in VAB versus the launch pad:\u00A0 You make a good point in terms of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Einitial camera angle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, but in the interest of avoiding potential confusion, it\u0027s worth noting that the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ephysical orientation\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is the same for both.\u00A0 The orientation of the ship is exactly the same in the VAB as it is on the launch pad; the only difference is which way the camera initially faces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Squad would save players a lot of confusion if they would just change the behavior so that,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nthe default

north\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would mean that VAB default camera, launchpad default camera, and ship default orientation would all match up, and bilaterally symmetric rockets (which are a very common design) would have the naturally favorable orientation as well.\u00A0 Doing this would mean that all existing KSP players would need to get used to the idea that \u0022I pitch down after launch\u0022 rather than \u0022I yaw right after launch\u0022, but that would just be a one-time thing and I think wouldn\u0027t be that big an
