More specifically, a hard (err.. hard-ish) sci-fi short story. But I need to know, how much would an asteroid weigh if it was around 8km in size? I\u0027m basing it around the Munroe asteroid (because it\u0027s named after the creator of xkcd) and Randall Munroe has stated that it it is \u00226-10km\u0022 in diameter. However, I can\u0027t seem to find any info on how high density asteroids have. the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=4942\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmall-body Database Browser\u003C/a\u003E has no answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fumbling in the dark here, can someone pass me the flashlight?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VirtualCLD","CreatedById":81542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T10:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChelyabinsk meteor\u003C/a\u003E was estimated to be approximately 12000-13000 metric tons with a diameter of 20m. So, taking a cue from an old physics joke, \u0022assume the asteroid is a perfect sphere\u0022 and since mass increases withe the cube of the radius, extrapolate from there. Basically: density = mass/volume, volume = 4/3*pi*r^3. Find density of Chelyabinsk meteor, use density to find mass of gigantic asteroid. Too lazy to do math now (in bed), but realize that density can vary widely in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, I get a density of about 0.373 metricT/m^3 if we assume Chelyabinsk was 12.5k metricT, so an 8000m asteroid would be about 8E11 metrics or 800,000,000,000 metricTons.
