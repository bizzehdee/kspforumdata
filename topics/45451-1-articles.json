I\u0027ve tried the stock and made my own planes that fly well but when I attempt to make a SSTO it gets to 70km(if even that) but I don\u0027t have enough fuel to round it out. What am I doing wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T19:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat ascent profile are you flying in attempting to get your SSTO to orbit, as they usually differ from how you would fly a rocket to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T20:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^ What he said. We need more information to figure out where you\u0027re going wrong. How high and fast are you going before you switch to your jet engines?
