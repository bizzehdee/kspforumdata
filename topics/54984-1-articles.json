I\u0027ve got an 9000-ton SSTO booster for lifting stuff like this; it\u0027s a giant brick of rockets, basically, so there are plenty of points for attaching awkward payloads to the top. and the design is close enough to symmetrical that rockets attached to the bottom of the central stack can safely lift it without any balance issues. The rover actually has enough built-in rockets to have a TWR of about 2 on Mun (1320 kN for 400 tons), and obviously plenty of fuel, so landing under its own power shouldn\u0027t be an issue. I\u0027m just not done tweaking the design yet, so I haven\u0027t actually put one on Mun in this version, but I\u0027ve done it before with slightly smaller versions before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of my old 0.19 version, after safely landing on Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XELA1KU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XELA1KU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerversely, the weak point in the new design is the wheels; on Kerbin, they just aren\u0027t strong enough to deal with the strain of a 400-ton rover. The 20 wheels do just fine when it\u0027s standing still, but go over any angles in the terrain, or try to make a turn, and one of the tires usually blows. This shouldn\u0027t be as bad on Mun or Minmus, though. I know there are mods looking to add caterpillar treads, and once those are ready I\u0027ll replace all the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kiwiak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kiwiak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat mod is this greenhouse from?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the most recent version of HOME. (The older versions used a fixed 3-way symmetry, as seen in the screenshot of the old rover above.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hub to which they attach doubles as a 9.5-ton fuel tank, but it also works nicely as a 4-way connector (as seen in the lower part of the central stack, where I use one to connect the various directions). The greenhouses themselves do nothing, but they only mass 0.5 tons and they look nice. For a manned moon base, I feel they\u0027re an aesthetic necessity. It\u0027s why I\u0027ve also got an array of them on my 800-ton space stations; when you\u0027ve got that much mass already, another couple tons of dead weight doesn\u0027t hurt much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut honestly, that 400-ton rover isn\u0027t really practical, given how far apart the resource fields are. It\u0027s a proof-of-concept for once the real resource system is in place, but Kethane doesn\u0027t have problems with landing at a single location and refining all the fuel you need. That\u0027s why I invented the \u003Cstrong\u003EValdez\u003C/strong\u003E class of mobile Kethane refineries:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cpQASZo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cpQASZo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one refueling on Pol. Fully filled it runs about 300 tons; it\u0027s got enough thrust to land on anything lighter than Mun, so I\u0027ve got copies of it at Gilly, Ike, Minmus, and two based at Pol (one of which moves down to Laythe), plus a couple acting as fuel depots in Kerbin orbit. And it\u0027s designed to basically act as a space station, refueling other vessels as necessary. Here is one refueling Jeb\u0027s favorite spaceplane over Laythe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yGayJ4T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yGayJ4T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 300 tons, it carries enough fuel to refuel one of those spaceplanes about a dozen times before it\u0027d have to return to Pol to refuel. The engines are hybrid ions (ISP 900), from a mod of course, so it shouldn\u0027t have a problem making that trip. Getting to Pol from low Kerbin orbit took about 2/3rds of its onboard fuel, and it needed almost 100,000 Kethane to refill after that trip, but it\u0027s definitely doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I launch it? With the Brick-21:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hv7OpRZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hv7OpRZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a stack of 21 3.75m rocket stacks, linked together. It\u0027s an SSTO design, just under 5000 tons at launch, that safely places any payload under about 400 tons in a circular Kerbin orbit before de-orbiting itself to prevent debris accumulation. The Brick-29 and Brick-37 are made for larger payloads; I\u0027ll use a 37 for the big rover once it\u0027s ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also got a 500-ton combination refinery, using a 450-ton orbital fuel depot and a 50-ton kethane-refining lander. It\u0027s more useful for places with Mun-level gravity, and also works better as a rescue vessel. At the moment, I only have a couple around Mun and Minmus, but in previous versions I had three at Jool, two at Duna, two at Eve, and seven in the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, if you think MY designs are huge, go look at Whackjob\u0027s big Kethane-refining lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T23:55:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panfish5","CreatedById":74937,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T03:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow I usually place my kethane bases with one launch seeing that multiple launches are a bit of a pain.
