upgraded the build rate to a 7 so that my manned rockets would be built in a more timely rate, my unmanned rockets would be outrageously fast.\u00A0 At a 7 build rate, my Luna 1 rocket (and probe) would take about 8 days to build while the Vostok would take about 52 days.\u00A0 I get that the man rated capsule probably took longer to assemble and all than the pretty simple Luna 1 impactor probe, but the time difference seems extreme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it\u0027s got nothing to do with my using premade tanks versus PP.\u00A0 My complete Vostok 1 rocket shows build cost 10221, Rollout cost 111476.8 and build time (at 1.25) of about 290d.\u00A0 If I remove the rocket and just look at the Vostok pod, SM, decoupler and parachute (just 4 parts), I\u0027m looking at build cost of 4411, Rollout cost of 75085.1 and build time (at 1.25) of basically 250 days.\u00A0 So my rocket (excluding the Vostok capsule) only costs 5810, with Rollout cost of 36391.7\u00A0and build time (at 1.25) of about 40 days.\u00A0 The Rollout Cost of just the launch vehicle still seems a little on the high side, but not outrageously so.\u00A0 And the build cost and build time both seem just fine.\u00A0 It\u0027s the Vostok capsule that\u0027s the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe issue seems to simply be how the Rollout Cost and Build time are calculated for the pod.\u00A0 If I remove everything but the pod itself, that one part has a build cost of 1813 (doesn\u0027t seem outrageous), Rollout Cost of 61819.7 (seems VERY high) and build time (at 1.25) of basically 227 days (also seems VERY high).\u00A0 That basically means that 78% of the build time, and 55% of the Rollout Cost,\u00A0is for a single part which seems crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the other \u0022manned\u0022 rocket I\u0027m working on.\u00A0 My Mercury-Redstone.\u00A0 It\u0027s showing build cost 6278, rollout cost 16761.5 and build time 32.5 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I take away the launch vehicle and just work with the Mercury capsule it shows build cost 3887, rollout cost 11614.2 and build time 18 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the Mercury pod alone shows build cost 3202, rollout cost 9756.8 and build time 14.5 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are more parts in the Mercury (9 vs 4 on the Vostok).\u00A0 It\u0027s launch mass is 2.722t vs 5.13t for the Vostok.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUltimately, the build time and rollout cost for the Mercury/Redstone is not outrageous.\u00A0 But apparently the heavier\u00A0(2.502t vs 1.011t), but less expensive (1802 vs 2502), Vostok needs 6 times more rollout cost (61819.7 vs 9756.8) and 15 times more build time (226d21h vs 14d10h).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: So I figured out some of the equation.\u00A0 And some of the reason the Mercury pod is so much less expensive and faster to build than the Vostok.\u00A0 The Mercury pod has\u00A0ModuleTagAvionics,\u00A0ModuleTagEngineSolid,\u00A0ModuleTagHumanRated, \u0026amp;\u00A0ModuleTagReentry.\u00A0 Vostock has\u00A0ModuleTagAvionics,\u00A0ModuleTagHabitable,\u00A0ModuleTagHumanRated, \u0026amp;\u00A0ModuleTagReentry.\u00A0 I\u0027m not really sure why the Mercury is tagged as \u0022ModuleTagEngineSolid\u0022 since it doesn\u0027t have a built\u00A0in solid rocket motor and I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s not listed as \u0022ModuleTagHabitable\u0022.\u00A0 I created a temporary file to reset\u00A0ModuleTagEngineSolid to\u00A0ModuleTagHabitable.\u00A0 Now my Mercury pod alone costs 2502, rollout cost of 20175.6 and build time of basically 57days.\u00A0 So that change had an effect of the rollout cost and build time.\u00A0 But it still doesn\u0027t explain why the Vostok pod has such a higher rollout cost or build time.\u00A0 The Vostok pod is less expensive and as far as I can tell from the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula, the mass of the part isn\u0027t a factor.\u00A0 Also, the Mercury pod has a higher part variable (0.14166699999999999 vs 0.13750000000000001).\u00A0 So you\u0027d expect the Mercury Pod to have higher rollout cost and build time.\u00A0 Unfortunately, there are some variables in RolloutCostFormula that I can\u0027t identify, so I can\u0027t determine if there\u0027s another error on the Mercury pod or an error on the Vostok pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: So after alot of digging, I think I know what the issue is.\u00A0 So, as a test, I altered the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula by removing the \u0022[PV]*[MV]*\u0022 at the beginning of the equation.\u00A0 Then I went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and pulled up the Mercury Pod.\u00A0 The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E site I\u0027m testing at only has a build rate of 1.0.\u00A0 The build time is listed as 21d4h3m31s with a rollout cost of 10369.6.\u00A0 And the Vostok shows 12d3h7m35s with a rollout cost of 8597.8.\u00A0 That makes sense as the part cost for the Mercury capsule is higher than the Vostok.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I exited the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and again adjusted the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula.\u00A0 This time I just removed the \u0022[MV]*\u0022 portion.\u00A0 So I should be including the\u00A0Part_Variables in the cost.\u00A0 Went back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Mercury capsule now shows build time of 3d6h40m51s and rollout cost of 6862.6.\u00A0 So the PV definitely had an effect there.\u00A0 But when I pulled up the Vostok pod, the build time remained 12d3h7m35s with a rollout cost of 8597.8.\u00A0 So it looks like there is an issue with the\u00A0Part_Variables for rn_vostok_sc being applied to the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula which is obviously going to throw off the BP and rollout cost for the part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I believe I know what is causing the issue.\u00A0 Kerbal replaces\u00A0the underscore character (_) in part names with a period (.).\u00A0 So even through the part file says \u0022rn_vostok_sc\u0022, in Kerbal the part is listed as \u0022rn.vostok.sc\u0022.\u00A0 I created a copy of the RP0/RP1 KCT preset file, then modified the name of the part to reflect periods instead of underscores.\u00A0 This time when I pull the part up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E I get a build time of 1d22h46m5s and rollout cost of 6602.\u00A0 So it looks like KCT isn\u0027t have it\u0027s part variable names altered from underscores to periods.\u00A0 Which means that will need to be manually done.\u00A0 I\u0027ve done that to my copy of the file so hopefully I won\u0027t have further issues with these pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

build cost of 4411, Rollout cost of 75085.1 and build time (at 1.25) of basically 250 days.\u00A0 So my rocket (excluding the Vostok capsule) only costs 5810, with Rollout cost of 36391.7\u00A0and build time (at 1.25) of about 40 days.\u00A0 The Rollout Cost of just the launch vehicle still seems a little on the high side, but not outrageously so.\u00A0 And the build cost and build time both seem just fine.\u00A0 It\u0027s the Vostok capsule that\u0027s the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe issue seems to simply be how the Rollout Cost and Build time are calculated for the pod.\u00A0 If I remove everything but the pod itself, that one part has a build cost of 1813 (doesn\u0027t seem outrageous), Rollout Cost of 61819.7 (seems VERY high) and build time (at 1.25) of basically 227 days (also seems VERY high).\u00A0 That basically means that 78% of the build time, and 55% of the Rollout Cost,\u00A0is for a single part which seems crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the other \u0022manned\u0022 rocket I\u0027m working on.\u00A0 My Mercury-Redstone.\u00A0 It\u0027s showing build cost 6278, rollout cost 16761.5 and build time 32.5 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I take away the launch vehicle and just work with the Mercury capsule it shows build cost 3887, rollout cost 11614.2 and build time 18 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the Mercury pod alone shows build cost 3202, rollout cost 9756.8 and build time 14.5 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are more parts in the Mercury (9 vs 4 on the Vostok).\u00A0 It\u0027s launch mass is 2.722t vs 5.13t for the Vostok.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUltimately, the build time and rollout cost for the Mercury/Redstone is not outrageous.\u00A0 But apparently the heavier\u00A0(2.502t vs 1.011t), but less expensive (1802 vs 2502), Vostok needs 6 times more rollout cost (61819.7 vs 9756.8) and 15 times more build time (226d21h vs 14d10h).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: So I figured out some of the equation.\u00A0 And some of the reason the Mercury pod is so much less expensive and faster to build than the Vostok.\u00A0 The Mercury pod has\u00A0ModuleTagAvionics,\u00A0ModuleTagEngineSolid,\u00A0ModuleTagHumanRated, \u0026amp;\u00A0ModuleTagReentry.\u00A0 Vostock has\u00A0ModuleTagAvionics,\u00A0ModuleTagHabitable,\u00A0ModuleTagHumanRated, \u0026amp;\u00A0ModuleTagReentry.\u00A0 I\u0027m not really sure why the Mercury is tagged as \u0022ModuleTagEngineSolid\u0022 since it doesn\u0027t have a built\u00A0in solid rocket motor and I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s not listed as \u0022ModuleTagHabitable\u0022.\u00A0 I created a temporary file to reset\u00A0ModuleTagEngineSolid to\u00A0ModuleTagHabitable.\u00A0 Now my Mercury pod alone costs 2502, rollout cost of 20175.6 and build time of basically 57days.\u00A0 So that change had an effect of the rollout cost and build time.\u00A0 But it still doesn\u0027t explain why the Vostok pod has such a higher rollout cost or build time.\u00A0 The Vostok pod is less expensive and as far as I can tell from the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula, the mass of the part isn\u0027t a factor.\u00A0 Also, the Mercury pod has a higher part variable (0.14166699999999999 vs 0.13750000000000001).\u00A0 So you\u0027d expect the Mercury Pod to have higher rollout cost and build time.\u00A0 Unfortunately, there are some variables in RolloutCostFormula that I can\u0027t identify, so I can\u0027t determine if there\u0027s another error on the Mercury pod or an error on the Vostok pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: So after alot of digging, I think I know what the issue is.\u00A0 So, as a test, I altered the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula by removing the \u0022[PV]*[MV]*\u0022 at the beginning of the equation.\u00A0 Then I went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and pulled up the Mercury Pod.\u00A0 The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E site I\u0027m testing at only has a build rate of 1.0.\u00A0 The build time is listed as 21d4h3m31s with a rollout cost of 10369.6.\u00A0 And the Vostok shows 12d3h7m35s with a rollout cost of 8597.8.\u00A0 That makes sense as the part cost for the Mercury capsule is higher than the Vostok.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I exited the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and again adjusted the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula.\u00A0 This time I just removed the \u0022[MV]*\u0022 portion.\u00A0 So I should be including the\u00A0Part_Variables in the cost.\u00A0 Went back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Mercury capsule now shows build time of 3d6h40m51s and rollout cost of 6862.6.\u00A0 So the PV definitely had an effect there.\u00A0 But when I pulled up the Vostok pod, the build time remained 12d3h7m35s with a rollout cost of 8597.8.\u00A0 So it looks like there is an issue with the\u00A0Part_Variables for rn_vostok_sc being applied to the\u00A0EffectivePartFormula which is obviously going to throw off the BP and rollout cost for the part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I believe I know what is causing the issue.\u00A0 Kerbal replaces\u00A0the underscore character (_) in part names with a period (.).\u00A0 So even through the part file says \u0022rn_vostok_sc\u0022, in Kerbal the part is listed as \u0022rn.vostok.sc\u0022.\u00A0 I created a copy of the RP0/RP1 KCT preset file, then modified the name of the part to reflect periods instead of underscores.\u00A0 This time when I pull the part up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E I get a build time of 1d22h46m5s and rollout cost of 6602.\u00A0 So it looks like KCT isn\u0027t have it\u0027s part variable names altered from underscores to periods.\u00A0 Which means that will need to be manually done.\u00A0 I\u0027ve done that to my copy of the file so hopefully I won\u0027t have further issues with these pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhold
