I have passed around Duna and rather than slowing down and getting to Duna orbit I intersected with Ike. Now I am in a very eccentric orbit with 2000Dv to turn back to Kerbin.

Ike has a good chunk of gravity relative to that of Duna so it\u0027s spere of influence extends far and it\u0027s orbit is slightly eccentric so there\u0027s a high chance you come close to Ike on your departure from Duna.

According to the first picture this shows me you want to timewarp until Ike has travelled a little over one quarter orbit around Duna. Then you want to do your burn retrograde in relation to the Sun so that you fall towards it when kerbin is at the right location. This burn is done either at peri or apo around Ike and depends which direciton your orbiting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAccording to the first picture you seem to be orbiting clockwise from the orientation of the picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what you do is wait until Ike has traveled just over one quarter orbit, then make a maneuver node at Ike Periapsis to meet Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause your orbit is highly eccentric you should already have a lot of energy so you will need a lot less then 1600m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-14T15:33:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2018 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-14T20:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe VERY first thing to do is alter your orbit so you don\u0027t plow into Ike the next time around ... a small burn at AP should do that, or you can break orbit to head for Duna.\u00A0 You\u0027re probably going to be best off thinking through how you want to do things, because getting to either a high Duna orbit or a low eccentric one shouldn\u0027t be too difficult, but they can interact badly with return windows if you\u0027re not careful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-14T23:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou realize that you\u0027ve got a couple years to wait for an efficient launch window back to Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-17T11:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are already in a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elow Ike orbit\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, it is cheaper to burn straight back to Kerbin from there than to return to Duna orbit first. The interplanetary transfer calculators can\u0027t show this because they\u0027d need to add another stage in the calculations (escape velocity from Ike translating into an escape velocity from Duna) to work it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it matters much whether it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eequatorial\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E or not: if it\u0027s inclined, the main effect will to make your Kerbin intercept inclined and therefore a bit trickier to hit without needing a correction burn on the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eeccentric\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, that\u0027s fine (and is in fact an advantage) \u003Cu\u003Eas long as you need to burn at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that last point is where you may have a problem. Your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is entirely on the wrong side of Ike to burn back to Kerbin at this point in Duna\u0027s orbit. It\u0027s quite possible that you\u0027re perfectly set up to go to Dres with a minimal burn, now, if that interests you, but you\u0027ll only barely be able to capture once you got there, with no way of going home...\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, when Duna is on the other side of the sun, that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E would be in the right place. If you have a transfer window at that time (approx. 400 days), then you can burn home straight from Ike \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is a distinct possibility, so you\u0027re probably best doing nothing at all until you have a better idea about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as others have said:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nyou\u0027ll probably need to return to Duna orbit before burning for Kerbin, unless your transfer window is in 400 days or so;\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyour next transfer window to Kerbin is a long way in the future, anyway, so make the most of your low passes around Ike to get EVA and gravioli science from multiple biomes if possible (and you may want to lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to about 15km for this purpose);\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nwhen you are ready to burn back to Kerbin, you have two conflicting things you want to do:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nraise your Ike orbit to send you into a dive down to Duna so that your Duna \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is as low as possible on the prograde (with respect to the sun) side of Duna, to minimize your Duna-Kerbin transfer burn; and\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nraise your Ike orbit to send you into a Duna orbit that has its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E roughly aligned with prograde/retrograde, so that the burn back to Kerbin needs little or no correction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly, I doubt you can do both of those last two things at the same time. To get the lowest Duna \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you should escape Ike when it is between Duna and the sun, and you\u0027ll end up in an inclined eccentric orbit with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E on the dark side of Duna (as we see it now) which is \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E the right way to be facing when the next transfer window comes up, but only if that is in about 600 days.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore the simplest option would be to minimize the inclination of your resulting Duna orbit, which means escaping Ike with minimal excess velocity when your Ike \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E (as you see it now) is as far away from Duna as possible (and which is currently prograde with respect to the sun). The burn back to Kerbin is going to be expensive, but doable if you\u0027re very careful not to waste fuel setting it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
