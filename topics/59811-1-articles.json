Try it. It doesn\u0027t quite work. So back in the VAB I edit it slightly. But the game has chosen to completely alter everything about my staging list even stuff not related to what I edited. I don\u0027t notice it did this. I go out to the launchpad and have a disaster because, for example, the launch stabilizers didn\u0027t let go when the engines kicked in, or the second stage starts before the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the game needs to auto-edit the staging list when parts are added and removed, but could it at least be possible for it to detect when a significant change exists from the previous staging list that\u0027s stored in the save file for the \u0022current craft\u0022 versus the staging list it has now in the editor, and use that to detect when it has edited the staging list without you doing it yourself? In those cases a warning chime or popup just before leaving the VAB to let the player know (\u0022I changed your staging list. Have a look before you go\u0022) would be really nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part about this that would be hard to implement would be for the game detecting the difference and thinking it can tell the difference between \u0022the player wanted to change this\u0022 versus \u0022I, the game, chose to change this myself\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, these things are \u0022player choosing the change the list\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Manually dragging the staging list or clicking the \u002B/- buttons, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding a new part from the sidebar \u0022bin\u0022 that has staging list actions associated with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Removing a part from the craft into the sidebar \u0022bin\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these things are not cases where the player wanted to change the staging list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Player detaching a part of the craft in the VAB, then re-attaching it, without binning it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything that is part of the detached subsection should retain the same staging steps relative to each other when re-attached. when this does not occur, that\u0027s when to issue the warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI steps are inserted into the staging list, and those steps are all associated with new parts being added from the bins, then that\u0027s \u0022expected\u0022 edits to the list. It\u0027s when the old steps changed relative to each other that the player needs to be warned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
