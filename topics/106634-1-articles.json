I\u0027ve been ending up with several degrees off equatorial, which isn\u0027t a big deal but does cost some dV when I\u0027m trying to do cheap rescue missions.

If you look closely at the navball you can see if your velocity prograde is slightly north or south. Just steer your rocket in the opposite direction to bring it back. You should be able to launch most of the time to an inclination of \u0026lt; 0.5 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TopGull","CreatedById":83617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve encountered the same sort of thing since before 1.0, although it\u0027s definitely more pronounced now. Even with lots of control surfaces and SAS modules I tend to get random oscillations that put my rockets slightly off due east. The only way I\u0027ve found to combat it is to constantly watch the navball during ascent and steer the prograde marker back to where I want it. It\u0027s annoying, but easily correctable with vigilant piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse short taps on the controls to keep the rocket on course.
