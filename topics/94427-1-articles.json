I thought that someone, especially mod developers, might benefit from all that research, so I hand-typed it all into the wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who are interested, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u003C/a\u003E has everything you need to know about configuration files. Not just the parts configuration files, either, but resources, contracts, and more! And for those mod developers who think they need to code a new mod for their part, explanations of the all the stock modules can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module\u003C/a\u003E. I will be updating as I can, and adding modules from add-ons, as well, as time permits. Right now, it has all of the stock modules from [0.90] explained as best I can, with examples from actual code, including usages. So...you developers may not have to write your own modules anymore!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T20:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks joshuadery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T05:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA noble effort!

As to MODULEs, did you actually check the KSPFields for each module, or are you just reporting what settings have been commonly used in cfg files?
