Given the height of that sub orbit, the design should have enough delta V to achieve orbit. Save the use of Mechjeb for building space stations where you need to launch dozens of rockets to the same spot in space. Learn to perform the orbital turn and achieve something approaching a 100K orbit. Turn the SAS on for stability, over ride it with short taps of the WSAD keys as needed to do the turn, and use the Nav Ball to see exactly what your rocket is doing when either in camera view or map mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
