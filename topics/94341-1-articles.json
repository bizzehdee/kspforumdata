Consider a situation like the one I have now: I have one craft headed for Eve, one headed for Duna, and one headed for Minmus. Each of them has one or more upcoming manoeuvres to perform to tweak their intercepts. I am also busily launching additional ships in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I am piloting one I could easily miss a required adjustment for another. I can avoid this by constantly going back to the space center, into the tracking station, double checking the timings and then going back to whichever ship I want to be controlling. But that\u0027s a pain. Can we just take that functionality from the tracking station and add it to map view? I\u0027m thinking that a single left click on any vessel in map view could highlight it in a different colour or something to show that you have selected it to view, while the vessel you are currently controlling could always be, say, green, so you don\u0027t lose track of what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know kerbal alarm clock exists, but I\u0027d like a simple, clean, and effective stock solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
