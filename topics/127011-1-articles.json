Those are absolute pain to fly in KSP, due to the way the game\u0027s physics work. You\u0027ll need to align your thrust with the centre of mass of the whole shuttle assembly (at all times!) and pray to the Kod or the Kraken or whatever entity is it that made kerbals that it doesn\u0027t shift itself too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you used the Buran-like approach (Essentially a spaceplane strapped to a giant rocket - engine under auxiliary tank), you should be relatively fine - albeit it\u0027s still a major pain in your rear on takeoff. In this case, you want to shift the SRBs slightly towards the orbiter (so that you have less torque from their thrust) and then you can control it by limiting the thrust of either the auxiliary engine or the orbiter engine. Usually you\u0027ll end up limiting the former because of CoM shift as the fuel gets burned (DO NOT FORGET FUEL LINES FROM AUX TANK TO THE ORBITER!!!!), but sometimes when your orbiter is carrying a hefty payload, you might actually want to limit the latter so it doesn\u0027t flip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, make sure that you have at least some engine aligned with the CoM of the orbiter (pointing the hollow end towards the rear), otherwise you\u0027ll be kinda boned when doing burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor re-entry, try to have a good landing zone (KSC for best results, the desert also works in case of emergency), because in my experience shuttle replicas tend to be quite nose-heavy when empty and thus need some speed to be landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest luck with your shuttles!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T00:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the three main engines aligned with CoM, need to throttle them down until the whole things starts to lean back, then throttle up to keep it straight but not tip over. But after that the thing starts turning sideways and there is no holding it. They have all the parts and introduced the engines in 1.0.5, but basically you are unable to use them in a real shuttle simulation without resorting to improvised boosters etc. That is just funky and I wonder why they bothered with the special parts for the shuttle (slanted engine mount, new gimballing engines).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T02:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJimbodiah,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0STS designs are about the hardest thing to do in KSP. I fly mine by designing it to be perfectly balanced throughout the flight. This isn\u0027t easy. The engines must be set up so that they thrust through the CoG. The fuel flow must be set up so that the CoG naturally falls toward the engines as the fuel drains. Even the SRBs must be mounted a little offset so the total thrust is through the Com.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The actual flying is weird because it flies \u0022crooked\u0022. To roll, you use yaw. Any roll input will generate an unhappy yaw response. The Vector\u0027s wide gimballing range would *seem* to improve this behavior, but in reality it just makes it worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kolumbia5_zpsfln9bmvl.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kolumbia/Kolumbia5_zpsfln9bmvl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood KSP STS replicas are do- able, but they\u0027re not easy to make or fly.
