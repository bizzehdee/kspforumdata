If you can\u0027t do that, try throwing on the steerable fins (AV-R8 Winglet) and, last but not least, try to keep your speed down until you get high in the atmosphere... Personally I limit my speed to less then 300m/s below 5km, 450m/s below 10km, and full throttle above 10km.. staying slow in the lower atmosphere will give better control, and it might also save a bit of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T03:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re just coming into the post 1.0 world, then you need to re-learn the best flight path to orbit (as we all have). You can no longer go straight up to 10km and turn right to 45 degrees. The new aerodynamic model dictates that you perform a realistic gravity turn, starting very soon after liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommon wisdom is along the lines of 5 degrees East when you\u0027re going about 100 m/s, and gradually following the prograde marker on the way up. You still be at 45 degrees East by the time you\u0027re 10km up, but you need to get there slowly by doing a long gradual turn. After that, most people give milestones something like 60 degrees by 30km, and nearly horizontal by 50km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, as Ketatrypt said, keep draggy stuff like fins at the back, and heavy stuff at the front. This makes your rocket more like an arrow or dart, and it will be more aerodynamically stable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket you have in the picture looks pretty good, you should be able to get to orbit with the right flight path.

fuel tanks stacked vertically (three, counting the little conical one).\u00A0 That\u0027s going to cause big stability problems, because the top tank will drain first, drastically lowering your CoM and rendering the ship unstable.\u00A0 The simple fix (if you don\u0027t want to redesign/rearrange the rocket) is to disable the top tank in the VAB.\u00A0 This will prevent it from draining, and the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebottom\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E tank will drain first, which will actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eimprove\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E your CoM for the first part of

be on your rocket\u0027s left and right, instead of top and bottom.\u00A0 It\u0027s more aerodynamically stable that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut a fin on each Kickback-- one on the left, one on the right.\u00A0 Stick it way down low, as low as you can get away with.\u00A0 That will really help your pitch stability during the turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard for me

it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, those suggestions ought to do the trick.\u00A0 I suspect that the major thing that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E
