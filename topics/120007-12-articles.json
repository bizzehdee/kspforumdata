Great! \u003Cp\u003EThe problem that occurred last time was a lack of direction/goal of the project. In project management, something I am quite familiar with, the project team must first come up with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals before any work occurs. Without this goal setting portion, the ship is basically without a rudder and is taken hither and thither by the four winds. I suggest that you stop development, sit down with the entire team or at least the top three of the project management and set some goals. When the goals are set, creative courses of actions can be, well, created (who, what, when, where, why) for each goal and a timeline for each as well. This may take a bit of time but imagine just being able to sit down and have everything already laid out on when it needs to be done and what needs to be done! All this being said, I\u0027m not in the management team and I am not certain as to what has actually already been discussed off the cuff and what is going on behind the scenes but it seems like there is a lack of direction among the project team.
