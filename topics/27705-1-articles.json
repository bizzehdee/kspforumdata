Although I\u0027m not completely new to the game with 12 days under my belt now I\u0027m still a long way from creating my Eeloo Transfer Capable vehicle, or one to Minimus for that matter. But great feats in space weren\u0027t achieved in a single day, it took years for NASA to put a man on the Moon. In the mean time for those who are interested I started a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://culv3r.wordpress.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eblog\u003C/a\u003E as a fun way to remember my successes (and failures) and help other Kerbonauts through the experience I gain as I work my way up in my crazy little space program. I hope to chat with fellow Kerbonauts in the coming days and look forward to seeing what the community can accomplish in the awesome and amazing game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Culv3r\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T16:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!

I\u0027m something of an aspiring author myself, although I haven\u0027t really written much that I\u0027ve put out in public. I\u0027ll be keeping tabs on it to see your progress; I\u0027m always up for a good story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get stuck on anything or are just looking for better ways to optimize your performance, I\u0027d highly recommend the Drawing Board (link in my sig) as a good place to start. It has tutorials, delta-v maps, links to various sorts of calculators, and all sorts of other useful resources. You can also ask questions in the How To section of the forums, where a lot of the more knowledgeable players like to hang out and share their accumulated wisdom. Feel free to look around and hop into any conversation that interests you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Culv3r","CreatedById":66862,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T20:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Xiphos - Thanks for the welcome and yeah, I\u0027m slowly but surely going to find my balance between information and brevity. There\u0027s just so much detail to cover with this game that I didn\u0027t want to leave anything out and well, to keep it lively and not just preclude it solely to science, I also wanted to have it be something of a story to tell. I\u0027ll definitely be sharing my builds that I come up with and I look forward to sharing them and learning from others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Specialist - Thanks as well for the welcome. Thank you for the compliments and the advice.
