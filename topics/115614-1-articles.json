For example, what if the Soviets landed on the moon first? So, I decided to make a game out of the topic. So, here it is: If you could change one thing in history, what would you change?\n\nRules:\n\n1. Don\u0027t change the life path of one random person, that, for all we know, you might have made up. It has to be something that there is a historical record of, or info about can be publicly accessed.\n\n2. If it\u0027s got a historical record of some sort, or info can be publicly accessed about it, you can change it, and maybe make up a little alternate history theory.\n\n3. You can only change *one* thing in history. Not ten things whose changes might interfere with each other.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of gameplay:\n\nP1: What if the failures of the Soviet N1 rockets never happened? If this happened, then they might have gotten manned missions to the moon as well.\n\nP2: What if the Lunar Module\u0027s liftoff stage hadn\u0027t worked on Apollo 11? Well, then the rest of the program would\u0027ve probably been canceled while a Reality TV show was made about Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong living on the moon. Of course, due to supplies being limited, the show probably wouldn\u0027t have made it to the end of the first season.\n\nand so on...\n\nLet\u0027s start!\n\nWhat if the ICC had approved the SP-SF merger in the 1980s? Well, most likely, trains in a lot of the country would look *very* different due to the huge network the combined railroad would\u0027ve spanned."},{"CreatedByName":"TrainEngie","CreatedById":138031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T07:09:36Z","Content":"If ICC approved SPSF, then SPSF wouldn\u0027t be \u0022shouldn\u0027t paint so fast\u0022 anymore.\n\nWhat if the XB-70 had two big J58 turbojets or 6 regular J58 turbojets instead of 6 YJ93 turbojets?
