But since I\u0027m not from America, it saddens me to know that the chance of me becoming an astronaut is close to 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as soon as I heard Axe Apollo has given an opportunity for astronaut wannabe\u0027s to be in space, I couldn\u0027t help but sign up immediately. So to win the competition, I need your votes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.
