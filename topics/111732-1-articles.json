I think it is about time. \\*grabs pitchfork\\*\n\nBut it wasn\u0027t just one \u0022incident\u0022 but several. I am a huge SimCity fan since the original release (SimCity with the clunky box graphics). SimCity 3000 had a few bugs and required a couple of patches just to make the game playable. SimCity 4 had four Maxis patches just to make the original release compatible with their own update (and the fan base at numerous sites began to mod the game even more to make it even better). Then there was SimSocieties which Maxis originally claimed was to be the elusive SimCity 5 just to ignore their own claim when SimSocieties bombed (it sucked really bad). Then there was the recent release of SimCity 5, which I didn\u0027t even bother to purchase. SimCity 4 had so much potential... \n\nWhen [Cities: Skylines](http://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/#scrollTop=0) came out, it really appealed to die-hard SimCity players. It seems that nearly every complaint we had about the Maxis SimCity franchise was answered by another game studio. Unfortunately, EA Games has, for the past fifteen years, spent more in developing first person shooter and sports related games rather than invest in the Maxis brand and simulator gaming. I know that many gamers enjoy first person shooters and sports, I prefer the challenges of simulation games (except Goat Simulator... i mean, really...![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) ) If Squad ever wanted a way to destroy KSP, then just study Maxis..."},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:25:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Despite the name, it hadn\u0027t really been the classic old Maxis for quite some time.

The Sims, the one released at the same time as SimCity 4 was a really neat concept that Maxis/EA could have developed more. It was kind of neat to be able to get a SimCitizen\u0027s opinion of the city. SimLife was pretty awesome when it came out and it gave the player the ability to tweak a planet\u0027s evolutionary model; I remember one time I actually evolved - FROGS! Yes, folks, a planet where FROGS were the sentient species ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)... I read somewhere that SimLife was the basis for SPORE; so I did buy the game. It worked ok until you got into the space age. From there, the game got a little lame. I was really looking forward to the much hyped and advertised SimMars, but the game was pulled during development. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Going to second this sentiment.

SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4 were great games but besides some visual updates, were virtually the same game. The Sims (1, 2, and 3) were nearly the same and probably 2 and 3 could have been add-on packages to the first game since neither the graphics, basic game play, or features changed in any remarkable way. But by 2000, Maxis was also being challenged by other simulation games - Tropico (and it has become a little stale, too), Roller Coaster Tycoon (which has also become a little stale in its three revisions), and Zoo Tycoon (Microsoft\u0027s attempt to do something other than its Flight Simulator and Train Simulator). I hope that when the decision is made to do a KSP 2, it is more than updated graphics and a few new trinkets..."},{"CreatedByName":"The D Train","CreatedById":145633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T06:24:25Z","Content":"SimTower and SimCopter.
