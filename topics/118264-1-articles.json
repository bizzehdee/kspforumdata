All the time it took in selecting that special rocket and then the time on assembly. Paper tubes, balsam wood, held together with glue and the decals just right. Testing the COM with a string and spinning it around like a lasso. The finished rocket is now carefully packed and I head off to the launchpad (park). Now the model rocket is all set up and ready to go. That feeling of accomplishment is instantly doubled when the ignition is lit and the rocket soars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat same feeling is what I am experiencing when I let Bill build rockets on the lawn. When he drives through KSC hauling 36 tonne components from the runway. I am trying to drive and assemble using IVA and it feels great. Then create a rocket at the launch pad that soars into space has got me sold. This for me is truly an unforgettable and awesome KSP experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else feel this is totally worth the time and effort?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere a rocket built by Bill that reached orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill:) has learned plenty about mechanical devices down at the ranch and still has much to learn about building rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time he built a multi stage rocket that sent a probe into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EJl99Rz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EJl99Rz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MR2XuC1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MR2XuC1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SfTxkwz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SfTxkwz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore details\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6rdQL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I remember the first model rocket I did. it was a C class (10 N\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7s), quite small, but the feeling was... just incredible. I was 12 years old and I felt like Superman!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP I\u0027ve been playing close to a thousand hours. I remember first time I landed on the Mun and came back safe to Kerbin. I danced all around the table while thinking the \u0022Space will never be the same\u0022 motto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess yeah, feelings when playing KSP vs making model rockets are similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me the big difference between Model rocketry and KSP is how I pursuit a project. In model rocketry once I have built my rocket, the only I can do once built is fly it as much as possible. I don\u0027t do many changes, only repairments if necessary. With KSP I enjoy planning and testing my rockets, trying to squeeze and minimize the resources. Sometimes I spend more time refining my model than actually flying. But each time I accomplish a mission you could see a happy face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor sure I enjoy both!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELord\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made this for anyone to enjoy building and launching a rocket. An easy to snap together design and even if after you build it and it fails it is still very thrilling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design is based on one of my first model rockets I built. Single tube and three balsam wood fins. Smoothed out the body/fin connection with putty and sanded it too many times. I remember the flash of the plastic molded nose cone needed to be trimmed in order to fit inside the tube. Painted the rocket with two coats of matte white.
