To be fair, I\u0027ve always been a PC gamer and totally cool with kb\u0026amp;m play, but it\u0027s nice to get analogues involved when in command of vehicles in any game. It was a bit of head scratching in the beginning but in the end I decided to try and keep it simple and just that by dedicating the controller to the pure flight/rocketry/rover (they\u0027re mapped into the analogues as well btw) and EVA controls. It made it a bit easier to come at it from that angle. Although my EVA\u0027s are done on the kb\u0026amp;m still as there\u0027s something a bit buggy going on with mapping for some of the \u0027kerbal/EVA\u0027 controls to the analogues in the game\u0027s input settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI didn\u0027t think KSP lets you bind a control to a combination of keys.

It\u0027s called DS4Windows and it\u0027s based on the old SCP Server (a tool used to fool Windows into thinking it has an x360/xinput controller attached). The tool also has quite deep configuration/mapping options which allow for the 2nd layer. How I\u0027ve set it up is to map all of the analogue stuff from withing KSP and the use the the tool to map the buttons and touchpad on the DS4 to keystrokes - it works flawlessly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s something you\u0027re interested in exploring I don\u0027t think you need to have a DS4/SCP Server...I\u0027m not 100% certain but I\u0027m sure the mapping features aren\u0027t exclusive to \u0027DS4Windows\u0027 and can be achieved by some of the other x360 mapping tools (xpadder, pinnacle game profiler, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T14:37:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fubarbrickdust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T15:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour controls are somewhat similar to mine, only I A) use an X360 controller, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E don\u0027t have max thrust/min thrust, just up and down, C) X and Y are brake and SAS toggle respectively, D) L and R bumpers are translate FW/BW, E) left stick push in does gear toggle, right stick toggle IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it works OK for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Didn\u0027t notice, but I also use the stick for Pictch and Yaw, and L/R for roll.
