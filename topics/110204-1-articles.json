So I would like to be able to use the mod without the part. I\u0027ve heard of people in the past accomplishing this, and I thought it was a configuration change, though I can\u0027t find the file to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData/KerbalEngineer/Settings contains the files BuildAdvanced.xml, BuildOverlay.xml, GuiDisplaySize.xml, and HelpStrings.xml. No options in any of them is blatenly obvious an option to disable the circuit board part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on Linux, but I think for something like this that that wouldn\u0027t matter.
