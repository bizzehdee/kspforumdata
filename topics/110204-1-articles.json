So I would like to be able to use the mod without the part. I\u0027ve heard of people in the past accomplishing this, and I thought it was a configuration change, though I can\u0027t find the file to change.\n\nGameData/KerbalEngineer/Settings contains the files BuildAdvanced.xml, BuildOverlay.xml, GuiDisplaySize.xml, and HelpStrings.xml. No options in any of them is blatenly obvious an option to disable the circuit board part.\n\nI\u0027m on Linux, but I think for something like this that that wouldn\u0027t matter. Thanks for your advice."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T11:47:05Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ***This mode is completely optional though, and by clicking on \u0022Settings\u0022 on the Kerbal Engineer Redux window in the editor, you may change its mode from \u0022Career\u0022 to \u0022Partless\u0022.***\n\n![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeffdude","CreatedById":144562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:20:29Z","Content":"That was it, thanks Harry!"}]}
