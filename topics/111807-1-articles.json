Also it has no real use after the mission was more or less finished, as everything in it has been expended or was non functional by that point, so they left it in orbit until it was brought back down by atmospheric drag a little while later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T04:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow could it be jettisoned after deorbit if you have to jettison to not have a wacky time deorbiting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while it makes sense why they\u0027d jettison it, it just seems odd to not deorbit it.

While there were plenty of concepts about reusable spacecraft at the time, the drive was to get there \u0022firstest with the leastest.\u0022 Weight was the demon to overcome. Design it simple to do exactly what was asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo spacecraft were designed to shed all used stages when no longer needed. Once a stag is depleted, don\u0027t haul it around, kick it loose. Gemini was the same way. Don\u0027t bring that weight back to Earth or you have to design more powerful retro\u0027s (heavier) and larger parachutes (again heavier). Heavier isn\u0027t good, especially for the power of the launch vehicles back in the day. Just like KSP, design light to get the most out of your launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, with the Space Shuttle in 1970\u0027s and SpaceX with others today the approach is reusable spacecraft. Make \u0027em last several missions. Times change as do mission profiles. There isn\u0027t a Space Sprint anymore. Now it\u0027s an Ironman challenge -- multi-roles needing multi-purpose crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd gooddog15 is right, it eventually deorbited on it\u0027s own, so why waste fuel, etc on it.
