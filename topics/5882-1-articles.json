Boasting the improved staging system found on the Mk4, the Mk5 carries the craft to an orbiting altitude of 100km efficiently and economically. The lander was designed to be aesthetically pleasing for those who want to arrive on the Munar surface with style. It comes with two sets of side tanks with the fuel necessary to travel to the moon and land. They can be jettisoned after takeoff from the Mun if necessary. The lander also comes with an RCS abort stage in case of emergencies, giving it a higher than average safety rating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiftoff guide:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the liftoff and ascent portion of the craft was designed with economics in mind, the fuel budget is quite tight with about 10 seconds worth of full burn to spare.

Sit back and pay attention to that clock. You will get through the second stage before reaching 16km. After, follow the altitude and attitude table listed below. The third stage is jettisoned just before reaching 60km. Keep burning until your apoapsis reaches 100km and cut your engines. It should happen shortly after the 5 minute mark. Then it\\\u0027s simply thrusting to 2245m/s at apoapsis.
