I\u0027ve also had experience in grade 11 and 12 computer science courses whereby my only \u0027crime\u0027 was over-complicating my \u0027program architecture\u0027 and being overly ambitious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I know, as generic add-ons concentrate on the addition of new parts with new behaviours, models and characteristics to the game alongside auxiliary GUIs, plugins more so concentrate on making changes to the internal game mechanics and as per my case, the plugin I wish to begin developing aims to find ways to bypass the standard vessel \u0027rail assignment and junk management\u0027 mechanics to allow for management of multiple flights which when unfocused undergo physical approximation. I basically have been wanting to develop a mod called \u0022Kerbal Civilizations\u0022 which allows me to perform highly physics, administration, resources and logistics oriented simulation of a functioning Kerbal civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestions:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start off, does there exist much information out there on how one would set up code to interact with the game API and in ways \u0027hijack\u0027 control over the physics of a flying vessel? For example I\u0027d imagine that in the development of FAR, a lot of work would have had to be done to be able to robustly apply alternative forces on vessel parts using separate or auxiliary physics processing code. Furthermore, what pointers could one give me towards exploring API interactions that would allow me to stop the stock game mechanics from deleting a vessel as debris or transferring it to rails when out of focus and far away? As in I want to be able to have dynamic code that allows multiple programmed autopilots (individual agents within the entire civilization automaton; to me most of this code logic can be implemented independent of the more confusing API interactions which are what I am having trouble with) to act upon the control surfaces of a physical vessel approximation flying on rails but not undergoing internal stresses. As in if I wanted to set up within my mod the ability to organize multiple land, sea and air logistics flights, the plugin would be able to manage approximated forces and constraints acting on the craft as it traverses the world whereby at any time you can resume focus on any one logistic vehicle and dynamically introduce any other approximations that fly close within the vicinity of the focused craft. Managing the success rates of \u0027approximated\u0027 landings would be the next step in this project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to conclude, this would in ways be the programming of the dynamic switching between vector point approximations of existing vessels and safe introduction into and suspension from \u0027focused\u0027 full physics game world processing. It would be as though I were implementing my own solution to switching between vessels while moving within the atmosphere. As per autopilots, I have yet to figure out how to program an agent to act upon vessel control surfaces unless this were as simple as scanning through and logging all parts in a vessel structure that I want to access, else I can look into using kOS to have ways to control crafts in focus with full physics simulation and out of focus on \u0027modded rails.\u0027 (As I\u0027d imagine that normally, the game \u0027listens\u0027 to control inputs from the kOS program, my mod would probably transfer listening and try to best approximate the expected control feedback upon the vessel while on rails. Accurately approximated point masses with angle of attacks.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow this may interfere with \u0027Kraken\u0027s Bane\u0027 for dynamic focus assignment may also be an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T22:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest place to start with this would probably be the history of \u0022on-rails\u0022 thrust mods such as this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator/tree/master/src\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esolar sail\u003C/a\u003E mod (alternatively Principia, while a much more complex mod, also deals with unfocused vessels). Somewhere in there will be the code for modifying the orbits of an on-rails craft and then you just need to work out how to apply it for your situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
