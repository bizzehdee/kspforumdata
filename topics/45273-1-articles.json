Real-world planes can do a much better job of distributing fuel near the CoM (usually in the wings). The problem with long planes in KSP (and especially SSTOs with all those heavy rockets and rocket fuel) is that the CoM moves so dramatically in long craft that stabilizing them on re-entry is very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the only parts in KSP that have any semblance of directional drag are wings. If you dropped a giant rod from space, it sure as heck wouldn\u0027t come down sideways. In KSP this translates into requiring special attention to your CoD, as others have mentioned. In real life, aircraft do a much better job of pointing prograde. This is especially true in pitch, because of the wings and horiz stabilizer, though yaw is less so (hence the IRL tendency of a large vert stabilizer with a strong rudder - take a look at a B-17 sometime). In KSP, planes (especially heavy ones) can be turned retrograde just by pitching too fast. They are much less responsive to changes in attitude. In my brief foray into FAR, that was the part I enjoyed the most - rockets and planes flying in-line with the oncoming air (which makes planes much more responsive and maneuverable).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awass","CreatedById":77431,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T00:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the replies, everyone.

What you\u0027re describing is partially true, but only as regards the Center of Drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more bizarre effects of this is that an atmospheric craft\u0027s drag drops as it burns off fuel. My modified Ravenspear Mk3 for example gains several hundred M/S and several kilometers maximum altitude as the fuel burns off. In stock, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key thing is that all parts have their full drag all the time: there\u0027s no \u0027shielding\u0027 effect. In reality, nosecones and fairings DO actually reduce the total vacuum Delta-V of the craft because of the extra weight. They\u0027re used because they more than make up for it in reduced drag losses and preventing damage to the payload on the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne particularly notable example of this was NASA\u0027s Orbiting Carbon Observatory Satellite.
