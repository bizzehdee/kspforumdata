Is the de-orbiting necessary for something(other than fun)? Will I bump into a wreck someday? Does the game slow down because it is tracking debris(even after deletion)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-07T10:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome just deorbit them for realism sake. Bumping into something in the game is very unlikely unless you actively try to do it (Kessler syndrome is a thing but space is huge). And the game will slow down the more active craft there is, so keeping the limit low is a nice thing to have. Either by deorbiting or removing, it\u0027s all about individual approach. If it\u0027s deleted, it\u0027s removed from savefile. So, no way to track something if it doesn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
