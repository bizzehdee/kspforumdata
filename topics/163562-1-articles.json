(I know that\u0027s inifficient but I was impatient and had extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, every time I actually hit x100 warp it skews the orbit to something random like 400k/750k and so I can\u0027t actually use x100 warp unless I spend more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E fixing it which I tried a few times but it just keeps getting mucked up when I time warp even if I got to 800 or 1000. I\u0027m not getting grabbed by the Mun or Minus or anything like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this just a limitation of the game code at extremely high time warp? Doesn\u0027t happen everytime but enough that it\u0027s annoying lol. (On a side note it happens less if I slowly ramp up to x100 instead of just kicking it right into max)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts, answers, or similar experiences are appreciated, thanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal101","CreatedById":157058,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-22T14:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbit can change to weird values if its very even (600,000/600,000) or physical warp is used in space.

Because of the warping restriction, I\u0027ve found it\u0027s best to do so from the tracking station. This eliminates your \u0022revert flight\u0022 option, but I usually make a specific quicksave before every flight in case of (inevitable) screw-ups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-22T18:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to both of you for your replies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I couldn\u0027t respond sooner, I was driving home from vacation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to know it\u0027s not just me, I\u0027ll just be more careful in the future and use an uneven orbit like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157058-kerbal101/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157058\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157058-kerbal101/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kerbal101\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0suggested.
