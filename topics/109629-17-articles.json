You can glide and land at around 85 m/s with stall speed at 55 m/s. There are a lot of topics on this forum showing that SSTO\u0027s are now kinda impossible to make realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opionion we can do 2 things. 1 = wait for a new patch. 2 = go FAR all the way and see how this goes. My bet is that we can get pretty close to realism with FAR (I once created a shuttle for Real Solar Systems from scratch).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T11:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Echeech. did you download the patch I put up today?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
