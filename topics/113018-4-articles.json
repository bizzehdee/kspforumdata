Kudos!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, there are a couple of things about it that bug me, so a little constructive criticism from me\u00A0(sorry)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe reactors run on Ore. I understand why you want to make it stock-compatible, but the parts themselves can create ore, so it\u0027s not a limitation. The Community Resource Pack has a variety of nuclear fuels that could be used as an alternative, it might be worth doing an MM patch to change the fuel if it\u0027s installed, or just make it part of the pack, or use a fuel that is not quite as easy to make on-the-fly.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAcross Near Future, USI Reactors and (to a lesser extent) KSP-Intersteller Extended, the reactors have a (broadly) similar output that is higher than your alternatives. So there\u0027s nothing to stop somebody from powering all your goodies with a better reactor from a different pack. From a balance perspective, it might be worth upping the respective outputs and power requirements of your parts to make them more ... competitive?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf I remember correctly (I\u0027m writing this after dropping the mod a week ago), there\u0027s no catchup processing on refocus. So leaving a station running and coming back to it after doing something else meant it hadn\u0027t produced or consumed anything. If I\u0027m wrong please ignore this, but if this is still the case, including this feature would be a big plus.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI really did enjoy a brief play around with this mod. I like the idea of having refueling stations in important places, but not the grind of maintaining them, so I saw this mod as filling a niche for slow fuel regeneration at a high initial cost (and weight) setup; slow, stationary (orbital) resource accumulation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor additional complexity, have you thought about making the dust accumulation gravity-dependent? Requiring the presence (or absence)\u00A0of gravity to get efficient production? Also, if you\u0027re content with the current reactors requiring ore (which isn\u0027t unreasonable at all) it may be worth re-branding them as high-efficiency ore-burning generators. The game has Ore drills, ISRU, and fuel cells so it\u0027s not a leap\u00A0to repackage this all into one part.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope you found some of that rambling helpful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drelam","CreatedById":103798,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T14:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222419221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022113018\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455911877\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137685\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carbonjvd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 19.2.2016 at 8:57 PM, Carbonjvd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a quick update on the next update, very clever!

Now to answer your suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I can see your point in wanting a more specialized fuel for reactors and other nuclear based parts. Those kinds of changes are a possibility for further expansion of the game, I\u0027ve looked into it since the beginning but to keep it stock compatible I left it as ore for the nuclear fuel substitute.
