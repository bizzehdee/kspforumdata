I played the demo for about a month, and then bought the full version, so there was some adjusting in terms of parts.

Enough about me, tell me a little bit about yourself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, pointers on mun landings would be very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: My steam is spacehelicopters, hit me up if you feel the need to.

Instead, put yourself in a low, stable orbit around the Mun first. This will allow you a greater degree of control over your final landing site and reduce the amount of guesswork involved in your final landing burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T00:27:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, SpaceHeli! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the game can be boiled down to thrust/weight. Stage your rockets so that the stage below is pushing the stage above with at least 2x the thrust need to life the stage above and you\u0027ll normally be in pretty good good shape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you can get a rocket into orbit with at least one stage at full fuel, then try for the Mun. Add a maneuver to your trajectory on the map screen. Green tab expands or contracts your orbit(see also, Retrograde and Prograde), Blue tab shifts your orbit left or right on the axis of where you are burning. sends you \u0027uphill\u0027 or \u0027downhill\u0027 compared to your orbital plane. You can slide the node along the blue line of your trajectory, this helps in finding a Mun intersect. Keep in mind that if your ship passes by the node while you are messing with it, the node is no longer valid on the map screen, but you can still burn toward it if you had it good and want to try and catch up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get the node at a flyby of the Mun, you can look at the NavBall and it will have a blue marker on the ball. This is where you\u0027re going to want to burn toward. Beside the NavBall will 2 sets of time readouts. One is Est. Burn, this is how long the game thinks it will take your ship to burn up to the speed required, the other says \u0027Node in T\u0027 Then it will be plus or minus a time. Minus two minutes means you are two minutes from the burn, Plus means you are behind the burn point. Try to time your burn so that you are halfway through burning when you hit the node. There will be a yellow bar by these numbers that shows you how much burn you have to do in m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse these maneuver nodes to get your Mun intercept and then slow down your Mun flyby into an orbit with a retrograde maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T09:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with landing on Minmus.
