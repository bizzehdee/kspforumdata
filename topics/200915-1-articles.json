A big, complex craft low in the atmosphere requires a lot of physics calculations to model it correctly to see if e.g. something would break off, lift/drag /thrust and so on, and since it can only run this on a single processor thread your CPU can easily become the bottleneck. Smaller craft or those with fewer parts are better in terms of physics performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurn some of scatterer\u2019s features e.g. the fancy ocean stuff\u00A0down or off, reduce reflections in the main menu settings or use lower resolution terrain textures and you might see an improvement in your game\u2019s performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
