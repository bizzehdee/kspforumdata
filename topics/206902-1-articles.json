You can set them to an action group and probably just control the plane with the cockpit\u0027s reaction wheels at high speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested in cheesing the aero system to go even faster, it may be of interest to you that 2 service bays clipped into each other experience no drag or heating at all at any speed. Clip an engine half inside and you can go as fast as you want. You can also get a lot of aero-cheese mileage out of clipping and offsetting stuff into fairings to achieve unrealistic reductions of drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
