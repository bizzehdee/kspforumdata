Keep your TWR below 2, keep your rockets looking like real rockets, tall and thin, use nosecones and fairings, below 10000m keep your speed under 300m/s.\n\nWhen you burn up on re-entry, heat shields and shallow entry angles"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T05:53:53Z","Content":"The old launch style doesn\u0027t work anymore, at least not in most cases. You want to either gradually turn not too far off the launch pad and slowly make your way down to almost horizontal with the planet\u0027s surface (this is a true gravity turn profile) OR for really un-aerodynamic rockets, go much higher than the old 10km before turning.\n\nRockets flipping can be caused by drag at the front, such as no fairings on a particularly flat payload. Also fins are needed to hold it steady as it goes through the air. This is the same effect as a plane\u0027s vertical stabilizer. \n\nYou said you played in May which I would think meant 1.0 which was released in April, so there have been a few changes since then but the launch profile shouldn\u0027t be that different. Most of the changes were with heat and parachutes. Main chutes can NOT be deployed faster that 250m/s, you now need drogues. Heat is much more dangerous than earlier 1.0 versions too so don\u0027t forget those heat shields and come in real shallow.\n\nIt\u0027s a brave new world out there now. It will take some practice, but think of it as if it were an all new game!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T06:00:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T05:56:12Z","Content":"I dunno, its happening in space too and I\u0027ve never been one for pancakes.\n\nNot thrusting.
