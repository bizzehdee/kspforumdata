You want to either gradually turn not too far off the launch pad and slowly make your way down to almost horizontal with the planet\u0027s surface (this is a true gravity turn profile) OR for really un-aerodynamic rockets, go much higher than the old 10km before turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets flipping can be caused by drag at the front, such as no fairings on a particularly flat payload. Also fins are needed to hold it steady as it goes through the air. This is the same effect as a plane\u0027s vertical stabilizer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou said you played in May which I would think meant 1.0 which was released in April, so there have been a few changes since then but the launch profile shouldn\u0027t be that different. Most of the changes were with heat and parachutes. Main chutes can NOT be deployed faster that 250m/s, you now need drogues. Heat is much more dangerous than earlier 1.0 versions too so don\u0027t forget those heat shields and come in real shallow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a brave new world out there now.
