I was playing a little earlier and was testing a rover I threw together on Kerbin. I was just driving along and was circling the camera around the rover and I suddenly noticed the pilot was wearing a white EVA suit in the chair. The only issue is that is was Jeb that was driving, his suit should have been orange. Not sure what happened, I don\u0027t have texture re-placer or anything like that installed so I am wondering if this is some weird bug or maybe he has been wearing white for awhile now and I just never noticed before. Here is a quick snapshot I just took showing Jeb wearing a white suit.\n\n![Hch3YHA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Hch3YHA.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"CodedThreat","CreatedById":142832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T05:45:30Z","Content":"Yea, I have been playing too much and not sleeping enough.
