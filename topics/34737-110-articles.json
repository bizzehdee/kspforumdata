I\u0027d just slapped them on to add weight, but it turns out with them present after docking the pistons movement was restricted and the hinges moved but didn\u0027t move the things connected to them. Weird. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere doesn\u0027t seem to be any problems caused by having KAS present as part of the lifting arm which is great, I figured if any other mod was going to cause problems it would be KAS, but that combo seems to work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings are definitely improving!

It moves a little bit but doesn\u0027t telescope properly. Sometimes some of the piston stages lock while others retract. This also breaks the two hinges, (the shoulder and the wrist). They no longer operate at full speed or in unison. The shoulder hinge also seems to be turned nearly 90 deg, and the claw doesn\u0027t stay centered on the wrist hinge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J4XSvHh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022J4XSvHh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, great job on the new release guys.
