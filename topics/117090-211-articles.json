Hard to tell where the floor would be, though, obviously.\n\u003E \n\nTechnically these are counter-rotating mass (as they are not in place for balance, but for mass), but counterweights is easier to type, and a decently exchangeable term for normal conversation.\n\nWindows -- will be doing them all consistent with each other.  If the small ones have windows, so will the large.  And honestly it would be -harder- to add windows to the large ones as the meshes are distorted more during animation.  Positions -- this is a 2.5m diameter module, kerbals are \u003C1m tall; thus the windows need to be more than halfway down the side, assuming a two-level interior, resulting in the slightly downward/outward facing windows as shown.  There could potentially be a second row of windows more along the interior of the torus  (at least I wasn\u0027t trying to put them on the exterior... which would be the floor...).\n\nHowever I\u0027m leaning towards no windows for these parts.  One -- the deploy animation makes them unrealistic -- they would need to be made of some sort of flexible material, not even paying attention to the skin-thickness that the current RL inflatables have.  Two -- the deploy animation mangles their geometry quite terribly, while they do look decent while deployed, they are far less desirable in the stowed animation state.\n\nUpdated render with counterweights shown (in yellow); managed to fit them onto the central pillar -- might move them up/down a bit, in place of the taper on the central pillar, probably make them taller as well as they don\u0027t have much diameter (would love to put them on some sort of extension, as the same mass further from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E = higher MOI/better at their job).  This is still just the rough-draft geometry, figuring everything out; lots of cleanup to do even on what is shown here:\n\n![8E6giCK.gif](http://i.imgur.com/8E6giCK.gif)\n\nFairly certain I\u0027ll be doing the larger models with the same type of bracing layout, and same techniques in general (only larger).  Mostly the differences will be the number of segments (texturing), and the crew tube / truss arrangements (larger parts will have multiple tubes and/or trusses).  Initial tests for bracing on the larger one pointed to there being difficulties with making the bracing much more complex than what is used here, but I\u0027m still playing around with a few things.\n\nHoping to have the rest of the larger parts rigged up and their models/animations figured out over the next few days, with possibly some initial texturing coming over the weekend.  No way that I\u0027ll have the parts finished up this weekend, but perhaps next ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T16:34:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Windows -- will be doing them all consistent with each other.

I\u0027m not entirely opposed to that, but would prefer to keep things smooth looking if possible, and would also like these parts to be consistent across the series.  Will do some tests to see how it looks...\n\nUpdated with expanding tethered counterweight setup (for greater MOI, less mass needed for same effect).  Not entirely sure I like the look, but its not terrible either.  Makes the model look a bit \u0027busier\u0027 than I would like.  May play around with it a bit more to see if there are any changes I can make to solidify its look a bit.\n\n![8DqQKEg.gif](http://i.imgur.com/8DqQKEg.gif)\n\nAdapting same type of setup to the next largest torus (20m x 3.125m, 6-\u003E12 bracing); more bracing lines, same techniques (crew tube will be updated/changed, merely using what I already had in place for this render):\n\n![lq48hBR.gif](http://i.imgur.com/lq48hBR.gif)\n\n3rd (35m x 3.75m, 8-\u003E16 bracing):\n\n![yjgj1To.png](http://i.imgur.com/yjgj1To.png)\n\n4th (50m x 5m, 12-\u003E24 bracing):\n\n![ClIUNa3.png](http://i.imgur.com/ClIUNa3.png)\n\nMay cut down the bracing on the 35m (use same layout as 20m), and use the bracing shown on 35m for the 50m one.  Lots to do, much of it it still experimentation and trying out various geometry setups..\n\nStill very hesitant on the windows.  I like the look while deployed, but I really am not fond of the distortion during the animation (or the illogical nature of distorting a rigid window...). \n\nIn -theory- I might be able to manipulate the mesh\u0027s stowed state to reduce the distortion... but it would take a ton of time (for each window... can\u0027t use mesh-duplication with blend-shape based animation; mesh has to be finalized, and each vertex needs to be manipulated individually, even when doing the same thing 12x rotated around...).  Going to do a bit of an experiment to see if I can get it to work out with a single window, and from there decide if it is worth the time to do it for the whole mesh.\n\nAhh.. tons of fun..."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T21:54:59Z","Content":"I am not so sure about the counterweight.
