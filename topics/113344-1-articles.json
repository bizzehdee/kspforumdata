I think most replies show people are just using what they know. I\u0027ve been using PhotoShop since version 3.something so, though I\u0027m not any kind of expert, I can construct some reasonable-looking things. (And I haven\u0027t found any other software as capable with text.) IrfanView is a great (free) too for quick tweaks too. \n\nOn the Mac, Pixelmator and Acorn are pretty good. I almost switched entirely to Pixelmator -- great tablet support, but I just couldn\u0027t do good enough arrows and text in it, like I could in PhotoShop. I haven\u0027t found anything free on Windows that\u0027s been good enough to grab my attention. Paint.net did look promising though. But for Windows I\u0027ve just stuck with an old version of PhotoShop .. and got a newer version of PhotoShop Essentials, which comes bundled with the Wacom Bamboo tablets. \n\nI haven\u0027t made any flags from scratch. I usually looked for real flags, or sci-fi emblems, scaled and cropped them to size, and applied far more vignetting than necessary. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![all-ish%252520flags%252520-%252520two-row%252520v2.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YFvOwvMWe04/VYQWNQMIHiI/AAAAAAAACWE/19rkTLc9A7A/s800/all-ish%252520flags%252520-%252520two-row%252520v2.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T13:40:21Z","Content":"I use Photoshop CS5.
