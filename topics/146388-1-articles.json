I\u0027ve done so twice now and it\u0027s not registering that I\u0027m at the right location. The first time I put myself in a polar orbit of the Mun, set my target, landed right on top of it, nothing. Flew around the area for a bit, nothing. Restarted the whole mission and selected the target location and landed precisely there with mechjeb and still nothing. Any idea what\u0027s causing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
