This is a doozy. I\u0027ll revisit aircraft parts in another post at another time.\n\nEssentially I\u0027ve discovered the ETT starting techs are a bit illogical. You\u0027ve got players unable to research airplanes without having to do a rocket mission - which invalidates ETT\u0027s stated mandate to allow a player to choose which path they can take. In short, ETT\u0027s mandate practically demands no other starting technologies except for that to make a basic science golf cart, manned or unmanned. I worked on modifying my own ETT and tested how it looks. So here are the changes I made, and here are my recommendations:\n\n**These ideas are based on a theory that wheels and a basic chassis is already available to the player at the start - that the first means to gather science to a stock or modded player is by driving around. This is also the theory behind GAP and is consistent with the CCF framework. It only gives the starting player small and unreliable rover wheels at the start, a battery, and a cubic strut for building a small car chassis.**\n\n**RoveMax Model S2 from Field Science to Starting Technology**\n\n**roverWheel2 to start**\n\n**Small Battery Pack from Electrics to Starting Technology**\n\n**batteryPack to start**\n\n**Cubic Strut from Meta-Materials to Starting Technology**\n\n**strutCube to start**\n\n**Now with the starting technology for a basic car out of the way, construction materials should follow smallest to largest in progression:**\n\n**Octagonal Strut from Meta-Materials to General Construction**\n\n**strutOcto to generalConstruction**\n\n**Mini I Beam from Meta-Materials to General Construction**\n\n**structuralIBeam3 to generalConstruction**\n\n**I Beam from Meta-Materials to Advanced Metal Works**\n\n**structuralIBeam2 to advMetalworks**\n\n**Running around with a car to gather some science should really be the only starting option available to players unless players opt in to start their games with science points to spend. Starting with a car gives players a reliable non-rocket option to grinding the science to start planes, or rockets, as is your intent with ETT for players to choose either or.** \n\n**That said, for starters, I think the thermometer should come before a barometer:**\n\n**2HOT Thermometer from Basic Science to Starting Technology**\n\n**sensorThermometer to start**\n\n**PresMat Barometer from Starting Technology to Basic Science**\n\n**sensorBarometer to basicScience**\n\n**and because of the ETT\u2019s intent to provide a player the opportunity to choose aviation or rockets first, this is why I propose moving the Flea Solid Rocket Booster to Solid Rockets:**\n\n**RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster from Starting Technology to Solid Rockets**\n\n**solidBooster\\_sm to solidRockets**\n\n**If a player wants to start flying solid rockets, they are welcome to science grind to it...through two nodes I propose before Solid Rockets which make for logical technical progression:**\n\n**Model Rockets (modelRockets) 1 science**\n\n**and then**\n\n**Sounding Rockets (soundingRockets) 5 science**\n\n**Model Rockets node should contain the stock sepratron since it\u2019s the closest equivalent in the stock game to a solid fuel sounding rocket per se (and makes early gliders a possibility by giving players an early game boost - literally - which is way lighter than attaching the lead weight of a Flea), and USi\u2019s Sounding Rocket\u2019s most basic motor and parts:**\n\n**Sepratron I from Ullage Motors to Solid Motors**\n\n**sepMotor1 to soundingRockets**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets SRM-S Sounding Rocket Motor from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_Rocket\\_35\\_01 to modelRockets**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Nosecone Parachute (0.35m) from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_Nosecone\\_35 to modelRockets**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Launch Stick from Starting Technology to Solid Motors**\n\n**SR\\_LaunchStick to modelRockets**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Payload Fairing (0.35m) from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_PayloadFairing\\_35 to modelRockets**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Payload Truss (0.35m) from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_PayloadTruss\\_35**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Rocket fin (small) from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_Wing\\_03**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Avionics Package from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_ProbeCore**\n\n**USi Sounding Rockets Materials Study Mini-Lab from Starting Technology to Model Rockets**\n\n**SR\\_Payload\\_01**\n\n**Sounding Rockets node should contain:**\n\n**SR\\_Rocket\\_35\\_02**\n\n**SR\\_Payload\\_02**\n\n**SR\\_Payload\\_03**\n\n**SR\\_Payload\\_04**\n\n**SR\\_Wing\\_02**\n\n**Also, Sounding Rockets tends to have its simple parts spreading to other nodes on ETT that just don\u2019t make sense. I recommend putting all other Sounding Rocket parts not listed above in an Advanced Sounding Rockets node that branches off from the Sounding Rockets node above.** \n\n**Advanced Sounding Rockets (advSoundingRockets) 10 science**\n\n**Advanced Sounding Rockets nodes should contain:**\n\n**all other USi Sounding Rocket parts not listed above**\n\n**Furthermore you might want to move the radial parachute from Starting Technology to Survivability, as golf carts don\u2019t need parachutes\u2026 yet. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)**\n\n**Finally I recommend changing the name Propulsion Systems to Liquid Rockets as it is more description of the intent of that tree. The science cost for Liquid Rockets should be equal to Aviation (since it\u2019s the choice in ETT right?) so make it 15 from the current 1, and boost Basic Rocketry to 25 from the current 10.**\n\nEdit: I should also mention that a basic fin does not seem to fit a car, unless one uses it for a hood covering, haha. But seriously, I was thinking about including it my aviation recommendations. I think aviation still needs a serious node redesign to include aerodynamics, flight control, engines, and other reorganiztion, but that\u0027s for later.\n\nHas anyone come up with a GUI based tree editor?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T08:45:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceNomad","CreatedById":136195,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T12:48:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, inigma said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E fresh new install on a new computer. ckan is not showing the latest ETT. you might want to raise a support issue with the CKAN folks if you haven\u0027t already.\n\u003E \n\n[@Probus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102512-probus/)\n\nIf I\u0027m not mistaken, the version string format changed between 20160112 and 2016-01-15, note the added dashes.

I have lots of time this weekend! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) \n\nYa I figured out the Tech Tree Editor can\u0027t save stock tree with parts. Nasty bug. Only good for node editing.  We really need a good in-game tech tree editor with full GUI and drag and drop and snap and double click right in the R\u0026D.\n\nI should also share a little trick that works with the 0.3 version of Tech Tree Editor: you can load up KSP with any active MM compatible tech tree, which then forces MM to write a new cache for the tree, and then rename the MM compiled ModuleManager.TechTree cache file to .cfg and it will load into TTE.  I was able to load CTT into TTE, but I\u0027ve not tested with your yet, but I figured it would be just as easy.  TTE though just can\u0027t seem to save part edits as stock format, so for now its only good at Node placement.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-12T16:30:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2016 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T18:35:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, inigma said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I should also share a little trick that works with the 0.3 version of Tech Tree Editor: you can load up KSP with any active MM compatible tech tree, which then forces MM to write a new cache for the tree, and then rename the MM compiled ModuleManager.TechTree cache file to .cfg and it will load into TTE.
