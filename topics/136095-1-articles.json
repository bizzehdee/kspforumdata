However, for... \u003Ci\u003Ereasons,\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0my total burn time on the transfer stage - that is, \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E the stage I\u0027m using to get there from KEO, which has almost exactly enough dV to get to Jool from KEO (4,131m/s)\u00A0- is sort of ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is, it\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone hour, fifty minutes and twenty-nine seconds\u003C/em\u003E. Due to the nature of the mission (it\u0027ll all\u00A0become apparent when I actually do the report), increasing TWR or\u00A0decreasing craft mass are not available options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as I see it, my only real advantage is that I\u0027m starting from KEO, which means that such a burn could (if done all at once) be completed in only 1/3 of an orbit, as opposed to taking ten thousand or so orbits if I was in LKO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions for where to go from here?

Find a Mun encounter, and tune it so that you pass behind it (from Kerbin\u0027s point of view). This will accelerate you. Make sure the pass is a nice low periapsis (sub 20 km), and tune your maneuver node so that you\u0027re just barely escaping Kerbin\u0027s SoI after the Mun pass. It may take some playing with the node and moving it around to get the lowest dV cost possible for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have that dV cost, rightclick your maneuver node and add a couple orbits to it - whatever is enough to make you miss the Mun completely.

What I was suggesting is, since you are planning a long burn in solar orbit, you might as well try and get part of that burn done while you are in close proximity of the Mun. Because there, you get the Oberth effect to help you, whereas in solar orbit, you don\u0027t. You potentially stand to gain far larger savings through doing this than the normal Mun slingshot would give you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I\u0027ve never done such a maneuver myself. It would take careful pre-planning to see if (and how) it works. Start with the same minimum-dV-to-Kerbin-escape-via-Mun-slingshot maneuver node you\u0027ve made above. Now put a second maneuver node onto your solar orbit trajectory and plot a Jool intercept - if you are launching within the proper window, you should be able to get it directly from there. Note how much dV it costs, and note the rough shape of the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow delete the second node. Instead, make a node at your Mun periapsis (which, as mentioned before, should be nice and low). Add dV until you have about a 15 to 20 minute burn. Now, it\u0027s important to make sure that the solar orbit you get out of that is shaped roughly similar to the complete Jool transfer orbit you planned earlier, even though this one doesn\u0027t go all the way to Jool. Apoapsis should still point roughly in the right direction, and such. The Mun is also a good place to make an inclination change, If you have to - you can get is practically for free just by adjusting the flyby trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, make a \u003Cem\u003Ethird\u003C/em\u003E maneuver node, this one again just outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI. That\u0027s the node you\u0027ll use to complete your transfer with. Add dV until you have your encounter. Now add up your dV here and that of you Mun node, and compare it to the total cost of the single solar orbit maneuver you planned at the start. You should see a noticable cost reduction.

So you must delete and remake it. But it should be easier this time, since you know roughly how you set it up the first time and how the resulting orbit looked.

You can\u0027t just slingshot in any old direction. It has to be the same one you\u0027d push your orbit into when making a traditional Hohman transfer burn, and as Jool is an outer planet, this means ejecting prograde with respect to Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause your ship is geostationary, you have a long orbital period. You may find that you have difficulties hitting the Mun in exactly the right way to get this trajectory, even when shifting your maneuver node around. The reason for that is that your ship will simply be on the wrong side of its orbit at the proper time, and take too long to swing around. In that case, if you have time left until the transfer window comes around, you can try and gently \u0022phase your ships\u0027s orbit\u0022 by deviating slightly from geostationary altitude - either increasing or decreasing your orbital period with just a little burn. Over many consecutive orbits, even small changes of 5-10 minutes per orbit can add up into a totally different vessel position when the time for the transfer rolls around, letting you hit the Mun slingshot with much more precision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-05T11:52:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2016 11:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T13:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222495706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136095\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459854974\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022March Unto Torment\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, March Unto Torment said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy difficulty with gravity assists is that I find them very unpredictable, and I have yet to find a decent way of figuring out how much dV they use.

To get such a large, 270\u00B0 swing around the Mun you\u0027d need to be going pretty slowly when you enter the Mun\u0027s SOI, and from what we all see when plotting our first Mun intercepts, that 270\u00B0 swing tends to be when your Ap is very close to the Mun\u0027s own orbit;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://files.arklyffe.com/orbcalc.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis excellent calculator\u003C/a\u003E, a burn from LKO to the Mun ends up with orbital velocity of about 170 m/s when you reach the Mun. Therefore the Mun\u0027s SOI catches up with you at an absolute maximum of about (540-170) = 370 m/s. You must therefore enter the Mun\u0027s SOI at a velocity of, say, 400 m/s (taking the vertical component of your velocity into account), and if you exit precisely prograde you\u0027ll leave it with 400\u002B540= 940 m/s. Escape velocity is about 750 m/s at the Mun\u0027s altitude, so you\u0027re basically at escape\u002B180 m/s, which is more or less right to get to Duna or Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- again according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://files.arklyffe.com/orbcalc.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethat excellent calculator\u003C/a\u003E, a transfer from KEO to the Mun has an Ap velocity of about 400m/s, so the Mun\u0027s SOI catches up with you at about 140 m/s. If you go 270\u00B0 around the Mun, you\u0027ll leave prograde with an orbital velocity relative to Kerbin of about 720-740 m/s. Not quite escape...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the trouble with Jool is that you\u0027re wanting to end up with around Kerbin escape\u002B980 m/s.

So personally I\u0027d aim for Tylo, swing by, and only actually enter Tylo orbit just before you want to leave the system (since burning to Kerbin from Tylo is much more efficient than burning from Tylo orbit out to Jool orbit then from there to Kerbin, for exactly the same reasons as you don\u0027t want to burn out to Kerbin SOI edge and then burn to Jool in the first place).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: re \u0022orbital velocity\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is actually the thing that determines how much of a burn you need to go anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn LKO, orbital velocity is about \u003Cstrong\u003E2300\u003C/strong\u003E m/s. If you increase this by 900 m/s (so at Pe, orbital velocity is \u003Cstrong\u003E3200\u003C/strong\u003E m/s) you will raise your Ap to near Minmus\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you increase that by another 50 m/s or so, you escape Kerbin\u0027s SOI.
