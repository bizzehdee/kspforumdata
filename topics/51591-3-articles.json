There\u0027s no reason to build a communications satellite or a space station or an airplane in the stock game, but if you want to and think that\u0027s fun, go for here and take their blessing. AntennaRange was conceived -- again, in general -- under a similar mindset. Honestly, I wrote the first versions specifically because if I didn\u0027t have a rule \u003Cem\u003Emaking\u003C/em\u003E me use the bigger communication pieces, I\u0027d never do it, and I think it\u0027s a shame that the base game doesn\u0027t have any system for enforcing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I wanted AntennaRange to be primarily rewarding, not punishing; that is, I want the player to feel like the efficiency of their space program has been increased by using the parts \u0022right\u0022. That\u0027s why the parts feature a data speedup when you\u0027re below the nominal range; it is literally a real-time reward for playing the game in the way that I (personally) think is more realistic and more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relay feature was intended as a continuation of this philosophy. If people don\u0027t want to build a relay network, and just want to send Communotron 88-88s everywhere they go, that\u0027s fine. But if they do, they get rewarded: expensive data transmissions from the surface of Eeloo can happen almost as quickly as if you were in low Kerbin orbit. In my opinion, this allows for and (I hope) fosters creative design in your spacecraft and space programs, without explicitly requiring people to spend a lot of real time setting up complicated communications networks in the name of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with all this in mind, I\u0027ve left these values configurable for a reason, and using ModuleManager (with thanks once against to (the awesome) Ialdabaoth and sarbian) affords a lot of flexibility in how we move things forward. When I was looking over the AEIS parts it occurred to me that it might be a lot of fun to talk to carmics about distributing his antenna parts with some custom AntennaRange configs as an optional \u0022hard mode\u0022 pack. I\u0027m also very interested to hear thoughts from those interested here: what do you think should be the \u0022next step\u0022 for AntennaRange?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a qualifier: I\u0027ve said before and will say again that I\u0027m not interested in developing a comprehensive replacement / substitute for RemoteTech. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe new update is working well, even immediately after undocking a ship from the station it\u0027ll be using as a relay, thanks much for that fix! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I have noticed one little oddity, however...\u003Cp\u003EI have a probe sitting on the surface of Minmus with the shortest range antenna, with a relay sat orbiting Minmus with a longer range antenna.

But, I\u0027m not certain it\u0027s very easy. My impression from casually listening to chatter about mods like Interstellar is that ElectricCharge handling is somewhat esoteric and inconsistent; it might be difficult for me to properly detect the actual net gain in order to do an auto balance. A manual balance should be easier; tweaking packetInterval upwards ought to reduce the actual power draw and proportionally reduce the throughput.
