What I found weird is that in the existing craft, I cannot attach a fuel pipe going from the outside tank to the inside tank. This forces me to make a replication of the stage as a seperate craft (in which case I can attach the fuel line from outer tanks to the center tank) and merge it to the old craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what settings etc may cause it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T15:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s usually more that you have to have a clear path between the two endpoints. If the fuel pipe intersects any other part, then you are not allowed to place it there. By moving the camera around carefully, you can usually find a way to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T18:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it does not intersect other parts.
