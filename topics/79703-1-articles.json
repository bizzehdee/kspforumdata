At the time, it was version 0.21.1 and, looking back, I can see how much the game has changed in just a year. From career mode being implemented to a new space center design, to the ARM patch. I have enjoyed my time so far with KSP, stock and modded. Even now, I haven\u0027t done everything I can. I\u0027ve done at least fly-by\u0027s of all the planets except Dres legitimately, and I still have to land on Moho, Eve, Gilly, Ike, Dres, Tylo, Vall, Bop, Pol and Eeloo. 10 objects out of 15, I haven\u0027t landed on legitimately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, overall, I\u0027d like to give squad and the community a good ol\u0027 thank you for the game. It truly has been a great experience playing your game and seeing how others have been playing. Not to mention the challenges put forward to me on the forums. Thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadRocketsCo.","CreatedById":101686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T07:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I have been playing for the exact same length of time! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has been fun and the community is lovely.
