I heard something about imprecision in the terrain mesh: basically, the suspension reacts as if the terrain were slightly higher or lower than what you see (and are driving on), so it pulls up/pushes down trying to conform to where it thinks the terrain is. It\u0027s only a problem when it pulls up, because it actually starts trying to pull the rover off the ground, and partially succeeds. The REAL problem there is that if you\u0027re on a hill when it happens, there\u0027s an extremely high chance you\u0027ll be rolling down said hill seconds later if you\u0027re at any kind of speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, before stock wheel were added I used to cruise around with the old Bigtrak rover, and it was actually FASTER on the Mun than on Kerbin. Over twice as fast, in fact. I got it up over 90 m/s one time. But then again, it was completely immune to damage, so when it\u0027d end up in a tumble after catching some air (and at that speed on the mun it catches air off every tiny rise), nothing came of it other than stuff on the outside of it getting broken. I dropped one from LMO one time by accident, and it survived just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then, I don\u0027t think the Bigtrak HAD a suspension, and I also think that\u0027s why it never had any of the problems the current rover wheels do. Even TT\u0027s Modular Multiwheels have the same suspension problems as the stock wheels, so it\u0027s clearly a Unity problem. I\u0027ve tried disabling the suspensions on the stock wheels to test if I\u0027m right, but only succeeded in making the wheels not work at all, so I\u0027m kinda stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome interesting, semi-random facts I discovered while trying to build a safe-esque manned rover in 0.20:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETR-2Ls have a tremendous amount of friction, which is a large part of why they work so well, with basically zero ability to slip. This includes even the non-tread parts of the wheel, like the sides. One of the results of this is that if you catch air and then come down in a direction that doesn\u0027t allow them to rotate, they basically stop dead on the spot, which causes an ENORMOUS G-Force spike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 30-35 m/s ish, this spike gets strong enough to rip the wheel off the rover entirely, and possibly knock the Kerbals out of their command seats just from the jolt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 50 m/s, the jolt from even regular structural members hitting the ground gets strong enough to start breaking off radially attached parts. Things like RTGs, Probe cores, and command seats (the wheels and Kerbals are probably long gone at this point, but only a direct impact will take the wheels off even at this speed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom further testing in 0.21, when the new terrain made it worse:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovemax 1s basically can\u0027t climb hills.

Their inability to skid at all just makes them generate way too much force, it seems. And it doesn\u0027t affect the suspension issue at all. Now if your problem were the joint between the rover and the wheel flexing, it might help. Might, there\u0027s some kind of problem when placing rover wheels with SPH symmetry that causes the second one not to attach properly...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
