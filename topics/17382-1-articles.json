The only issue? Asplosions. For reasons unknown, a fuel tank disengages from the ascent stage and causes the rocket below it to slam upwards into the arm of the station. Even worse, I have no clue what fuel tank it is. This same accident has killed about 40-50 kerbonauts because, well, it\u0027s a space station. The crew don\u0027t need to return to Kerbin so I neglected to add a parachute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause my computer has the processing power of a potato, I\u0027m going to upload the .ship file.
