Went through numerous designs as this is my first VTOL craft in KSP. \u003Cbr\u003E\nIt has 4 Engines. 1 Rapier, 2 VTOL jet engines, and one front VTOL lifter jet engine (Quiztech Aero mod). It has a docking port on the front, RCS system, and air brakes. It can land and take off in water. You can also use it as a boat. It doesn\u0026#39;t have wheels as it uses legs to land. Works with FAR.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ship by itself will not make it to orbit but I made a launcher for it ;) The launcher has 4 LFBs and 4 SRBs and is pitched at 30 degrees and man does it get you to space fast.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s still a work in progress so I haven\u0026#39;t come up with a name yet so maybe somebody could help me :) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/0jwDoAV.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ZlHDZfV.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]m2MLO[/imgur]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T03:52:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jbakes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
