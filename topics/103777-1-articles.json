For reference, the 737-800 has a MTOW of 79 t, and carries 26,000 liters of fuel. Jet fuel\u0027s density is around 0.8 kg/L, so that\u0027s about 21 tons of fuel. It uses two engines with a maximum thrust of about 120 kN, giving a TWR of about 0.31 (KSP\u0027s basic jet engines should be able to get it in the air just fine). Try building a plane that looks similar to a 737, using crew cabins, and tweak the fuel tanks to give it 21 t of fuel. If it\u0027s much over 80 t, than KSP\u0027s parts are a bit heavy... compared to a jet airliner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the MK3 parts are really made for \u003Cem\u003Espaceplanes\u003C/em\u003E, and presumably have a bunch of heat shielding, life support equipment, etc. So they SHOULD be a bit heavier than they would be for an airliner.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T03:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mad Rocket Scientist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mad Rocket Scientist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI made a FAR/NEAR A320 replica with 2 engines:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0oLmHVQ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/0oLmHVQ.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually it\u0027s really maneuverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you post the craft for that one?
