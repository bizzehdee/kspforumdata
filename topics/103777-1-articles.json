For reference, the 737-800 has a MTOW of 79 t, and carries 26,000 liters of fuel. Jet fuel\u0027s density is around 0.8 kg/L, so that\u0027s about 21 tons of fuel. It uses two engines with a maximum thrust of about 120 kN, giving a TWR of about 0.31 (KSP\u0027s basic jet engines should be able to get it in the air just fine). Try building a plane that looks similar to a 737, using crew cabins, and tweak the fuel tanks to give it 21 t of fuel. If it\u0027s much over 80 t, than KSP\u0027s parts are a bit heavy... compared to a jet airliner.\n\nHowever, the MK3 parts are really made for *spaceplanes*, and presumably have a bunch of heat shielding, life support equipment, etc. So they SHOULD be a bit heavier than they would be for an airliner."},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T03:58:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I made a FAR/NEAR A320 replica with 2 engines:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/0oLmHVQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/0oLmHVQ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Actually it\u0027s really maneuverable.\n\nWould you post the craft for that one?
