Part of the problem is that the threads I find end with \u0022ok I fixed it\u0022 without an explanation of how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started by creating my colliders as objects in 3ds Max, then bringing them in with my model, adding the various tags and setting everything up. I made sure Positive Y was up and Positive Z was pointing in to the model. And that actually mostly worked. I was able to get in and out of the airlock, and climb up and down the ladder I had defined. But the problem was I couldn\u0027t transition to ladders on other parts. I noticed my Kerbal was very close to the pod when exiting the airlock, the ends of his hands were actually clipping. I tried moving the colliders away, but it didn\u0027t seem to make a difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to switch to just using box colliders straight in Unity. I tried having them intersect the model, stand off from the model, so many things my head is spinning. I could exit the hatch, but I couldn\u0027t get back in. When I did get the \u0022Grab\u0022 indicator, my Kerbal tried to grab something a good ways off the side of the object, and was immediately thrown off. I wasn\u0027t even getting as far as I was with the imported geometry that I had turned into mesh colliders, despite the fact that box colliders seem like they should actually be simpler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that the tutorial on the wiki, while a nice start, is lacking some key details. It also has some information that is just plain contradictory to what I\u0027ve read in threads.
