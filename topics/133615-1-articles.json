See if you can you know what happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a previous mission I have rescued some astronauts lost without too many problems, the issue is that today wanted to rescue two more contract, and incidentally, bring back two others had out there orbiting kerbin and mun (do not ask because :-D ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproach to the right, between 0.5km and 2km, but still having the \u0022set target\u0022 of the mothership to which he would rescue or vice versa, did not show me the point in space at that address.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs was less than 2km, could switchear (with \u0027\u00A1) between ships, but did not know where they are from each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn other occasions without problems, being less than 2km, was dating the Kerbal and I went to the ship with the RCS without major problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end I was able to rescue the 4 approaching very much (imagine, always making meetings where the sun beat XDD) and when he saw one point, I was going there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you like something happened?

The best you can really do is get solid bearings with nearby references like the planet\u0027s surface and the sun, and remember where your ship should be if you have to swap, because you will need to set your target again after switching. If you\u0027re on the dark side, this can be nearly impossible without lights. The dev team is talking about a full UI overhaul in \u00A01.1 so there is a chance that this challenge has already been addressed. It\u0027s not a bug - its just a lack of foresight that can be very problematic at times.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you are just rescuing and not docking, it\u0027s a lot less difficult because you can simply light up your rescue craft, switch, EVA, and fly to the gleaming Kerbalese nearbly. Also, the round lights have enough range to illuminate another craft within the target icon\u0027s (sometimes) disappearance range of 500M. This doesn\u0027t seem to apply to docking targets. It\u0027s also worth considering that most cockpits and crew cabins have a \u0022Lights on\u0022 mode that can definitely help keep things visible, and they don\u0027t require additional lights or additional power.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found this image to show some smart lighting. This craft was a breeze to dock, even on the darkside because the main portion illuminates both itself and the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KUsZ8Av.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022KUsZ8Av.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-06T22:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2016 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
