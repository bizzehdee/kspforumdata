From what I\u0027ve read, the problem seems to be the centre of mass. When the centre of mass, due to fuel usage moves closer to the middle of your rocket, the more unstable your craft becomes. With my rockets, i am fine for a while, but then a slight nudge and it goes out of control. For this reason, i plan on building much heavier bottoms and taller rockets, to try and get the centre of mass as far down as i can. Might even add structural fuesale to act as a blocker to maintain the mass at the bottom as the fuel dissapears to make it more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot tested these ideas out, but, hopefully we can find a solution together.

Having the centre of drag behind the centre of mass (with respect to velocity direction) will ensure the rocket is stable regardless of its attitude but if it is too far back you won\u0027t be able to steer at all. It is possible to maintain forward flight even in an unstable configuration so long as you keep the too aligned or have the attitude authority to overcome the drag torque. But if you turn too hard the drag applies a larger and larger torque (positive re-enforcement) and the rocket flips.
