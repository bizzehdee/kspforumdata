Some missions or achievements\u00A0also give you a small amount of points. You use these points to unlock nodes of a tech tree. Nodes give you parts. Upgrading the RD Building allows you to reach further in the tree. You may (according to your career settings) need money to unlock each different parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I \u003Cstrong\u003Elike \u003C/strong\u003Eabout it.\u00A0It\u0027s a familiar concept in games. It\u0027s easy to understand. Fancy parts are harder to get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I \u003Cstrong\u003Edislike\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eabout it. All the experiments are equivalent (1). It encourages grinding science (2). Experiments aren\u0027t connected to unlocked technologies\u00A0(3).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) Science points are science points, no matter where they come from.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(2) I feel like it\u0027s a lot of \u0022go that\u00A0high, go that far, bring thermometer, barometer, goo, come back\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n(3) I know the temperature of the North Pole of the Mun, my scientists can finally develop supersonic air intakes !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA system that I think would be interesting\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0(I will most likely purchase KSP2 in any case but hey, my pride would be infinite if I can contribute) would be to.....\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EHave missions to unlock technologies or parts.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, revolutionary idea, right ?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, launching the first uncontrolled rocket \u0022that high\u0022 would unlock basic control. Then the first suborbital flight unlocks higher vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E engines. The first orbit unlocks basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, while the first rendezvous unlocks docking ports. And so on.

I didn\u0027t mean that the \u0022missions\u0022 or \u0022milestones\u0022 would come one after the other in a predetermined sequence. You could have a tree as well. And chose how you want to progress through that tree. My point is just that instead of having science point requirement to unlock technologies or parts, you\u0027d have to do specific stuff, or go to specific places. But not in a specific order. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E/EDIT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy do I think it would make sense ?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, right now, you can basically have almost everything unlocked before you send your first interplanetary craft.
