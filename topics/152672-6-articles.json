I\u0027ve been sort of mulling over how a page like this should look.

Imagine if we showed an image of a base that has mining craft harvesting Uraninite, plus a craft that handles the processing into EnrichedUranium, a way for that EnrichedUranium to reach PL, then maybe even a way for the base to handle retrieving DepletedFuel through PL and recycling it into EnrichedUranium again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my mind, I imagine that this hypothetical base would be made up of a few individual vessels. We could show an image of everything on the surface, then break down the base by vessel. Image of the vessel, what parts it has, what it DOES (I think this is what messes up lots of new players) and then maybe a link to a craft file. Does that sound reasonable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never messed around with uploading or downloading craft files anywhere, but isn\u0027t there a repository or something where people upload craft files?

The nice thing about DStaal\u0027s idea of craft basically being stand-alone examples, with suggestions for modifications (if I\u0027m understanding you correctly) is that multiple people could come up with various craft files and they don\u0027t necessarily have to mesh with each other, since the idea is to simply give ideas. The way I understand it, I could come up with a craft that is focused on storage of useful MKS resources with LS recyclers and agroponics (that is, no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E/mining of any sort, just using/storing resources that have been shipped in) as an early example, while someone else could come up with a craft that is dedicated to LS functions including mining/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. Even though these two craft overlap in function, they still both show ideas of what can be done. Is that sort of the idea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s how we want to do things, I think the next steps should maybe be to come up with A) a rough list of what kinds of craft/functions we want to show off (sort of like a roadmap for development) and B) some sort of standard format for how the entries should look on the wiki. Do we want craft separated into categories. how do we want to list possible modifications you could make to craft, do we want to include a list of what parts are used,\u00A0etc.?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thought I had was incorporating parts from other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods.

If we wanted to show any sort of interplanetary ark craft, FTT\u0027s Orca command pod is a natural addition.
