There should probably be a reason to orbit (or land on) different planets. I like the deep core drill and science lab ideas, although the latter isn\u0027t strictly a science experiment, but I think people will be happy as long as they can earn science points, somehow.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You should look into behemoth sized capsules/service modules for these bad boys!\n\nI\u0027ve looked into that, and it is a LOT of work to implement the IVA.

Needs more regidity!\n\nNice picture of the solar panels! Glad you seem to like the size!\n\nRegarding rigidity, the panels actually do not have a mass. What happens is that the secondary solar panel (the one that comes out upside down) is always \u0027on\u0027, and so turns toward the sun, even when folded, if you don\u0027t have anything on top of it. It\u0027s complicated, obviously, but it was a compromise I had to make in order to make both solar panels work with a single extension/retraction animation. Normally, you won\u0027t have the solar panels at the very top of your stack, so I figured it wouldn\u0027t be a huge problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T20:04:33Z","Content":"I see.
