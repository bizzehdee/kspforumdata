I did get things sorted out thanks to a fix by sal\\_vager I found buried on page 3 of the support request forum. Basically, when one copies an old save file to a new game folder the pointer to the tech tree config file in your persistent.sfs does not update--and if you don\u0027t point it in the right way, whenever you go to the VAB or SPH it\u0027s all [edit--I tried to write the acronym that begins \u0027whiskey tango\u0027 but oops filter] Anyway it can\u0027t figure out what parts you have access to so nothing loads.
