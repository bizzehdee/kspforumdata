I use a lot of texture sharing, even between seemingly unrelated parts; for example both the LC and SC-C series use geometry and textures from the SC-A RCS blocks. I suppose I could always split them as needed, with duplicating assets where they are needed. Would result in a slightly larger .zip sizes; but if I setup the layout properly they should all merge into the same folder and result in the same setup in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvertising -- aye, I will need to come up with a good plan when I\u0027m ready for a bit more exposure.

I suppose I need to start outlining precisely what the precise direction of the mod will be, what parts are in the works, what parts are finished, etc, and perhaps start getting promotional material setup for those portions that are done/nearly complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T18:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd.... the current full set of adapters/end-caps (not all will be available on every part, or even used initially):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8l8xPUg.png\u0022 alt=\u00228l8xPUg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to do some texturing for all these end-caps and noses... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of want to add some stringers to the sides of most of the adapters, and the bottom edge of some of the nose-cones.

Plugin code seems to be working well so far. Models have all been exported and are available in-game.

So... textures might be a bit rough for the nose-cone/adapter bits initially, as I don\u0027t think I have time to fully clean them up for this release; they will all have textures, but there might well be visible seams and most will be lacking detail, and none will be finished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the config end of things I managed to get the tank config file definition down from \u0026gt;2000 lines to ~500 lines last night through some refactoring of data storage, parsing, and layout, while still allowing for the same level of control and customization, and greatly increasing the human read/write-ability of the file.
