It was installed on a clean copy of ksp 0.24 (32 bit). I also installed Mechjeb 2 and Active texture reduction (Stable Aggressive). After a lengthy startup (so active texture reduction definately worked) the game seemed to be working fine. I created a new save and headed over to the hanger to build a spaceplane. Then the problem arose. As you probably know, B9 5 reduced the amount of parts by letting you switch between different versions. However, every single switchable part was bugged. The parts had all of the varients loaded at the same time and the textures were bugging out like when two parts clip. In addition, I could not switch between the part varients either-the option simply wasn\u0027t there apon right clicking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have any idea what I could do to fix this, or what is wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Using the wrong version of ksp-I wasn\u0027t quite up to date enough.

There is a confirmed incompatibility between Firespriter\u0027s multipart sistem and Tweakscale that causes the bug you describe.
