But here\u0027s one that\u0027s good to go out of the box. The Colibri MkF offers zero practicality, but makes up for that with huge amounts of giggles. Seriously, this thing is fun. But, because it\u0027s got fixed blades you\u0027re limited to around 50m/s top speed. Handling is best between 30 and 40m/s. But hey, who am I to stop you from having your fun with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake note, that if you have the Take Command mod installed, this craft will NOT work properly. Take Command does weird things to bearings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to operate this little baby, climb aboard, stage and remember to engage SAS. It\u0027s just not fun without out, and frankly is impossible to fly without SAS. While a true autogyro\u0027s rotor disc does spin much faster, and has a far shallower mast angle, this is about as good as we can get with a low part count (120 in the air!) in KSP. It provides a suitable mix of spinning blades, yet still capable of behaving. And with all the reaction wheels to counteract the torque you can do some fun stunts with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull power, and go. Sometimes the blades don\u0027t start spinning until you\u0027ve lifted the nose. But most of the the time it works all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing left to be said, is you really should try it for yourself... Because next up is the hinged version featuring fully flapping independently articulated blades, coming soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Rune for some suggestions way back near the end of September on mast\u002Bblade angles, and thanks to BlueCanary for some test flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECriticisms, comments and suggestions welcomed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/6704?download=true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDirect download from KerballX \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MV7uGN5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MV7uGN5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K1xShJO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K1xShJO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T21:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool craft!, and I love the way you used the toroidal fuel tanks like that!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T21:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bubbadevlin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bubbadevlin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECool craft!, and I love the way you used the toroidal fuel tanks like that!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
