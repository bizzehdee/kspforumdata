But what confused me is, that the target of the telescope is the L2 point (not LEO). So, how does the telescope get there!? I read the fact sheet. There it says the complete telescope\u0027s weight is 2 tons - including ca. 220 kg of propellant! I have read somewhere that you need around 4300 m/s of deltaV to get to the L2 point from LEO. My gut feeling was, that its not possible with the data from the fact sheet. So I rebuilt a probe with total mass of 2 tons and 220kg propellant in KSP/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. And like expected: no matter which thruster I use, I get nowhere near 4300 m/s deltaV... (for example: with a 350 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster I get 354 m/s ...).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how do they get the probe to L2 with just 220kg of propellant!?

I also thought of this possibility. But then the telescope still needs to slow down at L2.
