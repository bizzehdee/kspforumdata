Nothing ever really works, it\u0027s just one random error after another. I have reinstalled MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) countless times to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m following the tutorial on OSDev on compiling a cross-compiler. Make usually produces errors like \u0022C compiler cannot create executables\u0022 or some random error that occurs from a file (but make usually stops whatever it\u0027s doing \u003Cem\u003Eminutes \u003C/em\u003Eafter the error occurs, so I can\u0027t really figure out what the problem is). I don\u0027t understand why GCC can\u0027t make executables (it\u0027s a fresh install, yet it can\u0027t), nor do I understand why things don\u0027t just \u003Cem\u003Ework \u003C/em\u003Efor me when they work for everyone else. I followed the instructions on the tutorial \u003Cem\u003Eexactly \u003C/em\u003Ehow they are written.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u0027s a developer acquainted with GNU/Linux/*nix, then please post so that I can explain my woes in further detail and in less ambiguity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(That means that if this sounds like gibberish to you, ignore.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
