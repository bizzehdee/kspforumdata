By \u0027mission\u0027 I mean in-transit vessels to another moon or planet excluding things like stations and satellites and bases (unless they\u0027re en-route) that tend to stay put once in place. I always have run a lot at once, personally, but I know a lot of other people play more sequentially, and like to see each mission all the way to its conclusion before starting another. My suspicion is that because there will be colonies and stations to establish and support more players will have more simultaneous in-transit traffic than they do in KSP1 and will be less inclined to run one-off flags and footprints missions from Kerbin all the way to your destination without switching vessels. But maybe people are resistant to that? In either case it probably has implications for how resources are managed and how UI support works with things like alarm clocks and mission plans appended to vessels, etc.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoughts?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-14T16:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224116802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649951959\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to get a sense of how many players fly more than one mission at once\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I have more than a game time day to wait until something \u0022happens\u0022, I will work on another mission.\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027ve had well more than 10 missions going at a time.\u00A0 And yes, it has led to confusion on both my part (missed burns mostly), and KSP\u0027s part (created maneuvernodes evaporated after returning to craft after much game time interval etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-14T16:28:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2022 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-14T17:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to not care if in game time goes up a lot, so I\u2019ll not work on anything until a transfer is complete, unless it is a long transfer (like to Jool) in which case I\u2019ll build stuff to launch in intermediary transfer windows.

Im glad to see stock alarm clock has changed things for a lot of folks, I seem to recall a similar poll a few years ago almost half of players were typically running one mission at a time (not that thats a bad way to play, just that KSP2 might incline more with colonies and interstellar and all).

It does make me wonder though will there be some kind of time-cutoff for how long an interstellar mission can take? And how would that work? If vessel mass is all that mattered you could under-build and time warp overnight for a 100 years. So is there a reason to make faster ships besides avoiding ludicrous warp durations?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis leads me back to the age old LS question because the idea of it worries some people, especially when you\u0027ve got long warps and lots of simultaneous vessels. Even if LS is abstracted away somehow and doesn\u0027t deplete as its own resource do these vessels need continuous power? Perhaps having sufficient reactor fuel for the journey is a constraint?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-15T14:40:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2022 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
