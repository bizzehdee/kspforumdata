There\u0027s a lot of potential in outer space, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be much that anyone thinks is viable. There\u0027s a lot of \u0027when flight costs go down\u0027, or \u0027when someone creates the infrastructure\u0027, or \u0027we\u0027d need a pilot-project to test the concept first.\u0027 It seems that this whole thing is waiting for a major break-through. Still, let\u0027s see what we have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital solar power: I see great potential here. The construction costs are huge, but the possible output is in the realm of some of our biggest power projects. However, we can\u0027t say how well transmitting that power would work, let alone the hundreds of little concerns about anything that gets between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, a decent break-through in fusion power could make the matter irrelevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicroprocessor manufacture: There\u0027s a lot of theory here. The idea is that better crystals could be grown or more dense microprocessors could be made in microgravity. But this is still three or four projects short of a full plan. First, crystal grown of silicon in zero-g. Second, the combining of gallium arsenide and/or gallium nitride in zero-g. Finally, modifying the machinery for creating microprocessors for zero-g and testing if zero-g allows for improvement in manufacture. Those have to be done before anyone is going to commit to any plan. I did have a thought of sourcing the materials for making zero-g microprocessors from space to reduce the up-and-down costs. However, gallium is only found as a trace element in zinc ores and bauxite, which means you\u0027d already need to be producing aluminium before you\u0027d find gallium and I haven\u0027t found a notable source of zinc in space. Current ISRU doesn\u0027t cover rare minerals right now. Either way, we\u0027re just not there yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining ice water: This one looks easier. All of the concepts, except two, have already been proven. It has also been pointed out that there is a potential market for water in space, the ISS. Yes, it\u0027s a tiny market...but it does currently exist and has plenty of room to grow. The issue that still needs to be examined is the mining and handling of materials in zero-g. The devil\u0027s in the details here. This plan is a one-trick pony unless the vehicle can also making fuel from some of the ice it is mining. The water could be melted and electrolysed in some form into hydrogen and oxygen. But it turns out that pure water needs overpotential (that is, a lot of power) to break down into it\u0027s components. Usually an additional material is added (a salt, acid, or base) to the process to reduce the power requirement. But that means adding something to the water that can be separated from the hydrogen and oxygen afterwards before the process of compression and cryogenic cooling. Otherwise you have self-induced fuel impurities in a continuous mission. This is not to mention that materials handling now includes moving both liquids and gases in zero-g or the general power requirements of the process. Still, nothing that is, as of yet, impossible to overcome. Before I forget, you also need a big source of ice water to continuously mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, how much is the payload fraction of average ISS re-supply made up of water? I don\u0027t exactly see this as reducing the number of ISS re-supply missions, although it would definitely extend some of the safety factors for operational crews. That said, cargo space on a re-supply mission will be filled with something. I\u0027m just wondering if that\u0027ll be enough to get two different space agencies to sign the contract. I\u0027m sort of wondering if this plan couldn\u0027t be sweetened a bit. What else could be mined in space, preferably near ice water, that with only a bit of refining, could be used by the ISS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you might have calculated something here. If the vehicle could mine ice water, and make it\u0027s own fuel, then it should be able to bring liquid fuels to LEO, right? Well, possibly and sort of. The vehicle already needs fuel to both get to LEO, then back to the ice mine. Anyone who knows about cryonic fuels knows that they tend to boil off in the tanks. So the vehicle used might not have enough fuel to spare for other craft. Also, The thrusters on the ISS don\u0027t use a liquid hydrogen/oxygen mix, so that can\u0027t be re-supplied through ice mining. If anyone wanted to use any extra water for fuel, they would have to make that fuel through their own means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESending whisky to age in LEO: I like this one. It\u0027s just the sort of thing I was hoping to see here. It can be done with current technology, it is done for a uniqueness that only continuous zero-g can provide, and it can easily absorb the launch costs to make it happen. Modern whisky, or whiskey, casks can be made of metal or plastic, so materials shouldn\u0027t be an issue. They just have to be left in long-term storage in a climate-controlled environment, which a space-station should have. The market for specialty alcohol is huge. More than a few labels go for over a thousand a bottle. A quick Google search tells me that a bottle of Black Maple Hill 21 Cask 5 goes for approx. $3,000, a bottle of Bowmore Black 1964 2nd Addition for approx. $9,300, and a bottle (likely just one in existence) of Macallan 1946 Select Reserve for over $13,000. If aging in zero-g does slightly different, yet agreeable, to whisky, specialty collectors will buy the bottles for thousands per bottle. Of course, at anywhere from 119 litres to 300 litres per cask, it likely sets the teeth of engineers and quartermasters alike to lift and return that much dead-weight whenever it would be time to rotate the stock.

It\u0027s just the sort of thing I was hoping to see here. It can be done with current technology, it is done for a uniqueness that only continuous zero-g can provide, and it can easily absorb the launch costs to make it happen. Modern whisky, or whiskey, casks can be made of metal or plastic, so materials shouldn\u0027t be an issue. They just have to be left in long-term storage in a climate-controlled environment, which a space-station should have. The market for specialty alcohol is huge. More than a few labels go for over a thousand a bottle. A quick Google search tells me that a bottle of Black Maple Hill 21 Cask 5 goes for approx. $3,000, a bottle of Bowmore Black 1964 2nd Addition for approx. $9,300, and a bottle (likely just one in existence) of Macallan 1946 Select Reserve for over $13,000. If aging in zero-g does slightly different, yet agreeable, to whisky, specialty collectors will buy the bottles for thousands per bottle. Of course, at anywhere from 119 litres to 300 litres per cask, it likely sets the teeth of engineers and quartermasters alike to lift and return that much dead-weight whenever it would be time to rotate the stock. But it\u0027s very unlikely that space-aged alcohol will flood the market anytime soon, keeping the prices stable..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon can haul to space and return 3310 kg.

But I don\u0027t think anyone wanted to fill an entire Dragon capsule with whisky in the first place. No one can afford an entire capsule of dead-weight and the ISS doesn\u0027t have that much long-term storage. So let\u0027s cut it down a bit. This calls for a limited run. Let\u0027s say, a run of 100 fifths. As you said, a fifth is 0.76L. Assuming that we\u0027re not bothering with specialty casks, Wikipedia tells me that a wine cask holds 119L, of which only 75L is needed for the run itself. In fact that\u0027s over-kill, even with testing, tasting, and potential inefficiencies in bottling. The cask would weight a little over 113kg, which actually might not be as bad as I feared in terms of payload weight. The other 3197 kg in the capsule can be filled with things NASA or someone else actually wants to send in space. So the whisky doesn\u0027t need to pay for the whole rocket, just it\u0027s small part of it. Just keep the runs made to a hundred bottles or so and you have a small amount of a unique product for a market whose high-end market values unique products. Additionally, sometimes collectors actually consume the product they collect. So there is the possibility of a small amount of repeat business too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this plan does require that someone else want to buy up the rest of the space in a capsule to make it work. But I\u0027d like to point out that it also currently would also use long-term storage on the ISS because the ISS is currently the only climate-controlled environment in space right now. But that\u0027s what I like about this plan. It makes use of the currently existing infrastructure to make a business. And just to note. you would only want to send up casks of alcohol, never bottles. Fears of filching by the residents aside, it would be much easier to protect a cask from the tough handling up and down from space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T22:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis has been mentioned a bunch.
