The one scenario I could see where they might do it on their own without requiring federal funding is if Musk decides that the moon is a reasonable enough demo for certain systems needed for the Mars colonization effort he\u0027s got planned. Different enough that maybe it isn\u0027t worth it, but maybe similar enough that he does it. Either way, the man definitely has a lot of pride in his setup, I could see him going for it if his engineers feel they could do it first. Musk is not afraid to hurl away craptons of his cash for silly reasons. We\u0027ve got quotes from former engineers of SpaceX about million dollar projects being scrapped and restarted because their current iterations were not \u0022cool enough\u0022. Yes million and billion are different scales. Still, time will tell one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
