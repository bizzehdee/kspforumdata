The Chinese would be excellent partners for a manned Mars mission.\n\nApollo was 30 tonnes because it had about 20 tonnes of fuel to perform LOI, orbital manoeuvres, LOE. However you don\u0027t need one craft to do that, you also put some of the fuel in the lander (Constellation) or use a different stage (L3).\n\nThe Constellation Orion was about 20 tonnes and the Soviet LOK was 10 tonnes. \n\nAs for if it\u0027s cramped, probably about as much as Orion but it will mainly be a station taxi compared to Orion.\n\nAlso yes you are correct it is too early to start talking about more advanced things like the exact weight, I presume it will be along the lines of 23 tonnes.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But 45 years pass...

Different enough that maybe it isn\u0027t worth it, but maybe similar enough that he does it. Either way, the man definitely has a lot of pride in his setup, I could see him going for it if his engineers feel they could do it first. Musk is not afraid to hurl away craptons of his cash for silly reasons.
