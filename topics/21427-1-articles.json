Use a full tank for the lander, not a half one, it always helps for beginners to carry a little more fuel than needed, and it wont affect your rocket much. 2. Get rid of the middle stage, just have the main core of 3 LV-45 engines with 4 tanks above each plus 3 boosters also with 4 tanks and LV-30\u0027s (or aerospikes if they fit) under them. You can also add the big SRBs on the outside as needed, (I have 12 and I made it fly, but that\u0027s probably overkill \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) but they aren\u0027t integral.

The primary difference is that I made use of the full sized FL-T400 tank and I omitted the S.A.S. Module. I actually found landing upon Mun with such a slender footprint to be quite difficult and I\u0027ve since changed my lander design to something a bit easier to handle. Still, I\u0027m glad to see I\u0027m not the only one who had the idea to go with that kind of design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j318/Tobias_R/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot24.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used quite a bit different rocket design however. What I put together allowed me to get into Kerbin orbit with 1,400 Liters of fuel in my second stage, which proved to be more than adequate to get my command module up to Mun and to put me into a descent trajectory. I\u0027ll post a pic here as well as it will be a bit easier than trying to explain the whole thing in words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j318/Tobias_R/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot31.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot31.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak to how efficient that design is, but I\u0027ve found it to be reliable and quite suitable for the purposes of getting me to the Mun. Basically I use Rockomax tanks on the first stage and cluster eight 4.5 segment liquid boosters around that - the boosters don\u0027t just provide thrust, they also feed fuel into the central engine such that the primary tanks don\u0027t get drained until well into flight. I calculated that my first stage utilizes about 22,400 Liters of fuel and provides enough velocity to almost reach orbit by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, my main issue with landing on the Mun was that such a slim lander design leaves a very narrow footprint and its all too easy to crash, fall over or just fail miserably when it comes to affecting a landing. To be honest the keyboard layout and controls are not optimal for doing a manual landing, from what I can see, as it\u0027s no easy feat to use the mouse, the left control/shift keys and hit WASD all at the same time. Of course I might just be very uncoordinated - anything is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, I\u0027m pretty new to all this landing and orbit stuff myself so it\u0027s nice to see what other people are experiencing. Getting that first landing down without dying was quite the simulated experience to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew_C","CreatedById":53864,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T13:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the suggestions and advice, everyone.
