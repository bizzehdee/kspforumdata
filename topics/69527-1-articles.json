Also, the simple fact that the fuel has mass and needs to be accelerated is an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you get something that looks a lot like a scramjet, but use an electric arc to heat the flow, you don\u0027t have all these pesky mixing issues, and you can even get limited magnetoplsmadynamic thrust (extremely efficient at low pressures, works like a thermal arcjet at higher pressures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpontaneously, it looks like you could get better performance, and the weight of a microwave receptor should be comparable to the fuel tanks you don\u0027t need anymore. But nobody seems to be actively working on it, why?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T12:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t any compact electric energy source, yet. And no, real life microwave receiver doesn\u0027t work like in KSPI. Delivering several megawatts of power without using focused beam requires large receive array, which well, is too large to fit at the aircraft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T15:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA megawatt rectenna with a large gain (over 30dB) could fit easily in a small rocket, but you would need a very large emitting antenna to get a decent transfer efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn antenna array of 1m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 working with 1mm signal can have a gain up to 62dB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 10x10m emitter antenna would have a gain up to 82dB, at a 50km distance, you would have a .5% transmission efficiency, so you would need to emit 500MW to receive 1MW.
