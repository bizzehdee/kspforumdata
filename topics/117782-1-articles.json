Without a gimballed engine, flight control surfaces and a dedicated vacuum engine I suspect a lot of people with a fair amount of experience in KSP would struggle to get far!\n\n@ the OP, I haven\u0027t tried the Mun yet, but I slapped together a simple unmanned satellite that can get into a low orbit and not much else, as well as a manned rocket that can land on Minmus (i\u0027m assuming Kerbin\u0027s second moon is in the demo) and get home. The manned rocket could easily orbit the Mun, but would not survive any kind of landing attempt.\n\n![KSP%20Demo%20Style%20Satellite_zpshqhl98ye.jpg](http://i591.photobucket.com/albums/ss352/ghpstage/KSP%20Demo%20Style%20Satellite_zpshqhl98ye.jpg)\n\n![KSP%20Demo%20Style%20Minmus%20Rocket_zps2uems34u.jpg](http://i591.photobucket.com/albums/ss352/ghpstage/KSP%20Demo%20Style%20Minmus%20Rocket_zps2uems34u.jpg)\n\nThe lack of a decoupler below the command pod mean that re-entry, which I haven\u0027t yet completed will likely prove to be to explodey for Bill\u0027s tastes, but Jeb would probably love it.\n\nIt makes use of RCS for control during the ascent due to the lack of flying controls or vectored engines. Asparagus staging (thats what the fuel lines are for) is used as reaching the required dV without a dedicated vacuum engines isn\u0027t easy!\n\nThe asparagus might make copying it difficult for someone not familiar with the game.\n\nIn practice the solar panels on the manned rocket were a waste of fuel as all the engines had alternators..... but they may serve to rescue the worst reentry section I have ever built.\n\nI could have dumped two of the engines on the initial stage too.\n\nOnce you have a design your going to have to learn how to fly them, both at launch and your in space manoeuvres. What you have seen in videos of the game post version 1.0 will give you an idea of what to do during take off and reentry, orbital manoeuvres are the same as always so most videos will give a decent example of what to do there.\n\nOf my designs the unmanned rocket will not have access to SAS outside of sandbox mode, while the manned one will need RCS activated to control in the atmosphere but the rest should be the same as in most vids.\n\nEDIT I didn\u0027t expect it, but the Minmus rocket actually made it home following a lengthy aerobraking manoeuvre.

Basically the rocket equivalent of training wheels and MOAR boosters that solve a number problems. The solid boosters provide stability in themselves and act as a larger base for more lateral attachment of fins. Also, the wedge shape tends to maintain your heading at 90 degrees although it\u0027s not perfect. At one point, it is horizontal at about 30-40km up, in my hands at least. But there is more than enough rocket power to get you into orbit and then to the Mun and back.\n\n- central rocket that get\u0027s to the Mun, orbit and back  \n\n    - Command pod\n    - 8 TL-200\u0027s\n    - LV-30\n\n    [\\*]2 liquid fuel side boosters\n\n    - nose cone\n    - 7 TL-200\u0027s\n    - LV-30\n    - radial decoupler attached as in picture  \n\n        - use the offset tool to push things up and down\n\n    [\\*]2 Hammers that fire at the same time as the LF side boosters, capped with nose cones\n\n    - attached to the central rocket\n    - these run out before the LF side booster and decouple earlier\n\n    [\\*]6 Hammers that are ignited first, capped with nose cones\n\n    - attached 3 each to the two side boosters\n\n    [\\*]stick the fins on as seen in picture\n\n![fNvezVt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fNvezVt.jpg)\n\nIt fumbles a bit but below is the shot of what it should look like getting into Kerbin orbit. This manuever uses up the side boosters and is finished by the central rocket.\n\nEnough remaining fuel to get you to the Mun and back. (2500m/s deltaV for those who like numbers). It\u0027s been a while since I built something without MechJeb and flew something completely by hand with no manuever nodes.\n\nKeep everything in the central rocket for reentry, enter the atmo tail/engine first. Then decouple while 2-5km above ground level, open parachutes and Robert is your mother\u0027s brother.\n\nFeel free to slap on a few solar panels and batteries, I run the LV-30 at low thrust to get some charge as required.\n\n![yTLWWHd.png](http://i.imgur.com/yTLWWHd.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T15:46:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Weywot8**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:01:58Z","Content":"After much messing around I decided I just couldn\u0027t come up with a design I was really happy with - so here\u0027s three!\n\nThe design requirement I used was to be land on Mun and return, not just fly-by it. In accordance with my usual policy for landings, that also implies orbitting first, not just coming screaming in at high speed. Note that in general the parts used are the only ones of that type available in demo mode - and unlike the other designs given in this thread (except the fly-by probe) this these *only* use demo parts ^^.\n\n**Lander:**\n\n[![I83Km1sl.png](http://i.imgur.com/I83Km1sl.png)](http://imgur.com/I83Km1s)\n\nThe lander design is common to all three transfer/launch vehicles. The only thing that needs to come back to Kerbin is the pod and to do so safely it needs a parachute - so that\u0027s all that is above the decoupler. Since it can be hard to find somewhere flat to land on Mun, especially if you\u0027re new, this has a low Centre of Mass (CoM) and widely-spread landing legs. For both these reasons there are three fuel tanks radially attached to the decoupler, with the engine immediately below it. Fuel ducts are required to feed fuel from the tanks to the engine. Finally a 1x6 solar panel is also attached to the decoupler.\n\nThrust is obviously high. This amount of fuel is sufficient for the final Mun landing phase, re-launch, re-orbit, transfer to LKO (71km), re-orbit there and de-orbit burn. Once that\u0027s complete stage to jettison the tanks, legs, engine and solar panels, fall through re-entry until speed is below 250km then stage again to deploy the parachute.\n\n**Transfer:**\n\n[![PNucNbdl.png](http://i.imgur.com/PNucNbdl.png)](http://imgur.com/PNucNbd)\n\nIt takes a T30 about 6 tanks of fuel to transfer the lander from LKO to Mun, establish orbit there and de-orbit/almost land. It seemed sensible to use the lander\u0027s own engine for this, since there\u0027s no choice of engine anyway. Keeping this clear, putting the tanks under the existing radial stacks was a simple decision. Fuel ducts are required to connect these up to the lander\u0027s tanks, and so to the engine using the ducts they already have.\n\n**Launch Vehicle A:**\n\n[![zvSnZBfl.png](http://i.imgur.com/zvSnZBfl.png)](http://imgur.com/zvSnZBf)\n\nExtending below the lander and transfer stages\u0027 three stacks for the launcher, more T30s can only push another 7 fuel tanks each, which just isn\u0027t enough. Fins on each stack are simple enough, but fiddling-around with the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) got a bit messy. For a start, they need to be placed with mirror symmetry, not radial, or they\u0027ll clip into something \u0027with hilarious consequences\u0027 when you try to separate them. Secondly, I *still* had to asparagus them - and adjust the thrust-limiters in the VAB to match the liquid fuel consumption - in order to get acceptable performance. Note that although they are not visible in the picture there are struts connecting the bottoms of the main stacks, so they don\u0027t spread and wobble during flight (see variants below).\n\nHo hum. This looks impressive at launch and minimises drag (once you lose the boosters) because there are just the three serial stacks, but it\u0027s complicated to build. Flies quite nicely, but I wouldn\u0027t bother if I were you.\n\n**Launch Vehicle B:**\n\n[![79FtDEKl.png](http://i.imgur.com/79FtDEKl.png)](http://imgur.com/79FtDEK)\n\nIf not straight serial staging then asparagus is always an option. For the second attempt I made a core stack with 6 tanks. The lander and these tanks is a fair load for a single T30 but this stage is only used for the final ascent and circularistation, where shear power (Trust to Weight ratio, TWR) is not so important.\n\nRadially attached to this in the North and South positions - symmetry 2 = asparagus - are stacks of 12 fuel tanks, small reaction wheels, nosecones, fins and, of course, T30s. You can see how these are strutted together at the bottom. Being an asparagus arrangement, fuel ducts connect from these to the core stack. Identical stacks are finally put in the East/West positions, with the fuel ducts feeding their neighbouring N/S stack (and on to the core). The first-placed/last-jettisoned stacks are N/S so their fins give most benefit during the gravity turn, those on the E/W stacks are less useful.\n\nThis launch variant has the best performance (dV) but is most expensive (and has the most parts).\n\n**Launch Vehicle C:**\n\n[![J1xvaRyl.png](http://i.imgur.com/J1xvaRyl.png)](http://imgur.com/J1xvaRy)\n\nThis is an almost identical design but moves the transfer fuel-tanks down from the lander to the core/circularisation stage.

In accordance with my usual policy for landings, that also implies orbitting first, not just coming screaming in at high speed.

The only thing that needs to come back to Kerbin is the pod and to do so safely it needs a parachute - so that\u0027s all that is above the decoupler. Since it can be hard to find somewhere flat to land on Mun, especially if you\u0027re new, this has a low Centre of Mass (CoM) and widely-spread landing legs. For both these reasons there are three fuel tanks radially attached to the decoupler, with the engine immediately below it. Fuel ducts are required to feed fuel from the tanks to the engine. Finally a 1x6 solar panel is also attached to the decoupler.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Thrust is obviously high. This amount of fuel is sufficient for the final Mun landing phase, re-launch, re-orbit, transfer to LKO (71km), re-orbit there and de-orbit burn. Once that\u0027s complete stage to jettison the tanks, legs, engine and solar panels, fall through re-entry until speed is below 250km then stage again to deploy the parachute.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Transfer:**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E [![PNucNbdl.png](http://i.imgur.com/PNucNbdl.png)](http://imgur.com/PNucNbd)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E It takes a T30 about 6 tanks of fuel to transfer the lander from LKO to Mun, establish orbit there and de-orbit/almost land. It seemed sensible to use the lander\u0027s own engine for this, since there\u0027s no choice of engine anyway. Keeping this clear, putting the tanks under the existing radial stacks was a simple decision. Fuel ducts are required to connect these up to the lander\u0027s tanks, and so to the engine using the ducts they already have.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Launch Vehicle A:**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E [![zvSnZBfl.png](http://i.imgur.com/zvSnZBfl.png)](http://imgur.com/zvSnZBf)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Extending below the lander and transfer stages\u0027 three stacks for the launcher, more T30s can only push another 7 fuel tanks each, which just isn\u0027t enough. Fins on each stack are simple enough, but fiddling-around with the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) got a bit messy. For a start, they need to be placed with mirror symmetry, not radial, or they\u0027ll clip into something \u0027with hilarious consequences\u0027 when you try to separate them. Secondly, I *still* had to asparagus them - and adjust the thrust-limiters in the VAB to match the liquid fuel consumption - in order to get acceptable performance. Note that although they are not visible in the picture there are struts connecting the bottoms of the main stacks, so they don\u0027t spread and wobble during flight (see variants below).\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Ho hum. This looks impressive at launch and minimises drag (once you lose the boosters) because there are just the three serial stacks, but it\u0027s complicated to build.

For the second attempt I made a core stack with 6 tanks. The lander and these tanks is a fair load for a single T30 but this stage is only used for the final ascent and circularistation, where shear power (Trust to Weight ratio, TWR) is not so important.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Radially attached to this in the North and South positions - symmetry 2 = asparagus - are stacks of 12 fuel tanks, small reaction wheels, nosecones, fins and, of course, T30s. You can see how these are strutted together at the bottom. Being an asparagus arrangement, fuel ducts connect from these to the core stack. Identical stacks are finally put in the East/West positions, with the fuel ducts feeding their neighbouring N/S stack (and on to the core). The first-placed/last-jettisoned stacks are N/S so their fins give most benefit during the gravity turn, those on the E/W stacks are less useful.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E This launch variant has the best performance (dV) but is most expensive (and has the most parts).\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Launch Vehicle C:**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E [![J1xvaRyl.png](http://i.imgur.com/J1xvaRyl.png)](http://imgur.com/J1xvaRy)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E This is an almost identical design but moves the transfer fuel-tanks down from the lander to the core/circularisation stage.
