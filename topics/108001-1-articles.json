This is in no way a serious suggestion, although if someone made a tech tree based on this concept I would try it just for fun.\n\nI just had a random thought: what would the game be like if the tech tree were reversed, i.e. instead of starting with the Flea and the Mk1 pod, you started with the Mammoth and the Mk3 Cockpit?\n\nThe progression would be from larger to smaller parts, so some parts would still be approximately where they are now (RTG, ion engines) but in general the progression would be essentially the opposite to what it is now.\n\nThis obviously wouldn\u0027t be for a balanced playthrough (would probably need to be for a science game due to size/weight and funds), but it could make for some interesting design challenges when all you have to work with is oversized parts.\n\nA possible beginning to such a tree:\n\nStart:\n\nMk3 Cockpit\n\nMammoth Engine\n\nLarge 3.75m Tank\n\nMk3 to 3.75m adapter\n\n3.75m decoupler\n\n3.75m heatshield\n\nmaterial science bay\n\nmk16-xl parachute\n\nAnd an example first craft:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![BigStart.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/BigStart.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWhat are your thoughts and suggestions on how this progression could work?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T03:55:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:28:46Z","Content":"For some things it would make a lot of sense, more than the current tech tree at least which is totally bonkers."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T03:35:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For some things it would make a lot of sense, more than the current tech tree at least which is totally bonkers.\n\nWhats so bad about current tech tree? im not saying its great, but its a massive improvement over the past 0.90 one.

At least i get my bloody jet engines quickly, and for the most part the progression in size/advancement is at least logical.\n\nWell, one problem IS that it starts small and goes big. This suggestion/joke actually makes SOME degree of sense.\n\nAside from interactions between part count limitations and tiny tanks (and this vanishes almost instantly unless you\u0027ve cranked the building costs to 1000% or so), and *eventually* rocket stiffness/lag issues, tiny tanks are actually more powerful items than big tanks (that\u0027s one of the reasons why people keep on asking for procedural tanks).\n\nLarge tanks limit your flexibility - imagine if you ONLY had T800s and Jumbo64s. What would a light science probe look like? Or the last stage of a one-man craft built around the mk1 pod? Mk1-T800-lv-909? It would have a lot of delta-v, but it would weigh something like six tons minimum. If you had all the tanks, you could use a T200\u002BT100 and have a nice little return stage. And if youreally wanted to, and your part count/lag issues were under control, you could make the same craft as the T800 design with a set of eight T100s or four T200s etc.\n\nHaving to deal with heavy other parts is also bad - There\u0027s very little the big cockpits can do that the Mk1 can\u0027t do (basically hold more than one kerbal), and they\u0027re murdering your dry mass.\n\nPeople get all spazzy drunk over specific impulse, when dry mass is often MORE important.\n\nAnyhow, reversing it in the manner suggested would make it so that you WERE by and large unlocking *upgrades* (aside from a few obvious exceptions)."},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T05:52:56Z","Content":"Oh man, I\u0027m just thinking about the tons and tons of money required in the beginning.\n\nThat bail-out strategy would get used a lot!\n\nStill, at the very least, such a reverse tech-tree makes you think..."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:03:07Z","Content":"@Kuu Lightwing\n\nI thought about starting with the lab, but it\u0027s a science over time part and I wanted to make sure at least one regular experiment besides the crew/eva reports would be available. Although now that I think about it, that would be an interesting dynamic, having to get enough crew reports to fill up the lab to get science...\n\n@T-Bouw\n\nI thought about the funds issue as well, which is why I suggested that this might be more appropriate for science mode (or a career mode with the funds slider at 1000% like Renegrade suggested).\n\nAnd yes, the whole point of this kind of progression is to make you think completely outside the current progression box.\n\nSome good ideas here, keep it coming."}]}
