So Neptune has cleared its orbit, because the only things sharing it are Trojan asteroids and Plutinoids locked into a 3:2 orbital resonance (and minor Neptune-crossers which haven\u0027t been fully cleared). The same with Earth, everything earth-crossing is either locked in orbital resonance with earth (like Cruithne), or it is slowly being perturbed either towards an orbital resonance or ejection from earth\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mathematical parameter used to determine how dominant a planetary body is over its orbit, and how likely it is to clear its neighbourhood over astronomical timescales. It is called the Stern-Levison Parameter, and is anything but arbitrary. The major planets have Stern-Levison parameters from 942 (Mercury) to 1.3E9 (Jupiter). The most gravitationally dominant dwarf planet over its orbit is Pluto, with a Stern-Levison parameter of 2.95E-3. So Jupiter is 7 orders of magnitude more dominant than Mercury, and Mercury is 5 orders of magnitude more dominant than Pluto. Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Haumea and Makemake all have S-L parameters of roughly the same order of magnitude, so if you let one in you have to let them all in.

This is already partly true, and eliminates issues with objects that do not quite fall into this category or that. I can imagine that things still need hydrostatic equilibrium to have a baseline, so that all the loose floaty rocks and dust will be cut out.
