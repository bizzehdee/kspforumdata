You\u0027re still likely to get lots of wobbling though. The key to turning such a craft is patience. Turn off SAS, use RCS, turn on fine-control mode. Only fire the RCS briefly and let your ship slowly drift to the right orientation. If your ship still wobbles too much, you might need a mod like Kerbal Attachment System that lets you add struts in space, but personally, I\u0027ve never had issues with just being careful and gentle with the turns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPuller designs work well if your ship is very long, and will reduce flexing. Make sure that the exhaust doesn\u0027t hit any part of your ship, however. One piece of advice is to turn off the gimbals on the engines of the tug (and any engine that is in front of your center-of-mass). If you don\u0027t, the engines will gimbal in the wrong direction and steer you away from where you want to turn. This bug/quirk might be fixed at some point, but is still present as far as I know. This means that you\u0027ll need to have several SAS modules or use RCS to maintain altitude control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T10:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo make a tugger with SAS on the front and possibly back with gimbal deactivated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeem good?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T10:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uc1J8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
