can\u0027t just startup the ISRU and mining equipment, and leave it running whilst timewarping at the space center, it requires baby sitting since they deactivate due to not being in contact with the ground (even though they are), something weird about the surface of Pol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Take off from Pol, and burn for a Periapsis around Jool of about 250km timed with the departure

Jool with my orbit was impossible, burn huge amounts of fuel just to avoid being flung back out into deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use aerocapture and remaining fuel to lower orbit to around 80x80km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Burn to de-orbit somewhere near KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Slightly overshoot KSC (ended up coming down by the island with the runway), and glide/fly back to
