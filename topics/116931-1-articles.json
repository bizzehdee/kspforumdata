You love Markdown. GitHub, KerbalStuff, and KerbalX love Markdown, but CurseForge and the forums don\u0027t. Since the latter two are official, this leaves us mod makers with the trouble of having to manually shoehorn our README files and such into HTML and BBCode. There\u0027s a tool called [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org/) which can convert documents between various markup and markdown formats, but it doesn\u0027t handle BBCode by default. Fortunately, somebody else went to the trouble of making [**a BBCode exporter**](https://github.com/2ion/pandoc-bbcode), and I have produced [**a modified version**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/pandoc-bbcode) which works with vBulletin\u0027s flavor of BBCode. (I don\u0027t actually know Lua or pandoc specifically, so please let me know if you find any issues. In particular, I\u0027d like to have a nice way to get the true width of a table, because when pandoc ingests Markdown tables, it doesn\u0027t seem to get any width information, so the resulting BBCode table always defaults to width 500.)\n\nNow we can write our README files **once**, export them, and then paste them into the \u0022source editors\u0022 of CurseForge and the forum.

That\u0027s where the pandoc-bbcode converter lives. I put this batch folder in e.g. my AntennaRange Relays folder, so it goes up one level to get to \u0022Addons\u0022, another level to get to \u0022KSP stuff\u0022, and then down to where panbbcode.lua lives. Since the batch file is in the top of the addon directory, same as the README files, they don\u0027t need any folder information.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-08T01:19:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2015 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra**\n  \nRevised for the new forum."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T23:43:43Z","Content":"This should be helpful.

Since that\u0027s what KerbalStuff parses the markdown into, that\u0027s what would get copied.
