Ever since the moldy lunch bag incident admin has removed all refrigerators in the spacecraft. Therefore you need to get that ice cream to KSC 2 before it melts. Fastest time gets to enjoy the coldest ice cream. \n\nPlease post screens of you landed near the space center and any mods that you used. \n\nI made it in 16m 38s using vanilla parts. I could trim that down a little as I overshot the landing site a little on reentry :-X\n\n\u003E ![screenshot9.png](http://s17.postimage.org/elkcvsybj/screenshot9.png)\n\nVanilla:\n\n1: antbin: 12:04\n\n2: infatuatedPP: 13:12\n\n3:\n\nMods:\n\n1:\n\n2:\n\n3:\n\nCredit goes to antbin for the original idea.
