I basically boost up into an elliptical orbit matching the height of Minmus. I\\\u0027ve even gotten lucky a few times and have been able to get the Mun to slingshot me up to that orbit for a much more fuel efficient ride. Once my apoapsis is even with Minmus\\\u0027s orbit, I do an alignment maneuver to match its orbital inclination. There is a simple way of doing it by basically aligning the orbital lines in the map view so they both look like solid lines, and then burning either north or south at the point where the two lines intersect. Sorry I\\\u0027m bad at describing this. Anyways once the apoapsis is matched, the inclination is matched, I simply burn prograde at apoapsis until the patched conics show me entering the SOI of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is by no means the most fuel efficient, or smartest way of doing it. I have a tendency of overbuilding my rockets, so fuel isn\\\u0027t my biggest concern.

It\\\u0027s pretty accurate and doesn\\\u0027t take much fuel. Here\\\u0027s how:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get into a circular equatorial orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Focusing the map view on your craft, zoom out until both the front and back lines of the moon orbit are in your view. Line them up so you\\\u0027re looking at the moon\\\u0027s orbit \u0027edge-on\u0027. You should see Kerbin in the middle, and a horizontal white line going across it for the moon\\\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Turn your view until the Minmus orbital plane crosses behind Kerbin (You may need to zoom out a bit more). You are now looking directly at the intersection of the two planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Check which way you need to burn: at your craft\\\u0027s next crossing of the intersection, you will either need to burn north or south to change the angle. You can orient your craft to put the navball on the horizon at 0\u00C2\u00B0 north or 180\u00C2\u00B0 south and lock it there. You can set this up ahead of time: unlike when pointing prograde in orbit, these points on the navball won\\\u0027t move, they\\\u0027ll just rotate about your ship\\\u0027s axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Zoom in until you can see the sphere of Kerbin fill the top and bottom of the screen. If you\\\u0027ve focused the map view on your craft, Kerbin will move across your view from side to side while your craft stays centered. You\\\u0027ll know you\\\u0027re at the intersection when the space on either side of Kerbin is equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. When you reach the intersection, burn full power. You\\\u0027ll have to zoom out to see the Minmus orbit, and zoom back in to overlay your craft orbit. Check a few times until your orbits look like the same angle. Cut the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for exactly when to start your transfer burn to Minmus, I\\\u0027m not sure. I can usually get it pretty close, but I still have to sweep around with small radial burns mid-course until I find an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
