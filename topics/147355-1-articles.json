results of your training, and the current needs of the Service - you\u0027ll be assigned somewhere. \u00A0Could be a fighter pilot, could be flying a transport. \u00A0 And heaven forbid you manage to wash out, you still have a service commitment and\u00A0you\u0027ll end up JOOD on a tin can somewhere. \u00A0Had a Division Officer like that, washed out, went to an oiler, and volunteered subs to get off the oiler. \u00A0He was lucky, they closed the boats to non nuke officers about a year later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe am I glad I\u0027m not an American.\u00A0 The policy as told to me is that needs of the service dictate how many open positions are available at each point in the training path.\u00A0 The RCAF isn\u0027t very big, so that can change radically from year to year depending on who is retiring.\u00A0 But we then get to choose our path based on our class rank.\u00A0 Being top of the class doesn\u0027t make you a fighter pilot.\u00A0 It gives you first choice of assignments.\u00A0 Lots of people actually want to fly transport because you can then go on to make big bucks flying 747s for a major airline.\u00A0 Others want to fly helicopters for similar reasons, and because they want to do search and rescue operations.\u00A0 That\u0027s a really big thing in Canada given the distances involved.\u00A0 The \u0022fast jets\u0022 aren\u0027t everyone\u0027s first choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
