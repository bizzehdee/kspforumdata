If you must use a limiter, I\u0027ve had success with using \u0022Limit acceleration to 20 m/s.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fine if it\u0027s on really, it\u0027s been fixed in the latest dev version. Limiting acceleration to 18m/s or 20m/s should keep you under that anyway. I\u0027m finding that once you get beyond ~10km, terminal velocity is a non-issue anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot16_zpslbefwdc8.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot16_zpslbefwdc8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot16_zpslbefwdc8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T21:15:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orange_Slime_","CreatedById":109168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I love mechjeb, and before 1.0 used it for near everything.
