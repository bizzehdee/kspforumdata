Having done that, I set my eye on a loftier goal, a manned Laythe return. Now, I like to meticulously plan everything in advance, but in this case, don\u0027t have all the info. And what better way to fix that than by starting a generic-named Howto thread, and dump a bunch of vaguely-related questions into it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst question concerns those delta-v maps I see floating around. As I read them, I need a vessel in LKO to have circa 4000 m/s delta-v for the return trip, assuming aerobraking on Jool capture with the resultant apoapsis around Laythe\u0027s orbit. But, I am unsure (How much to kick that periapsis out of Jool atmosphere? How costly is the Laythe capture?). What are the rough requirements, assuming liberal use of aerobraking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, my Duna mission vessel had abysmal TWR, which resulted in rather long burns. Not long enough to jeopardize the mission, but long enough to annoy me. How low do people commonly go, before low TWR becomes a serious problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, it looks to me that the best way to go about designing a Laythe lander is to build a hybrid jet and rocket powered VTOL SSTO. Which raises a whole host of questions, since I can test my designs on Kerbin, not Laythe, and I don\u0027t want to overbuild the lander to make it Kerbin-ascent capable. My current design has around 1500 m/s delta-v as reported by MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer, which I think accounts only for the rocket-powered ascent phase. Is there a good way to find out the delta-v of the jet phase? I guess I could build a purely rocket-powered ship with 2800 m/s delta-v, and try and match its ascent profile with my hybrid lander, but that wouldn\u0027t be entirely accurate, since I imagine jets perform slightly differently on Laythe. Or do they?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks in advance for any insights, I\u0027m sure as I keep designing I\u0027ll stumble into more questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T11:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of its atmosphere, Laythe is indeed the ideal destination for spaceplanes. The only difference to jets is that it\u0027s slightly denser so you get as much thrust as if you were higher in altitude - but it\u0027s fine since gravity is also less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that if you aim directly at Laythe for aerocapture instead of stopping at Jool then intercepting Laythe, you can save yet some more fuel. You can basically do Kerbin orbit \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Laythe orbit on just 2000 m/s of deltaV. It works both ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC someone was able to make a round trip to Laythe with a single-stage spaceplane, using just jet engines and ion engines (and lots of solar panels). Low TWR too alas... The lowest TWR I allowed myself on a Laythe mission was 0.16 and I had to thrust for 36 minutes (24 minutes ingame, but there was some dilation because of the size and complexity of the mothership). It\u0027s fine as long as you only have to do it once.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T11:17:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jesrad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T14:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would definitely opt for a VTVL jet powered SSTO for Laythe landing and return to orbit rather a spaceplane. I have landed planes on Laythe but in general the terrain is poorly suited to extended landings so your plane needs to be very durable and capable of landing very very slowly. Jets do function a bit differently on Laythe, I think you get a little less intake air. My advice though would just be to build a VTVL jet rocket that can achieve Kerbin orbit, that way you have a more versatile craft than something that can only achieve orbit on Laythe. I find a lot about this game is reducing the challenges you face to problems you have previously solved, so while you may not need a small Kerbin ascent capable SSTO at the moment, you might find you\u0027ll need it later and then you won\u0027t have to do a complete redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for long burns to get to Laythe, I wouldn\u0027t worry about it. My typical burns to get there are between 15 minutes and an hour, time accelerate and read a book or something, it\u0027s more efficient that way. I would definitely suggest doing the initial burn to Laythe as a series of periapsis kicks and possibly, if the alignment suits, a munar gravity assist as well - every little bit of fuel saved is a bonus. On your way back, a Tylo gravity assist might be a good way to leave the Joolian system but I\u0027ve not actually attempted a return flight from Laythe yet. My Kerbals go there and they colonise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can estimate the delta-v of your jets with the rocket equation. Turbojet ISP is 800s, so exhaust velocity is effectively 8000ms\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E. If you want, say, 2000 delta-v from your jets you need 31% of the starting mass of your rocket to be liquid fuel (note this is approximate because jet ISP changes with altitude).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T14:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(Warning: Non-helpful joke reply)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how you Laythe ^^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T14:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you go straight to aerobraking on Laythe from you transfer orbit that bit will be almost free.
