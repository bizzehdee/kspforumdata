The Pelican is an 8 Kerbal SSTO shuttle capable of extended flights both in space and atmosphere. Based on the frame of an obsolete kerban bomber, the Pelican has the ability to maneuver like a fighter, rather than the roomy Kerbal Carrier that it really is. A balerina in the air, on the runway the KC 12 is skittery, and it\u0027s advised that around 60-70 m/s you start bringing the nose up. Also, due to it\u0027s need for extended operations in orbit, the Pelican is rather heavy, and it is advisable to keep it in a shallow climb at 15,000 meters or higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kc-12-pelican/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kc-12-pelican/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1012.photobucket.com/albums/af248/barrenwaste1/screenshot49_zps4d49cd00.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot49_zps4d49cd00.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1012.photobucket.com/albums/af248/barrenwaste1/screenshot50_zps759cba4c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot50_zps759cba4c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1012.photobucket.com/albums/af248/barrenwaste1/screenshot51_zpsa1c67f21.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot51_zpsa1c67f21.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T18:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by barrenwaste\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot the download\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralMDBK","CreatedById":72407,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T22:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice craft :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scootersoup","CreatedById":92366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T05:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a neat way of resolving things.
