EL contains a somewhat similar part to the first concept ( Launch Pad 2 ), maybe this already suits your needs?\n\nThe second one is close to the concept I have in mind for the foldable Pad. Had to throw away the first concept because I couldn\u0027t get it working in unity ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) \n\nRamps are a general problem. They need colliders and if they hit uneven terrain I assume it gets messy pretty fast. This is one of the reasons I try to seperate the Launchpads in \u0022rocket-pads\u0022 and \u0022rover/plane-pads\u0022 (and maybe submarines) but I have to admit that I couldn\u0027t come up with a good concept for the latter yet.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, colmo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s correct - it operates like a launch clamp in terms of the way it interacts with the ground and attaches to parts, but creates essentially a nice wide concrete slab, that merges neatly with the ground (bevelled or stepped to make it climbable by Kerbals) and should also be perfectly upright, ideal for building non-mobile craft on. In the VAB or SPH, you\u0027d construct, say, a hut made of metal plates with a probe core or command pod, then attach the concrete foundation like a launchclamp to the bottom. When built using EPL (using survey stakes most likely), the slab would anchor the hut permanently to the ground, precisely level. It could either be available in a number or sizes, or with some kind of Tweakscale functionality.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It would be perfect for anchoring the recycler to the ground, for instance. The only way to shift them afterwards might be demolition. And any opportunity to use demolition in KSP can only be a good thing.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure how launchclamp functionality works, but you could add nodes to it, which might not be affected by it, only the connection via surface attachment.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E This mod would work very well with it:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128954-the-cube-transformable-blocks-designed-to-fit-your-structural-needs-super-sexy-edition/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It could spark interest in parts designed for static us - large command station, research and comms pods with IVAs, KAS pipes designed to pass underground (only the connectors at each end would be visible, ideal for fastening to the concrete slabs), and associated damage mods like Kerbal Krash System, which allows such installations to get rather battered looking without disappearing with a puff or boom.\n\u003E \n\nI really like this. Spent the whole day experimenting with the LaunchClamps and I had a lot of fun. It seems like it does not matter if other parts are attached radial or via node, but when the LaunchClamp is activated, it only breaks its connection to the part, that the root-part is attached to (have a look at the pictures below for better visualisation). Other attached parts remain attached to the Clamp. So I attached the Clamp to the root-part and the metal-plates, hitchhiker and stuff to the Clamp (via node).\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aplYz/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWhat I have not figured out yet is how to set the spawn height. Moving the craft up/down in the VAB does not affect the spawn height.\n\nThe levelness of the Clamp/spawned craft depends on the level of the Launchpad. During the tests I realised quickly that the deployment vessel needs to be very robust and symmetric  in order to make everything level.\n\nI\u0027ll upload a test-config to GitHub as soon as I have a basic texture.\n\nI\u0027ve never done anything with IVAs but I\u0027m interested in that too. Biggest problem will be the time-factor. Had a bit of free-time the last three weeks and could get a lot done but tomorrow RL kicks back in.\n\nDuring the tests I had some strange observations with the new tanks. While building a craft, not all RocketParts tanks get actually drained. Some tanks just remained full. EL was still using/converting RocketParts (on the GUI) but the overall amount of RocketParts in the resource-panel did not change. I\u0027m gonna investigate this further with a clean install tonight or tomorrow but maybe someone encountered this too."},{"CreatedByName":"Third_OfFive","CreatedById":142954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T02:24:47Z","Content":"Does anyone else get the Better Off Ted reference?"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T02:42:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Eleusis La Arwall said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What I have not figured out yet is how to set the spawn height.

Now attach the base-parts to the sockel via node or radial attach. Save the file but don\u0027t launch it from VAB/SPH.  \n\n- IN VAB/SPH: Create a new craft with a Launchpad/Survey Stake (latter is recommended for level sockels). When done, launch it and bring the Launchpad/Stake in position. Build the craft with the sockels attached from first step. Finalize/Release.  \n\n- Focus the new craft with the Sockel and activate the \u0022launchclamp\u0022. The Root part and stuff will fall off as described in the first step.\n\nLimitations:  \n\n- It is possibe to connect mupltiple bases created that way with KAS but as soon as two vessels get attached the launchclamp is reenabled! Activating the \u0022launchclamp\u0022 afterwards will result in connection break between both bases. (During my tests only the KAS-connector was seperated, the bases did not detach from the sockel, but no warranty)  \n\n- On uneven terrain: find a spot as flat as possible with very low slope. In some cases I was able to spawn \u0022level\u0022 Sockels but weired things may happen: [Fail-collection](http://imgur.com/a/dg0XD)\n\nUntested:  \n\n-Near/in water  \n\n-Docking  \n\n-A lot more\n\nWarranty:  \n\nThis is highly experimental - No warranty if it breaks craft- or save-files.

I\u0027m not really good with words but I\u0027ll upload a pic when I can.\n\nThought a bit about other forms. Triangular, hexagonal and round (24faces) are the most obvious I could come up with so far. Maybe some rounded corners.\n\nDuring some more tests I figured out some things to increase propabilty for a successful deployment on uneven terrain:  \n\n1. The survey stake should be the highest point in the \u0022deployment area\u0022. Spawning downhill had much less violent desintegrations than mixed/uphill.  \n\n2. Attach a Ground base (from KIS) to the surface. Attach a plate to the Ground base and \u0022level\u0022 it by eye. It doesn\u0027t need to be 100% accurate. Now place a survey stake on the plate. [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/d8dPx)\n\nAll 3 bases in the pictures are perfectly leveled (Had a Kerbal sit in all 4 corners and the height was identical with KER).\n\nI almost forgot, it does not like water at all.

As you might have seen in the changelog, the update is called  **PECUNIA PER KERBULUS** \n\nThe sentence is already included in the latest version and I think it\u0027s pretty easy to find ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\n\u0022Sockels\u0022 are now replaced by the \u0022Fundament\u0022 and It behaves a bit different. The strechable part is now angeled and the closer the Fundament spawns to the ground , the flatter the slope of the Fundament will be. This makes it really easy to walk and/or drive from surface onto the Fundament. The downside is that the texture becomes squeezed with higher Fundaments.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-03T17:00:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2016 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Eleusis La Arwall**\n  \nedited changelog, added pics"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T06:21:37Z","Content":"The original post\u0027s gallary is a bit outdated..."},{"CreatedByName":"Eleusis La Arwall","CreatedById":116286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T16:57:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 02/05/2016 at 8:21 AM, Joshwoo69 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The original post\u0027s gallary is a bit outdated...\n\u003E \n\nYeah you got me there ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) Was a bit lazy and hoped I get away with it but now the gallery in the OP and on Spacedock are up to date."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T23:24:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Eleusis La Arwall said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah you got me there ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) Was a bit lazy and hoped I get away with it but now the gallery in the OP and on Spacedock are up to date.\n\u003E \n\ncool!
