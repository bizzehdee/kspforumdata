Newtonian telescopes can sometimes have trouble reaching focus if the camera is mounted directly to the focuser with the T adapter, but eyepiece projection will work fine with them. Most other types of telescopes are okay to just mount the T mount directly to the focuser with no issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust using a T mount, at least from what I\u0027ve experienced, gives you sharper pictures. There is less glass and things to focus/worry about which seems to make things just work better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEyepiece projection can be touchy. I have a Meade .965 direct projection adapter I hook to my DSLR every once in a while. It seems to only work well with an 18mm eyepiece Anything lower then 10mm or higher then 20mm makes it really hard to focus, and to do that you sometimes have to adjust the eyepiece in the tube which can be a pain in the butt with that little set screw on the side. Its very, very, touchy. Also the pictures from it seem to be not as sharp as you would think they would be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, check this out. Its roughly the same price as the projection tube but you would still need to buy a T mount for you Nikon: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93230-24mm-1-25-Eyepiece/dp/B0007UQNV8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1394872585\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=8-24mm\u002Bzoom\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93230-24mm-1-25-Eyepiece/dp/B0007UQNV8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1394872585\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=8-24mm\u002Bzoom\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a zoom eyepiece that you can zoom in or out by twisting it. It makes finding and zooming in on things very nice and easy since you don\u0027t have to keep swapping out your eyepieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the really neat thing; that rubber cup on the end pops off, and under it is a T mount thread for your camera. This means that you can screw your camera directly onto the eyepiece and then zoom in or out by just twisting the eyepiece to help focus/zoom. I would highly recommend it over a direct projection tube just because its so much easier to use, and as an eyepiece its very nice as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and one last thing, Barlows! I never had any luck using one with the camera, it just made everything way to dark.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-15T08:51:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2014 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by chickenplucker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rjhere","CreatedById":65625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T15:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s a little too late now as I bought the T2 mount with eyepiece projection. Although I regret it now when I see that sweet eyepiece with zoom and everything! Definitaly will buy that later on!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wouldn\u0027t a way to compensate for the light loss with a barlow lense, atleast if you have DSLR camera, is to make the ISO level higher. I know this affects some quality of the picture, but rather sharpness with not so good colors, than a giant mess. As I haven\u0027t gotten any method of mounting my camera to my telescope yet, I have held it loosely up to the telescope, therefore alot of shaking and so on. I turned up the ISO level to 6400 to compensate, thus having to lower the F factor to 1/500 when I took this Jupiter pic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CuhTuwd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CuhTuwd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy telescope is a Sky-watcher 90mm refractor, with a focal length of 910mm.

But yes, since I have a small scope, the colors aren\u0027t quite up to reality, also the camera is at the highest ISO level, which means that colors are dimmed a little I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you really want is lowest possible ISO, and highest possible F-factor. I\u0027m not exactly sure what the ISO does, but the F-factor holds the sensor open longer than if you had a lower F-factor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, Jupiter is more colorfull, but both camera and the scope is in the way of making higher quality pictures.

In film cameras ISO numbers would have been the speed of film you put in the camera. Faster film had more grain but short exposures, and slower film needed longer exposures but had less grain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to the barlow, basically think of it as multiplying your F-stops. I think your scope is normally F/10. Adding the 3x barlow turns it into an F/30, which means you may need to increase the exposure time with the ISO setting to keep up. But there is only one way to find out, just keep playing with settings and see what works for you and what doesn\u0027t.

Although these pictures are of very bright celestial objects, which means exposure times doesn\u0027t need to be that high. I mean the exposure time on some pictures are so small that it doesn\u0027t matter. To us it\u0027s an instant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the reason I have these high ISO levels and short exposures are since I haven\u0027t got a mount for my camera to mount to the telescope, to take these pictures I held my camera up to the telescope, thus shaking alot. When I do get the mount, longer exposures will be in order. Maybe even nebulae pics as I saw someone take a 1 sec exposure with an iPhone through a 8\u0022 telescope. You could clearly see the nebulae, and even some color on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I just have an 90mm scope, I don\u0027t think much more exposure is required to be able to see that there is a nebulae there, but I don\u0027t expect these beautifull colors and such, those are the results of hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours of exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
