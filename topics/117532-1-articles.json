Think of the CoL as a fulcrum, and the CoM as the point mass hanging from it (and the CoT the force you\u0027re applying to the CoM). If the mass is directly underneath the fulcrum, it\u0027ll happily hang there. A thrust \u0027forward\u0027 on that mass from directly behind it will push it forward and rotate it a little around the fulcrum, meaning you\u0027ll nose-up a little. Cut the thrust and it\u0027ll settle back to its normal orientation. Move the fulcrum down and the \u0027turn\u0027 will be less and less pronounced until it vanishes altogether when they\u0027re directly aligned. Move that fulcrum forward, and the mass will drop away and attempt to point the whole craft straight up. That means your craft is quite likely going to stall and you\u0027ll lose control of it. Move the fulcrum backward and the nose will want to drop. No stalling there, you\u0027ll speed up instead, so as long as you can raise the nose enough to lift off the ground, you can overcome that tendency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not rocket science.
