Think of the CoL as a fulcrum, and the CoM as the point mass hanging from it (and the CoT the force you\u0027re applying to the CoM). If the mass is directly underneath the fulcrum, it\u0027ll happily hang there. A thrust \u0027forward\u0027 on that mass from directly behind it will push it forward and rotate it a little around the fulcrum, meaning you\u0027ll nose-up a little. Cut the thrust and it\u0027ll settle back to its normal orientation. Move the fulcrum down and the \u0027turn\u0027 will be less and less pronounced until it vanishes altogether when they\u0027re directly aligned. Move that fulcrum forward, and the mass will drop away and attempt to point the whole craft straight up. That means your craft is quite likely going to stall and you\u0027ll lose control of it. Move the fulcrum backward and the nose will want to drop. No stalling there, you\u0027ll speed up instead, so as long as you can raise the nose enough to lift off the ground, you can overcome that tendency.\n\nIt\u0027s not rocket science.

Problem is you can\u0027t control such a craft without a fly by wire system (and significant control authority). Stock SAS is woefully insufficient as a flight control system for such craft.\n\nControl surfaces use a different AoA from the wing to create torque. You get control authority when that torque overcomes the torque of the CoL (whose strength is based upon the moment of inertia, the lift coefficient and the distance between the centers). In an aerodynamically stable craft (CoL behind CoM), that torque resists deviation from prograde with negative feedback. In a dynamically unstable craft, that force deviates from prograde with positive feedback.\n\nNeed some info to help with repulsors. Are they modeled as a thruster or are they negative mass in operation. Still you want those to do most the lifting, so put control surfaces in the back for stability and forget about it.

An easy way to remember teh CoL and CoM\u0027s relative positions is to think of gliders, which fly slightly nose down and thus tail up. So the pointing-up one (CoL) should sit behind the pointing down one (CoM).\n\nWith the craft you have there though...

You want to maintain a glide slope without control surface use to maximise range. In fact, if you can\u0027t align, you want CoL ahead of CoM so your tail plane is creating upwards force to maintain positive AoA.\n\nAfter I finish reentry, I redistribute fuel so my pitch plane needs no trim to maintain course."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T22:31:40Z","Content":"Thanks for the info and tips. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
