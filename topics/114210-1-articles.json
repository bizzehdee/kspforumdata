Anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking on a plugin aimed at getting KSP to run in a useful fashion over two or more monitors (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126780-WIP-Multi-monitor-screen-space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E). For the most part, this has been progressing spectacularly well (helps that 80\u002B% of it is just the same thing in a different scene...), except for the editor scenes. They are heavily distorted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/laSUNKs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022laSUNKs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever this one originates with how KSP sets up the camera for the double width resolution in the first place. Even without any modifications to the view it still has very noticeable distortion at 3840x1080. This doesn\u0027t happen in any other scene, so I assume there\u0027s a camera setting causing this. I just don\u0027t know what that setting is (it\u0027s not field of view and it\u0027s not aspect ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T08:30:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T06:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo first thing, the camera\u0027s used in 1920 and resized 3840 views are identical in all respects (mass debug.log on every property of all active cameras)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the camera\u0027s are ignoring all the alterations to their view settings that I\u0027ve tried using (most notably, setting the projection matrix directly has had no effect at all) so I\u0027m rather frustratingly out of ideas at this point\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
