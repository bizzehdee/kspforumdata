that.\u00A0 Take a close look at the actual contract.\u00A0 It probably says something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMine 550 units of ore from the

do whatever you want with them (for example, convert them to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E as you mine them, or whatever).\u00A0 As soon as you\u0027ve extracted 550 units-- regardless of what you\u0027ve done with them-- then you\u0027ve completed criterion #1.\u00A0 If you then just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elaunch a new ship at

instant it hits the launchpad.\u00A0 You don\u0027t even have to take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it\u0027s a bit of an exploit, so some might consider it \u0022cheating\u0022 and prefer
