I completed ejection from the Kerbin system, entered solar orbit, made a second burn to adjust my trajectory, and was pleased to see the patched conics report an intercept with Duna. Satisfied, I returned to the Space Center and flew many more missions here and there, occasionally checking on my rover mission in the Tracking Station - still on-course for intercept, days ticking down, with the ship\u0027s situation listed as \u0022escaping the sun,\u0022 even though it was simply on a simple Homann transfer orbit to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, at long last, it was only weeks away from its Duna encounter, so I clicked on the tracking station and switched to the ship, and lo and behold, what do I get?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022a4da2029e3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://puu.sh/oiW0B/a4da2029e3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to \u0022quit\u0022 back to the Space Center did not actually show me the Space Center - it just showed me the starry skybox. Even quitting to menu and re-entering game just showed me the starry skybox instead of the KSP launch complex, even though the time acceleration bar was present at the bottom. I had to quit and restart the game to fix this, and naturally, when I checked back, my flight (which had been in progress for over 200 days) had vanished. The ship was dead and gone, as if it had never existed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the second time this has happened to me - the first time, (in an older version) it was a manned mission, and it auto-killed all the Kerbals aboard, too. I figured this would\u0027ve been fixed by now. I figured wrong. I\u0027d like to know what did this, because it is seriously liquiding me off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only mod I have installed is Kerbal Engineer, version 1.0.18.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalstar","CreatedById":154159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T15:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Hell Kraken\u0022.
