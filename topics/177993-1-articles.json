I know there that science is available there, but, it seems like there is maybe a 1x1 pixel size you need to have your craft touch to be considered at those locations.\u00A0 I built a small rover that could go under the Round Tanks, and it still didn\u0027t trigger that I was at Round Tanks in Science X mod.\u00A0 On the satellites at the Tracking Station, I drove half my rover on the bottom base of the satellite, and it still wouldn\u0027t detect I was at the location.\u00A0 When I managed to do the Pod monument, I pretty much had to ram\u00A0 my rover into the monument, keep on the gas, and hold it there to keep the location as active to collect science data here.....not easy.\u00A0 So, am I missing something?\u00A0 Is there an easier way to grab the science at some of these locations?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 I think I know the answer here, but was just curious......if I launch a scanning satellite and scan Mun for ore, if I start a new game, is the ore going to be in the exact same location?\u00A0 I\u0027m thinking yes that technically, once you scan a moon or planet, you could actually just save off screenshots and use those every time you play, no matter what save you are loading.\u00A0 More of a curiosity question than anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-01T22:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
