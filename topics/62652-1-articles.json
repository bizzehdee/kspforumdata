The project could go one of two ways: roleplay or documentary. A poll is included in this thread where you can cast your opinion on the matter and determine the fate of the project. My opinion? Being as unbiased as possible, I would like to point out the following: roleplay would take twice as long to write, twice as long in construction, and three times as long in screenshot editing. On the other hand, it would be more entertaining and far more interactive than a documentary. Design would also play a larger part.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027century gothic\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe story: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027century gothic\u0027;\u0022\u003EI have a few years of experience with design and media studies, but am yet to put them to any real use.

The effect you have on the mission will still be major (especially in the later stages, but that\u0027s enough for spoilers), but it a very different way to how you would have affected it if we were to go for roleplay. For example: where in roleplay you would be able to change certain aspects as to the way a specific Kerbal acts as a result of his time in space, in documentary you will change where the mission is destined to go and what the point of it all will be. It also means that rather than having to do things like they are in real life (in a logical order), you can instruct me to do things in any order you wish (by this I mean the assembly of the station). It also includes the option of us not having to do crew rotations (or as many, the chances are that I\u0027ll still do at least one... Or more, if you so wish) or even have a crew at all. The purpose of the station could be changed in a more flexible manner - where a refuelling-based space station would have been off the cards in roleplay it\u0027s a very real possibility with documentary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe layout of each episode will also be different. With roleplay, a poll would be found at the end of each episode in which you could decide on what happens next. Because of this, it would have been more linear (though with multiple paths, so not exactly linear, per se) - now that we are not focused around a narrative as such, there are more possibilities and therefore more more opportunities.
