The rockets I build, while I think they are powerful enough to get into orbit, my aopsis(?) ends up being very high, and I have to burn a lot of fuel to get a stable orbit. By this point I usually don\u0027t have fuel to do anything else. Is there any tips you guys could offer me to help me get into orbit more efficently? Like when i am supposed to tilt the rocket to gain speed? Also, is there a mod that lets you plot courses and put vehicles into orbit automatically for you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T20:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch rocket. Once you get to around 10 km, go into the map view. Once your apoapsis gets to about 30km, turn to about 45 degrees. Once it reaches 45, start going even more horizontal. By the time your apoapsis reaches 70 km, you should be completely horizontal. Fire your rocket until reaching an apoapsis of about 80km. Drift the rest of the way until you reach apoapsis, and then circularize your orbit from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, there are mods that will automatically orbit for you, but I reccomend not using them until you can get into orbit manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alacrity","CreatedById":70443,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T20:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe joys of a gravity turn....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all went through this little learnig curve...

Straight up to 10k, then turn to 45 degrees on heading 090 (I\u0027ve also heard that you can turn ten degrees per 10k and get mainly the same effect). Switch to your map occasionally to check your apoapsis; cut your burn when it\u0027s where you want it. You can either then set a maneuver node there for orbital insertion or just burn along the horizon when you get close to it (say fifteen to twenty seconds to apoapsis, depending on how much acceleration your orbital stage can provide).

First, you need to gain vertical speed, so launch straight up as usual. Be sure not to throttle too high as drag/air resistance and terminal velocity can decrease fuel efficiency. Switch between map view and the external view to maintain awareness, but when you reach 10000 meters, or 10 km, you should begin to consider a gravity turn. If you are not accelerating enough i.e. the T/W is not very high, you may have to turn later. Your spacecraft should have some distance to apoapsis before you turn, ideally for me, your apoapsis should be ~ 15-20 km higher than your current altitude. Turn over to 90 degrees at a 15 degrees down ( just tipping over past the first angle mark) and add horizontal velocity. To me, it has been experimental and it is all about the \u0022Feel\u0022, but soon you should turn to 45 degrees, than almost on the horizon before you reach the vacuum. Be sure to reach your desired altitude, but your apoapsis will still rise when burning only horizontal. Depending on how high your T/W is, (Just how quickly it can accelerate to be simple) you may want to start burning to create an orbital trajectory 1 minute or 45 seconds before apoapsis. I hope this was not overly complicated, but good luck! It just takes time to perfect after you get the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T14:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Leonidous\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Leonidous\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, is there a mod that lets you plot courses and put vehicles into orbit automatically for you?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, there is a mod.
