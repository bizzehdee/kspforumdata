I think a popup window with only sliders to adjust the maneuver along the 3 axes, a button to add or remove one orbital period, and delete the node would suffice (and maybe a display for your ejection angle as regex suggested).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m imagining some UI feature that is toggle-able from the options (hopefully with U5, UI work will become \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E easier.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat enabling this feature should do; is overlay a small window with the most pertinent information on it \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E. This window should be translucent until mouseover/clicked in. This window should be anchored just below the maneuver node in the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be designed as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E%DD:HH:MM:SS to Node% %Node Orbit Number Delta% (Reflects the wait an orbit indicator. i.e. \u002B0 for \u0022this orbit\u0022 \u002B1 for \u0022next orbit\u0022 etc.)  (These fields auto-modify each other.)\u003Cbr\u003E%Node Angle to Prograde% (Positioning of the node, same as Ejection angle)\u003Cbr\u003E%Node Prograde dV%\u003Cbr\u003E%Node Radial dV%\u003Cbr\u003E%Node Normal dV%\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll fields \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be editable in my opinion.
