I am not sure If I am doing something, but I can never get the Thermal rockets, or the Thermal Turbo Jets (which function similarly to rockets once you have reached a certain tech point) to use water as a fuel source.

Because sending back science and having to let it run for at minimum of 150 seconds (I believe 10 mits is the smallest experiment and the largest especially with KSP Interstellar can reach well in the thousands) per experiment seems a bit crazy to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted this seems to only be on the extremely long range Dishes like the Comlar 1\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-19T09:48:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2014 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Reign Of Magic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T11:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found a handy comparison of different fuel options for long-term missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Isp (s) Advantages / Disadvantages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrogen NTR 850-900 Excellent Isp, poor storability \u0026amp; density, heavy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethane NTR 650-700 High Isp, fair storability \u0026amp; density, heavy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPentaborane NTR 550-600 High Isp, good storability \u0026amp; density, heavy, neutron absorber?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmmonia NTR 400-450 Medium Isp, good storability \u0026amp; density, heavy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOX-LH2 400-450 Medium Isp, fair storability \u0026amp; density\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther Chemical 300-350 Low Isp, excellent storability \u0026amp; density, light\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid 300 Low Isp, excellent storability \u0026amp; density, simple, little control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(source: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thespacerace.com/forum/index.php?topic=2878.30\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.thespacerace.com/forum/index.php?topic=2878.30\u003C/a\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to me that methane NTR and ammonia NTR are the best options (especially considering an additional advantage - ease of off-world production).

Adding the fuel itself to RF can happen, quite easily, I\u0027ll work with NK to do that. It appears that JetA (not JetA1) has the same density as RP-1 in RF (0.000820), which looking at MilSpec the range is .000799-.000815, while russian rocket kerosene is heavier, so the 0.000820 isn\u0027t a bad figure to average the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where does that leave us...Honestly, I\u0027d just say, name a fuel \u0027JetA\u0027 give it the same 0.000820 density but \u0027ALL_VESSEL\u0027. At least a stop gap until a plugin could be written.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow...as for wings, I\u0027d actually rather see tanks be given in RF than RO, but that\u0027s just me. Stock, and otherwise \u0027fixed\u0027 wings could be hard coded for volume, while procedurals would need some work with that developer (sorry can\u0027t think of name off top of my head), to get volume output out of that plugin, so that RealFuels could read it and make the appropriate adjustments. That\u0027s just geometry for the most part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow AJE. I really can\u0027t tell you how it works...what I am pretty sure of though, is that the name of the fuel doesn\u0027t matter, and likely the density, as it works the same with both LiquidFuel and Kerosene, both having vastly different densities. Of course I could be completely wrong. That said...making a change to AJE so that things run better on one than the other...I don\u0027t think is modeled. For that matter, most specifications for any jet engine is going to be made based on the fuel used/recommended in testing. Everything else is theory, manufacturers don\u0027t post specifications otherwise, besides MAYBE a general statement of increase/decrease thrust by 6.2% and increase consumption by xx%, or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while I understand what you are thinking...besides adding the fuel type (I\u0027ll get that done), and fuel tanks to wings, which for procedural would requires some co-op with another developer, not a problem just statement of fact...your biggest hurdle is going to get camlost to get AJE to support what you are thinking...otherwise it\u0027s all kinda a moot point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T18:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre there any plans (or already available configs) to integrate TweakScale with RO such that we don\u0027t need a million different nosecone parts, etc? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really care about scaling engines, I just want to MAKE stuff instead of wading through part lists (or spend two weekends rolling my own MM config)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T18:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by curiousepic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T18:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022curiousepic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022curiousepic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre there any plans (or already available configs) to integrate TweakScale with RO such that we don\u0027t need a million different nosecone parts, etc? \u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really care about scaling engines, I just want to MAKE stuff instead of wading through part lists (or spend two weekends rolling my own MM config)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy YES!!!

We\u0027ll have to discuss performance alterations, though, figuring that out could be hard. Maybe running just on Jet-A at first would be best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
