It all started from the Astronaut Complex, where next I proceeded to gather science around the flag, then tried to cross the street to the admin building when I bumped into an invisible force in the middle of the street. Trying again I was met with the same outcome. I decided to eva Bob to plant a flag there, and when he stepped off the rover I vaporized Kerbin. Gone. I went back to the space center view only to be greeted with a lovely starry sky in all directions. Going back to the initial game screen there were 3 kerbals in front of- stars with the start menu. I killed Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Luckily shutting down and starting up KSP got me to my last quicksave point.
