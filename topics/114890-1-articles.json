Thank you.**\nWhen playing a game centered around peaceful exploration of the stars and research of other planets, it is only logical to build a large vehicle capable of dealing death to anyone within several miles of it in an instant. That\u0027s why I made this:![nYla8A8.png](http://i.imgur.com/nYla8A8.png)\n\nThe Typhoon Class Missile Submarine! \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[Typhoon Class Submarine](https://sketchfab.com/models/afa9e9fd75004845bda0dc7d39d46e4e) by [KME](https://sketchfab.com/kmw) on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com)\n\nOf course, submarines in Kerbal Space program aren\u0027t really useful or practical, because the oceans were made by dumping several million tons of blueberry flavored instant Jell-O mix into some water. Nevertheless, I made this, and it doesn\u0027t explode very much, so that\u0027s good. \n\nThe submarine features eight guided missiles in their own individual tubes, and a small but detailed interior to give you the feeling that you are really inside a submarine. The sail also has a small observation post on it for your brave crew to get a breath of fresh air after long periods underwater. I\u0027m kidding, this thing can\u0027t dive at all. It\u0027s fun for roleplay though! \n\nHere, have some more pictures of the submarine. These were taken during the sea trials of Typhoon-01 *Blue November*, Captain Malcolm Kerman commanding.![JOkUiOv.png](http://i.imgur.com/JOkUiOv.png)Captain Malcolm Kerman peers out from the observation deck on *Blue November\u0027s* sail. \n\n![zPAqFYk.png](http://i.imgur.com/zPAqFYk.png)First Mate Jeb shows the photography crew the sleeping quarters. The crew will often have to share bunks due to limited space. half the crew sleeps at night while the other half sleeps during the day. Not that they can tell whether it\u0027s day or night while the sub is underwater. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![t0XqQVb.png](http://i.imgur.com/t0XqQVb.png)The main control room seats six crewmembers and the captain. It\u0027s difficult to see in this photo, but Captain Malcolm Kerman is using the periscope to make sure no other ships are around to watch *Blue November* dive.\n\n![YXMcoL8.png](http://i.imgur.com/YXMcoL8.png)This thing is **really** slow. It\u0027s top speed is 6.4 m/s, so don\u0027t expect to get far with this. \n\n![GP0BlMK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GP0BlMK.jpg)Even if you have the patience to wait out the long trips with the sub, you still have to watch it. It loves to tilt from side to side while the engines are running, and one time it capsized while I wasn\u0027t looking.\n\n![IZa9694.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IZa9694.jpg)Alright, here\u0027s the big feature, the missile deck. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n![IGYtCqR.png](http://i.imgur.com/IGYtCqR.png)\u0022Captain, we have been ordered to fire at these coordinates!\u0022\n\n![WBWoiGu.png](http://i.imgur.com/WBWoiGu.png)\u0022Flooding tube No.1\u0022 This has to be done because the game doesn\u0027t allow engines to fire while in a closed cargo bay, it counts them as stowed parts.\n\n![FfERXgp.png](http://i.imgur.com/FfERXgp.png)\u0022Missile ignition!\u0022\n\n![mOsZVYU.png](http://i.imgur.com/mOsZVYU.png)Altitude increasing!\n\n![Ta4v6L6.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ta4v6L6.png)Missile has acquired target coordinates and is proceeding to home in on them.\n\n![JeHXysL.png](http://i.imgur.com/JeHXysL.png)Missile is in final descent phase!\n\n![xGs4RTH.png](http://i.imgur.com/xGs4RTH.png)Warhead is armed...\n\n![sUBOU0b.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sUBOU0b.jpg)Detonation detected!\n\nThe submarine has several places to store crew before launch. A lander can opens up to the interior to allow crew access. To fill the interior, take the Kerbal who spawned in there and place him in the desired seat in the control room via EVA. Then transfer another Kerbal into the lander can and put him in another seat. Repeat this until all Kerbals are inside the control room. The other crew pods are located on top of the sail, in the nose of the sub (escape trunk), and in the tail. It is recommended that the middle seat is filled last, as it has been known to obstruct the hatch when a Kerbal is in it. \n\nI used a KerbinSide launch site to get the sub into the water, but you could possibly use Hyperedit. Hell, you could even do something like this: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E ![tpwh0Cf.png](http://i.imgur.com/tpwh0Cf.png)Be careful if you do this though. \n\nMissiles are set up to fire in groups of two, but I normally fire them one at a time. Remember to open the Mk 2 cargo bay and click Control From Here on the missile\u0027s probe core. For best range, wait for the missile to clear 2,000 meters before turning it towards the target. \n\n That\u0027s all you need to know about the Typhoon!

Well Now you can have them! Kerdinand has kindly created a BD Armory variant of the Typhoon, which is available here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114591-Kerbal-Military-Engineering-BD-Armory?p=2059185#post2059185](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114591-Kerbal-Military-Engineering-BD-Armory?p=2059185#post2059185) (Kerdinand also made the Sketchfab model at the top of this post)\n\nI\u0027d love some feedback on this craft, and make sure to leave some rep if you enjoyed! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T15:39:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs**"},{"CreatedByName":"mackadelik","CreatedById":143364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T21:28:34Z","Content":"This is awesome!
