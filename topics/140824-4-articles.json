Because\u00A0if there was even the slightest chance you read this Felipe I want you to know something.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI only realized this just recently. But your story, your passion and the succes of Kerbal Space Program have convinced me to persue a career in games aswell. You have showed me that by being passionate, working hard, being brave and dare to jump into the deep end,\u00A0that you can make your dreams come true.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI remember the first time I played KSP, I was at a lan party and a friend of mine showed me this game where he was launching rockets. I thought to myself \u0022oh well that looks cool\u0022. But then he showed me that he actually built all the craft he launched himself, he showed me how he put them together, how you have to take into account the weight, the thrust of each engine at diffrent alttitudes and all this cool engineering stuff. Then I thought \u0022This is brilliant! Why hasn\u0027t anyone ever thought of this before!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI immediatly recognized the potential of the game, especially when I discovered the amazing community and all the awesome modding people where doing. That was version 0.13 of the game (April of 2011 if I remember correctly). But even I woulnd\u0027t\u00A0have dared to\u00A0dream that\u00A0KSP could become what it is today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOfcourse I didn\u0027t hesitate to buy the game, and I got envolved in the community, watching the livestreams, posting threads and suggesting new things to developers and modders alike. It is the very definition of what makes games great in my opinion. And the story of you and Squad is one for the history books. It made me realize that it is what I want to do aswell, I want to create my own succes story and have such an amazing community backing my game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, besides making one heck of an amazing game, I want to thank you for inspiring me, and many others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is a testomony to how far this game has come, and its all because of you sir.

They way it\u0027s so modifiable, and how genuine the space travel felt, makes it a great stepping stone up to greater things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo other games has felt quite like KSP. That sense to adventure you get jumping down from a lander after touchdown, or watching Kerbinrise from the flats of Minmus, or driving around a space based you designed and built yourself. KSP is awesome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oHwqpPk.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oHwqpPk.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s supposed\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003Eto be a\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E21 mainsail salute\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Salutes*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P4UtCnV.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P4UtCnV.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee you later, \u00A0HarvesteR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-31T17:28:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2016 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T19:15:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for creating the greatest game in the multiverse, and I wish you the best of luck to whatever you do \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T19:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow, didn\u0027t expect that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, thank you soo much felipe! Thanks to this game, your game, I got super interested in spaceflight. I started to read through long wikipedia entries about spaceflight, orbital mechanics, physics. I started to learn how to use Blender, started to get into programming, to make my own content. I took an astrophysics class at school, and it was a great decision, I learned much more about physics than I\u0027d have thought of, and now even my regular physics mark is very good, while it was always \u0022ok\u0022, let\u0027s say before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I have to think of what I will do in the future, and guess what: I will study engineering once I passed my final exams, and then will try to get a job at the European Space Agency here in Germany. You pretty much changed my life, I would say. And I have to thank you so much for this and all of your work you and the team of course too put into this. And all because of this game, in which you try not to crash little green minions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
