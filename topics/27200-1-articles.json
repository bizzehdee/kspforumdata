Because of the way the rocket equation works, in order to increase the amount of delta-v (potential change in velocity) from having more fuel by the same measure as you could from having a more efficient engine, you\u0027d need to add \u003Cem\u003Etons\u003C/em\u003E of fuel... which translates into a heavier payload for your rocket to lift into orbit... which in turn means even \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E fuel in your ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of ascent stages, you really want to get rid of the vast majority of the fuel on your rocket (and the fuel tanks used to carry them) in that first climb up to Low Kerbin Orbit.

There\u0027s a wealth of information available on these subjects in the Drawing Board, which is stickied to the top of this particular forum (or you could just use the link in my signature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, Moho is an absolute bear of a target to get to. I\u0027m actually in the middle of sending a tanker out to a pair of kerbalnauts I\u0027ve got in orbit there, and it\u0027s even crazier trying to build a craft that can make orbit there \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E still have plenty of fuel to transfer to my first craft than it was to get them out there in the first place! Ah well, even us people who know what we\u0027re doing have our off days...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
