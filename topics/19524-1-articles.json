Start to fly over your targeted landing site. Kill all of your velocity -- look at the --\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;-- indicators. Get that to 0 when you are exactly above your landing site. Now slowly throttle your engine up and down to kill velocity and come in for a nice smooth, soft landing, just like a helicopter.

That is why so darn many Mun missions end with a post saying \u0022Made it to Mun, but...\u0022 and the pics inside the post show a lander lying on its side!

I won\u0027t lie...I had a little difficulty at first landing on the mun but now I tend to touch down safely every time. I don\u0027t use RCS at all, but an engine descent. My first lander was 1 man pod, 1 fuel tank, 1 engine, and 3 legs and it landed every time and I always made it back. My currently lander has 3 other legs in addition to the main and dual fuel tanks and I have enough fuel to land on minmus, transfer to the mun, land, and get back to a parachute landing on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy landings always stick to 2 dimensions.
