Last time I played KSPi was with KSP 0.23.5 and KSPi 0.11. I\u0027ve seen some issues with TreeLoader in 0.25 and was unaware of them when I started my new Career game. Mostly, anytime I unlock a new science node, I have to exit the R\u0026amp;D screen and reload it to see the unlocked node (and anything it reveals). At this point, I\u0027m not even certain the Interstellar tree is actually being used. However, I\u0027m getting close to where it used to diverge (usually Fusion for me) and I want to ensure I gain access to the parts and upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found an MM patch back in this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-%28Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp%29-Version-0-13?p=1472425\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1472425\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epost\u003C/a\u003E that moves the parts back to stock tech nodes. Is this still the most up to date method for dealing with the removal of TreeLoader, and has Fractal_UK altered any relevant plugins or configs needed to ensure that part upgrades are no longer dependent upon the custom nodes? Is there now a better way of dealing with the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Of course, an answer was found 2 pages back...somehow I missed it before posting this.

I love this mod, but I\u0027m having a lot of trouble with the fusion reactors too. The problem seems to be that I cannot control how many percent they operate on - when my ship has filled up with MJ, they default to 10% - fine - but when not, I have reactors who refuse to operate on 100%, even when I need them to. After several hours of trial and error on 3.75m Fusion Reactors, I found that \u003Cp\u003E1. they seem to default to some low setting whenever a small electric generator is present anywhere on the ship (say, attached to a small nuclear reactor) and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. once they are set to operate on a less-than 100% setting, they remember this, even if I revert and remove the little generator and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I cannot control what mode the generators I place at both ends will operate in - they sometimes understand to go for one each, but in general seem to prefer charged particles, with little method to give me a clue when that will happen. When both are in that mode, the thermal power is unused and fills up. I\u0027ve included plenty of \u0022Large Flat Radiators\u0022, and have little waste heat (not that a couple of thousand degrees should matter so much when the core is 15 000 K anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, I haven\u0027t found any way of manually forcing it to 100%. The \u0022Control Window\u0022 only gives me the option to turn it off, so that\u0027s not any more useful than the standard right-click-on-part window.

The only time they will operate at 100% is when the power demand requires it. You will see this happen when you have a transceiver set to transmit or when you have electric engines at maximum power (and haven\u0027t reached their caps). Otherwise it throttles them back to only use what is needed.
