However I\u0027ve begun playing with alot of mods in particular interstellar extended, kerbal atomics and the cryogenic engines. These mods introduce hydrogen fuel which is way less dense and supposedly has a much higher isp on nuclear rockets.

But I doubt that you would get as strongly worse performance as your wording seems to suggest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven a known value for Isp, your final \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E depends only on one variable: your mass fraction, AKA the ratio of wet mass to dry mass. If you provide 10 tons of propellant A and 10 tons of propellant B, with the only difference between the two setups being that the two propellants come in different tanks, then the only way you can still get different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E numbers is if the tanks have different mass fractions. If the tankage of propellant A weighs 100 kg for every ton of propellant load, and the tankage of propellant B weighs 500 kg for every ton of propellant load, then the spacecraft using propellant B will be 4 tons heavier. This extra dry mass will reduce both the available \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and the effective engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I\u0027m doubting that your results could be as bad as you describe is because you stated \u0022any engine running on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 is better than any nuclear thermal rocket. You suggest that an engine with three times the Isp has worse \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E output, just because of tank dry mass differences? That would have to be a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E difference. Are you sure you\u0027re using the correct tank configuration for the NTRs? As in, hydrogen only, not hydrogen \u002B oxidizer? While one of the Kerbal Atomics engines is a LANTR that can optionally use oxidizer, the standard operation mode for all the NTRs is hydrogen-only. Like how in stock it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E-only, and people regularly post in Gameplay Questions about how they only get terrible Isp and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, because they use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks.

And I was looking at several of the nuclear engines including the nerv, LANTRN and lightbulb.\u00A0I was careful to check that the tanks where set to just h2 and not LHO. and I was building dummy rockets with just a mk1 capsule and a whole buttload of fuel. Basically I was following along with this you tube video.

Starting with liquid hydrogen and oxygen,\u00A0the square cube rule says, essentially if you go for a small\u00A0system\u00A0hydrocarbon fuel is cheaper than hydrogen to work with, and that\u0027s mostly to do with tank costs (the structure is more expensive than fuel). Going to a modern heavy-lifter the sizing gets to the point you\u0027re either spending on mass to support the dense kerosene, or on insulation for otherwise less dense\u00A0hydrogen, and not only is the insulation\u00A0lighter, but the\u00A0volume-to-surface-area is higher due to the square cube rule. Additionally, the insulation needs will drop as the area through\u00A0which heat\u00A0gets, per unit volume in is smaller (so the tank stays cold for longer).\u00A0This means that the cost of the tank for the hydrocarbon fuel, including insulation, will eventually outstrip the cost for the liquid hydrogen tank and the cost of hydrogen doesn\u0027t make a difference because the tank is about a hundred times the price of the fuel it holds, unless you\u0027re sitting just on the margin. The emphasis is big tanks.\u00A0Think SLS and Energia\u00A0scale, or bigger.
