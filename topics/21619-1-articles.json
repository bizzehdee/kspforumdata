Launch and go straight up until you hit about 25,000 meters, then turn your ship 45 degrees (half way to the horizion) towards 90 on the compass. Keep thrusting till you hit 45KM (45,000 meters) and then turn your ship completely at the horizon (where the blue/brown meet) at 90 on the compass. Keep burning till your apoapsis is about 150-200KM. **A lot of the older videos/people suggest using a 100KM parking orbit but it\u0027s so close to the atmosphere and time accel is really lame below 120KM...**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your AP is above 150KM shut down your engines and time accel till you are about 50 or so seconds away from your AP (you may need more time if your ship is really clunky.) With your ship pointed at the horizon, fire full blast about 10-15 sec before AP. You should see the PE begin to rise from the opposite side of the planet. Hover your finger over the X button ready to press it when you see the PE begin to move circually around your orbit. You want to hit X as the AP and PE are both 90 degrees away from you in your orbit. This happens as your ship accelerates and your current location becomes the lower side of your orbit, due to you exceeding the speed required to maintain a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis technique may leave you off by a few KM on either side of the orbit, don\u0027t worry about that for now, it\u0027s circular enough to burn for the mun. Now in the map view, use the camera angle to keep the mun exactly on the 90 degrees right side of your monitor. You will have to actively move the camera with time warp to keep the mun there. Warp until your ships place in it\u0027s orbit places it towards the bottom most part of your screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is the time to light up your engines, as you see the AP rise towards munar orbit, throttle back, you will notice that the further out it gets, the quicker it climbs. You don\u0027t want to overshoot. Tap \u0022x\u0022 when you see your munar encounter and then dial in the thrust (or retro thrust) to brink the PE of the mun encounter to where you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there on out, you\u0027re on your own.
