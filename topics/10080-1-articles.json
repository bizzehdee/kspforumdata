It literally is bare. No parachute, no landing legs. A propulsive landing is necessary to land back on kerbin without killing the crew. It uses landing legs for stage separation. When the stage 0 tanks run out of fuel, cut the engines, spin the whole craft around to generate centrifugal forces, and when you think it\\\u0027s enough, press G to deploy the legs, and they will push the tanks away from the middle tank. Thanks to sjwt for pioneering seperation using landing legs and also thanks to r4m0n for further developing super light weight mun rockets over at [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9729.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9729.0)\n\n The decoupling will spin the rocket a little off course, you just have to re-align and continue your burn to orbit. I believe a return trip may still be possible with a parachute, using an efficient direct descent approach, according to my delta-v calculations. However, the thrust to weight at liftoff is already below optimal, and adding the extra little bit of weight would make it worse and you\\\u0027d lose more delta-v to gravity drag. Without parachute it has 8177m/s delta-v, with parachute 7291m/s. I like to compare my munar craft to Kosmo-not\\\u0027s Koalemos II, which has about 7429 delta-v, since I mostly follow the method described in his tutorial.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that upon returning to kerbin, my engine and tank blew up, which is why they\\\u0027re not there. They absorbed some of the impact."},{"CreatedByName":"r4m0n","CreatedById":5404,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T23:07:36Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve tried a version of this with a parachute before, but it didn\\\u0027t do too well...

It looked as if it was going to take more than just the side tanks with it, but it turned out alright. It probably really helped me that I applied some knowledge I learned recently for the Mun landing trajectory. This was the first time I successfully landed on just an engine. The rest of the mission went just fine. Do I get some kind of rental rebate for landing the thing back on Kerbin without it exploding?\n\nBTW, this it the first time I\\\u0027ve done it on 3 tanks of fuel.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nFor some weird reason, I was wondering if NASA would let me fly a rocket to the moon and back by myself.

As I said, it does have plenty of delta-v, 8177. Which is like 700 more delta-v than the koalemos II. And I find the engine very suitable for landing on. By the time you reach the mun, you don\\\u0027t have much fuel mass left, and so it can actually take quite a beating. I\\\u0027ve even had succsesful mun landings with landing velocities in the region of 4 m/s. I believe the fact that it\\\u0027s a gimballing engine might help a little, too. The nozzle kinda acts as a shock absorber methinks, and it makes for a wonderful launch platform. I\\\u0027ve always been too nervous landing back on kerbin. Gravity is so much stronger there, so I fear about hovering for too long. I need more practice.
