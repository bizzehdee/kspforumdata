Now I\u0027m using it a lot! Sometimes even off the default sizes, when I need a mid-term engine/fuel tank, or the model of a high-end antenna with the specs and size of a basic one, or a very big and powerful c\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Communotron_16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eommunotron\u003C/a\u003E.

At first I\u0027m thinking \u0022meh, just a new resource with no use for my mission, fuel is more important\u0022. Then I ended up curiously installed it, and I realized, the further I\u0027m going into the game, the wilder and insane my imagination become, and the bigger my craft turns out.
