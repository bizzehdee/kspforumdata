Plus, it\u0027s not as though they are necessarily paying everyone United States-level middle class nuclear family salaries, even with their significant earnings - most companies earn far more than enough to pay their employees more than they do. You say 6 million dollars, but if we go by the cheapest Steam prices of around 20$ as you say, as our \u0022average\u0022, then 500,000 sales equates to $10,000,000 USD, which leaves four million dollars in surplus even if every employee were paid 100K yearly.\u003Cp\u003EThe surplus goes up tremendously if the figure for sales increases. There is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55532-How-Many-Sales-Has-KSP-Made\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea thread\u003C/a\u003E which references a SteamSpy account of Steam ownership numbers (the data is now censored at the behest of SQUAD), and the amount corroborated there is in the range of 1 million sales, which likely doesn\u0027t include private profiles, and of course doesn\u0027t include the KSP store, so the number is probably even higher. And an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-04-10-community-is-a-double-edged-sword\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einterview with Calisker\u003C/a\u003E from last year gives a figure close to 3 million sales if you count their assertion that the forums represent 5% of the total playerbase, given our current 140-ish thousand strong member count. That\u0027s tens of millions of dollars. 50 million dollars would be enough to buy minor mansions for each permanent team member.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fine if people make mints, but SQUAD is a company that existed before KSP began. Most of these people are likely being paid salaries of some sort, not just getting a certain cut of the profits. Most entry level software engineers make significantly less than 100K/year, and positions other than software engineer - 3D artists, sound designers, IT people, etc - can make significantly less.

Career Mode has languished for a year while waiting for, among other things perhaps, an aerodynamics overhaul, which in turn was waiting for new spaceplane parts. They could have had new spaceplane parts while they had B9 on the team, but he mysteriously disappeared from the roster with not a word (although I\u0027m absolutely not implying that we should pressure B9 to spill the beans). It\u0027s been over two years since the first release of FAR. And multiple modded career balances have sprung up in the year that Career has been out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD has had the money, the resources, the time, and the people - both on their team and available, even bursting from the seams of the community with enthusiasm to develop for KSP. That they have not used their fairly staggering quantities of cash to hand over some of the so-terrible responsibilities of development to some of the lovely, proven skills among the mod crew, and have let go of most of the hires they have made without taking on much in the way of significant gameplay contribution, makes this whole business about contracting a port of KSP to an entirely new platform to a shady, unproven company seem very dubious to me at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, hey, what can I say. I\u0027m still waiting for that space program tycoon game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI respect your position and I agree on some of your points. But at the end of the day this is a completed game. It has 2 goal oriented game modes and a sandbox. Full mod support. Unique gameplay features not found in any other game. And most of us that have been around got it for around the same price as a large coffee or a pack of smokes. So while I understand your position about SQUAD not hiring more people (ECHO that in fact), I don\u0027t think its fair to say your still waiting for a space tycoon game. It\u0027s right here. It might not be exactly as it was envisioned in the beginning, but it is one of the greatest games of our time none the less (IMO). I personally have played more then 1500 hours. And many of the bugs that we are so critical of as experienced long term players, new players won\u0027t even notice. I am 100% satisfied with the product I have. I will continue to ask for further development and be critical of the dev process, but we really are not owed anything at this point. and I feel like everyone bashing SQUAD for this decision is really unfair to them. This is a great accomplishment for SQUAD. Partnership with SONY could be a huge thing for them. Remember, SQUAD is a subsidiary of a MARKETING COMPANY. They are not a games development studio first and foremost. I feel like I have a lot more to say about the topic but I\u0027m just gonna put this thread down. Its really getting on my nerves.
