Class System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current class system boils down to only engineers being worth retaining on the payroll. Pilots become utterly redundant once you get your 1st probe core with SAS. Scientists become redundant once you finish the tech tree, and aren\u0027t very useful even before then due to the sheer difficulty in leveling up all Kerbals significantly (see below). Engineers, OTOH, always have practical, indespensible functions that improve with experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Experience and Training\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals unrealsitically learn not through book study or practical application, but only through achievements requring going to new places. And then the KXP only takes effect upon their return to KSC, which is illogical because they can\u0027t be trained at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Recruitment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player has no control over the applicant pool. Despite only needing engineers, he keeps getting spammed with useless pilots and scientists. Further, he has to pay an ever-increasing amount to hire these candidates despite them having zero skills and the player being unable to invest any training on them on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPROPOSED SOLUTIONS:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Scrap the current class system and replace it with something more flexible and useful as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal applicants are essentially tourists with neither class nor skills. They have a random but low-weighted bravery score and a random by high-weighted stupidity score.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe player can choose hiring strategies (and pay cash/rep/science to do so) that will improve either the bravery or stupidity of applicants.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe player can dismiss applicants he doens\u0027t like without penalty, same as declining contracts without accepting them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHiring Kerbals costs a small fee that doesn\u0027t increase. This initial cost covers basic flight training so that every single Kerbal can use SAS. Otherwise, all the pilot skills are removed from the game for lack of practical value and general bugginess.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbals do not have named classes---all are just \u0022astronauts\u0022 or \u0022kerbalnauts\u0022. Instead of classes, each time a Kerbal earns sufficient KXP, the player can choose any skill from the lists for engineers and scientists in any order desired. IOW, the 1st skill a Kerbal might learn could be fixing flat tires, while another could learn how to reset experiments, process data in a lab, or buff general science value.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESome skills can by tied to the tech tree. For instance, you can\u0027t fix wheels until you\u0027ve unlocked rover wheels, can\u0027t learn to process data until you unlock the mobile lab, can\u0027t learn to improve ore drilling until you\u0027ve got the drills, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

The player would pick a skill for the Kerbal to study and at the end of some period of time based on stupidity (during which the Kerbal would be unavailable for missions), the Kerbal emerges with the desired skill and enough new KXP to have earned it. This costs money based on the time it takes, based on the amount of KXP required as modified by the Kerbal\u0027s stupidity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemove the limitation that KXP only takes effect upon return to KSC. Most of spaceflight is sitting on your butt for days/months/years waiting for the next burn, during which time the Kerbals can be hitting the books (or being force-fed information \u003Cem\u003EClockwork Orange\u003C/em\u003E-style \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). IOW, KXP takes effect at the moment it\u0027s earned, allowing Kerbals to level up during missions when they\u0027re presumably actually doing their learning.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAllow multiple awards of KXP for doing the same thing (say landing on Mun) over again.
