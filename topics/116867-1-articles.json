In this case, it\u0027s reporting the results for a point at the top edge of the map. You\u0027ll note that the \u0022Map Center\u0022\u0027s coordinate is indeed the same as the digital readouts, once you do the west-to-east conversion."},{"CreatedByName":"brusura","CreatedById":57899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:13:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To answer this question, it\u0027s because you can (and have) mouse over the GUI map to get the resources for points nearby.

An informal bug report can be made by posting on the \u0022Technical support (unmodded)\u0022 or \u0022Technical Support (modded)\u0022 forums. To create a formal bug report, you need to create an account in the bugtracker: [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/)\n\n(Pick a bugtracker username \u0026 password, get a confirmation email with an activation, then go into the bugtracker and select \u0022New Issue\u0022. You should do a search of the bugtracker first, to make sure the issue has not already been reported, but I already just did that for you -- as far as I can tell, it hasn\u0027t. -- Once you click the New Issue button, you make a written description of the bug, and add some files. *You must make a savegame at the point where you can see an error.* At the very least, you need to upload the screenshot, and the savegame. The devs also like to have a KSP.log, and the output\\_log.txt file from your game.)\n\nIf you try the informal version of just posting in the Technical Support forums, there is a fair chance that the report will never be seen.

The rounding is a small issue, but more important is the incorrect sign/direction.  If the longitudes are to be given as either E or W, then the number should always be positive, i.e. \u002B76.700W.  This is because the cardinal direction tells us which way we\u0027re going.  Saying -76.700W is a double negative that really means \u002B76.700E.  If we are going to use \u002B/- signs, then the directions should always be given as E.  In this particular example, we should use either 76.700W or -76.700E, but never -76.700W.  We know the longitude is west because the \u0022Edit Waypoint\u0022 display is showing it as 283.300457301298 (0-180 is east, and 180-360 is west)."}]}
