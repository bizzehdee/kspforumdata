It used to be that you had reaction wheels (SAS) and heading hold (ASAS) as separate parts. So if you wanted to have control, you needed to add an ASAS, otherwise it was manual flying (read: spin stabilization). The ASAS was pretty heavy, 800 kg, so you\u0027d typically have it on launchers and maybe landers, but not on the ascent stage, for both dV reasons and size. ASAS functionality was added to the pods in .21 when the SAS was rewritten, so not even that long ago.

It was nearly impossible to fly planes prior to 0.21 (by keyboard) and so i never bothered. Once ASAS heading hold was introduced it opened a whole new section of the game for me. Heading hold is a must for flying by keyboard, i reckon most players who made aircraft prior to 0.21 used joysticks.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It used to be that you constantly had to unlock and relock asas (t) to change direction, very frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre- 0.21:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESAS were ONLY reaction wheels\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EASAS were ONLY heading hold computers\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVessels needed ASAS to have heading hold, but did not need more than one ASAS part\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EASAS was a \u0022hard-hold\u0022: it would not allow any manual control inputs, requiring unlocking and locking\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe ASAS would waste RCS like crazy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe ASAS would maintain exactly the heading you wanted, but would oscillate pretty badly on some craft trying to do so\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost- 0.21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EASAS functionality was added to all command pods and probe cores\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EASAS parts changed to act as SAS (torque wheels)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EASAS logic vastly improved by:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAllowing a player to control one axis while holding the others steady, a \u0022soft-hold\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBeing much less likely to \u0022hunt\u0022 for the correct direction, no longer wasting RCS like crazy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like post- 0.90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAll probe cores will provide post-0.21 ASAS functionality.
