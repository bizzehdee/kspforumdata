There does seem to be a growing concern I have about NASA\u0027s current mission architecture. Mainly asking the question- what happens if there\u0027s a fault, a failure or a straight up loss of the spacecraft? How will this affect NASA\u0027s timeline? Can NASA continue without PPE or the Gateway? If so, would the plan to just commit to the first true instance of LOR and just have the lander launched to lunar orbit and Orion dock to it while it\u0027s freely orbiting? Or would the timeline be delayed to compensate for repairing/replacing Gateway?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just got to thinking since that despite the PPE being based on vary well known technologies and concepts and not pushing the envelope very far, there\u0027s still a lot riding on the deployment mission and any fault could end up damaging the program as a whole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jadebenn","CreatedById":41164,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-24T06:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe honest answer is that if there\u0027s a LOV event, the 2024 timeline goes out the window. There\u0027s no redundancy built into the aggressive timeline; anything going kaput delays the landing. I guess there might be a way to jerry-rig an approach depending on the failure mode (i.e. if the PPE just stops accepting signals instead of literally blowing up), but NASA\u0027s already cutting it close as-is. It\u0027s likely any major issues would push a manned landing\u00A0out to 2025\u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t answer any specific questions about the PPE itself, but from what I\u0027ve read it seems pretty integral to the functioning of the Gateway. Again, depends on the specific failure. Loss of PPE on launch means large, unavoidable delay. Loss of PPE in transit means large, unavoidable delay. Loss of PPE in lunar orbit means large, possibly salvageable delay (assuming it doesn\u0027t explode and\u00A0there\u0027s a way to get it working again before it\u0027s flung out of NRHO into cis-lunar space). Basically, the PPE is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every much\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on the critical path to a 2024 Moon landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, I\u0027d imagine this is why NASA chose Maxar for the PPE.

In November 2018, within one year of announcing an up to 19-month delay for the three programs\u2014the Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle, the Orion spacecraft, and supporting ground systems\u2014NASA senior leaders acknowledged the revised date of June 2020 is unlikely. Any issues uncovered during planned integration and testing may push the launch date as late as June 2021. Moreover, while NASA acknowledges about $1 billion in cost growth for the SLS program, it is understated. This is because NASA shifted some planned SLS scope to future missions but did not reduce the program\u0027s cost baseline accordingly. When GAO reduced the baseline to account for the reduced scope, the cost growth is about $1.8 billion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull report:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/699823.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.gao.gov/assets/700/699823.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed177995857\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/USGAO/status/1141323501711876096\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-19T13:50:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2019 01:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jadebenn","CreatedById":41164,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T22:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GAO report is the worst-case scenario, but I can hardly blame them for assuming such.

As you said, production is going by lightning fast by my observation. They\u0027re nearly done with the core, and the engine section is the big delay now. After which is 2 tests (AA and the Stennis test burn) and then shipping back to the cape. At which point all that remains is assembly. Which is going to be rather quick since everything is already built and awaiting their debut. The Stennis test could reveal issues but I\u0027m not too concerned since they\u0027ve already tested every facet of the vehicle to the point of mind numbing nausea. That said- I\u0027m disappointed that they won\u0027t include the SRBs in the test since I\u0027m most interested in how the RS-25 engines will respond to the boosters being much closer to the RS-25 engines. With the Space Shuttle, they had a dozen or so meters between them and the boosters. Now they are next to each other. The addition of an additional engine doesn\u0027t concern me as much as that. Since the SRBs generate a lot more heat and noise than the RS-25s do. That noise could cause shaking that could affect the performance or stability of the RS-25.

Because they can spend that income on technologies to benefit other aspects of the economy. Boeing can spend that money on advancing the RnD of the 797 (or the 737-800 right now), or put that money into RnD and develop a more fuel efficient engine for their aircraft, which can cut cost for airlines, which can cut costs for business travelers and vacation travelers.
