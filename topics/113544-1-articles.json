I think it was a big mistake to just add only full shuttle bays for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather see official loose hinges and powered ones, so that I can build my own hinges from scratch, so I can make build my own bays from scratch to make my ships more unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd those hinges could be used for so much else that they were never intended for in the first place, while that is sadly impossible when you get only fully premade bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAgree.\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried mixing Station Science and Infernal robotics? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking ports now need a large scale logistics problem to solve to make them more interesting. Station science provides this through multi part heavy sections that must be docked together in orbit. The logistics support also provides the only real excuse for Space Shuttle development. Add in some hinges from Infernal robotic and you have a new direction to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T22:40:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T22:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConfirming that EVE is dying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T22:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDont worry, soon enough we will have thousands of new PS4 members flooding in with new ideas and stuff.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis scares me deeply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nobodyhasthis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nobodyhasthis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEven Scott Manley has been showing off the classic Homeworld game recently.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s way behind schedule with that.
