Once you have visited most planet/moons, built bases, stations and so on you will lose that feeling of achievement that you once had and then there really is not that much left to do.

But one fairly predictable thing I\u0027ve noticed on KerbalX is that the weekends are always quieter followed by an above average spike on Monday. My explanation for this is that folk are actually playing the game hard over the weekend, or doing family stuff (possibly even going outside!). Then on Monday they get to work, realize it\u0027s Monday and they\u0027d far rather being playing KSP but they can\u0027t hide doing that at work so they go check on forum and see what new craft are up on KerbalX. Also seem to get higher numbers of new craft posted on Mondays, which I think are the fruits of a hard weekend\u0027s rocket building. \n\nI think we always expected that there would be a massive surge as 1.0 came out, followed by a lull. A lot of casual players will probably have picked it up and are now moving on to something else (lightweights ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ).

Station science provides this through multi part heavy sections that must be docked together in orbit. The logistics support also provides the only real excuse for Space Shuttle development. Add in some hinges from Infernal robotic and you have a new direction to the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T22:40:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T22:44:10Z","Content":"Confirming that EVE is dying."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T22:48:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Dont worry, soon enough we will have thousands of new PS4 members flooding in with new ideas and stuff.\n\nThis scares me deeply.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Even Scott Manley has been showing off the classic Homeworld game recently.\n\nHe\u0027s way behind schedule with that.
