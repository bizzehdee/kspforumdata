The rules don\u0027t say anything about having to lug all of the fuel along the entire time. You could totally design a modular lander that lightens its fuel load for the smaller moons, then loads up on extra tanks to take on Tylo and Laythe. If you made Laythe the last spot you visit (or at least visit it after you go to Tylo), you could have it could dispose of a few of its sub-tanks permanently on the way back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T01:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis lander should be capable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://moc-per.micromine.com/owncloud/public.php?service=files\u0026amp;t=bacb814629734252523bdaa200136321\u0026amp;download\u0022 alt=\u0022public.php?service=files\u0026amp;t=bacb814629734252523bdaa200136321\u0026amp;download\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://moc-per.micromine.com/owncloud/public.php?service=files\u0026amp;t=2d16f6df2ab7752decedc61d25eda818\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://moc-per.micromine.com/owncloud/public.php?service=files\u0026amp;t=2d16f6df2ab7752decedc61d25eda818\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T03:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTO supercarrier coming soon, hopefully complete with a docked compact spaceplane or several each capable of landing on Tylo and returning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T03:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn one launch?
