Hyperedit may be used to put your ship into this 80\u002B km orbit around Kerbin. Alternatively, you can use any lifter you choose to get your plane into space, or even use Alt-F12 to cheat your plane up there with no gravity and free fuel (Just turn gravity back on before starting!). Any lifter you DO use doesn\u0027t count towards your parts, only the number of parts on the plane that enters the atmosphere counts.

The OLD Rule #6 is below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) You may not decouple, undock, or disconnect any pieces once you\u0027ve left the 80-90km orbit. The plane in orbit must be the plane that descends and lands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added a new Rule as #9, and moved the old #9 to #10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rewrote rule #3 to remove the 90km upper limit. Upper limits on the orbit only make this easier. If you want to start from a 100x100km orbit, go for it! The OLD Rule #3 is below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The plane must start in an at least an 80km (periapsis) and at most 90km (apoapsis) orbit around Kerbin. Hyperedit may be used to put your ship into this 80-90km orbit around Kerbin.
