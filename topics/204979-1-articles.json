He\u0027s a very popular (well, relatively speaking) sci-fi author with an awesome catalogue of novels that I\u0027d highly recommend.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo of these books in particular interest me because of their suitability to KSP. The first is Voyage, which he wrote in 1996. In the novel, Richard Nixon\u0027s speech on the moon is wildly different, leading NASA to adopt the Apollo Applications Program and attempt a crewed landing on Mars in the 1980s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout giving too much of the novel away, I think that it is certainly possible to recreate the fictional Ares mission to Mars - indeed, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143617-winged/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022143617\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143617-winged/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@winged\u003C/a\u003E(hopefully that\u0027s the right person) made a fantastic cinematic recreating the mission in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP0, no less. Given that the novel\u0027s storyline relies on Saturn-era hardware and easily constructed mission concepts from that era, which are markedly easier to use and build in KSP, I\u0027d say this is the easier mission of the two.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings us to Titan, my personal favourite of Baxter\u0027s novels. Definitely more pessimistic in tone, Titan takes place in the late 2000s to mid-2010s, which was roughly 10-15 years in the future when the book was published. Facing increased militarization of space, the winding down of NASA operations and the destruction of humanity\u0027s exploratory spirit, a desperate attempt is made to retrofit Shuttle-era hardware into a manned mission to Saturn\u0027s moon Titan. This book is definitely lesser known than Voyage, which is a shame as I really enjoyed this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI think the Shuttle era hardware, especially the unscrewed Shuttle-Can concepts, make for interesting builds, and of course we can substitute Laythe or even OPM\u0027s Tekto for Titan. I have never seen this mission recreated in KSP, and personally I\u0027m really keen to try it and make a cinematic out of the whole thing. The only issues are a few difficult situations to set up with KSP\u0027s limitations and of course, the Earth-Venus-Earth-Jupiter-Saturn (I think that was the gravity assist route) would be difficult to make (assuming Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Kerbin-Jool) , as I am very inexperienced with gravity assists. Not to mention I\u0027ve never made a KSP cinematic before...\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnyway, if anyone is interested in recreating the mission(s) mentioned here, look up Voyage and/or Titan, even read them through fully if you can, and let me know what you think! I\u0027m curious to see if anyone else has any thoughts on this or has tried to replicate the missions themselves. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T14:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll have to give these books a read... thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T15:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAyyyy, Baxter gang!\u00A0 I read the Voyage trilogy a while ago; Titan was by far my favorite.\u00A0 It was what got me \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E interested in exploration of Titan.\u00A0 I actually did a sorta-Baxter version of Titan in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E about a year ago with some parts mods.\u00A0 The main problem was figuring out what the pressurized section of the ship would look like.\u00A0 I\u0027ll probably have a go at this again once I\u0027ve done my current Shuttle Challenge mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Now that I\u0027m thinking about this, I \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Ewant to recreate Titan in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E again.\u00A0 I\u0027m definitely doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-24T15:27:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2021 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Entropian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T16:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224035699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221632491137\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178125\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SiriusRocketry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SiriusRocketry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarth-Venus-Earth-Jupiter-Saturn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been doing some tests in KSPTOT and it seems that E-V-J-S may be quicker and cheaper.\u00A0 The book definitely has Venus and Jupiter as flyby bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T21:47:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224035735\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221632497028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205453\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Entropian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Entropian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAyyyy, Baxter gang!\u00A0 I read the Voyage trilogy a while ago; Titan was by far my favorite.\u00A0 It was what got me \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E interested in exploration of Titan.\u00A0 I actually did a sorta-Baxter version of Titan in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E about a year ago with some parts mods.\u00A0 The main problem was figuring out what the pressurized section of the ship would look like.\u00A0 I\u0027ll probably have a go at this again once I\u0027ve done my current Shuttle Challenge mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Now that I\u0027m thinking about this, I \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Ewant to recreate Titan in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E again.\u00A0 I\u0027m definitely doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s interesting to hear; I\u0027d guessed that the mission would be far harder to fly in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Most of the fuel comes from \u0022massive blunt-nosed cylinders\u0022 fixed onto the side of the cargo bay, in front of the wings. The centrifuge could probably be recreated with a hinged Breaking Ground arm of some kind; the craft itself, aside from the aforementioned OMS fuel tanks, altered wings for Titan\u0027s atmosphere and the removal of the tailplane, looks otherwise identical to the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDiscovery\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eorbiter that it was built from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T23:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224035879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221632520036\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178125\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SiriusRocketry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, SiriusRocketry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe improvised Apollo capsule landers, for example, would have to fit in a separate cargo bay, or squeezed in-line behind the CELSS greenhouse/TOPAZ reactor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that they were supposed to be mounted on the outside of the cargo bay.\u00A0 The CELSS farm and TOPAZ were mounted in the cargobay.\u00A0 Stockalike Station Parts probably will be able to do the centrifuge.\u00A0 A problem I\u0027m running into is where to put the fuel and whatever engines (if there are any extras) for the flyby injection.\u00A0 Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-24T23:18:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2021 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Entropian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T23:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224035918\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221632525514\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205453\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Entropian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Entropian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that they were supposed to be mounted on the outside of the cargo bay.\u00A0 The CELSS farm and TOPAZ were mounted in the cargobay.\u00A0 Stockalike Station Parts probably will be able to do the centrifuge.\u00A0 A problem I\u0027m running into is where to put the fuel and whatever engines (if there are any extras) for the flyby injection.\u00A0 Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a quick tinkering around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and built a basic mockup (minus centrifuge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225qp8p27.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5qp8p27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four Thud engines represent OMS.

I\u0027ll put some on the cupola at the back (representing the greenhouse) too.\u00A0 The two Apollo \u0027landers\u0027 are mounted in the cargo bay; a docking adapter was mentioned in the novel between the greenhouse and the hab, although it wasn\u0027t mentioned as extending outside the bay in any way. Obviously this is far too small to fit two Apollo modules, so I just crammed them inline.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe cupola, as aforementioned, is meant to be a \u0027greenhouse\u0027 of sorts. The novel says that the greenhouse itself is mounted behind the Apollo docking adapters and in front of the nuclear reactor, but as the docking adapter\u0027s crew transfer tunnel doesn\u0027t exist, I might swap positions around. The last thing there (where the radiators are sticking out from the girders) is meant to be the cooling tower for the TOPAZ reactor. The reactor itself, like in the book, is fairly small. I\u0027ve just clipped two RTGs into the cone adapter on a structural plate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022ywz4q9H.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ywz4q9H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T23:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks nice!\u00A0 Now the real problem is how to fit the surface equipment in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-25T03:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my current (possibly subject to massive change) design:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Titan%20Shuttle.png?dl=1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022695\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dmp9539au8up5q/Titan%20Shuttle.png?dl=1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a trajectory mapped in KSPTOT and as far as I can tell the things I have left to do before flight are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake more tweakscale configs for mod parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReconfig some mod parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomehow make sleds for the landing gear\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-25T03:16:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2021 03:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Entropian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-09T05:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: I\u0027m currently having some trouble with reconfiging BDB parts but I\u0027m definitely still doing this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-28T04:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178125-siriusrocketry/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022178125\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178125-siriusrocketry/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SiriusRocketry\u003C/a\u003E I got it sorta-done.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t manage to include everything but the basic mission architecture is still there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022205453\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2910113924\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205405-sorta-doing-a-crewed-titan-mission-based-on-stephen-baxters-titan/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:192px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-09T08:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224048001\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221635394347\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205453\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Entropian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/28/2021 at 5:12 PM, Entropian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178125-siriusrocketry/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022178125\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178125-siriusrocketry/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SiriusRocketry\u003C/a\u003E I got it sorta-done.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t manage to include everything but the basic mission architecture is still there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022205453\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6134428300\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205405-sorta-doing-a-crewed-titan-mission-based-on-stephen-baxters-titan/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, well done -
