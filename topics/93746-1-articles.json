The rocket has a staging error, where upon pressing space bar, it does not activate \u0022Decoupler\u0022 but instead activates Engine2. Thus, Engine2 begins its burn directly atop the still attached decoupler/fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would expect an explosion (and possible damage) to occur, however nothing untoward happens. Engine2 ignites as normal and propels the ship.
