I have been using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to mess around with dozens of mods, and most notably I have been helping \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148627-the-white-guardian/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022148627\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148627-the-white-guardian/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@The White Guardian\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0beta test his massive Evolution mod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJ11E3In4UzpP4tsQAeZ17bqd6RmONIu5\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTWG is making a massive overhaul of Evo, so I thought this would be a good time to unisntall everything, update KSP to 1.3, pick some new mods for the future (I want a very simulation-like experience with life support, stage recovery, and failures etc). So I uninstalled and deleted everything and then reinstalled KSP and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery time I do that and go to play the game stutters terribly. I can go up to a minute without one, but sometimes it pauses for three seconds every 10 seconds. I did free flight the other day and it was less common, but on my career mode every time I tried to do some SCIENCE! it paused, thought about it, then eventually decided to go ahead. But that was for every experiment. It basically made it a science slideshow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anyone here that has any idea what could be causing this or that can help me fix it? It\u0027s not my PC, let me say that (6700K, GTX 1070, 32GB ram, SSD) as it never did this before anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a very long list of mods, but it\u0027s not more robust than it was necessarily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know if anyone has suggestions or can help me with this. I would be happy to provide a mod list if necessary. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: forgot to mention I\u0027ve uninstalled and reinstalled several times and it still happens. It also happened with stock planets and another planet pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-30T14:02:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2017 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Disparia Books\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot to mention...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
