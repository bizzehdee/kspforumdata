Firespitter was the first mod with electric propellers, and thus other mods have Firespitter core as a requirement. KAX has a variety of airplane parts, including both electric and fueled propellers. The propellers from USI mods are meant from vertical propulsion, but are extremely powerful, maybe too powerful. Of course these all require an atmosphere to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
