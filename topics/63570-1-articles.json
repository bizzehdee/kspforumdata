Firstly, we find that, although the Kerbal Engineer parts have 0 mass, they do appear to have drag. Because with FAR installed, placing a KER part on top would send this thing upside down straight away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, dealing with FAR makes me see another major deficiency. This thing literally can\u0027t fly without a nosecone. The only nosecone for something this size, the \u0022Standard NC\u0022, has more than three times of the mass of the significantly larger \u0022Aerodynamic nosecone\u0022. The latter actually made this much easier to fly, but looked stupid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard NC is also the same exact weight as the Mk1 parachute, meaning we might as well use one of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt liftoff, there are 48 engines running. Again, FAR makes things interesting. Turning this thing low like we\u0027d like to is just about impossible since there\u0027s no gimballing, limited torque in our small probe, and fins would make it too heavy. We therefore are forced to take a very inefficient profile and turn at about 22km where the air really thins out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we migrate to the smaller Oscar tanks, each with two engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearly there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00007.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00007.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularisation burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00008.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00008.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lolware.net/kerbal/2014-02-18_00009.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-18_00009.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
