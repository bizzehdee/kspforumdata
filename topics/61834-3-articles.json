So I looked at the commit. As near as I can tell kOS creates a temporary execution context for a single iteration of a loop, and then when it gets to the end of the loop it marks it as \u0022done\u0022 and makes a new one for the next iteration. At each time slice kOS goes through all execution contexts in its master superloop and sees if they have any statements queued up that need executing. Ones that are marked as \u0022done\u0022 don\u0027t need anything executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell, the error was that it was merely marking the old iterations\u0027 execution contexts as \u0022done\u0022 when it should have been fully deleting them. So by the time you were on iteration 2000 of a loop for example, you\u0027d have 1 execution context that actually needed work done (the current iteration of the loop), but it was buried among the other older 1999 \u0022done\u0022 execution contexts from previous iterations. The superloop\u0027s time was wasted iterating over them to see if they needed work done. (They didn\u0027t, but they still occupied execution time checking each one in turn to find out that it\u0027s in \u0022done\u0022 status.) Thus why loops got more laggy the more previous iterations they\u0027ve been through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T06:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThus why loops got more laggy the more previous iterations they\u0027ve been through.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce i heard what the symptoms were, i was pretty sure it was a problem with execution contexts.
