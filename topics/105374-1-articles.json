This probably means the attachment node is hidden inside the satellite. What I do is open the satellite file or a new craft and place the subassembly, then attach something useless under it, a decoupled or something. Then I hit 4 on the keyboard and click something on the satellite, then the useless part under it. Now the root node is the useless part. Click the fairing now and you should see that green attachment point. Now drop that in the subassembly area and your satellite will attach to anything that comes below it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dentzu","CreatedById":143715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T05:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having the exact same problem and am struggling to find a solution :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T05:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand the process correctly, and I don\u0027t claim that I do, you have to make the part you want to connect onto the rocket the \u0022root part\u0022. You do this with the Root tool which is the rightmost of the 4 tools at the top of the VAB screen. Looks a bit like a Z. Click on the Root tool, then somewhere on your satellite, then on the new root part, which, I think, in your case will be the fairing at the bottom. The save the satellite and open your rocket stage. You should now, if I understand the system, have a green sphere on the bottom of the fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T05:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dentzu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dentzu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m having the exact same problem and am struggling to find a solution :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAs with subassemblies, the root part on the craft being merged in (so the satellite if you\u0027re adding it to the rocket) MUST have a free attachment node.\u003Cp\u003ENot any other part, the ROOT part.
