I really don\u0027t understand how a developer can release a game without fixing something so critical! Even if they cannot fix it I cannot warrant a 1.0 release until it was fixed for a game like this. what happens to all those people who just bought KSP for the first time and try to build that awesome base?

Likewise, there is a chance that there are new bugs in Unity 5. Nevertheless, Unity 5 is out there and massive amounts of developers are using it, and doing amazing things with it. \n\nYes, the Win64 problems were caused by the Unity 4 engine issues. However, Unity has address those issues, and many others, and has released a new and updated version. Therefore, in now falls to Squad to update its engine so that these limitations and bugs are fixed. You can\u0027t pass the problem off to Unity anymore. They\u0027ve done their part, now its time for Squad to do theirs."},{"CreatedByName":"Holyvision","CreatedById":100532,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:25:33Z","Content":"A lot of the posts in this thread make me sad. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nThanks you for the amazing game Squad, and keep up all the hard work! ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mipe","CreatedById":109421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:27:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No. Unity 5.0 has only just come out, and it takes weeks to read and understand the differences between the old product and the new product, and months to adapt code to work with it.

By its very nature KSP stretches the game engine to its limits. Very few engines are designed to deal with the tremendous distances present in KSP, nor do many games model vehicles made of multiple interconnected parts for which physics must be calculated. It\u0027s not surprising that workarounds have had to be used, and that upgrading the engine for KSP might be more complex than upgrading for more conventional games."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:33:26Z","Content":"Bugs.
