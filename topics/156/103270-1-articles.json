Soon we\u0027ll unleash the experimental testers on all the new features, optimisations and bugfixes that the developers have crammed into the next update. We\u0027re excited to be moving forward on our development schedule, and we hope you are as well. We\u0027d like to stress that due to the nature of a 1.0 release we\u0027ve scheduled more time than usual for experimental testing.\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in how the QA \u0026 Experimental process works I can recommend reading [Ted\u0027s article](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/303) on the process.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T21:42:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld**"}]}
