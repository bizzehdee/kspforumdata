What I see is that you are dumping more useful content than we are getting in return. Seems like a lot of work for just a different software package that does the same thing. Moving to other software means all the attachments will be broken, old smileys will revert to bbcode etc. Been there, done that, got the migrane.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T23:52:48Z","Content":"\nAre articles going to be transferred?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-27T00:01:04Z","Content":"\nI remember this happening (unintentionally) about a year or so ago, I think they called it the \u0022great coffee spill of 2013\u0022 during the last upgrade transition.
