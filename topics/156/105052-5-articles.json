Same as a mars orbital colony would not live on mars, but in orbit around mars. Also, most people do not equate where you get your resources with where you live. They are two separate concepts. I live in my home, not the supermarket. Similarly, the definition of \u0022living somewhere\u0022 for most people I know seems to be \u0022staying in that location for a few months\u0022, not necessarily \u0022where I call home\u0022. I think you definition of \u0022living somewhere\u0022 is solidly in the minority. Most people use terms like \u0022home\u0022 and \u0022dependent on\u0022 to describe the other concepts you mention. \u0022I live on the ISS, but my home is earth, on which I depend.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Beduino","CreatedById":81326,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:28:02Z","Content":"What ever guys... i could go on with this but wont take us anywhere.. our language is a poor construct anyway.
