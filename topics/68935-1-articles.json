So you would have to be able to control your burns through that length of time. Also, If you were in career mode, a mission to another Solar System could take decades (optimistically) so you would either have to time accelerate to complete the mission (neglecting your space program for years at a time) or start a mission and wait for 10... 20... 30 game years to pass to complete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is that an entire galaxy would probably need to be created to facilitate interstellar travel as there would have to be an SOI in interstellar space.

As for FTL, the FTL drive should be severely limited to avoid its overuse for traveling to other planets. For example in career, to build an FTL, you will need a TON of science points at the end of the tech tree, will require you to visit multiple planets in order to assemble such a material, and should only work once far enough away from Kerbol similar to a Bussard-Ramjet engine, except its FTL, so more like a jump drive.

If we send that space ship to a different solar system and watch it leave from our point of view 10\u002B years will pass before The spaceship makes it to a different solar system. but if we were riding that same spaceship only maybe one or two years will pass by before we made it to the other solar system. So now we have two different timelines. If that same spaceship traveled back to Karbel at 99% speed of light the person riding that spaceship would only have aged about three to five years but the time that passed on Kerbal would be 30 to 50 years so if you returned back to Kerbal then you would have to have the two different timelines sync back up again (much like the system to sync time in the Multiplayer mode). with all that said most trips to different solar systems would be only a one way trip, better pack a lunch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T02:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYea, if we talk about binary (or even trinary) start systems, it becomes feasible, but then you might call it all just one big solar system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, but it still lets you have more stars and planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m thinking something like the Centauri system, with planets (so far there have been no observatios of planets in that system, and it is the closest system, so... maybe they unusual star configuration has resulted in a planetless system, or maybe they are there afterall)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is actually a \u003Cem\u003Edebated\u003C/em\u003E report of a sizzling planet (3.4 day year) around Alpha Centauri B.
