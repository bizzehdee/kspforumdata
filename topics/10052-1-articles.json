Ill periodically post pictures and videos of my launches and or orbits and with goals (Satellites, Mun orbits, maybe even a Sun obit) Basically my vision is that everyone gets to see the excitement and complexity go up from that of a new player who can only really build single rockets to multi stage complex machines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little about my setup so far since Im not going to start over, I will post pictures or a video eventually, but where I am at right now is I have 2 of my first 4 rockets in orbit around Kerbin (named Venture-2, and Venture-3, 1 and 4 didn\\\u0027t fair so well) These are stock rockets next project for me is my Orion mission, to send some Kerbals to orbit the Mun, I am starting with Orion 1 and hope to progress from there. Afterwords I think I will try to do satellite orbits around Kerbin and possibly around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also currently running the Nova Punch pack and what the stock game gives, thats all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing, whats a good site to host photos on?? Im going to do a mix of pictures and videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up, Orion-1 was a failure and Venture-3 fell out of orbit somehow while I was gone, so now we are starting with Orion-2 to hopefully get a large multi stage rocket into the lower/medium stages of Kerbins orbit. Wish me luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMunRules#1","CreatedById":17298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T19:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euse imgur for pics and youtube for vids.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-01T00:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will be watching your progress with great interest, young Jedi. \u0026gt;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also simply attach images to your forum posts.

My first project will be to get a simple maybe 2 staged rocket into space with a satellite to orbit Kerbin and bring Satellite TV to all. Eventually Id like to get a network of them orbiting, and some orbiting Mun.
