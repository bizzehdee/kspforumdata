Line 41152 is where the simulation proper starts (the previous 150 lines are the setup for it). This shows that the dodgy engine is incorrectly marked as active and the other engine is activated because it is in the initial stage. So, it is simulating both engines burning at the same time and the top engine presumably burns all its fuel before the lower one. If you turn the thrust limiter on the top engine right down you should be able to slow it down enough that it will still have some fuel left when the lower one runs out and then some deltaV will appear in stage 0. The active flag is read from ModuleEngines.isOperational so I would expect all engines to have this set to false in the VAB and for it to be false during flight until the engine is activated (either by the staging or any other method).

I got a question though, when I use the already buggy UbioWelding ltd, the interstellar fuel switch keeps on the part. I suspect this is the cause of my crashes because there are more than one type of fuel on the welded part, not to mention the non-generic LqdHydrogen and etc also in it. What would I need to do in the .CFG file to disable the fuel switch for a specific part? Changing the part type didn\u0027t do the trick.\u003Cp\u003EHope that made sense.
