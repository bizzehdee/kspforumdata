When sending data vs. bringing it back physically, it seems like there\u0027s a penalty in the amount of science collected from that experiment. If you send the data, can you recollect it to bring back physically for more science or can you only collect it once? If you can only collect it once then I guess it\u0027s always better to bring back physically to get the bets bang for your buck? I heard there were only biomes on kerbin but it seems like you can also get science by doing flybys to any planet or moon for science as well? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I asked in the chat during a live stream how long it takes to unlock everything and he replied that it took someone about 30 hours, but a mod in the chat said \u00224 flights\u0022 so which is it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T13:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m by no means an expert, but here is what I\u0027ve gathered by watching livestreams and reading blogs etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData Penalty - Seems to apply to \u0022samples\u0022 right now, crew reports gain you 100% when transmitted. I\u0027m unsure if you can collect a sample, transmit it, collect the same sample and bring it back, I\u0027m assuming you probably can at this point, but there is probably a mechanic that will reduce the amount of data you get. From what I have seen so far it\u0027s always better to bring back samples (unknown how many you can store in a capsule). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiomes - From what I\u0027ve seen there are multiple biome types on Kerbin, from grasslands to deserts, to polar caps. The Mun also has \u0022biomes\u0022, and there is some confusion as to how many. Right now I know that Harvester was talking about a biome type inside craters and another outside craters. When they were talked about on the livestream it was implied that each crater on the Mun had it\u0027s own biome (Personally I find this unlikely, I find it more likely that they will find a way to classify craters and assign 1 of x number of biome types, rather than create hundreds or thousands of biomes for one body in the system, but I could very well be wrong).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get science by doing flyby\u0027s, take a crew report (don\u0027t forget you can get out of the capsule on EVA and take an \u0022EVA Report\u0022 as well!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched Scott Manley\u0027s interview with Harvester video (it\u0027s on youtube, check it out), and in there Manley talks about Yargnit doing 4 missions to unlock the entire Tech Tree. Manley thinks he can do it in 3 missions. Now before you get all bent out of shape, Harvester had a REALLY good point. Advanced players shouldn\u0027t have to \u0022grind\u0022 to get all the parts. If you can figure out ways to collect that much data in 3 missions, that\u0027s \u0022super awesome\u0022. Players new to the game will spend more time designing and flying missions to gain science, while gaining much needed experience and personal knowledge of how to play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I hope that helps you out. I had started a thread here in general about Science, but it got moved to tutorials even though it wasn\u0027t intended to be a tutorial, but I\u0027ve decided to attempt it, so I will be updating that thread as more information comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T14:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Data penalty, for samples it makes sense to bring them back to the lab for analyze over having kerbals study them on the site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote you need plenty of power to send back reports so you can not report much until you get better power at tire 3 and 4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso its pretty pointless to try to do this in as few missions as possible. If you do one report on pad you get a decopler, do an suborbital one with two pods and kerbals and you can get both the first space pod and eva report and the specimen reports and an water report after splashdown. next up could be Mun flyby. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be far faster and easier than trying to do it with 4 missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Mun has lots of biomes you could easy finish the tree with an kerbal on an rover traveling around on Mun\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
