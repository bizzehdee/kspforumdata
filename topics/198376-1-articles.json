It seems like like an obvious mod but I can\u0027t seem to find one that fits the bill in terms of expanding up on that part. We have the R7 rocket in game. We have a way to make a a Vostok and a Voskhood completely stock. But no way to make a proper soyuz that doesn\u0027t include part clipping and a bunch of creative uses of canisters and fairings. Maybe I am missing an obvious mod but I can\u0027t find one. Long story short my question, is anyone working on one? Or is there are already a mod that makes expands upon the pods added with making history?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minmus Taster","CreatedById":206159,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-27T17:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTantares:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002270533\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed93761908\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73686-110x-tantares-stockalike-soyuz-and-mir-23201112020/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
