I too met and shook hands with Buzz Aldrin about 7 years ago. I hope to show off the picture some time. I am a boat captain and of a large yacht at the time. He was aboard with other celebs, and I let him into the pilot house, just he and I for about 10 minutes and I let him drive for longer than that as others started to gather round. Then he got a little iffy when I had to take the helm to shove through some ice at a glacier view here in Alaska. He had been drinking a little scotch I had noticed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E Nice enough guy, but he did not want to talk about the moon, I could tell.
