I\u0027d like to ask for a small change in it\u0027s work.\n\nRight now in 0.90 if you accept a part testing contract with a non researched part that is highlighted on the part selector inside VAB/SPH\n\nTHIS option is pretty usefull.\n\nAll I\u0027d like to ask to make a different distinction for the already researched parts to. Because IT IS make the actual part finding reasonable easy.\n\nSo maybe a different color, green or purple or whatever... Or just a mid noticeable frame/border around that part should be neat.\n\nThank you.\n\nHistory on this: I reported it as a bug about this effect not happening with all the parts, so sometime it is higlighted sometimes not... I thought it\u0027s is some kind of strange bug, related to something else (like mods).\n\nthan Sal given me an answer about it highlights the \u0022experimental\u0022 parts. \n\nSo I just like to avoid public confusion on this matter ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) :D"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:50:00Z","Content":"If I\u0027m reading this right, then the blue highlighting in the parts list appears for non-researched experimental parts that you need to test for a contract, but not for already-researched parts that you need to test for a contract, right?\n\nIf so, I agree - it\u0027d be nice to have the highlighting appear regardless of if the part is already researched or not."},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:02:08Z","Content":"Absolutely.\n\nThank you for make it clear, and understandable English.\n\nAnd I am glad to have someone on this side ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ."}]}
