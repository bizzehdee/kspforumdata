I have run into a pretty odd and annoying problem though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to edit .cfg or .txt files, they exception detector shows an error trying to parse the file and all settings in the file are ignored. This is especially prevalent in the NoMoreGrid mod which I want to edit to 0.3 instead of 0.1. Any setting I change cannot be loaded by KSP. So, if I change the launchpad from 0.1 to 0.3 in the file and then start the game, the launchpad reverts back to the default 1.0 setting from the stock game (all NoMoreGrind is ignored).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured it had to to with end-of-line characters, so I saved the file as DOS with no effect. I tried vi, vim, pico, nano, gedit... none of them work. So, now I can have 100 mods, but no way to edit any of the settings without breaking the entire mod... extremely frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have had succes editing .cfg and .txt files on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"v8Dave","CreatedById":134518,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T19:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe files probably contain lines that are too long for the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry the KSP SaveFile Editor \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81870-All-OS-Java-WIP-KSP-Savefile-Editor-v0-2-2-%2824-11-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81870-All-OS-Java-WIP-KSP-Savefile-Editor-v0-2-2-%2824-11-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZaPPPa","CreatedById":94708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T21:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe files are actually really short..
