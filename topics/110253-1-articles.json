No point in worrying about debris unless you are launching thousands of ships to the same orbit and constantly dropping debris, even then it still shouldn\u0027t be a problem! 32-120m/s is a very tiny amount of dV. Is it really worthwhile dragging yourself up the extra few hundred meters either?"},{"CreatedByName":"brianorca","CreatedById":109756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:34:08Z","Content":"Another option: add a probe core and about 200m/s of dv, and you have a booster that can fly home and be recovered.

After all, even paint chips stay in orbit and pose a very real threat. [http://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/f_debris.html](http://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/f_debris.html)\n\nIn the game though I see it more as a gameplay choice. As SpaceChipmunk says, you\u0027ll probably never accumulate enough debris for it to be an issue. In my 0.90 game I was very careful to plan my launches so that no debris would be left in orbit (as long as nothing went wrong ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). In 1.0.x I\u0027ve been purposefully ignoring such planning and just letting the debris accumulate. I\u0027m finding it kinda fun to see old debris whiz by during launches. Closest encounter so far has been around 10km."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:26:14Z","Content":"I try to not leave any debris, if for no other reason than because I think too many vessels (even if classes as debris), has a negative impact on game performance for my computer.\n\nEarly in career, this means stages that are discarded just before orbit.\n\nA bit later it also means stages that collide with Mun/Minmus.\n\nAnd a bit later, it means SSTOing everything."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T21:02:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Another option: add a probe core and about 200m/s of dv, and you have a booster that can fly home and be recovered.

It\u0027s a smidgen less safe, but some moderately careful driving should get you around it easily enough.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, I vote you make the ascent stage orbit-capable, and perhaps attach a probe so you can later turn it around and send it back down, possibly for recovery."},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:25:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Another option: add a probe core and about 200m/s of dv, and you have a booster that can fly home and be recovered.
