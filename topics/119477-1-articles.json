So have managed to send 2 ships and have 1 ship that has just arrived. Its again an unmanned probe - almost the same as I sent to Duna. I have just a poodle engine remaining and about 800LF/Oxy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Velocity is almost 6000M/S so I thought I could set up an aerocapture (is that the right terminology) by plotting just in the atmosphere. After several attempts at 80K right up to 90K - I either explode instantaneously or just go straight out the other side. The lowest Peri I could do was 89,500 without exploding. I guess my velocity is just too high and I don\u0027t have enough fuel left to slow down in orbit. I have airbrakes and parachutes of which obviously the airbrakes do nothing as I can\u0027t get into the atmosphere before exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically am I screwed as I don\u0027t have enough fuel and just have to do a flyby and capture some science above 90K and then let my ship go into distant space? With my second eve mission which is due to land in one day I may have to scrap my plans to land on eve and see if I can get into orbit around Tylo?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T09:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.02 I was barely aple to manage an aerocapture with a relative velocity of 5k....
