Yet they have less thrust than chemical rockets, which are the means we use to even reach vacuum.

The main reason LANTR works so well is that LH2 isn\u0027t very dense. When you add\u00A0oxygen, mass flow goes up. An oxidizing reaction would be a plus, but a relatively minor effect, especially since it would occur inside the nozzle. With methane, you don\u0027t have mass flow problems in first place, since it\u0027s reasonably dense. Oxygen would not give\u00A0a significant performance bonus here, if you want to switch gears you can just dump more methane straight into\u00A0the reactor. It will cool down, but that by itself wouldn\u0027t harm the nuclear reaction, but will trade Isp for thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLH2 NTRs in general have the same problems as hydrolox engines, only magnified by the fact all of their mass flow is hydrogen.
