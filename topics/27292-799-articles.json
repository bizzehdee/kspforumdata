Unfortunately, I\u0027m not a very good pilot, so I crashed both...several times. Then I switched to building rockets, which went considerably better after some initial difficulties with ballistic stages. Again, I\u0027m not a very good pilot, so Mechjeb was able to do my job better than I was (to be honest, I\u0027m grateful for that; I greatly prefer designing and building rockets to actually flying them). In fact, I was able to design a series of relatively small solid rockets that were able to launch some quite meaningful payloads: a basic satellite (using only solids), a scientific satellite in a polar orbit (also using the monoprop thrusters on the satellite for insertion), a high-orbit test vehicle, another scientific satellite in a very high polar orbit, and a geostationary satellite. I\u0027m certain I could also launch a flyby of the Mun and Minmus, and maybe even Duna and Eve with this vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I learned from this is that Sepratrons are NOT just for separating stages (though they are of course very useful for that). If their thrust is turned down, they can burn just as long as a Flea or Hammer (or very nearly) and provide a meaningful delta-V increment for lighter launch vehicles. Another point is that seemingly minor changes, e.g. switching from two engines to three, can actually have a big effect on available delta-V for light launchers. Old hat to some, I suppose, but not things I would typically think about...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m actually enjoying this all-solids, all-monoprop challenge I wandered into more or less by accident. Normally I tend to just whack together great big piles of rockets, but now I actually have to think about things.

I had to make two attempts - FAR borked on me and tried to throw physics out the window (must\u0027ve been because Val was on board the plane - same thing happened last time she was aboard a \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E except that flight wasn\u0027t so lucky), so I had to revert. Reverting worked, though; I nearly came down right on top of KSC, which is not the sort of thing you want to do in a spaceplane (what with the usual method of landing and all). I was able to pull the plane up in time about ten clicks from KSC 09 and kept her in the glide slope the rest of the way in, landing successfully. The success of the flight cleared three contracts and scored me 1,706 science points, enough to unlock three techs on the 550-point tier. All I\u0027ve got left on the tech tree to unlock at this point is Ion Propulsion - 550 more and I\u0027m done.

So, I\u0027m now planning on putting that off until the next group of tourists is scheduled to visit Mun. To support that goal, I focused on my Munar mining operations - four days worth, long enough for \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E to return to Kerbin from Minmus with Cerxie and four tourists aboard. I\u0027ve been waiting for one of those tourists to get back from Minmus; she and three others at Kerbinport have a Kerbolar orbit on their itineraries.
