Get down close to Jool surface, go eva with an kerbal and plant an flag, return to ship and get back to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote I say this is harder than Eve SSTO, mods are obviously required, hooliganlabs balloons or perhaps the firespitter propels, this let you hover, it will also take you out of most of the atmosphere before going for rockets. Tips if you start the rockets at 40km you still need 8-9000m/s to reach orbit, upside is that gravity is less than on Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is to getting down and up, now the second part who I have been unable to do is the Eva. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS will obviously help here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes this challenge breaks the rules as I\u0027m unable to do it myself.

It might be that I now went down below 0 attitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea might be to attach an kas wire to the kerbal, drop him to the surface have him bunch around until I got the plant flag option then winch him back up. Get him back into the pod, inflate the balloons, drop all Eva stuff on the way up and burn for orbit. An interesting ship you had, how much dV and TWR, able to send three kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T13:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo long as the ship is \u0022anchored\u0022 to the surface, then your Kerbals can walk around on the decking of it. If it isn\u0027t anchored then the Kerbals act like their in free fall on the decks. I have set my cable lengths for KAS to be 250m, which does help keep my ships out of the kraken zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to my ship, it\u0027s a straightforward design using asparagus staging. The final stage of it can reach low Jool orbit, enough to be out of the atmosphere. If you want to have a play around with it let me know and I\u0027ll upload it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
