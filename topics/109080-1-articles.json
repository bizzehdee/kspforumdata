I know how to animate/rig in 3D Studio Max and how generally the exporting/importing process goes for game engines (Unity/UE4), but was wondering if KSP itself has support for adding in new animations to the Kerbal EVA. I figured custom animations are possible for parts themselves judging from the mods I\u0027ve seen, but I have yet to see a mod that does anything animation wise to the Kerbals. I\u0027ve tried googling but haven\u0027t had any luck finding someone whose done anything related to EVA animations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027m thinking of more of an extension/interactive nature to Kerbals on EVA, starting simple with something like right clicking on the Kerbal EVA which opens the buttons as normal, but with the ability to add a button that would basically trigger a new animation for the kerbal (and probably either restrict movement for the duration of the animation, or have it be canceled out when a movement key is pressed) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to set something like this up and open some doors for EVA interactions besides flag experiments, like having little science experiment animations or fun emotes for all of you out there that like to do videos and photos.
