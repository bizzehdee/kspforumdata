I know how to animate/rig in 3D Studio Max and how generally the exporting/importing process goes for game engines (Unity/UE4), but was wondering if KSP itself has support for adding in new animations to the Kerbal EVA. I figured custom animations are possible for parts themselves judging from the mods I\u0027ve seen, but I have yet to see a mod that does anything animation wise to the Kerbals. I\u0027ve tried googling but haven\u0027t had any luck finding someone whose done anything related to EVA animations.\n\nBasically I\u0027m thinking of more of an extension/interactive nature to Kerbals on EVA, starting simple with something like right clicking on the Kerbal EVA which opens the buttons as normal, but with the ability to add a button that would basically trigger a new animation for the kerbal (and probably either restrict movement for the duration of the animation, or have it be canceled out when a movement key is pressed) \n\nIt would be nice to set something like this up and open some doors for EVA interactions besides flag experiments, like having little science experiment animations or fun emotes for all of you out there that like to do videos and photos.

I suppose you could recreate the kerbal rig, animate, and somehow copy the movements into a script to be played through that plugin.\n\nBest I can come up with I\u0027m afraid!"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T21:39:46Z","Content":"My understanding is that Kerbal animations / poses are hard-coded into the game\u0027s asset files.\n\nHowever:\n\n - stupid\\_chris and I extracted the [Kerbal transform tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113748-Reference-Kerbal-EVA-model-transform-tree), showing all the meshes, joints and bones that make up a Kerbal\n\n - DSSP had [a proof-of-concept for a plugin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56952-WIP-Animated-EVA-ScienceRack) that directly manipulated each joint/bone in a Kerbal, as well as recording/playback of the resulting animation. However, DSSP never finished his work, nor released any WIPs.\n\nIn conclusion: It\u0027s definitely possible, but not for the faint-hearted."},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T21:47:50Z","Content":"I did something similar involving kerbal joints, but I only have the ability to make poses, not moving animations, . It\u0027s just a tool that goes through all the kerbal bones, and allows you to manipulate them through a basic gui.\n\n![jQDS84d.png](http://i.imgur.com/jQDS84d.png)\n\nThis pose was made by rotating the base bone-hierarchy transform by 90 degrees, and bending the neck/upper jaw bones.\n\nIt also turns out that it\u0027s really easy to add editor gizmos to kerbal joints, so that kerbal animations could be made in the VAB/SPH. You\u0027d manipulate the bones with the rotation and translation gizmos, then save consecutive poses as keyframes in an animationclip, which could be saved (in some kind of text based format, or ConfigNodes), and reused as parts of the KerbalFSM system.\n\nAlso...\n\nthe poses in my avatar picture were also made with this. I also have a tool that can selectively disable renderer components and colliders, which is how I removed the jetpacks/helmets\n\n[heres a higher res version of my avatar image](http://imgur.com/bHH8Esd.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T21:52:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**"}]}
