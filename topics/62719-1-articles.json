After a couple launches, I was curious about how I could get a circular orbit using a decoupler because it always fires my satellite off into an elliptical orbit once my final stage circularizes at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB, the TR-18A decouplers (the first decoupler you get) say they have an \u0027ejection force\u0027 of 250. I went hunting around and found that the ejection force is in kilonewtons, or 250,000 newtons. However, my satellite (a Stayputnik and 3 antennas) weighs 0.065 according to the game, or 65 kilograms, so an ejection force of 250,000 newtons would be able to add 3,846.2 m/s of delta-v (250,000 kg*m/s divided by 65 kg = 3,846.2 m/s) or enough to escape the solar system from low Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit of experimenting, I figured out that the decoupler adds 38.5 m/s of delta-v, or 2,500 newtons (2,500 kg*m/s divided by 65 kg = 38.462 m/s). This means that the ejection force of the decoupler is in decanewtons, a somewhat awkward unit and one that the game never mentions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to ask that Squad double-check the decouplers so that everything lines up. This could mean the ejection force is now written as 2.5 kN with the current units but a corrected number, 250 daN as it is now but with the proper units, or 2500 N with the base unit and a corrected number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a bit confusing when the units don\u0027t line up with what they say they are. This could especially be a problem with the KerbalEdu program, because while I haven\u0027t used it, I\u0027d imagine it\u0027s much more math-intensive and correct units become much more important in the classroom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strikerklm96","CreatedById":102539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T01:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA Newton is a kg*m/s^2, not kg*m/s. You cannot calculate delta-v from just a force, you also need the forces duration. In your calculation you accidentally assumed it applied it for 1 second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess you have actually found out that the decoupler applies 250,000 newtons for 0.01 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E250,000m/s^2 * 0.01s / 65kg = 38.46m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey ought to put the force duration on the decoupler though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"novafire08","CreatedById":19606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T04:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I\u0027m probably wrong then. If you can go into more detail though, how does the duration matter in this case? The force is going to apply 250,000 newtons, so how does shortening the duration affect how much of that is applied? Decouplers in KSP pretty much provide an instantaneous change in velocity (or 0.01 seconds if you\u0027re right), so how does it end up applying only 1/100th of the potential 250,000 newton force contained in the decoupler? I\u0027m probably not phrasing that the best, let me know if I should clarify.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T07:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause F\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u009Dt = m\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u009Dv.
