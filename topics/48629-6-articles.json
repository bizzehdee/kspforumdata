Also, there are other mods out there such as IonCross life Support, that make it so Kerbals will use up O2 and produce CO2 at all times.

I am kind of new to this mod, just as I got on board with this mod, it got updated. I basically know the standard Biomass stuff, not much to figure out. There is some new things I figured out. The Biomass\u002B stuff is where I need some learning, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, they are currently still developing the new version of the mod. There are a few bugs they have to work out (one being fairly serious -- time compression kills your biomass) so before they really can afford to make any new videos, they\u0027d first need to work out the kinks so that everything works \u0027as advertised\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing with the mod and want to help in its development it might be a good idea to notice and report any quirks or bugs to the github (I personally love the github issue tracker -- makes life easier and it\u0027s much easier to track ongoing issues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, Roboto, the models are superb. Can easily tell a lot of thought went into the designs! A suggestion I\u0027d have for you guys since Sean hinted at an issue in stock KSP that would be very useful for this mod in particular. An oxidizer tank. I\u0027d also personally like to see some in-line tanks as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
