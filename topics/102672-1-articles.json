But he and the stone are in freefall, so when he pushes down the stone to jump, the stone might not be able to provide enough reactive force to jump. But there is mass difference between Legolas and the stone, so as Newton\u0027s second law, assuming the stone have higher mass than Legolas, the stone will be accelerated slower compared to Legolas, and so he can jump from the falling stone.
