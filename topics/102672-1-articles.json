But is it true? \n\nFrom what I know, Newton\u0027s third law states that every action have equal and opposite force, so when he applies force to the falling stone, the stone exerts a reactive force that propel him upward. But he and the stone are in freefall, so when he pushes down the stone to jump, the stone might not be able to provide enough reactive force to jump. But there is mass difference between Legolas and the stone, so as Newton\u0027s second law, assuming the stone have higher mass than Legolas, the stone will be accelerated slower compared to Legolas, and so he can jump from the falling stone. But is it true or my physics is wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:42:54Z","Content":"This.
