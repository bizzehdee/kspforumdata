Look in the sticky\u0027s at the top of the sub sub forum\u0027s - some tutorials in there - old but still mostly applicable (except for wheels). but the basic (many details missing) process is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Create your model - Blender is the most used but there are also Wings 3D and others. 24 sided cylinders with 12 sided collision meshes are\u00A0 standard for things like fuel tanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Unwrap the model and create the textures\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Export the model to a format Unity can handle - there is also a Blender direct to .mu (in-game file type) but I haven\u0027t used it so can\u0027t speak to it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Import model and textures into Unity - add materials, setup collision meshes, setup animations, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5)Export from Unity to your Dev GameData folder using the PartTools Unity package from Squad - will write a .mu file (the model) and textures\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Create a config file for the part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of details missing - see above mentioned tutorials. Can be rather frustrating at first as lots of ways for things to not work but is a real thrill when you get your first part in game. I would suggest you start with a simple fuel tank at first to get familiar with the process. As you run into roadblocks check the add-on forum\u0027s - someone\u0027s probably had the same issue before. If you can\u0027t find an answer ask - lots of helpful people here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
