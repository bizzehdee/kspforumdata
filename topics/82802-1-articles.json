It has a crash tolerance of 45m/s. I was wondering, if you used the command pod base to land, would it be beneficial? Would there be a good reason to build something this way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it save fuel if u landed at 30m/s instead of slowing down to like 5/ms or, could u literally drop it and it would survive somehow \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried thinking about it myself, but I\u0027m struggling, yet still believe might be some potential here. Technically anything u build on top of it would survive, Anything that might offset its large mas at 4.12. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on this part to best use it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T11:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can save fuel - on airless bodies you just don\u0027t brake that much, saving some 25 m/s dv at least. On bodies with air, you can mount less parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crash tolerance, though, only means the pod will not explode if it runs into the ground at that speed.
