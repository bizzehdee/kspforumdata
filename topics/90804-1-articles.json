It\u0027s a fascinating structure, really. Holding more asteroids than we can count, as well as Sol\u0027s daughter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost went off into a poem up there. Jeez. Anyway, yes, and Oort cloud. First off, I would completely understand this being rejected on first sight, as it would require stepping past the outermost reaches of the Kerbol system, and would be pure evil to create in programming. However, if you one day decide to create it, that would be absolutely stellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking: At the outer reaches of the sun, there lies a mysterious cloud shrouded in mystery. What could it be? The Oort cloud, of course! It\u0027s millions and billions of asteroids and particles of space dust! Surely there\u0027s plenty of science here, right? Anyway, what\u0027s that thing extending out tangential to Eeloo\u0027s aphelion? Looks to me like a brown dwarf star. ...Oh silly me, it couldn\u0027t possibly... wait... could it? Could it be? Kerbol\u0027s daughter star? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmazing! This opens up another field of science we haven\u0027t even touched on yet! Of course, this raises a question... How do we get there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELooks over to an SRB... \u003C/strong\u003EEureka!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, I completely understand if this is completely out of the realm of possibility. I just wanted this to be here before I saw any others (I can\u0027t help but think that sounds really jerkish, but I have no idea why).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T13:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal being Kerbal I dont think it would be that bad to include an Oort cloud much closer than in reality. Just a significant but not extreme distance past the final planet (assuming more than what we have might be implemented, we should have a Planet X) and make it the only source of F or G class asteroids or something.
