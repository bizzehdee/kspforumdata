I\u0027m attempting to remove my Air breaks from the stock \u0022Breaks\u0022 Action Group, and add them to Custom 3. However since I have Air Breaks on top and bottom, I want to close the lower ones once I am about to land, so I set them to Custom 4 to toggle yet again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustom 3 and Custom 4 are yellow after I do the edit. I click Save, they turn white. But when I go to the launch pad, my Action Groups are back to what they were before the flight, with Custom 01 being my lights, and Custom 2 being my flaps. Custom 3 and 4 won\u0027t save with the Air breaks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods installed:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Frontier \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot Assistance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule Manager 2.6.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReproduction steps:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnknown\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaara","CreatedById":139923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame here.
