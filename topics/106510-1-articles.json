I\u0027m attempting to remove my Air breaks from the stock \u0022Breaks\u0022 Action Group, and add them to Custom 3. However since I have Air Breaks on top and bottom, I want to close the lower ones once I am about to land, so I set them to Custom 4 to toggle yet again. \n\nCustom 3 and Custom 4 are yellow after I do the edit. I click Save, they turn white. But when I go to the launch pad, my Action Groups are back to what they were before the flight, with Custom 01 being my lights, and Custom 2 being my flaps. Custom 3 and 4 won\u0027t save with the Air breaks. \n\n**Mods installed:**\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nMechjeb 2\n\nFinal Frontier \n\nPilot Assistance\n\nModule Manager 2.6.2\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\nUnknown"},{"CreatedByName":"jaara","CreatedById":139923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:32:25Z","Content":"Same here.

I\u0027ve had this problem today also and the fixes claim to include that really, really irritating issue.
