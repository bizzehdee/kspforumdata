I landed my shuttle on a random patch of land on Kerbin, but it just rolled uncontrollably and took forever to decelerate. If this is a common issue that will be dealt with later, I understand, but I want to make sure im not missing anything. To circumvent this, I tried to attach some RCS and thrust backwards after landing, but it seems to really destabilize the plane. Any help would be appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:17:02Z","Content":"\u0027B\u0027 is the default brake on the landing gear."},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:25:29Z","Content":"The brake as stated above, but another good idea is to put parachutes on the back of your space plane to slow it down Shuttle-style ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:59:11Z","Content":"OR!\n\nyou can use retro rockets for...\n\nKERBAL STYLE!"},{"CreatedByName":"timmybananas","CreatedById":16406,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T02:26:04Z","Content":"Awesome, thanks everyone for all the ideas, and thanks for the clarifications on the controls Feragorn ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T02:33:08Z","Content":"No problem."}]}
