I landed my shuttle on a random patch of land on Kerbin, but it just rolled uncontrollably and took forever to decelerate. If this is a common issue that will be dealt with later, I understand, but I want to make sure im not missing anything. To circumvent this, I tried to attach some RCS and thrust backwards after landing, but it seems to really destabilize the plane. Any help would be appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027B\u0027 is the default brake on the landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:25:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brake as stated above, but another good idea is to put parachutes on the back of your space plane to slow it down Shuttle-style \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOR!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can use retro rockets for...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERBAL STYLE!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timmybananas","CreatedById":16406,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T02:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thanks everyone for all the ideas, and thanks for the clarifications on the controls Feragorn \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T02:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo problem. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
