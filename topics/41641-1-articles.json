I love building rockets, stations and bases in KSP and since i keep running into situation where I wish i had this part or that part, i have decided to join the fray and develop some parts for KSP. I have some ideas for a mod which I will be posting information and my pre-visualization in the add-on development forums. I am a software engineer by day and a 3-D animator at night, so hopefully I can create a mod most people will enjoy. Hats off to all those mod developers that have created some really cool content so far!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T23:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
