Ie. could an induced voltage or an applied current be used instead of (or to augment) a pressure swing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are working on developing a proof of concept for a novel O2 concentration device. These things exist already; they typically use Li-subsituted Zeolites on a rapid pressure swing cycle to adsorb N2 out of ambient air and create a stream of relatively concentrated oxygen. Portable models can generate about 3 liters per minute of 90% O2. This patent \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com.sv/patents/EP2485794A2?cl=en\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.google.com.sv/patents/EP2485794A2?cl=en\u003C/a\u003E describes the current devices fairly well. We are planning on building a similar device but utilizing a different Zeolite, Cu\u002B Substituted ZSM-5, which has demonstrated great N2 adsorption characteristics, but has the added benefit of not using spendy Lithium. Adsorption isotherms and some other data on these Zeolites are here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jz100467w\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jz100467w\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2001/cp/b009942m/unauth#!divAbstract\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2001/cp/b009942m/unauth#!divAbstract\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo back to my main question. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering if there is a way to cause the N2 to desorb off the zeolite without using a pressure swing. The N2 adsorbs due to ligand formation with the Cu\u002B in the zeolite framework; could it be desorbed using a voltage swing or a current? I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found literature that mentions electrical swing adsorption for CO2 scrubbers, but the electrical swing only works by creating heat, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really a thermal swing. If anyone has a good working knowledge of this kind of thing (it is used for CO2 scrubbing and gas management on the ISS after all!) it would be greatly appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome background: I work in a medical research lab. The Gates Foundation has certain problem areas in healthcare that they fund research in. They focus on developing countries, particularly in Africa. One of the biggest healthcare problems in rural setting is maintaining supplies of O2. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve promised to fund (and I mean 6-7 figures kind of fund) further research into novel technology to cheaply and renewably generate O2 without using much power. Thus, my boss gave me this as a ridiculously ambitious side project.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBit of a stab in the dark here but would laser or (probably cheaper) microwave desorption work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Businfu","CreatedById":116782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an interesting thought... do you have any theoretical reason why it could?

It\u0027s an interesting prospect, and you are right there is quite a bit of literature out there. Most of what I came up with focuses on systems designed to pull volatile organics out of air, but that doesn\u0027t mean the concept couldn\u0027t be applied. Since you seem to have a solid background in physics I\u0027ll pose another question. I know microwaves themselves aren\u0027t very high energy, but how much energy does it take to \u003Cem\u003Emake\u003C/em\u003E microwaves? Brief googling yielded that a home microwave oven runs on something crazy like 1200 watts.

It\u0027s like the first one listed on the wikipedia page you linked. I would assume that the nitrogen generator you describe actually uses Zeolite as well, or possibly active carbon. The whole issue is \u0027discarding the other components\u0027. Molecular sieves adsorb certain molecules into pores, but once everything is saturated, no more can be adsorbed. A pressure swing adsorbtion device removes the unwanted stuff by lowering the pressure which causes unwanted gas (N2 in my case, O2 in the automobile case) to vent out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly though, I found this article about capillary condensation of N2 on multiwall carbon nanotubes. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jp973319n\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp973319n\u003C/a\u003E.
