The fact is, it just doesn\u0027t make sense to have a standard size fairing, just like it doesn\u0027t make sense to have a standard size fuel tank (if it were up to me, I would toss ALL the standard fuel tanks and replace them with procedural fuel tanks with various different possible textures available. It would save memory/RAM while improving player options at the same time...) You build a rocket to the size you want, and then fit a fairing on top of it. Frankly, beyond engines, I see no use for standard-size parts... At the VERY least, fuel tanks and fairings should be stretchable to any length, even if they only come in certain fixed diameters.

Thus, even with the stock LF/O (and *especially* with the RealFuels mod) it is often advisable to separate your fuel and oxidizer into separate tanks to influence how the Center of Mass shifts as you burn fuel. This is even more important in planes (you don\u0027t want CoM to shift too far backwards). In stock, where Liquidfuel and Oxidizer are the same density, you want to place your Oxidizer towards the bottom/rear of your plane/rocket as the Center of Mass will then shift away from it (Oxidizer is consumed in greater quantities of mass than Liquidfuel, even in KSP- although this tendency is much stronger in real life...) With realistic fuels (which I really think should be a part of the stock game, as they make the game more believable than LF/O and give players more options for fuel-density vs. ISP), you want to place your Liquid Oxygen higher up on the rocket, as it is denser than Liquid Hydrogen or Kerosene...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(3) Drop-tanks and staging.\u003C/strong\u003E It is generally advisable from a Delta-V perspective to stage and/or use drop tanks.
