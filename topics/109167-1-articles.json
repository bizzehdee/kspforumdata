The skipper seemed the closest match, but that required throwing fins on in place of the radials and limiting the thrust to 73% to match the TWR of the radials.

Now, airstream that is at higher pressure is coming of from the edge and naturally mixes with that zone of lower pressure and that creates vortices which in turn drags on the object and slows it down. When you have back end tapering like that of a nose cone mixing of those low and high pressure streams is much more gradual, vortices are less powerful and are causing less drag on your vehicle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s mixing two different ideas. It doesn\u0027t require any large-scale vortices for this effect to occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are trying to describe is called \u0022form drag\u0022 or \u0022pressure drag\u0022. When you push a solid object through the air, the air in front gets squished, giving it a high pressure. In a completely inviscid flow, this pressure is recovered at the back, and the net effect is no drag. But real air is not inviscid. In real air, the flow does not completely fill in at the back. Instead, a boundary layer forms around the object, and this boundary layer prevents the freestream flow from completely closing at the back. So you have low pressure at the back and high pressure at the front. The difference between the two is a net force from the pressure: drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more that you leave a blunt surface at the back, the more that you get a big area of low pressure pulling back on you. Or another way to put it, the bigger of a hole that you punch through the air. A shape like an airfoil, however, gives the air a chance to fill in behind your object without leaving a huge hole of low pressure. That\u0027s why an airfoil shape has less drag than other shapes. It\u0027s also why airfoils have a sharp and pointing trailing edge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T21:16:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
