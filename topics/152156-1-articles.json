The slope is not all that big (5-10\u00A0degree at most) but my heavy rover slides down even on brakes. Even when the wheels are perpendicular to the direction of slope... even when landing legs are lowered. The slide always happens as if the rover is standing on ice. (this all happens on Eve).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried playing with wheels set up, but no amount of tweaking the traction or\u00A0friction, etc could not prevent\u00A0the slide. Is it by design? Basically all I want is to make sure that when I enable the brakes the rover would remain still. Is it impossible on the slope now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T07:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u00A0set the friction at 5.00 and the brakes at 200, it always stops for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-17T07:57:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2016 07:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T08:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, what\u0027s the difference between friction and traction (KSP-wise)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T09:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFriction\u00A0is always there whether the wheel is accelerating or braking.
