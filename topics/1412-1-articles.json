It\u0027s made of three concentric \u0027rings\u0027 of eight solid fuel boosters, angled slightly and attached to the other stages (and/or the command module itself) by radial decouplers. As you may have guessed, the craft spins quite enthusiastically, but is surprisingly stable in spite (or perhaps because?) of this. You may want to fiddle with the staging a bit: Although the craft is perfectly functional, there\u0027s a number of stages (10, 6, 4, and 2) that don\u0027t do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Wobbling Wheel God is quite similar, save for the fact that it doesn\u0027t get as much lift, flies in whatever direction it feels like flying in, and is rather less safe. It\u0027s actually quite amusing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETriskelion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i53.tinypic.com/oh4y6h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oh4y6h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Triskelion is not so much a spacecraft as it is a screaming metal death trap. There\u0027s certainly nothing new or exciting about a rocket that invariably kills its passengers. What\u0027s strange (and completely unintentional!) about the Triskelion is how consistent it is at doing so: If no attempts are made to control it, it will invariably explode at precisely 2762 meters up (well, assuming that thrust is at default levels). In all my attempts to change this outcome, I was only able to cause it to detonate at 276\u003Cstrong\u003E1\u003C/strong\u003E meters. Obviously, the heights reached will be different if you fiddle with the thrust output, but other than that there\u0027s not much you can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP-EX1 Condor\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i52.tinypic.com/vzhces.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vzhces.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Condor was my attempt to create a working prototype of an overland, rocket-propelled \u0027plane\u0027 of sorts, and, to a certain extent, it works. However, the ship is... temperamental. \u003Cstrong\u003EVery\u003C/strong\u003E temperamental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mechanism which \u0027tilts\u0027 the Condor from vertical launch to horizontal flight will do its job very quickly. At this point, it must be ejected with extreme haste (otherwise the craft tilts further and smashes into the ground). Once ejected, the two rockets that compose this mechanism will crash into each other and explode mere meters in front of the Condor itself. Thus, the Condor\u0027s operator \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E delay activating the second stage thrusters. If you do not delay, the Condor will smash into the ejected engines (instant death). If you do delay, but too briefly, the Condor will have at least one of its wings smashed off as it accelerates through the debris from the explosion (eventual death). Lastly, even if you do clear the debris unscathed, the condor is so difficult to steer that you won\u0027t be flying parallel to the ground for too long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the KSP-EX1 Condor can be seen in one of two ways: As an experimental foray into safe and controlled horizontal rocketeering (in which case it is a horrific failure), or as a hilarious, breakneck thrillride that may or may not leave its occupants intact (in which case it is a \u003Cem\u003Eresounding\u003C/em\u003E success!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-08T20:27:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is an enormous amount of insanity you wrapped up here together.
