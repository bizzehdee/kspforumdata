As the message is regarding g-force tolerance it would appear to be at least partially DRE hence, I have posted here. It is not the aerodynamic failure message I get when I tear the wings off things. I have thought about it some more. It could have been happening since I upgraded KSP to 0.24.2 and I possibly just took some time to notice. Therefore it could be an interaction between DRE and any of many KSP setup/mod changes I made at the time, not just FAR\u002BDRE. I am also thinking that this is in some ways a symptom of the comic theme of KSP in opposition with realism adding mods. From an engineering perspective the 4 little wire-like struts that are depicted on the sepratron really have to break off given the significant g-force that will occur upon sepratron firing. Why should I expect otherwise? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Really it is probably the joint that is too weak.

If I am alone or nearly alone in experiencing the sepratrons blasting off from their attached part and flying chaotically all around the sky individually then I should investigate further to diagnose what is unique about my KSP that is causing this extraneous pyrotechnics display. Perhaps by doing the classic clean install followed by a progressive mod add procedure. Otherwise, if many are experiencing this then I am comfortable to accept that I/we have modded in just a little bit too much realism.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HerrGeneral","CreatedById":63453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T22:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDumb question, but how do I get my heatshields to be aerodynamically stable with FAR?
