Even going back to my very first quicksave, I still see all the contract I have in my latest quicksave, so basically besides this tourist contract suddenly failing, the contracts you have don\u0027t change between quicksaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, Wehrkin Kerman is still in my list of astronauts (so not lost at all), but now unusable since I can\u0027t \u0027redo\u0027 the contract (already discarded it for that matter) and unable to be removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After relaunching the game later I noticed the contract suddenly being back (after it had \u0027failed\u0027 and I had discarded it), so I retried it and now I\u0027ve achieved the contract!
