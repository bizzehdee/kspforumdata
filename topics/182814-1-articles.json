While in prior attempts several versions ago I found the first few missions to be a fairly perfunctory exercise, to my consternation I have discovered that in the current version, re-entering with the Mk. 1 command pod is unreasonably difficult. Specifically, atmospheric drag seems to have been\u00A0nerfed so much that if you make the mistake of getting off a totally \u003Cs\u003Eprograde\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0 retrograde heading by more than 2-3 degrees during mid re-entry, you are irrevocably dead! And not because you will blow up with the wrong end pointed towards the ground,\u00A0but because your nose will lock to prograde so hard from the aerodynamic forces that you can never change your attitude again. That in itself wouldn\u0027t be so bad, but now the air is so thin you can never even slow down enough to safely deploy a parachute before you drill a hole in the ground. It definitely wasn\u0027t like that before. Do they really want it this way? I think they either need to increase the drag numbers on the Mk. 1 capsule or strengthen its reaction wheels, because the way it is now I think it is going to turn a lot of players off, even if they have the benefit of F5/F9. Besides, \u0022career\u0022 games in general ought to start off relatively easy and then get harder as you go. Under this regime, hard career starts off nearly impossible and then becomes trivial and boring as you finally get the parts that actually let you fly missions effectively. I\u0027ve always had that complaint about it, but in the current state of affairs it seems worse than ever. Anyway, just my $0.02, but\u00A0 I\u0027d be interested to know if others have had the same experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-12T02:35:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2019 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-12T02:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just abuse parachutes and high speeds.

Maybe that\u0027s by design, to force you to scrounge science from a bunch of ultra-boring early-game missions so you can buy the tech to not die coming back from orbit. It doesn\u0027t take much -- just some higher-speed drogue chutes or radial-mount chutes. And it\u0027s not like I can\u0027t turn the corner on even that game -- I just can\u0027t currently do it without killing multiple pilots and losing a lot of rep along the way.

But down around 25km, where the deceleration really kicks in, it seemed like there was much less margin of error than that. Once flipped, it seemed like the capsule had a TV of at least 900 m/s, accelerating or holding steady almost all the way to the ground, even though it was coming in at a pretty low angle. Pointed the other way, it rapidly slows down to a safe chute deployment speed on the same trajectory. For my (re-started) hard career game, I dealt with it by just doing more silly missions at the start and getting the\u00A0drogue chutes before I even attempted to go to orbit.\u00A0 Those seem to deploy successfully even at 800 m/s, so they greatly shorten the time spent in that zone of instant death. Still, the pointy-end-forward drag of the Mk. 1 capsule \u002B chute seems implausibly low to me, out of step with the other front-end parts.
