That is a fact. However, the current implementation is far from accurate and it kinda hurts the gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience as of now is a miracle resource. You find it in new places and you build all your new tech out of it. All science is identical. A science point from a crew report on the launchpad is exactly the same as a science point from an atmospheric pressure reading from Jool\u0027s lower atmosphere. The can both be spent on any technology in the entire tree. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say that the science system needs an overhaul!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFOR EXAMPLE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you should start out with solid boosters that get lower end ISP\u0027s. After some data on the rocket and how it flies is collected with instruments, It should open up options to develop improvements to those SRB\u0027s and, after some upper atmosphere science, open up the thrust tweakable and possibly liquid fuel rockets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system for getting new parts would be pretty complicated. The first step towards awesome parts is to send a probe with all the scanning parts to the celestial body you are interested in. Then, your scientists tell you the possible technological advancements and what to do to further progress toward them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFOR EXAMPLE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to improve armor plating then you might take samples of craters on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn for meteor chunks containing new metals. After you find a crater containing a new metal, you could take the samples back to Kerbin where you can initiate research on the utilization of those metals. The research would probably cost a significant sum of cash but, after completing it, you can equip your vehicles with this new and more advanced metal for a small amount of extra money per part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I don\u0027t know how the economical system will work, but I really hope that Squad makes some significant changes to science. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd what you think about science and how it should be changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T17:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience is more about gameplay than about realism.

Rocket Science. Materials Science. Science Science. Atmospheric Science... Dunno how many but I figure just keep making buckets until you\u0027ve covered all the bases. Then have experiments that get you those kinds of science, and achievements that do so as well. Get into orbit for the first time? You just earned yourself 10 rocket science points. Temperature reading on Mun? That\u0027s a bit of materials science and a bit of Science Science. Landed on Laythe? Atmospheric Science it is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen to unlock nodes you need a certain amount of each science bucket. So to get the Mainsail/Orange Tank node maybe you need 1000 Rocket science and 250 Materials science.

And the tech tree isn\u0027t just for noobs; I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a long time and I really enjoy how it shifts emphasis back to the smaller less powerful parts and designs. I agree that it doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense - IRL docking port technology is much more about mission priorities and gumption, not about physical science.
