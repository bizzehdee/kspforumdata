Its main purpose is to ferry kerbals, either from kerbin to LKO, or from LKO to wherever you want with refueling. With its twin nuclear engines, it\u0027s also very fuel efficient. In case you need to take off from other bodies, we have also provided you with an aerospike. Be warned though, we have not tested its SSTO capabilities on bodies where jets do not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, aside from its impressive status as a 4-seater, it also carries with it not one, not three, but TWO clamp-o-tron \u003Cstrong\u003Esr\u003C/strong\u003Es. This is not something that you often see on SSTOs due to its status as a 2m part, so in case your space station has a few of these big boys, this is your chance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: I like to call the wing tank-engine configuration the \u0022Nuclear Vortex Turbine\u0022.

Then pitch up and switch to rockets. Turn off aerospike once you reach around 1800 m/s to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Varyon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Varyon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy didn\u0027t I comment on this way back on the 12th?
