Would it be helpful for CLS itself to impliment and \u0022open hatch / close hatch\u0022 functionality for docking ports?

This way you can \u0022close the hatch\u0022 and then you know who is on which side of the hatch before you undock.

Here is how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you renamed a space, that space name is stored in each of the parts that make up the space. If you then undock, redock, close hatches etc, then the name of the new space will be the space name assigned to the first part that is discovered in that space, but each of the parts still have their own stored space name, so if you reconfigure your hatches / /docking etc then you should get your original spacenames back. Ask questions if that is not clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
