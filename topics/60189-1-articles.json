So you\u0027d need a gearbox if you want that prop to do something useful, just like normal turboprop. But otherwise, there is nothing really wrong with the idea. It\u0027s just that an extra compressor stage is going to be lighter and easier to make.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miracmert","CreatedById":67128,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T00:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I don\u0027t know if understood correct but I assume the question is about putting propeller blades on the front of jet engines. If that\u0027s the case, that pretty much useless because even though propellers are cheap and easy, there\u0027s a drawback about them. When you slow the engine down, propellers act just like a big circle shaped walls blocking the air so the aircraft slows down insanely. Also they are way, way bad at compressing air compared to jet compressors. However, there is an engine type called \u0022turboprop\u0022 that works like both propeller andgine and jet engine. There are propellers to lead air into air intake channels in the engine and there are turbines at the end of the engine. After intake air gets burned up with fuel inside combustion chambers it turns the turbines at the back which turn the propellers on the front. Still, turboprops engines have the same problem as propeller engines have that they are not good at airflow, making them poor aerodynamically. Jet engines don\u0027t have these problems since the compressors are already inside the engine and they don\u0027t block the airflow, also compressing the air much better then any of those props.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T02:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, this is probably stupid, but here\u0027s my idea.

Something to keep in mind though is that turbofan engines are already optimized for peak efficiency over their typical operating range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put things in perspective, a 747-400 has a fuel capacity of ~375 000 pounds. Compare that to the empty weight of 400 000 pounds and a useful payload (with full fuel) of only 100 000 pounds. Flying a 747 on a return flight from LA to Sydney will burn almost two full tanks of fuel costing close to half a million dollars. Whatever you save in fuel burn not only saves you money, but it also increases useful payload (because you have to carry less fuel to reach your destination and can carry payload instead). Fuel costs money and useful payload pays the bills, so clearly there is a huge incentive to increase the efficiency of engines. Engine/airframe manufacturers already do everything that is technologically possible to increase efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T03:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, this is probably stupid, but here\u0027s my idea.

This is the \u0022classic\u0022 jet engine where a series of blades compress air, which is then mixed with fuel and ignited. Then at the back, said air passes over some turbine blades that drive the compressor blades in the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in a turbojet, the first compressor blade is much larger than the other compressor blades. This is because this blade acts not only as a compressor, but also as a ducted fan, which is essentially a propeller with a casing. You will notice in the cutaway above that there is a large outer tube in the front. This is the \u0022bypass\u0022, air that is simply pushed through the tube by the compressor, driven by the central turbojet, creating thrust. In a lot of cases, even most of the thrust of the engine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is much more effecient use of the jet engine than a traditional turbojet, and it is much less noisy too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this was what you meant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T05:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think we are being trolled.
