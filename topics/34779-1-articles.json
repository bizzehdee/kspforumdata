A long succession of monarchs stretches back hundreds of years, some good, some bad. Today, in the modern United Kerbin, the King is still the head of State but the power of governance lies with Parliament and the Prime Minister, and the King remains only as a figurehead. Through the ages the Kingdom rose to become the greatest global power on Kerbin. Through the use of it\u0027s mighty navy, the Kingdom of United established colonies in many different foreign regions. These extensive trade routes brought wealth and resources back to the homeland, further accelerating the expansion of the Empire and the Kingdom\u0027s power. Through either weapons of force or economics the Kingdom of United Kerbin soon conquered almost all of the known world. \u0022The sun never set\u0027s on the Kerbin Empire,\u0022 was the phase of the day, and rightly so, as the Empire stretched across the world with colonies in every corner of the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kindgom of United Kerbin remained the dominate global power for centuries, but the inevitable decline was soon to come. The last century brought two global wars, in which modern machination and technology brought destruction and death tolls unseen in previous conflicts. Although victory came to United Kerbin in both world wars, it took a huge economic toll on the Empire. Stretched thin the Kingdom struggled to maintain the colonies and trade routes that had been the life blood of it power. Changing social attitudes also helped further push the decline of the Empire, with \u0022Imperialism\u0022 becoming a dirty word. Eventually bowing to pressure from both inside and outside the Empire, one by one each of the colonies were granted independence and formed new nations of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough not the global military force it once was, that power had shifted to it\u0027s allies across the ocean, the Kingdom still prospered in the post-war years establishing itself as a major financial and economic player on the world stage. The capital became one of the financial centers of the world, but this too would not last. Lax regulations and unchecked greed, at first brought wealth to the Kingdom, but these practices could not be sustained. Across the world banks collapsed, currency were devalued and trillions in wealth was lost. A global economic crisis followed. The coalition government of United Kerbin reacted with crippling austerity measures, aimed at saving the ailing economy. Much of the social services the people had come to rely on were eliminated, or had their funding drastically cut. Despite these efforts the economy continued to shrink, unemployment rose and soon the people had had enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew elections outed the former coalition government and saw the newly formed Kerbin Space Party elected to almost all seats of the House of Commons. The Kerbin Space Party, led by newly elected Prime Minister Ronfrey Kerman, campaigned on the sole promise of growing the economy by restoring the Kingdom of United Kerbin to the Empirial power it once was. Only this time the Empire would not be of colonies on Kerbin, but colonies in the stars. With the blessing of King Herbald the VI, and backed by the people, the newly created United Kerbin Space Agency was given limitless funding and charged with the task of colonizing space for the greater glory of the United Kerbin Empire!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientist and engineers were recruited from across the country and after a three week mail in course on rocketry, the UKSA was ready to begin their first mission...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T06:58:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 06:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OUScooby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OUScooby","CreatedById":66208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T00:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first task of any space agency is, simply put, to get stuff in the air. Not only into the air, but then out of it, out of the atmosphere, into space and into an orbit. To complete this first stepping stone on the way to an empire of space, the rocketeers set about building a satellite to put in orbit around Kerbin and a rocket to take it there. Things were all set to launch when someone pointed out that perhaps they should make this satellite somehow useful, and at the last minute the original payload of consisting of TV antennas duct taped to a pressure cooker, was swapped out for a radar topography array. Though most of the UKSA scientists did not understand how such a device worked, they though it sounded very \u0022scientificie\u0022 and agreed to go along with it. This new satellite would scan the surface of the planet with radar waves and create a detailed map of the planet, allowing them to replace their old out of date maps, drawn in crayons on the back of restaurant kids\u0027 menus, with new scientifically accurate maps.

With their flags planted the three crews boarded their Buggies and headed out on their mission to explore the remaining Munar anomalies.

The hill side proved too steep for the Buggy to drive back up and it began slowly slipping towards the hole. Bob, Bill \u0026amp; Jeb had to abandon their Buggy and jet pack away from the cliff. As the Buggy tumbled down into the hole they were able to catch a glimpse of the anomaly. A black monolith similar to the one discovered by Kerpollo 3 was mysteriously floating above this deep hole. With the Buggy destroyed and in pieces at the bottom of the hole, the Kerpollo 7 crew jetpacked back to the MMBM. Mission Control decided they would just write off the cost of the Buggy and not report it to their insurance company to avoid further rate increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5342/9438907262_2c7977f8ca_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229438907262_2c7977f8ca_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the opposite pole Kerpollo 9 was experiencing similar problems. Their satellite scanning revealed the anomaly was in the vicinity of another deep hole. They drove their Buggy all around the hole exploring for the anomaly. The upgrade to the new v0.21 software had a dramatic effect on controlling the Buggy giving more control over the buggy, should it begin to flip the crew could easily regain control before it rolled over and crashed. They were able to quickly traverse even the toughest terrain and even getting the Buggy airborne on a few occasions. In the end they were not able to find any anomalies so they planted their flag to mark the vicinity near it to mark it for possible future explorations and returned to the MMBM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3791/9436125757_ac9c4fe9f7_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229436125757_ac9c4fe9f7_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kerpollo 7 now without a Mun Buggy and Kerpollo 9 with no anomaly to explore, the two crews headed back for Kerbin.
