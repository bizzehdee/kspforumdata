I made a lander/rover to go to the mun to be a fuel tanker for kethane mining. I got the rig into a 100km orbit and began my transfer burn to the mun when I ran out of fuel in the ascent stage portion of the rocket as I expected when I separated to use my atomic engine and it would not burn, it showed as if it had no fuel but I was certain I had made it with all cross-feed capable parts. So I said \u0022no bother\u0022 \u0022I\u0027ll just use the rockets on the lander, 90* out, it will add a challenge\u0022 but after I separated from the atomic engine the rover began to spin uncontrollably. So I thought perhaps it was only due to the separation so I countered the rotation and watched it slow, but once I released control it began spinning faster. Then I figured the wheels on the rover were perhaps moving and causing some inertial spin so I carefully clicked each wheel and disabling the motor on them. Even still after this and disabling the reaction wheels on the command modules it was all to no avail, even the RCS couldn\u0027t completely stop the spinning. So how could I fix this.... You will see that I have attached the craft file and save file along with a rar with the mods I have installed. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. There is one battery part in there that isnt from a mod or part pack its one I edited. Its the 4k battery, I made it an 8k. sorry about the audio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyoutube video --\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9F7x63aE_A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink for game files - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23147727/slickit%20kerbal%20stuff.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23147727/slickit%20kerbal%20stuff.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-13T04:48:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2013 04:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Slickit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS on would\u0027ve helped reduce the spin - reactivate the reaction wheels in the probe core and hit T.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is it still spinning when you exit the game and reload?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slickit","CreatedById":71333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T02:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used the SAS to begin with and without RCS and it wasnt enough force to stop it unfortunately.

I\u0027ve heard reports that sometimes if you have parts clipped through one another, they can create phantom forces acting on your craft due to the way the game engine handles the physics calculations. I don\u0027t know if it still happens in later versions of the game, but the issue used to pop up infrequently at least a few months back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slickit","CreatedById":71333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T03:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei believe you may be correct. I just adjusted a few things on my design and re-launched it to test to see the spinning and sure enough it happened again. I made an action group to disable all motors and the extra control module for the little rover that sits in the back to troubleshoot more easily and even though I disabled all that it happened again and I couldn\u0027t control it. I decoupled the small rover off the back and the main rover stopped and the little one began spinning like a top. So I have at least narrowed down the problem to a very small and easily rebuild-able rover. I will remove it and test it with hack gravity to see if it produces those forces on its own but its good to know that I don\u0027t have to make the big rover over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slickit","CreatedById":71333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T03:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eanyone know how i can change the thread title to answered instead of unanswered??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T04:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit your first post.
