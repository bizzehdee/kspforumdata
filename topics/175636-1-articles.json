This is because the mods i run\u00A0 do not write much to\u00A0 the log, they don\u0027t need to\u00A0 as there\u0027s nothing wrong.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf however you have a messy install, run numerous incompatible mods, out of date or just rubbish mods, you can find that the game performance is slowed , as all these errors are written to the log, this can in a lot of cases result in\u00A0 the game slowing down, freezing , stuttering and numerous other issues .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO the question should be ,\u00A0 How can i make my log smaller?\u00A0 The answer to that is fairly simple,\u00A0 or not,\u00A0 find the errors in the log, identify the troubled mods , and fix /update/ or remove the offending item.\u00A0 Or quite simply use less mods per install,\u00A0 If you like doing things in space, have an install for your space mods, If you are a BDA fan for example\u00A0 have an install with all the weapon mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s not error related and the game runs fine, why worry , huge logs however , unless you\u0027re running a full realism overhaul setup\u00A0 with 10000 patches, tends to indicate a problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0027d like to ZIP up 1 of these huge logs and post a link, I\u0027ll take a look and see if it\u0027s a normal log, or something you should be concerned about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-05T23:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine is like 200 something MB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause i use a lot of incompatible ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thanks for your answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
