Explaining function calls and referring to directories or commands are the places I use it most; just now I wanted to answer a question and include the KSP install directory in a sentence,\u00A0like \u0060~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program/\u0060 .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, I\u0027d be able to select those inline statements and declare them as code.
