That\u0027s a huge difference! The whole point of the aerospike is that it is efficient at all altitudes, and it has failed in this variation! It is also supposed to be efficient anyway! I would suggest Isp of 335atm to 340vac, making it a little less efficient than the LV-909, like it originally was.
