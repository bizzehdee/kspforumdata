That\u0027s a huge difference! The whole point of the aerospike is that it is efficient at all altitudes, and it has failed in this variation! It is also supposed to be efficient anyway! I would suggest Isp of 335atm to 340vac, making it a little less efficient than the LV-909, like it originally was. It really should be built for Eve missions, right now it is way underspec\u0027d for that mission.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T01:12:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:37:50Z","Content":"Did you mean nerfed ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:26:07Z","Content":"Yeah ... same goes for the basic jet engine.

Your performance is always going to decrease, and quite sharply, as the ambient pressure increases. All an altitude-compensating nozzle does is let you have near (but not fully) optimal performance *at that pressure.* Want an example? Compare the toroidal aerospike J-2 derivative J-2T-250K to the SSME.\n\n[http://www.astronautix.com/engines/j2t250k.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/engines/j2t250k.htm)\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_main_engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_main_engine)\n\n1. A bell nozzle will always do better than an altitude-compensating nozzle at the bell\u0027s optimal altitude; however, *for the same cycle efficiency and chamber pressure* an altitude-compensating nozzle will do better at all other ambient pressures.\n\n2. Chamber pressure matters as much or more than nozzle design in high-pressure situations. Squad seems to have taken this onboard, with the (SSME-lookalike) 3.75 booster having slightly better SL Isp than the \u0027spike (although worse vacuum Isp).\n\nThat said, I do think the \u0027spike\u0027s vacuum Isp is a bit low. It should be more comparable to the LV-909 and KR-2L."}]}
