Now if all you want is to whip up a proof of concept for your own personal use using a Module Manager patch to create a \u0022New\u0022 part using a copy of an existing one as a base, that\u0027s fine. If you want to redistribute that patch even, that\u0027s fine. But if you want to ship a mod with models, textures, and complete parts; that\u0027s likely where you\u0027d run into trouble and need to create (Or commission; I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a number here who\u0027d be happy to make you models for some compensation) your own original assets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m going to be crystal clear; you absolutely should pursue this if you want.
