I\\\u0027m brand new to the forums, and the game itself. I thought I might as well say that I haven\\\u0027t bought the game yet but I already love it! I was wondering if the fps increases if you buy it? Or maybe there is a way to speed it up? Anyways I have some screenshots from my first orbit! These are pictures of the Foxtrot 1.0! I decided not to count the versions untill they got, well, usable. I found a Small spacecraft online made to orbit the \u0027Earth\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"closette","CreatedById":11773,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T06:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations on reaching orbit. The free version you are using (0.13.3) has fewer features and does not limit fps as far as I know. The paid version has many more features which might well end up producing a slower fps overall, depending on your system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI keep both versions (and a couple of intermediate ones) on my laptop\\\u0027s hard drive depending on whether I want to show a quick demo or do something more in-depth with all the features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice - feel free to ignore - is to play the free version up to being able to complete a Mun mission, before going for the more fully featured version, which by then you will both want and appreciate all the more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Da_Dumples","CreatedById":32594,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T07:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations.
