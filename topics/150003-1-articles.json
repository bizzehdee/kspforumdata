Not only would you have to keep track of how much credits you have, but you would also need to supply the resources to build your own parts using ore. You\u0027d start with a large deposit of ore to get you off the ground (no pun intended) but eventually you\u0027d need to start exporting ore to Kerbin in order to keep building space crafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFreelance\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis gamemode would be like career, however the amount of credits and science you get would be massively inflated. This would be a good gamemode to those who want less of a challenge and something more similar to sandbox mode, while still being able to collect science and gain reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERealistic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be different than just playing KSP on the hardest difficulty settings. While it would be equivalent of a career KSP save on hardest settings, it would have a few new challenges. The first one would be random failures, which was inspired by the random failures mod that existed a while ago (not sure if it is still being maintained). Failures would include explosions at launch (0.8% chance of happening per launch), jammed solar panels (5% chance of happening per panel), or broken science experiments (15% chance). In addition, there would also be orbital decay. This effect would be stronger depending on how close you are to the atmosphere of a planet. If you are not orbiting something with an atmosphere, then orbital decay would not happen. Finally. The average kerbal would be much more suspicious. By this, I mean that reputation would be very hard to earn, but incredibly easy to lose, even more so than it already is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-15T05:41:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2016 05:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T23:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeh.
