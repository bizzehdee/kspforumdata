You do not turn a plane using the rudder. If you want to turn left you roll the plane a little (or a lot, depending on how hard you inted to turn) to the left and then pull up gently. This is where the rudder is used, to prevent the plane from sideslipping toward the left too far since rolling to the left will make your nose slide to the lower left side. You can test how much your plane sideslips by switching off ASAS and rolling to one side, then watch what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the amount of vertical stabilizers you have sideslip should be very managable via control input.

I would recommend taking a finished craft file (doesen\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s one of the example crafts or from the spacecraft exchange here on the forum) of something that looks similar to a jet fighter craft and getting some practice with that. You will quickly notice that on most craft the rudder has very little authority when trying to steer, however depending on how well they are built you might be able to pull six or seven Gs when rolling ~75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and then pulling \u0022up\u0022 hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso angling your tail fins should not be a problem as long as you do not rotate them relative to your airflow.
