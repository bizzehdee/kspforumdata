As of now, we don\u0027t have a spacecraft management tool. What I\u0027m envisioning is a unified system that handles action groups, resource flows, and automated actions based on basic programming steps and triggers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an epic Laythe expedition mothership. It\u0027s a train, pulling multiple modules and fuel tanks behind its nuclear rocket puller. I\u0027ve built the thing in orbit through docking and want it to function as one ship. There are three things that I want this ship to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI want to set up certain fuel flow rules, because I was not able to put in fuel lines.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI want to get rid of empty tanks along the way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBefore I aerobrake through Jool and Laythe, I want all of my solar panels and antennae to stow via one action group and open via another.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interface for all of this is a well-lit model of the ship against a grey background (a \u0022cyber\u0022 VAB), henceforth referred to as the \u003Cstrong\u003EManager Window\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI filter for various types of part, such as fuel. All of my fuel tanks are now highlighted in green. I then tell tank 4 to flow into tank 3 into tank 2 into tank 1. Arrows appear, indicating the flow I\u0027ve now set up. I right click tank 4 and it asks me if I want to create a trigger. I say yes, and create a trigger based on the tank being empty. On the right of the screen, similar in structure to the staging diagram, a list appears. I click the docking port and drag it into this list at the \u00220\u0022 position. It gives me a couple of choices for the object (like action groups in the VAB). I select \u0022Undock.\u0022 I then title my list \u0022Jettison Tank 4\u0022 and add the comment \u0022Tank 4 is empty.\u0022 It goes into a small list in the top right. I exit the Manager Window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m doing my burn, when a notification pops up with \u0022Jettison Tank 4\u0022 or \u0022Cancel.\u0022 I click \u0022Jettison Tank 4,\u0022 and a docking port disengages, kicking the thing off the back, leaving me free to continue my burn and maneuver my ship without distraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in the Manager Window, I could access the action groups menu from the VAB. But now, it applies to the entire mothership. Using the filter tools, I select all of the solar panels. I then set up my new action group and am ready for aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Vic\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
