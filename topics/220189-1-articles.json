Knowing more about the atmosphere of Venus won\u2019t help us make better aircraft, and taking a surface sample from the North Pole of Mars won\u2019t help us make better shovels. One is scientific research, the other is engineering research. Any connection between space science discoveries and space engineering is indirect: engineering gets funded because people want to do science, and they want to do science because they care about the discoveries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single science currency is a decent abstraction of this. Discoveries get kerbaldom excited, which get them to invest effort into research that let them make more discoveries. You can imagine a whole society between your successful science experiment and unlocking a node: kerbal engineers got hyped about your visit to Duna\u2019s North Pole and help you design better landing legs for your next mission because they can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll discover there, wherever it is. It\u2019s just all abstracted out into science points and tech tree nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted, you could even add mechanics to flesh this out \u2014 like having different engineering research facilities you\u2019d have to invest in to unlock tiers in different kinds of engineering, and calling them Engineering Research Resources rather than Science Points. But I\u2019m not sure how fun that would be, which brings me to the second aspect, gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is all about designing and flying spaceships and using them to discover places. Anything that is not directly about that needs to be designed to support it rather than distract from it. If you want to add complexity to tech and science \u2014 like the different science currencies you\u2019re proposing, or the engineering minigame I sketched out above \u2014 their purpose should be to create and incentivize more varied and interesting gameplay. How does having different science currencies do that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I do think that KSP1\u2019s science leaves a lot to be desired and I really hope the new version won\u2019t land in \u201Cfly to biome, click button, fly back, repeat until tech tree is unlocked.\u201D However, I don\u2019t think the choice of science currency has much bearing on that at all, it\u2019s all about what the conditions for the experiments are and what kinds of missions you have to fly to get there. If we get more experiments like the surface ones in Breaking Ground where you had to do a series of things to complete the experiment, I will be happy \u2014 and if in some cases it won\u2019t be a simple success/failure but there will be degrees of success and ways to continue your mission to do more complicated things with your instruments, I will be downright delighted! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:happy:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022:happy:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-24T16:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224332923\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220189\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698146676\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHear hear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of discussion regarding the reveal of the upcoming science system, and I think a lot of the arguments are valid.

How does killing a guy with a pick axe teach you how to make a bow and arrow? Dunno, but it worked for Lara Croft. In Factorio, making ridiculous numbers of random items and then burning them in geodesic domes teaches you all kinds of things, from how to make better conveyor belts to how to make bullets to how to build a rocket ship. In D\u0026amp;D (and most any rpg be it pen/paper or computerized), the main way to improve yourself in EVERY WAY is to kill people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all these situations, the mechanic is always the same: Do the stuff that is the main reason you\u0027re playing the game, earn things that let you do that stuff .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP, it should be: Fly rockets, get stuff that makes flying rockets better/easier/more/whatever. An easy way to do that is to have us collect \u0022science points\u0022 that are somewhat limited and have interesting restrictions on how and where they can be collected, and those \u0022science points\u0022 can unlock either everything or a set of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s exactly what they did in KSP1, and that\u0027s exactly what they\u0027re doing in KSP2. It\u0027s how games work and it\u0027s (IMO) the right way to do it. The stuff that KSP1 got wrong was that there was no reward for doing original stuff (once you got a surface sample from Mun, the rest of the planets\u0027 surface samples are pretty much the same), and you had to click way too many things to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 seems to be fixing both of those.
