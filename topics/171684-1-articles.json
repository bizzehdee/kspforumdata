I took an interplanetary vessel with two landers -- one lander designed specifically\u00A0for Laythe and one Tylo-land-and-return staged multipurpose lander for the rest of the planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intended order of operations\u00A0was to land first at Laythe and return to the ship. Then, the Laythe lander could be jettisoned to reduce dry mass. Next, we would go to Tylo\u00A0and during landing and ascent from\u00A0we\u0027d stage away even more dry mass from the multipurpose lander. After rendezvous with the main ship we\u0027d go to Vall where we\u0027d refuel\u00A0and reuse the multipurpose lander. Bop and Pol would be like Vall. Then we\u0027d return home to Kerbin and be big darn heroes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe never made it home. We never even made it past Vall. My excitement of the success of the tested-only-on-Kerbin multipurpose lander after pulling off the\u00A0landing and return at Tylo and then Vall\u00A0got the better of me and I time accelerated\u00A0too fast enroute to Bop. We\u00A0got shot out of Jool\u0027s sphere of influence by an unexpected moon slingshot\u00A0before I had any idea what was going on, and by the time I could stop it we were too far with the last quicksave being before the Tylo landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne day I will return to Jool and each of\u00A0 its moons in one mission, and I will use this same profile. I think the engineering was proven on that first attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend launching your mothership with as little fuel in the tanks as possible to get into orbit. This will make it easier to get a very high delta-v capable mothership into orbit. Once in orbit, launch your lander(s) and\u00A0dock with the mothership. Lastly, launch as many refueling vessels as needed to top up your mothership/landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t speak to the necessary delta-v requirements for any part of the mission as things have changed a lot since my attempt. It\u0027s likely none of my designs would work today.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for lander engines, for Laythe you can pretty much use whatever you\u0027d use for Kerbin. For everything else you want engines with good vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, and for Tylo you want to make sure you have plenty\u00A0of thrust. Tylo is like landing on Kerbin\u00A0without anything but engines to get you down safely, but harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember exactly what my main vessel looked like, but I\u0027m pretty sure I used a puller style ship with engines in front to pull the fuel and landers as opposed to a more usual pusher design. It seemed to increase the stability of the vessel, especially when changing heading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck and welcome to the forums. It\u0027s a fun challenge and I\u0027m really looking forward to attempting it\u00A0again myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeronRocketry","CreatedById":186099,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-05T12:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all the great replies, everyone!

It\u0027ll give you a pretty good idea of how well everything will work. If your Laythe lander can land and take off to orbit there it should work on Laythe no problem. Be sure to test it\u0027s water landing and take off capability. Your Tylo lander will need to be capable of making a safe propulsive landing on Kerbin, but it needs to also be able of slowing itself down during desent without relying on atmospheric drag. If your Tylo lander can get\u00A0into orbit on Kerbin, it should be able to do the same on Tylo.
