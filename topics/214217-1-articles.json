I\u0027ve got KSP on steam just bought it, figured I\u0027d do this one before getting 2. Chatterer is the only mod I\u0027m trying to use. I downloaded using CurseForge and I can see the Chatterer folder in the correct Game Data folder and I\u0027m even able to open the Mod toolbar in game, but no noise. I need to be spoken to like I\u0027m 5 so I can figure this out. Help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"njwact","CreatedById":227173,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T17:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have figured out that there was the second Game Data folder installed but I still can\u0027t figure out how to get things configured correctly.
