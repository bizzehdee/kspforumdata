The point of this was not to discuss climate change itself, but in the event it happens and will not right itself over time short enough to be tolerable by humans, human intervention will be required to make it more of what we consider a tolerable climate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas like the giant space mirrors/shades, swinging a comet by our atmosphere to \u0027drag\u0027 off excess atmosphere, genetically modifying crops to use up or fix more CO2 etc are what the OP was after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was at such a stage that a natural cycle would not return it to normal, it would take the entire human race to right it again. Unfortunately some of the ideas will probably be unthinkable (or deemed unethical) at the moment but will probably appear more reasonable later. Alternatively some of the ideas that include eugenics, genocidal and anti-human rights paths and may become irrelevant as many people may starve and die in resource wars and civil disorder before we get to a point where \u0027irreversible\u0027 change takes place. So in fact we may not have to reduce the population actively because lots of people will die anyway. This is a very sad state of affairs in my opinion either way. I would not like to see anything like this, but as things change people panic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of things like eating less cows/livestock and converting to insects or agrarian sources of protein would help a long way. Also increasing density and public transport so we don\u0027t need to use cars and fossil fuels. I don\u0027t think high density living has a very good effect on personal and mental wellbeing (at least it doesn\u0027t for me) though so, but again these can only prevent further change. To actually cool a warming climate would be very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually all the things we will do unless you look at the causes of things. IF climate change is down to humans and CO2 and Methane and other greenhouse gases then we\u0027d need a way to reduce these in the atmosphere (and also production of these gasses). Fixing bacteria or artificial processing plants would need to be used, although these come with risks and would have to be on a grant scale. We could create polymers from the CO2 in the air, rather than digging it out of the ground?
