In all seriousness, in career mode spaceplanes (if designed and flown right) have the advantage of reducing overhead costs. For example, to launch a satellite in orbit, you would have to buy and throw away a launch vehicle. But with a spaceplane, you can take off from the runway, fly to the orbit you want the satellite in, simply decouple it from the cargo bay using a small docking port, and then return and land at the runway. The only thing you end up paying for is the fuel the spaceplane expended, you get reimbursed for the rest. Plus, the satellite itself is cheaper since you didn\u0027t have to put a small orbital maneuvering rocket and fuel tank on it to get that perfect orbit; and the satellite is usually is worth more than a second fuel load for the spaceplane, so if you take the time to recover it when its mission is complete, you get money back for the satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently inserted a small Scansat that consisted of nothing more than a probecore, a battery, a couple small solar panels, and a scanner in 250km polar orbit using a spaceplane.

A well-designed asparagus-staged rocket usually has a payload fraction of somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-18% give or take, this for a vehicle whose only parts might be recovered would be a portion of the payload (if that - if the payload is a satellite, you\u0027re not getting any money back for the parts at all). A crappily-designed transporter spaceplane will generally have a payload fraction around 25%, which is the figure I use when I design my planes. That particular lift vehicle can be recovered intact - you will recoup at least some of the cost of the parts when the plane lands (provided you don\u0027t botch the landing, of course); land it at the KSC runway or its environs and you\u0027ll get a 100% refund.
