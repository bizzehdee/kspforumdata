The vessel isnt misbalanced becasue nothing can misbalance it. It is 2 fuel tanks below a cockpit with a small engine beneath... any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T09:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour center of mass falls below your center of pressure and the aerodynamic forces push you over and make the part with more mass fly in front. The solution is adding draggy bits like fins at the verry bottom of the rocket to keep your center of pressure down and/or to add a second stage that will keep the center of mass somewhat at the top of your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T10:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso add wings to the bottom of your rocket, and/or add enough gimballing engines to keep control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, back off the throttle, the faster you go the higher the aerodynamic forces and the greater the drag on the upper parts of your rocket, causing a flip, I try to keep my acceleration to 2g\u0027s maximum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not some mysterious force by the way, it\u0027s lift and drag acting on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving to gameplay questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T11:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, back off the throttle, the faster you go the higher the aerodynamic forces and the greater the drag on the upper parts of your rocket, causing a flip, I try to keep my acceleration to 2g\u0027s maximum.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd bear in mind that the drag force spikes dramatically upwards when you pass Mach 1, which is around 340 m/s at Kerbin sea level. (If you notice that your rocket seems to fly just fine for a while and then suddenly wants to flip, that\u0027s likely why.) This is really bad not just for stability, but also for fuel efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo keep an eye on your speed, and don\u0027t let it climb much over 300 m/s until you get over 12 km or so. (And watch out for those wispy Mach shockwave F/X showing up... they do look cool, but they\u0027re not something you want to see unless you\u0027re flying a spaceplane.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
