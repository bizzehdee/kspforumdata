They\u0027ll pass Kerbals into a hull section where there\u0027s room for them, but they won\u0027t accept Kerbals into their own interior spaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hatch Door is supposed to have interior space for 3 Kerbals and the Airlock has room for 8. If you assign Kerbals to them in the VAB/SPH, then they can start there. But out in the field, if they exit that space for EVA, then the hatch/airlock will ONLY pass them directly to the interior hull space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - The Crew Manifest mod doesn\u0027t work to transfer them into/out of those spaces as it used to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example - if there\u0027s a 2x1 Hull section with a free seat, then using an airlock or Hatch to board will pass the Kerbal directly from the hatch/airlock to the interior space/seat, completely bypassing the airlock\u0027s interior. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - there\u0027s no way to move a Kerbal to a hatch or airlock from inside the crew hull section. Even with the Crew Manifest mod. If you click on \u0022EVA\u0022 in the Kerbal\u0027s portrait in the lower right corner, and the hull section doesn\u0027t have it\u0027s own integral door set up (via the swappable hull options) then it will \u0022pop\u0022 them out of the hull and bypass the hatch/airlock. In space they go tumbling until they right themselves with an EVA pack. On the ground, they just sprawl just outside the pod until you take control of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that if you have a full 2x1 pod with 3 Kerbals in it and assign any Kerbals in the VAB/SPH to hatch/airlock spaces, that they will start there, but if they EVA there will be no way for them to re-board! (Unless there\u0027s another hull section or pod nearby that they can enter). Stranded Kerbals are not a good thing. (Particularly if you\u0027re using a life support mod!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few screens for illustration: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have a full rover. 2 Kerbals in the cockpit section. 3 in the 2x1 cabin in the middle. There is one Hatch and one Airlock door. In addition to the Kerbals in the interior spaces, there was 1 Kerbal apiece assigned to the hatch and airlock doors in the SPH before the rover was loaded on the runway. In this screen the Kerbal assigned to the hatch door has just exited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o1hkXQz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o1hkXQz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeah Kerman is still inside the airlock door space. The 2x1 hull is still occupied with 3/3 Kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tPCVHZd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tPCVHZd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can click repeatedly to move a Kerbal from the 2x1 Hull to the Hatch door and nothing will happen.

Maybe the direct pass-through was intentional, as also possibly the removal of the interior space of the attachable doors. But the inability to use the airlocks or hatches from the inside properly can\u0027t be intentional. And if the interior spaces of the hatchs/airlocks were meant to be removed, then the documentation and interior space indicators need to be edited to reflect that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
