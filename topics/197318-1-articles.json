That is the lander and its interplanetary stage to get it to Eve. The lander was built in 4X symmetry around the central core. During ascent it flew true with out any hint of instability. Sure mechjeb did the leg work, but, even with mechjeb ive seen imbalances destroy the craft. On the bottom of the central core is an inflatable heat shield. When inflated it covered the whole craft. There was no hint at what was coming. During entry into Eve, it flipped. The crew capsule ended up on the leading end of things. No survivors. Reverted to a quick save, no survivors. Reverted again. Same thing as before, but, I was able to dump the capsule and save the crew, then reverted again. I wanted that lander to land. No dice. All tanks were fully fueled. No idea why it kept flipping.

Sure, you can use floats, but under the hood they\u0027re mostly integers with a decimal added at a specific position (which is encoded into the type, which makes float a little bit less efficient storage wise than int. 0 takes a little bit less space in RAM than 0.0 or 0.0000000000)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO, of course, you can decide that your sample size could be small enough that it does not really have an impact on game.
