I don\u0027t quite understand what you did....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe revert flight button is basically a quicksave, except said quicksave is only at the launch pad. Once you make and reload a quicksave, that becomes the first point where it (the flight/world) loads. If this bothers you, use alt-f5 to make a selectable quicksave at the launch pad named launch or something you can revert to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-31T03:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever used quicksaves, never had a problem with reverting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I wouldn\u0027t expect reverting to work after I\u0027ve left an active flight and gone back to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-31T03:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust get in the habit of making a named quicksave at each important milestone and you\u0027ll be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you may want to try out the saves in your backup folder off of your save folder.

It is from a time when you couldn\u0027t have multiple flights and when you exited your mission, your choice was to just end it, or end it and go back to the start. It probably could use a second look by the developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very least, I don\u0027t see why the game can\u0027t use the in-place backup/restore system to make a backup any time a craft is sent to the launch pad, and then allow you to revert to that event via the menus. For the one-and-done missions the function of the button would be the same except it would work even after you manually quicksaved/loaded during that mission. For others, it would always give you a known and significant milestone to which you could always quickload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut still nothing\u0027s stopping you from doing the above manually right now. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-31T07:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me it depends on what I am doing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an R\u0026amp;D save that I use for trying stuff out, and generally mucking about,\u00A0which allows reverts.\u00A0 Any \u0027serious\u0027 saves I disable revert, but i do leave quicksave enabled, as \u0027glitch insurance\u0027, but forget to use it anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-31T07:56:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2018 07:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OPPlayer11","CreatedById":194332,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-31T10:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell i the reason i had problems with it is because i quicksave at 10km incase something goes wrong but then i realized my 1 stage didnt have enough fuel so i wanted to revert flight but i couldnt because i had loaded a save i crashed (the ship) and was forced to open an earlier save (dont want to lose jeb do ve?) that didnt have the research and\u00A0 i had to get it back sure i couldve landed but still\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
