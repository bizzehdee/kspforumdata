As in, the thermal rocket nozzles (which in the lower temperature ranges used by a Microwave Beamed Power system would realistically be little more than a cheap, dumb metal cone that should cost almost nothing...) costing more than some entire rocket designs I\u0027ve built that can get small payloads into orbit in my Real Solar System 6.4x \u002B FAR \u002B RealFuels game...

The RSS 6.4x config also seems to be one of the less common configs to play with- but one I favor as it doesn\u0027t require any re-scaling of stock or mod parts for them to be balanced correctly, as most parts in KSP are at approximately 60-70% of real-life scale...

The main method I settled upon was a multiplier that scaled per MJ, additionally multiplied by power to weight. The price roughly intercepted the cost of an LVN for whatever reactor/nozzle combo was closest in performance. I wasn\u0027t too concerned with \u0022realism\u0022. (This was just for hardware, resource balance would come later.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy reasoning was thus: KSP doesn\u0027t have an actual market economy. There is a bounded rate by which you can gain funds, so unless you intend to players to perform some task to generate funds, which will need to be designed, all costs need to be reasonable within those bounds. With this is mind, the focus of funds to me should be about influencing player behavior. I had a lot of offers from people to trying to adjust costs based on real world values, which is ludicrous frankly. Are we talking dollars, euros, doubloons... There is no United Kerbal States with set budget for KSP funds. There is no stock exchange. The inputs the funds system are arbitrary. The outputs will always be just as arbitrary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, you will run into an issue where it becomes more cost effective to use higher tier reactors over lower tier reactors because the scaling is no linear. You will either have reactors that are entirely unreasonably priced for their performance or too expensive for the stock incomes to support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt just 10 funds per MW, the range is 150 (cheaper than an RTG) to 4.05M (the likely working budget for entire playthrough) funds. Dry cost. Before even considering resource costs. And before considering power to weight. This was one of many reasons that I linearized reactor outputs for kspil. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust something to keep in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevie_D","CreatedById":103007,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T15:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EObviously, these costs need to be more realistic than this if you want to have any kind of realism-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe said, when describing the act of buying a rocket fueled by microwave beamed power, to push along the aliens in the cockpit.

Your thoughts also mirror mine more or less exactly, with one exception...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by \u0022smaller per-unit cost\u0022? Are you suggesting that the smaller reactors, etc., should be cheaper for the power they provide? Since entry cost isn\u0027t really implemented into the game yet, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m in agreement with that... Plus, unless you\u0027re mass-producing the reactors (which is unlikely, on the tiny scale of demand of a space program) I can\u0027t see any reason why the smaller reactors would be more cost-effective...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, with regards to suggestions for balancing costs for 0.24.2/0.25, \u003Cstrong\u003EI *strongly* suggest paying careful attention to make sure the Microwave Beamed Power and In Situ Resource Utilization parts aren\u0027t overpriced.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile some of the advanced stuff like antimatter reactors and DT-Vista engines would likely be incredibly expensive in real life, and are desirable for the improved performance they allow; Microwave Beamed Power and ISRU work off technologies that have already been around for decades (or in the case of ISRU, over a century- many of the relevant chemical cycles were worked out and widely-utilized in the 1800\u0027s and around the the turn-of-the-century...), and one of the main attractions about using these technologies in real life is the cost-savings they enable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISRU, for instance, allows use of a moderately-priced chemical reaction chamber to save on use of a whole bunch of at least equally-expensive rocket engines and fuel tanks. Like with rocket engines (which are inherently cheap), the majority of the cost comes from the fact that the ISRU system has to work in space and on very narrow mass margins, rather than anything inherently expensive about the technology...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave Beamed Power, similarly, is attractive in real life for the cost-savings it offers- this time in the form of leaving the expensive parts on the ground (ground-based nuclear reactors and beamed power transmitters) rather than sending them up into space (chemical rocket engines or NERVA systems). The ground systems are quite expensive in real life, and should be in KSP-Interstellar as well, but the rectennas necessary to turn the beamed power into electrical power (power transmission on the other hand requires a gyrotron or magnetron- which is MUCH more expensive than a rectenna), or the thermal receivers to turn it directly into thermal energy, are both relatively cheap compared even to a rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual base technologies of Microwave Beamed Power are inherently more expensive that rocket engines, but the costs increase MUCH less steeply when scaling them to use space-quality materials and mass margins: resulting in a much cheaper rocket power/propulsion system than chemical rocket engines (although any electrical engines utilizing the beamed power will still be quite expensive). A space-grade thermal receiver (which contains no moving parts, and is basically just a pressure-fed heat exchanger built of microwave-absorptive materials: most likely semiconductors which can easily be made with some of the same technology/equipment as solar panels or circuit boards, according to current feasibility studies) is *MUCH* cheaper than a space-grade chemical rocket engine in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thermal rocket nozzle for a Microwave Beamed Power system is even simpler/cheaper than the receiver- it\u0027s little more that a hollow metal cone the thermal receiver\u0027s exhaust passes through (and the exhaust temperatures it has to withstand are in fact *lower* than those for the nozzle a chemical rocket- the superior ISP comes from the lower molecular mass, and thus higher velocity, of the exhaust gasses, not from the chamber/exhaust temperature; and superior TWR to chemical rockets can be obtained due to the potential for the thermal rocket to have at least 2-3 times higher fuel mass-flow rates with much lighter equipment than a turbopump-fed chemical rocket...) It annoyed me to no end that WaveFunctionP decided to make this relatively cheap/simple exhaust nozzle part more expensive than some of my RSS 6.4x orbit-capable rockets...
