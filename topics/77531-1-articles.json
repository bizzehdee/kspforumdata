There is a general consensus that the thing is hideous so nobody wants to make anything for it. But you can find mods with cockpits that try to mimic STS/Buran orbiters like the Mk3 does and look a lot better. Kerbal Shuttle Orbiter System, Component Space Shuttle, and B9 all have offerings that have the look. CSS is probably the most real looking to the Buran and STS shuttles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T22:36:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T00:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETouhou Torpedo had a Mk3 cockpit improvement pack, but he took all his packs offline.
