Strictly speaking there\u0027s no reason to rear-mount an OMS, other than to protect from the engine exhaust, or to mount a single engine. You just need them to be in line with the CoM on the roll axis, in order to ease maneuvering. So twin engines, mounted out- or inside the turboramjet nacelles, or quad engines over-and-under mounted on the TRJ pods would work well. Alternatively, given that the TRJs are for atmospheric flight, you can aerodynamically compensate for mounting those vertically off-center (esp. given that you need an angle of attack to generate lift), so if you mount the TRJs low and the OMS centerline, each engine should work for its intended regime.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeepSlayLP","CreatedById":122306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T13:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess it was a good suggestion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreakyHydra","CreatedById":118549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T16:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis this mods integrated in to community techtree ??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anister","CreatedById":66553,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T09:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutly gorgeous!

The only new partModule I found is the intake, the plugin code looks like the size should scale as an area. So I\u0027ll include it with an exponent of 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ETWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = OPTRamIntake\u003Cbr\u003E\tintakeSize = 2\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a \u0022compressor\u0022 dll, but I can\u0027t find any source code or part modules for it, so I suppose there is nothing more to scale.

If I recall, the drag model is gonna change in 1.0. I\u0027ve noticed that while using NEAR, the center of lift can bounce around while using your parts. Also, I think one part is SLIGHTLY unbalanced for lift while using NEAR. I didn\u0027t notice until now after I started using Pilot Assistant to help me with launch and landing profiles. Since I don\u0027t have to be hands-on as much, I actually had time to check vehicle stats and statuses. I noticed while using craft with the RAMJETs in pairs via mirrored radial attachment that my craft tend to have some minor yaw always applied. This became VERY obvious in one case where I was testing a craft and shut down all assistance (including stock SAS) to attempt to correct something. At the speed I was going, the natural yaw became VERY apparent and I had to keep correcting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reverted to the hangar to check and I noticed the CoL sphere was offset to the right a little. You wouldn\u0027t really notice unless you were looking for it and/or had the CoL overlapping the CoM/DCoM. I removed wing surfaces and go no change. Removing the Ramjets got the CoL properly centered. Messing with it allowed me to realized that the CoL could get very odd when placing the Ramjets. I was attaching it to Mk2 and your J hulls and saw that the CoL could jump suddenly at points rather than smoothly transition. KSP/NEAR doesn\u0027t seem to like the Ramjets for some reason. (KER doesn\u0027t seem to like the Ramjet mode either. I can\u0027t get proper dV measurements in the editor. Turbojet mode works though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, KSP v1.0 is bringing a lot of changes, so I\u0027ll have to wait and see. I do hope you plan to continue this mod because I adore the designs for it. (BTW, any chance of a J to dual 2.5m adapter? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
