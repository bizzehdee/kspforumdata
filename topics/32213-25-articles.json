I know that there are mods that try to replicate what this mod did, but I have yet to see a true successor that meets / met the quality of this mod. Combined with that fact, plus with how much memory 0.90 uses with just a stock install is enough for me to stick with 0.25. Hopefully when the next KSP release (hopefully another beta release if Squad is smart, but I doubt that...) drops, memory optimization will be much better. As it stands now, I\u0027m unable to run roughly 40% - 50% less mods than what I did in 0.25, and that\u0027s with aggressive ActiveTextureManagement and other game textures reduced to a quarter of their normal size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith how this game is built and with how long it\u0027s been out for purchase, mods make the game what it is. With the mods that are out there to run, I have limitless options for what I want to do, what parts I need, and what I want those parts to do; I can also completely change what a part was originally meant to do as well. The most useful tool KSP has, in my mind, is ModuleManager, and guess what, it\u0027s a mod made the community. Once you take away the ability to have more mods, you are effectively killing the replayability factor by a massive amount. I know not everyone has this problem, but I also know there has to be more people that feel this way due to the sheer size of the game\u0027s community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example of extremely small \u0022modding\u0022 is that I have the new MK3 parts that were introduced in 0.90 in my 0.25 game; all it takes is a few config edits and the models plus textures. If I see a mod that introduces more parts that I find interesting or just plain want, once again, just a few minor config changes and boom, it\u0027s working and usable in 0.25. I can do this because 0.25 has a decent amount of ram to play with unlike 0.90 that barely has enough room to allow two or three of the bigger mods this community has made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last statement, as said above, is hopefully the next release will fix the issues I currently have with the game, but, until then, I\u0027m sticking to 0.25. Or, the better option, Unity get\u0027s a stable 64bit and KSP is converted. I\u0027d prefer the latter, but I don\u0027t see it happening anytime soon. Until then, the first option will have to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gotcha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gotcha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei agree too... i need this mod to live !!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartCatalog can make it, don\u0027t let go!
