Look at the Space janitor one, but instead of being empty in the middle, have it setup so that the exterior tanks can rest on the munar surface, while the middle one is low enough so that the legs will grasp a command module perfectly. This would be very hard and require a ton of RCS thrusters and fuel, but it seems reasonable if you are that in need of a design. Hardest part would be to touch down slowly and to lift off with pure RCS, like I said you would need a lot. Another idea could use 2 craft \u0027docked\u0027 to one another with legs so the middle is facing downward to the surface like described before, and the second is a ring of sorts facing upward to make it easier to thrust upward. Just my thoughts, IDK if it would work or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-20T13:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022togfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022togfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI land a 2nd craft close by, use my imagination and it all end well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBahahahah I\\\u0027m sure that\\\u0027s how the Kerbs handle most of their missions shortly before crashing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-21T06:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Linchowlewy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Linchowlewy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made my first successful Munar landing, although I use the term successful with a heavy grain of salt.
