The units are chosen as-such in order to reduce the complexity of code KSP has to run- as KSP stores atmospheric pressure as fractional Kerbin sea-level pressure (where 101.325 kPa = 1 atm). This way KPS won\u0027t have to perform a unit-conversion every time it wants to calculate an engine\u0027s thrust in-atmosphere!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs for your concerns about Nozzle Efficiency before, NonWonderDog\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E- this can already *easily* be reflected in the numbers plugged into the formula. For a rocket with a Nozzle Efficiency less than 100%, you just plug an Exit Area Factor into the equation smaller than the physical size of the nozzle in square-meters * 101.325. This is a stealthy/clever way of reflecting that the Exhaust Pressure is actually higher than you would expect if you looked purely at the size of the exhaust nozzle and the amount of Thrust the engine produces in vacuum... Solution also works for intentionally highly over-expanded nozzles! (where the nozzle size/shape is actually used to SHIELD the exhaust-stream from some amount of atmospheric-compression)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that the Exit Area Factor here is *ONLY* used to calculate atmospheric-compression. This is *COMPLETELY* separate from the effects of exhaust nozzles on increasing Exhaust Velocity at the expense of Exhaust Pressure- which should already be reflected in the Vacuum ISP values chosen for that engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt *extremely* low Thrust and Exhaust Pressure values (where predicted atmospheric thrust starts to approach zero) this equation breaks down and starts under-estimate thrust production. However the only time this should be a problem in KSP is if you throttle an engine down to *EXTREMELY* low throttle values- which isn\u0027t possible in real life anyways, and in which case your engine really ought not to be functioning in the first place (the only \u0022deep-throttling\u0022 engines in real life are built for use on landers..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, but not least, this equation has the beneficial result of solving \u003Cstrong\u003Enot one but TWO\u003C/strong\u003E of your problems with how RealFuels currently calculates atmospheric thrust!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(1)\u003C/strong\u003E Atmospheric Thrust doesn\u0027t bottom-out at Kerbin sea-level pressure with this equation!
