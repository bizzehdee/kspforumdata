It was long thought to be a burning mass of coal in the sky, burning an unending supply of the flammable rocks. It is now known that the Sun, and all main sequence stars like it, do not burn fuel as much as they totally annihilate it through a process known as nuclear fusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoho: Moho is a dark world, and thus very difficult to see. In fact, it is usually invisible to the naked eye except under very particular circumstances. With its very dark surface absorbing a huge portion of the light that the sun throws at it, it glows brightly in the infrared. The dark crust is thought to be caused by high concentrations of carbon and iron oxide in its crust. If it had any atmosphere from volcanic activity or otherwise, it has likely long since evaporated away into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve: Eve is one of the brighter objects in the night sky. Its color seems to shift from orange to blue depending upon the time of year and the direction which it faces Kerbin, likely due to a dense atmosphere of light-scattering particles. Eve has no moons despite its high gravity. This is either because all of the potential moon candidates are too scared to orbit Eve for fear of being torn apart, or because Kerbin stole ALL the moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin: Kerbin is the only planet in the entire system that is confirmed to have life. It is a very warm planet due to tidal effects from its two large moons, as well as its relative closeness to the sun. The underground system of oceans acts as a cooling engine to keep the polar areas warmer and the equatorial areas cooler. The underground oceans are host to a huge cast of interesting creatures very much unlike the desert, grasslands, savanna, ocean surface, or deep sea life observed elsewhere. With no sunlight to power photosynthesis, the food chain of Kerbin\u0027s underground seas are based around thermal vents and chemosynthesis. Kerbin is home to the Kerbals, a group of brilliant, intelligent, foresight lacking marsupials who are doing their darndest to figure this whole \u0022universe\u0022 thing out. Kerbin is also orbited by three moons and a complex system of rings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus: The rings of Kerbin, known by many as the \u0022sky arches,\u0022 provide a fascinating astronomical view for anyone, any time of the day. They light up the night side of the planet, they darken the winters and brighten the summers. They are immensely beautiful. They are thought to have been created when a series of close encounters with a large near-Kerbin object found the object captured into a low orbit around Kerbin. Due to tidal effects and the gravitational interactions with the Mun and Dres, the object would have fallen towards Kerbin, before being torn up by Kerbin\u0027s gravity. The remnant of the original object is the very very dense object known as Minmus. Minmus helps keep the ring material together and stops it from falling in or being ejected. Minmus appears to be a very dense object coated in dirt and ring material. Its entire near side surface has been mapped by telescopic observations in greater detail than the larger and further Dres. It is a fairly homogenous surface of... well whatever the rings are made of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun: The most obvious moon of Kerbin in the sky, the aptly named Mun is a dry and dull brown moon born from the formation of the Kerbin system. Maps of the Mun seem to show large, straight cracks which are thought to be generated by ancient plate tectonics. The lack of any volcanic gasses and the appearance of the craters suggests that the Mun has little to no active vulcanism of any recent times. The craters are suspected not to be generated from volcanoes, but instead by impacts from asteroids over the eons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres: Dres is the largest and furthest moon of Kerbin. Telescopic observation suggests that it is covered in craters. No tectonic activity is apparent on its surface features, but its features are less visible than Mun\u0027s due to its distance from Kerbin. It is also darker than Mun, and is thus much more difficult to see during the daylight hours when the sky is bright blue. Dres and the Mun both seem to have anomalous histories. It seems unlikely that such large moons could have accreted from the same disc that formed Kerbin, nor that they could have been captured into orbit by Kerbin\u0027s gravity. Hypotheses made to explain this anomaly have been made:\u00A0ranging from the idea that Kerbin, Mun, and Dres are all figment\u0027s of Jool\u0027s imagination, to the idea that Mun and Dres used to be one large body in a lower orbit that got blasted in two by a large asteroid. Some crackpots have even proposed that, if the two moons prove to have similar compositions to Kerbin\u0027s crust and mantle, that the entire Kerbin system was formed from a single huge impact of two larger bodies after the formation of the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe: Laythe is a flat, featureless green-blue sphere. Spectroscopic analysis suggests that it is covered entirely by water, and it has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Since oxygen naturally bonds to other elements, it can not exist for long periods of time in a planetary atmosphere. It has to be constantly generated. There are three possibilities to explain this oxygen problem: Laythe has nanobots on its surface that exist purely to replicate more of itself\u00A0and the nanobots release oxygen as a waste product, Laythe has factories underwater separating oxygen and hydrogen from the ocean for fueling purposes, or Laythe has actual life in the oceans. The green ocean would seem to suggest the latter possibility. Space program funding to explore Laythe would be much higher if Laythe wasn\u0027t such a boring world from space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo: Tylo is a blue-grey planet in a binary orbit with its larger companion, Laythe. It is thought to be compositionally similar to the core of Laythe. Laythe\u0027s core is smaller than Tylo, but the huge mass of liquid water makes Laythe bigger in total. Tylo does not have any obvious impact craters, but then again it is very far away. If there turns out to be a lack of impact craters, Tylo might have active or recent volcanism or cryovolcanism. Spectroscopic analysis of its terrain indicates it is rich in metallic ores on the surface, with areas of icy mountains rising above the metallic surface. The ice is thought to be the leftovers from whatever water Laythe didn\u0027t eat up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool: Jool is the largest planet in the solar system. It is thought to be a world made entirely of gasses, with only a small rock/ice core at the center.\u00A0The brown, white and red cloud bands are a remarkable sight, even if they are blurry through a telescope. Jool is thought to be a fascinating look at what a failed star looks like. Despite the lack of nuclear fusion in its core, it does seem to be a very successful planet, on account of the fact that it represents over 90% of the system\u0027s mass outside of the Sun itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna: Duna is a large moon in a low orbit around the massive planet Jool. Duna is one of the objects which was presented as evidence that the whole universe doesn\u0027t revolve around Kerbin, only the larger moons did. Duna is thought to be volcanic due to tidal interactions with Jool and the other major moons of the planet, but it may turn out to be geologically dead and barren much like Mun. The first astronomer to observe Duna was locked up in his house for unrelated reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke: Ike is the second moon of Jool. It is dimmer than the brighter Duna and Vall, which could mean it is either small or dark in color (or both). It is thought to be made out of rock and ice, and was probably formed around the same time as Jool itself. Ike was discovered significantly later than Duna and Bop, presumably because its discoverer was the only astronomer of the Joolwatcher\u0027s Club that hadn\u0027t burned their eyes out trying to look at the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBop: Bop is a large brown moon orbiting Jool. It is one of the brighter objects near Jool, and can usually be seen in a nearly straight line compared to Duna and Jool. This was the first hint that something interesting was going on with the strange arrangement of stars in the background whenever someone tried to take a nice picture of Jool to hang in the office. For this reason, Bop is named after the ancient Kerbal god of photobombing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall: Vall is a moon in a distant and irregular orbit around Jupiter. Unlike the other irregular satellites of Jool, Vall is quite large. Vall is the brightest moon of Jool visible, on account of its bright white ices covering its surface. Vall\u0027s mass was calculated roughly based upon calculations of how it interacts and perturbs the inner moons and Jool itself. To her astonishment, the astronomer who made the discovery found that Vall was much denser than it should be. This, coupled with Vall\u0027s high reflectivity, seems to suggest that Vall is actually a gold-rich core covered in a thick coating of snow and ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo: Eeloo is the seventh planet from the sun. It is in many respects like a frozen version of Laythe. It is mostly composed of water ice and dirt, and telescopic observation shows some barely visible brown circles on its map, likely caused by impacts. There is a high possibility that Eeloo might have an ocean of liquid water underneath its icy crust. However, so far out from the sun, Eeloo gets virtually no heat energy. Any life-supporting energy must be generated by internal geological processes. Eeloo was the first planet ever to be discovered, as every other planet was known since antiquity. When Eeloo was first discovered, the astronomer in charge was very skeptical about the possibility that this object was a planet. She was, after all, the first person who had ever discovered a planet. No one ever knew that there were planets outside those that had already been discovered, but nonetheless Eeloo was proven to orbit the sun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol: Pol is a tiny moon orbiting Eeloo. It is much darker and much smaller than Eeloo, and was very difficult to detect. The moon was only recently discovered by an intern at the tracking station of the Kerbal Astronomical Society. The astronomer in charge didn\u0027t believe that the poor intern had actually discovered a moon, and joking referred to the moon as \u0022Pol\u0022 which is the Kerbal god of stupidity. Unfortunately the name stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly: Gilly is a mysterious, rocky object orbiting the sun in an orbit that crosses the planets Laythe and Tylo through Eeloo.\u00A0It was first thought to be a comet, except it didn\u0027t display any trails or flares when it approaches the sun, and its mass estimates kept going up and up and up. It is now thought to be an extremely dense object made from totally different compounds and materials from the origin of our own solar system. The strange orbit it has would seem to corroborate this idea, as it appears to be an object that was captured into solar orbit after flying through many lightyears of interstellar space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiber9","CreatedById":144299,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T02:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222581266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022120111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463235386\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133436\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Therlun\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/14/2016 at 10:16 AM, Therlun said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used a probe trying to land on Eve and it exploded due to overheating when it touched Eve\u0027s ocean surface (or a few meters above at most) while descending at 6m/s with a parachute.
