So far I\u0027ve tried crafts powered by jet engines. They work but they are inefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve noticed that if you submerge tail fins they will work as rudders. Can similar logic be applied to propellers? Could a propeller be constructed out of wing parts and such?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible to use stock liquid fuel or electric propellers underwater? If so, what would be the best settings in terms of angle, rpm etc? Do they need to be adjusted for the weight of the craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried to find tutorials on this but only results that come up relate to airplane propellers. If anyone\u0027s researched this subject and has some know-how to share I\u0027d be very grateful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-05T20:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use stock aerodynamic parts (wings or elevons) to make propellers for a ship or submarine. The actual propeller parts from the breaking ground dlc do not work in the water, but using elevons on the rotors works well. You can even change their deployment angle to adjust their performance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to use mods, you can use the engine parts from the life aquatic. They need a water intake and electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-05T23:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMOIST! by Jatwaa is another mod pack that adds water engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
