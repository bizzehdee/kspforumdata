There are those who believe things like life support should be in the stock game, while others think that would be no fun, and I can see the merits of both views. The best way would be to simply have difficulty options, set when a save is created. A fresh install should make the game as easy as possible, so new players are not overwhelmed. Seasoned players can breathe new life into the game by turning on the difficulty options. Players already do that by installing mods, as I did. Players generally hope their favorite mods are adapted into the final version anyways.

I would counter-point, however, that it seems very common for \u0022newbies\u0022 to be using mods, and to help diagnose problems, we currently have to ask \u0022what mods are you using?\u0022. If we had these \u0022physics options\u0022, we would instead just be asking \u0022what mods are you using \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E what options do you have active\u0022.

They weren\u0027t interested in having a single difficulty setting, but rather having certain options that could be turned on or off. Reentry heat and life support are two of the things that they discussed that, if implemented, could be disabled this way. Yes, there\u0027s a lot of if/could type words there, I wouldn\u0027t count on both making it into the stock game. In fact, the only time they discussed life support favorably, they were also talking about resource mining, so I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if no resources means no life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022hassle\u0022 of having to set a bunch of options, I don\u0027t see it that way if done well. First, at worst, you\u0027d only have to deal with them when you create a save file or want to alter the settings. I probably create one or two save files a week at most, except for the week a new version comes out. Second, most games I play that have these kinds of settings instead of a strict difficulty setting give you two or three buttons, one for a game with default settings, one for a game with the previous settings, and one for \u0022OK, let me specify everything.\u0022 Since we don\u0027t currently have to reset key bindings, audio settings, etc. every time we create a save file, I don\u0027t see why we would assume that the difficulty settings couldn\u0027t be persistent either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T22:06:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs per the aerodynamics model: I only recently started using FAR, so I don\u0027t have a lot of experience with it.

I\u0027ve launched my fair share of monstrosities with FAR enabled. At the worst case, it usually involved a lower TWR and/or some extra delta-v so I could take things slow. To me, FAR feels more like it\u0027s about rewarding doing it right than punishing doing it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m in favor of being able to turn reentry heat or life support on or off as an option, but not better aerodynamics. In the former two cases, it\u0027s strictly disabling some functionality. With aerodynamics, you\u0027re switching between functionality. Or to put it another way, reentry heat probably means you add a heat shield. Life support might mean adding storage for life support resources. Changing the way aerodynamics works means potentially undoing something in order to make it work differently. So it\u0027s the difference between learning new things and unlearning bad habits combined with learning new things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
