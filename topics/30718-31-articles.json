Six grey packs full of loose, damp earth stood in a neat row by his feet, each divided into six chambers by thin wooden tubes driven into the soil. Beside them, a knife, a soft round-headed brush and a shallow bowl of cinnamon-scented, watery green paste were arranged on a square of canvas, next to a heap of small dark grey drawstring bags. He wedged his notebook under the bowl, picked up the knife and grasped the Kerm branch between finger and trembling thumb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOnly take cuttings from the first two rings of branches. Cut straight across, below a leaf node.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely stared fixedly at his hands, willing them to stop shaking. Then, cautiously, he placed his knife against the branch and pressed. The blade slid easily through the thin bark and tender green wood, leaving him holding a slender shoot tipped with small, furry green leaves. For a moment he cradled it in his hands, like a new father presented with his first kerblet, then pushed it gently into the first pack of earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPaint the branch stump with a thin coat of leaf paste. Place bag over the end and tie. Do not allow bag to touch the paste.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stump greedily soaked up the paste, turning the exposed, creamy-white wood a delicate shade of green, thickly speckled with darker fragments of leaf mash. Enely examined it curiously, peering at the ring of darker green just under the bark. He picked up one of the grey bags and, turning away from the Kerm, shook it vigorously, dislodging a thin cloud of charcoal dust. Slipping the bag over the branch stump, he pulled the drawstring tight, knotted it and stepped back to inspect his work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell I think that looks right. It had better be - nowhere near enough spare branches to try this again. Best take the next one from the opposite side.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking the second cutting took rather less time than taking the first and by the time he\u0027d tied down the straps on the second pack, Enely had settled into a steady routine of slicing, painting and bagging. He flexed his fingers, working the tension out of his cramped knuckles, then picked up his knife and went back to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive finished packs later, the Kerm sapling appeared to be suffering from a peculiarly regular fungus, with dark swellings extending from each of its lower branches. Enely pressed his brush against the raw end of the last branch, squeezing out every last trace of leaf paste from its splayed bristles. He scraped out the bowl, chasing down the last few fragments of leaf and painted them over a bare patch of wood. He fumbled the last grey bag into place, pushed the final cutting into its pack and stood up, digging his thumbs into the small of his back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach of the five kerbals silently watching him work stepped forward and hoisted a pack onto their shoulders. Enely picked up his own pack and looked at them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does everybody know where they\u0027re going?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe do, Keeper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely knelt down and stretched his arms out towards his companions in the traditional gesture of benediction. \u201CThen go, my friends. And may all our saplings flourish.\u0022 He climbed to his feet and watched his companions spread out through the village, each heading in his or her own direction. He shrugged his pack into a more comfortable place on his shoulders and set off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe village had grown in the months since landing, although the need to ship most of the raw materials over from the Wakiran mainland had made for slow progress. Nevertheless, neat stone and slate buildings were gradually replacing the original, temporary, shelters which, one by one, were being dismantled and used for spare parts. Newly marked out fields stretched out in all directions, carpeted in quick growing clover. Eventually, Enely knew, the fields would be protected from the salt winds by a barrier of sturdy dwarf pines, although right now, the planned windbreak was only visible from the village if you had a pair of binoculars and a good idea of where to look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreen and white pennants snapped in the breeze, each emblazoned with a stylised Kerm tree growing out a ring of thirty-six stars. Groups of kerbals bustled about, setting up awnings and bunting or heaving trestle tables and benches into place. One awning had been converted into an outdoor kitchen which was already occupied by a large knot of kerbals dressed in traditional leather aprons and hard at work wrapping mounds of tubers in metal foil, chopping vegetables into large flat-bottomed pots and preparing deep trays of layered pastry, dried fruit and wrinkled, sliced apples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the cooks waved his spoon threateningly at a pair of young kerbals who\u0027d strayed suspiciously close to one of the trays. Enely smiled as a pair of apples sailed through the air and were neatly caught by the two would-be plunderers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the outskirts of the village a gang of kerbals stood around a long rectangular pit, watching a truck cautiously backing up to it. No sooner had it stopped when two of the kerbals, both wearing heavy boots and gloves, scrambled onto the back trailer and began shovelling out smoking black sand. The others gathered round and started scraping the hot volcanic ash into the pit. One of them waved at Enely as he walked past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot as good as desert sand but it\u0027ll make a sathy enough fire pit! You going to lend us a hand, Keeper?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely grinned and jerked his thumb over his shoulder. \u201CI won\u0027 be much use with only a trowel,\u0022 he said, \u201Cbut get me a shovel and I\u0027ll be right back after the planting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe marker post and bright red water bucket stood out clearly against the dark, gritty soil. Enely knelt down and scraped out a rough bowl with his trowel, carefully filling it with earth from his pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECut end down.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pushed the Kerm cutting into the soft soil, probing gently for the harder packed ground beneath. Mentally crossing his fingers, he pulled out the cutting, sprinkled two handfuls of soil into the hole it left behind and replaced it. Carefully, he tamped down the earth around the cutting, then poured the water all around it. Finally, he took a slim wooden tube out of his pack, slipped it over the Kerm and drove it firmly into the damp soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOne down, five more to go.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely picked up the empty bucket and set off for the next marker post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-116-blackout/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2188964\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 51\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-116-blackout/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2250259\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 53\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-29T14:37:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2020 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T15:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA good indication that a new chapter will be posted is when I stop checking for new chapters on a daily basis - as soon as I slack for a few days ... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T09:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022\u003E Better not keep you waiting for the next one then...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTinny music rattled around the Rockomax Mission Control room as Nelton watched the bouncing, swaying figures on the main screen with an equal mix of amusement and exasperation. The irritatingly chirpy blend of drums and synthesisers faded briefly, spiked to a loud and sudden peak and then cut out. One of the figures struck a dramatic, if cramped, one-handed pose, his other hand still firmly clamped around the frame of his acceleration couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeahhh!

All three kerbonauts watched the flight clock intently; Kerke uncaging the manual ignition button, hand hovering over it as they waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTen seconds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFive...four...three...two...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe service module engine lit, pushing Seanan back onto and then firmly into, his couch. \u0022Uhh - getting some transients here. Going to secondary.... no hold that, we\u0027re good. Pressures coming up...okay coming up nicely now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Delta-P?\u0022 asked Kerke sharply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Spiked for a second but balancing,\u0022 said Seanan. \u0022Chamber pressure back between the lines and holding.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke nodded tersely, eyes focused on his instruments. Grey light spilled through the capsule window, throwing unseen shadows across his chest. Beside him, Seanan and Barrie were breathing heavily, unaccustomed to their sudden weight after over three days in free-fall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chamber pressure...\u00A0holding. Propellant levels are good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke reached for the engine shutdown button. \u201CThirty seconds to go. Twenty...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe service module engine roared silently in the vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree...two...one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShutdown!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie\u0027s fingers raced over her computer keyboard. \u201CDelta-v is low but we have an orbit! One-eleven by three-five-five!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And thank the Kerm for that.\u0022 Seanan mopped his forehead with his flight suit sleeve. \u0022Thought we were in trouble there for a minute.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie shook her head. \u0022One hundred and eleven kilometres away after travelling over four hundred thousand kilometres to get here. I thought Pioneer 1 was cutting it close but...Kerm, the trajectory team are on their game today.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke grimaced. \u0022Apoapsis is high. Not surprising after that burn but we\u0027ll need to compensate at circularisation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shouldn\u0027t be a problem,\u0022 said Barrie, \u201CWe\u0027ve got the fuel for it. I can compute a correction burn if you like but I imagine Mission Control will want to run the numbers themselves. All the important burns are farside on this flight. Works for me - we get a chance to fix any screw-ups before Nelton gets to see them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not until Foxham have had a chance to look at that engine we don\u0027t,\u0022 said Kerke heavily. \u201CI didn\u0027t like that start-up at all. This was supposed to be our sightseeing orbit anyway, so lets use it for that.\u0022 He took hold of the attitude controls and eased \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 3\u003C/em\u003E into a slow roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan tipped his head to one side, blinking at the streaks of grey sliding past the capsule window. He moved a little closer, trying to ignore the reflected lights from the instrument panel, peering \u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E the window rather than at it. Then suddenly, perspective twisted and, like seeing the hidden image in an optical illusion for the first time, he found himself looking \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E at a landscape unlike anything on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh sweet...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Craters upon craters upon craters...\u0022 Barrie whispered in awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then some more craters on top of those,\u0022 said Kerke, \u0022Can\u0027t see what else those speckles would be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Boulders?\u0022 suggested Seanan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerm - I hope not. Rocks that we can see from orbit are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E what we need anywhere near the landing site.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hard to tell with the sunlight at this angle,\u0022 Barrie noted. She squinted out of the window. \u0022Is it just me or are you guys seeing colours down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just looks grey to me,\u0022 said Seanan. \u0022Well, lots of different greys.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No - I see them too,\u0022 said Kerke, \u0022Very faint tans and golds and pale pinks. Near the horizon and around the crater edges mainly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan knocked on the window. \u0022These are pretty thick - they\u0027re probably just distorting the view.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke shook his head. \u0022Too subtle for that. Maybe something to do with contrast - I don\u0027t know. Kinda pretty though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whirring fans and muted gurgles from the depths of the life support systems provided a reassuringly homely backdrop to the stark vista of greys, black and washed out, translucent pastels unrolling beneath them. The three kerbonauts watched the Munar landscape drift past, each of them lost in his or her own thoughts. Occasionally, out of ingrained habit, Kerke scanned the advisory panels in front of the commander\u0027s station for warning lights before turning back to the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan stirred. \u0022Still not seeing any gold or tan out there,\u0022 he said quietly, \u0022but I am getting some blue.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sliver of azure light crested the horizon, swelling rapidly into a gleaming blue hemisphere, streaked and whorled with iridescent white. Reluctantly, Kerke dragged his gaze away and switched on the radio. The crackling static shook Seanan out of his contemplation. He tapped a rapt Barrie on the shoulder on the way back to his couch, managing a credible impersonation of Nelton\u0027s clipped tones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Playtime\u0027s over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroken fragments of words surfaced from the static as \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 3\u003C/em\u003E soared out from the Munar farside. Barrie frowned. \u0022Getting a lot of noise still on high gain one. Switching antennas.\u0022 She reached forward and clicked a switch on her panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022F...ght to...eer 3. Co...in Pione... Fli... to Pioneer 3. Come in Pioneer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pioneer 3, Flight. Receiving you loud and clear on high gain two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton\u0027s reply was drowned out by the storm of cheers in the background. The kerbonauts winced at the heavy thud from the speaker, followed by a muffled voice shouting over the noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Pioneer - good to have you back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke grinned. \u0022Good to be on the noisy side of the Mun again, Flight.\u0022 The grin disappeared. \u0022Please be advised that MOI was off-nominal, we\u0027re seeing a three-five-five apoapsis - requesting update for circularisation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSay again, Pioneer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe had a hard SME start, Flight. Recovered before we could switch to secondary valves but still gave us an under-burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood, Pioneer. Propulsion are on it. Flight dynamics are waiting for the tracking data but we\u0027ll get a circularisation update to you once they have a good trajectory fix. Suggest you start the landmark tracking on this orbit whilst we work this, and we\u0027ll set up for circularisation on orbit 3.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sounds good, Flight. Can\u0027t say we were paying much attention to the timings on that last orbit but the major craters all seemed to be in the right place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t want to see the expression on the boss\u0027s face right now, Pioneer,\u0022 Nelton said dryly. \u0022On a different note, CapSys is on-loop and ready with a troubleshooting procedure for high-gain one. Please switch to loop B and stand by.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Two minutes to loss of signal. Propulsion have got Barkton on the line, working the under-burn with them. Don\u0027t worry guys - we\u0027ll have an answer for you on the next orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We know you will,\u0022 Kerke answered, \u0022Thanks, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe received a grunt in reply. \u0022Thirty seconds. See you on the next pass, Pioneer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio fuzzed into static. Kerke stared at it for a moment before clicking it off. He looked up at the ripping, tearing noise from across the capsule. Silently, Barrie held up her Kerb Kerman mascot before stowing it under her seat. Kerke opened his mouth to speak but thought better of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027ll work something out,\u0022 said Seanan quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, we\u0027ll get home,\u0022 said Kerke. \u0022One of those valve sets should still be good and if they\u0027re not, we\u0027ve got the lander lifeboat drill.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not what we had in mind for it though,\u0022 said Seanan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 Kerke agreed. He shook himself. \u0022Right - if this is gonna be our last orbit, lets make it a good one. Least we can save the next team some camera time. Barrie, give me an attitude check. Seanan - unstow that camera again and get yourself to a window.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Say again, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We want you to split the circularisation burn into two. Guidance is standing by with the burn numbers and TKI updates for the next four orbits. You\u0027ll fire each half on a different valve set - if both sets are green then the rest of the flight is a Go. One stuck set and we\u0027ll bring you home on the next orbit. Two stuck sets and we\u0027ll bring you home in the lander lifeboat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mode five if we get a stuck-on?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s affirmative, Pioneer. Better get that lander warmed up and checked out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On it, Flight.\u0022 Seanan pushed away from the window and, with a deft assist from his couch frame, swung down into the equipment storage bay. Bracing himself against a nearby handhold, he took hold of the hatch lever. \u0022Unsealing hatch!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lever pivoted smoothly - far more smoothly than Seanan was expecting - and the locking bolts withdrew with a heavy clunk and a brief whoosh of equalising air pressures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cabin pressure holding, Seanan. Go ahead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan lifted the hatch out of the way and poked his head cautiously through the opening. \u0022Woah - better take this feet first. Don\u0027t want to kick anything important, squirming around down there.\u0022 He tucked himself into a ball and slowly spun over in a half somersault, grinning as he extended his legs and slowed his rotation almost to a halt. \u003Cem\u003EGotta conserve that angular momentum!\u003C/em\u003E He eased himself forward through the hatchway and then down into another world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay - I\u0027m in. I see what the Pioneer 2 gang were talking about now - that orientation shift is \u003Cem\u003Eweird\u003C/em\u003E. Those hose clips were a good idea too - wouldn\u0027t fancy having them flapping around me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan shuffled his feet firmly into their restraining straps on the lander floor. Then he bent down and plugged his suit umbilical into its socket. \u0022Okay - ready for my hat and gloves. How\u0027s that pressure looking?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Holding, Seanan. Catch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA spacesuit helmet fell slowly towards him through the hatch. Seanan caught it, checked that both gloves were inside and placed it by his feet. A shadow passed over his head, followed by the soft clank of the hatch settling against its stops. \u003Cem\u003EFirst things first.\u003C/em\u003E He clicked his microphone on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pioneer 3 to Barrie. Requesting comms check.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hear you, Pioneer. How do you read, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Loud and clear, Barrie, Pioneer. Copying no movement on your cabin pressure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan checked the circuit breaker panel before cautiously flipping a series of switches. Section by section, the instrument panel came to life, indicator lamps lighting up, dials swinging over and electroluminescent panels glowing soft green. He flipped a second set of switches, pausing occasionally to study his checklist. \u0022Okay. Drawing power from main buses. Lander batteries full and trickle charging. Evaporators look good. Bringing up the guidance systems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe computer screen - a duplicate of Barrie\u0027s screen up in the crew module - and the keyboard beneath it, both lit up. Seanan tapped out a sequence of commands, watching a row of indicator lights flicker and then settle. \u0022Guidance data transferred from CSM systems. Give me an attitude read please, Barrie.\u0022 He listened to the string of numbers coming over his headset then tapped a key. \u0022Transfer confirmed and saved. How are we doing for time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fine\u0022 said Kerke, leaning down through the now open hatchway. \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E checks are scrubbed unless we get the good word from Nelton; environmental and life-support we\u0027ll either pick up after circularisation 1 or catch during the lander separation prep. Time to get that hatch back in place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On my way.\u0022 Seanan extricated himself from the lander systems and carefully kicked off for the open hatchway. Emerging into the capsule, he wrestled the hatch into place and heaved the locking lever closed. \u0022Ready for pressure test!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke reached over to Seanan\u0027s side of the instrument panel and flipped a toggle switch. Over his head, two fans started up, blowing a cool, slightly rubbery smelling breeze into the capsule. \u0022Cabin overpressure at 5%...10%...and holding at 15%.\u0022 He flipped the switch back and the fans fell silent, as Seanan scrambled into his couch beside him. \u0022Okay, Flight - are you seeing this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are, Pioneer. If the pressure holds, CapSys advises to vent before loss of signal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood, Flight. Burn program for circularisation 1 is loaded, readbacks confirmed for circularisation 2 and TKI updates.\u0022 Kerke paused. \u0022Looks like we\u0027re on the plan, Flight - please pass along our thanks to everyone for sweating the details.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Pioneer - we\u0027d do it all again. CapSys tells me that the cabin pressure is holding but wants to keep an eye on it for a bit longer yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPioneer 3\u003C/em\u003E sailed silently over the near side of the M\u00FCn, the paired spacecraft gleaming in Kerbol\u0027s full, unfiltered glare. The geometric simplicity of the capsule and service module contrasted starkly with the boxy, cobbled-together appearance of the M\u00FCn lander it was joined to. Four plumes of vapour jetted out from around the join, freezing instantly into sparkling motes that swiftly dissipated in the vacuum. Minutes later, the spacecraft slipped around the curve of the M\u00FCn and disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlone above the Munar craters, the spacecraft edged into position. Its main engine fired, slowing it fractionally, lowering its orbit. Coded bursts of radio waves flashed across the void as the spacecraft swung around the near side of the M\u00FCn, its crew momentarily back in touch with their home planet. Then, once again, it slipped into the shadow of the M\u00FCn and disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the capsule, the crew were silent, strapped stiffly to their couches, eyes fixed on their instruments. A blue light flashed; a green finger pushed a button in response. Exactly fifty-four seconds seconds later flames vented from the spacecraft thrusters and then precisely six seconds after that, valves snapped open allowing volatile liquids to mix and erupt in a fiery torrent. The spacecraft slowed again and the torrent ceased; its end as swift and certain as its beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was beautiful, Flight!\u0022 Barrie\u0027s exultant voice echoed over the speakers. \u201CSeanan pushes the button, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fires for ullage and then - wham - SPS, full thrust, right on schedule, no mess, no stress!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton decided not to mention the copious amounts of both mess and stress in the Mission Control back rooms. \u201CCopy that, Barrie. We see you at undock attitude - please confirm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CConfirmed, Flight. The away team are in the lander, we have a good seal on both hatches, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and life support systems are Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd comms,\u0022said Kerke cheerfully. \u201CDon\u0027t forget the comms.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd comms,\u0022 agreed Barrie. \u201CShip to ship link confirmed, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Barrie. Lander confirms Go. Propulsion copies, Guidance and FD confirm. Pioneer - you are Go for undocking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie leaned forward and uncaged a button on the instrument panel. One that was conspicuously set as far away as possible from the other controls. She rested her thumb against it, took a deep breath and pushed. Latches rattled under her feet, accompanied by a flashing orange light on the console. A gentle thud rocked the capsule, the light flickered and then glowed a solid, reassuring green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBarrie, Flight. Undock confirmed.\u0022 She peered out of the rendezvous window above the instrument panel. \u201CLooking good...landing legs deployed!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer, Flight. Spacecraft handling is nominal. Moving to station-keeping distance and standing by for rendezvous radar tests.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne and a half orbits later, Seanan lifted his eyes from the radar display and stared at the inky blackness outside the lander window. Behind him, he knew, Barrie was following them at a safe distance in the capsule and service module. Under his back, a lonely, cratered landscape slid past unseen and far away on the other side of the M\u00FCn, Mission Control - and everything else that he had ever known - waited for them. For now it was just himself and Kerke. Two kerbals staring wide-eyed at the rest of the universe from inside their tiny, fragile landing craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow did we ever get out here,\u0022 he murmured. Kerke turned to look at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou too, huh?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan nodded slowly. \u201CYeah.\u0022 He tapped his chest. \u201CPillars preserve me; I was a \u003Cem\u003Eplumber\u003C/em\u003E. Joined the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E because building rocket engines looked like fun. Never figured I would end up building actual capsules, never mind watching kerbals fly them into \u003Cem\u003Eouter space\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022 He gestured over his shoulder. \u201CAnd now here\u0027s me this close to the actual damn \u003Cem\u003EM\u00FCn\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd it\u0027s about to get a lot closer,\u0022 said Kerke quietly. \u201CIf it makes any difference, Seanan, I was a pilot before I joined Rockomax. Flew a lot of planes in a lot of places but right now?\u0022 He shook his head. \u201CYeah, I know exactly how you feel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke glanced at the mission timer, then down at the navball. \u201CSpacecraft alignment confirmed. Go, for descent orbit insertion.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRadar is tracking. You\u0027re looking good from here, guys. Good luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Barrie. Throttle mode zero. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in AUTO. Proceeding at sixty seconds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwenty seconds. Tank pressures nominal, standing by for ullage burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeven...six...five...\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E firing...three...two...one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe descent engine fired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as it shut down, Seanan turned to the computer and punched in a burn status request. The two kerbonauts sighed with relief at the numbers that flashed up on the screen. Kerke keyed his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, Barrie. We\u0027re seeing a delta-V of 28.4 metres per second with a new periapsis of 18.5 kilometres. Residuals minimal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRadar concurs with the delta-V, Kerke. I\u0027ll follow you down and firm up the trajectory numbers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan was busy at his keyboard. \u201COkay, ditching the CSM data. Landing radar attitude entered and saved. Phasing burn program entered and saved.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke glanced at his sleeve checklist. \u201CGot the CSM altitude matching and circularisation data here. We\u0027ll load them in on the second pass once we\u0027ve dropped the descent stage. Don\u0027t want to get our burns mixed up. Okay, let\u0027s see what we can see.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan felt the rattle of thruster fire through the hull. The stars slid past, replaced by the cratered Munar surface. The thrusters rattled again as Kerke checked their spin. He stared at the pockmarked surface below, hunting for the first landmark on their list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGot them! The Gateway Craters - and right on schedule. Okay, looking for Mount Kelvey - should be coming into view in a couple of minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp in the crew capsule, Barrie crossed off the landmarks on her checklist as Seanan read them out. She grinned at the increasingly excited voices from the lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerm but we\u0027re picking up some speed now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWould you look at those dark speckles round the crater rims Those have \u003Cem\u003Egot\u003C/em\u003E to be rocks - look at the size of those things!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks like plenty of space between them though. We could set down there if we had to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u0027t think we packed enough snacks for a surface stay. Oh wow - Bill\u0027s Rille sure looks different from down here. Like someone took an axe to the side of the M\u00FCn!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWoaaaaahhh. What the...!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s fine - it\u0027s fine! Just the radar test - computer\u0027s got us. Too high to get a ground return but tracking looks good. Okay, landing radar to OFF. Hey, Barrie - any news from Mission Control?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFourteen minutes to acquisition, Kerke. Don\u0027t worry - I\u0027ll make sure you\u0027re patched in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton frowned as she caught herself tapping her fingers on the edge of her console. \u003Cem\u003EAgain.\u003C/em\u003E The main screen was still showed the two spacecraft orbiting the Mun together; a status plot which was nearly half an orbit out of date. \u003Cem\u003EStation-keeping would be acceptable. Better that than...no, don\u0027t go there.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re getting something, Flight! Broken but definitely telemetry, transmitting on Barrie\u0027s frequency!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...to Foxh...Co...in Foxham...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Barrie. Reading you loud and clear - what is Pioneer\u0027s status?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton swore she could hear the kerbonaut\u0027s grin over the air to ground loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, they\u0027re doing just fine, Flight. Switching to three-way now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI got it, Kerke, I got it! Site 2, fat as you like! Kerm - look at \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E ones - better warn Four not to come in short!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton watched a ripple of smiles breaking out around Mission Control at the unbridled enthusiasm in Seanan\u0027s voice, although the flight dynamics team looked at each other uneasily. Lemgan caught her eye mouthing \u0022rocks?\u0022 at her. She leaned forward and tapped her headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Pioneer. How\u0027s the M\u00FCn look from down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExtraordinary, Flight! Beats the view from orbit all hollow - you can practically count the boulders down there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout that, Pioneer. What\u0027s your assessment of the landing sites?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke spoke up. \u201CSite 1 was clear in the middle, Flight but we saw a lot of ejecta on the approach. Can\u0027t say for certain till we get a look at the camera footage but my eyeball estimate is that the trajectory team could drop an ellipse down there and keep it away from the major craters. Right now, I\u0027d give it a cautious Go. Site 2 looks like a scrub - there\u00C3\u0027s a major boulder field in the middle that we didn\u0027t pick up from orbit and I don\u0027t remember seeing from the Muna maps. The geology team would love us for it on a future landing but I do not recommend it as a site for Pioneer 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s a decision then,\u0022 said Nelton. \u201CThank you, Pioneer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe could do a timed overflight on the next orbit, Flight - try and get some better data for the trajectory team?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s good thought but no, Pioneer,\u0022 said Nelton. \u201CYour priority will be setting up and executing the phasing burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil the lander passed out of radio contact again, the \u003Cem\u003EPioneer\u003C/em\u003E crew treated their flight control team to a non-stop running commentary from the M\u00FCn, Kerke\u0027s drier, more precisely composed observations interspersing with Seanan\u0027s enthusiastic rapid-fire chatter and Barrie\u0027s occasional questions. At the flight director\u0027s console, Nelton relaxed minutely for the first time since the arrival at the M\u00FCn. Once she pointed out that the air to ground loop was being recorded for later analysis, the controllers crammed around the trajectory and science consoles relaxed slightly as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the flight clock ticked away the minutes to reacquisition of signal, the Lander team gathered around their console, rustling flight plans and the smell of stale coffee betraying tense controllers, alert for the first sign of telemetry from the static on their screens. Numbers flickered on their screens, amidst a clutter of fragmented characters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPicking up telemetry noise, Flight! Waiting for...and we got them, Flight! Fuel levels consistent with a good burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Flight!\u0022 said Kerke. \u201CThis descent engine is a landing \u003Cem\u003Emachine\u003C/em\u003E. Throttling, guidance...\u00A0all right on target. We\u0027re gonna be flying high on this orbit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe engineers will be glad to hear it, Pioneer,\u0022 replied Nelton. \u201CFlight dynamics have the backup numbers for your altitude matching burn if you\u0027re ready for them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReady and waiting, Flight,\u0022 said Kerke. \u201CBut if they built the ascent engine the same way they built the machine underneath it, then I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to need them!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u0027s hope so,\u0022 said Nelton. \u201CThis is the final test, team. Pull this one off and we\u0027ve got a landing mission.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 3\u003C/em\u003E plunged towards the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn for the third time, one thought ran through hundreds of minds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWould the ascent engine fire?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt ran through the minds of the engineers who had designed and built the engine. It ran through the minds of the flight controllers tasked with watching over it. Most especially, it ran through the minds of the lone kerbonaut in orbit around the\u00A0M\u00FCn and her two crewmates standing right on top of it. Seanan took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBurn programs loaded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke scanned his navball. \u201CThirty seconds. Attitude good, correct end pointing towards space.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie didn\u0027t bother to reply. The corner of Seanan\u0027s mouth twitched briefly as he braced himself as best he could against his foot restraints. Kerke reached forward, hands racing over the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ascent engine armed! Abort stage... and ignition! Ascent engine firing!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSmooth separation and a steady start,\u0022 Seanan called out. \u201CMine\u0027s a coffee, Barrie...\u00A0we\u0027ll see you soon!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You guys got your hats on?\u0022 Barrie checked the air hoses connecting her suit to the bulky life support pack strapped to her back. \u0022What did they call this thing again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan locked his helmet onto the collar ring of his own suit and checked his gloves. \u0022The EMU,\u0022 he said. \u0022Short for Extravehicular Mobility Unit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sounds like some kind of a bird,\u0022 said Barrie, her voice tinny through the suit radio. \u0022You would think they could come up with something snappier.\u0022 She pressed a switch on the control box attached to her chest. The backpack started up with a faint gurgle and a stream of cool air blew across the inside of her helmet. \u0022Seems to be working though.\u0022 She glanced at Kerke and Seanan. \u0022All set?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All set,\u0022 Seanan said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke nodded. \u0022Depressurising.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInsulated from the cabin noise inside her suit, Barrie watched the pressure gauge drop silently to zero. She reached up and twisted the hatch locking bar, grunting with effort. \u0022Mobility unit my foot.\u0022 She heaved the hatch open and, checking her tether, pushed her head out of the capsule. Seanan and Kerke watched nervously as she pulled the rest of her body through the opening but her life support backpack slipped out without catching on anything. They heard a sudden intake of breath over the radio and then Barrie\u0027s carefully matter-of-fact voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Flight. I\u0027m clear of the hatch. The suit gloves are pretty stiff under vacuum but I can still grip the hand-holds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve got the tether, Flight,\u0022 said Seanan. \u0022Ready for second-eyes duty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Pioneer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan settled himself half-way out of the capsule, holding tightly onto the hatch rim with one hand and onto Barrie\u0027s tether with the other. \u0022Tether looks good, Barrie. Ready when you are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie clambered slowly along the capsule, paused for a moment as she felt for the next foothold, then edged onto the service module. She tucked her fingers under a recess on its curved metal skin and pulled. The access panel dutifully popped open and Barrie reached inside. \u0022Okay, Flight, I have the sat. What next?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It should activate automatically, Pioneer. Check for a green light on the base.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got it, Flight. You picking up a signal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Loud and clear, Pioneer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie carefully lifted the small spherical device clear of its compartment, being careful not to snag any of its four stub antennas. \u0022Deploying.\u0022 Grinning inside her helmet, she tossed the satellite away with a gentle underarm throw and watched it tumble slowly away into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood work, Pioneer. That and the ascent module should let the tracking team get the mascons pinned down before the next flight. How about a couple of holiday pictures to finish the EVA?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan blinked. \u003Cem\u003EDid she really just...sounds like she\u0027s been spending too much time with Gene or Jeb.\u003C/em\u003E He ducked back inside the capsule. \u201COne moment, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke regarded the rectangular shape on Seanan\u0027s couch with amusement and clicked his suit radio over to the crew\u0027s private channel.\u201CIs that what it looks like?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf it looks like a roll of painted cloth held straight with a pair of old car aerials,\u0022 said Seanan, \u201Cthen, yes it is. Fiddly too - good thing I opened it before suiting up.\u0022 He passed the makeshift signboard through the hatch to Barrie, before climbing back out himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUp a bit, Barrie, get it pointing over your left shoulder. Bit more. Perfect!\u0022 Seanan hastily switched over to the air to ground loop. \u201COkay, Flight. Here goes with the exterior camera. Let me know if its out of focus.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton froze in her seat. A couple of the flight controllers chuckled briefly then fell silent, drinking in the view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cratered grey Munar horizon filled the right hand side of the main screen. In the centre, a spacesuited figure stood boldly atop \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 3\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s service module, its mirrored visor gleaming in the sunlight. It appeared to be holding a road sign, arrow pointed over it\u0027s shoulder directly at the shining blue and white marble in the background, writing clearly visible to everyone in Mission Control:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nKerbin\n\u003Cp\u003E\n385,000 km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton stared entranced at the screen. \u201CI should yell at you lot for this but somehow...somehow that just sums up the whole program.\u0022 She cleared her throat. \u201CI almost hate to say this guys but we\u0027ve only got thirty minutes before loss of signal. Time to come inside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spacecraft circled the M\u00FCn for the last time. The boxy remains of the landing craft separated from its mothership with a spurt of ice crystals and drifted away on the barest puff of gas. Thrusters fired, aligning the capsule and its service module along some unseen arrow. They fired again, a longer burst this time, urging sluggish fluids into position. Then, at the appointed moment, the main engine burst into life for the last time, hurling the spacecraft and its crew away from the M\u00FCn and onto the long path home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarkton Mission Control was packed with, and surrounded by, anxious kerbals listening to the flight updates from Foxham. Geneney sat bolt upright at the flight director\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s console, jaw clenched, hands crushing the armrests of his chair.

The Red Planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wandering star that had drawn kerbal eyes skyward ever since they had thought to look beyond their Kerm; their efforts to predict and then understand it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s path across the sky the underpinning behind some of their greatest scientific achievements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe historical record was replete with astronomical works, the very earliest ones dating back to the First Age of Prosperity and only recognisable by their diagrams and charts. The accompanying texts tended to be written in obscure notations and more often than not were simply lost. Even then, scientific historians pointed out, they showed a comparatively sophisticated understanding, suggesting that still earlier records were destroyed in the turmoil of the Age of Madness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrough the earliest telescopes, Duna appeared as a blurred reddish-orange disc which exhibited only limited phases, unlike the M\u00FCn. As their instruments improved, kerbal astronomers observed dark and light regions of Duna\u0027s surface. They watched them change over time and deduced the length of Duna\u0027s day, which was found to be a little longer than Kerbin\u0027s. The white regions at Duna\u0027s poles were also seen to change, although over the course of a season rather than a day. Popularly supposed to be made of ice, the Duna polar caps were the cause of much, largely unverified, speculation on Dunan weather and whether water might be found elsewhere on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pressing navigational needs of the Age of Sail drove new waves of enquiry into astronomy and turned telescope manufacture from a pastime and curiosity into an industry. Progress was rapid and was matched by an equally rapid growth in the number and quality of astronomical observations. Duna\u0027s position in the sky was pinpointed with unparalleled precision, steadily more detailed maps were made of its surface and, like Kerbin, it was found to have a mun, which was named Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the Age of Sail waxed into the Second Age of Prosperity, the burgeoning sciences of photometry, and then spectroscopy, provided kerbal astronomers with their first temperature measurements of Duna\u0027s surface and skies and their first glimpses into the makeup of those skies. Ever more sophisticated observational and mathematical techniques placed an upper limit on the thickness of Duna\u0027s atmosphere, established that it contained significant quantities of carbon dioxide and suggested that on the whole, Duna was a smooth world, free of large surface irregularities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther progress would have to wait for an extraordinary leap into the unknown and the pioneering achievements of three teams of kerbals. And like the Age of Sail before it, the astronomical accomplishments of the new Age would be driven as much by dire need as by scientific curiosity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan studied the printout intently. \u201CThese are confirmed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJernie nodded.\u00A0\u201CAveraged radio occultation data from the Hope 3 and Hope 4 orbiters over the last twelve orbits.

She shrugged. \u201CNitrogen is always a pain to work with. We\u0027re seeing carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon mainly. Traces of water and oxygen but nothing you could breathe. The mass spec data from the landers will give us a better picture.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney bent down and retrieved a long tube from under the table. \u201CSpeaking of which.\u0022 He carefully extracted a roll of glossy paper. \u201CA hand if you would, please, Jernie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJernie jumped to her feet and helped Dunney unroll the paper and pin it to the wall. Lodan stared at the black and white picture, noting the pair of thin, red ellipses drawn over it. Dunney picked up a pointer, unfolded it, and to Lodan\u0027s inward amusement, tucked a thumb into his belt and began to lecture them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is the initial, low-resolution composite map of Duna, generated from the wide angle cameras aboard the Hope 3 and Hope 4 orbiters - you\u0027ll notice that it has a slightly motttled appearance for that reason. Cylindrical projection of course, so the polar regions are grossly distorted, but we\u0027re not immediately interested in them in any case.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney cleared his throat. \u201CThe orbiters are also equipped with high-resolution cameras and the survey team will be assembling an improved map over the next few weeks, which they\u0027ll use to select the final landing sites. However, based on the images obtained to date, we have tentatively identified two possibilities that may be of interest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pointer jabbed at one of the red ellipses. \u201CThe first site - here - shows features akin to a large river delta here on Kerbin. This will need to be confirmed on the high-resolution images and even if verified, is unlikely to be due to currently flowing surface water. In fact, we believe the features are more likely to be created by surface erosion due to fluidised particulates.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney gave them a lopsided grin. \u201COf course, we cannot entirely rule out an alternative hypothesis which is that we\u0027re looking at an \u003Cem\u003Eancient\u003C/em\u003E watercourse, ideally with sub-surface ice deposits still present. We propose this landing site as a means to test that hypothesis but more prosaically because it\u0027s a large flat region of Duna that ought to be comparatively straightforward to land on.\u0022 He pointed at the second ellipse. \u201CGiving the flight planners a bit of practice before asking them to put a lander down at Site 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan leaned forward. \u0022Presumably without hitting those mountains,\u0022 he said. \u201CWell, those hills anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney nodded. \u201CThey\u0027re higher than they look but yes, that\u0027s the idea. We\u0027re thinking that the hills would provide shelter from the prevailing winds and ideally we\u0027ll find a nice cliff face somewhere that the colonists can burrow into. Better yet would be another stream bed nearby but I rather imagine that would be setting our hopes too high.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan drummed his fingers on the table thoughtfully. \u201CAgreed,\u0022 he said at last. \u201CUnless the high resolution studies find somewhere better, Site 1 is our main objective If we do manage to set down there on the first attempt, then we try for Site 2 as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney folded up his pointer. \u201CThank you, Director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilently, \u003Cem\u003EHope 3\u003C/em\u003E split into two, its flattened, discoidal base drifting slowly away from its spindly, angular upper body. Tiny rockets fired around the rim of the base section, nudging it onto an intercept course with the snow-capped, dusty orange sphere waiting far below. The body section pivoted to follow, onboard cameras tracking the disc as it fell, surrogate eyes of silicon and glass for the anxious kerbals watching from so many millions of kilometres away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rockets fired again, making fine adjustments to the disc\u0027s trajectory and orientation. Light minutes away from Kerbin, the final moments of its long voyage would be over before its controllers could react, let alone respond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrails of glowing gas streamed away from the descending spacecraft, its blunt, saucer shaped front end glowing red, then yellow, then white hot, as it tore through the thin Dunan air. Instruments buried within its shell sensed the steadily building forces. By itself the resultant information was a meaningless stream of electronic pulses. Combined with other bits of data hard-wired into the spacecraft\u0027s computer memory, it provided the vital measuring rule against which its descent could be gauged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo strings of numbers were compared many hundreds of times per second and for a fleeting moment they matched. A threshold was crossed, triggering new sets of instructions. Explosive bolts fired, blasting the upper aeroshell section away from the plummeting craft. Seconds later parachutes deployed, hauling it free from the still glowing heatshield, which tumbled away out of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo more numbers slid into alignment. Four articulated metal legs unfolded from the spacecraft body. Rupturing gas cartridges slammed knife blades through restraining tethers and cut the parachutes free. Clusters of rocket engines fired, bleeding off excess speed whilst invisible beams of radio waves probed the surface below. The spacecraft dipped to one side, floated sideways and then steadied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA final pair of numbers crossed their preprogrammed thresholds. The rocket engines shut down, the exhaust from each engine barely enough to stir the dust from the waiting planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface. Four legs kissed the ground; honeycomb padded feet crumpled under the load and brought the spacecraft to a standstill. Antennas unfolded and tilted skywards, automatically seeking a pair of invisible stars through the dusty Dunan sky, one high and swift-moving, the other low and fixed, a bright blue speck hidden by Kerbol\u0027s dim disc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPicking up a carrier signal.

The \u003Cem\u003EHope 3\u003C/em\u003E team sat up a little straighter at their consoles. Behind them, dozens of Probodyne staff had crammed themselves into the room, their eyes fixed on a large, static filled screen set into the far wall.
