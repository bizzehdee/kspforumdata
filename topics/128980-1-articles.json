First went to North Pole on Mun. Climbed as high as freakiness would allow and planted flag. Bill exploded jet packing back to the ship. Crazy pole Kraken! Next mission was Valentina landing badly at the South Pole. The ship was pretty much toast but pod survived, stopping on the edge of another in a series of seemingly endless slides.\u00A0Tried to make it to the pole summit but more freakies going on. Smacked the ground slid down the slope. Once stopped saw this floating boulder. Climbed as close as possible and planted flag. Then made the mistake of returning to the crashed pod and reverting - it took the flag with the revert. So I have no coordinates but I do have this picture. Graphics set to half res. It\u0027s dark but I think you can see it. If it is a graphics glitch, I am disappointed but it was still really cool. The South Pole summit is in the distance behind the boulder.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kkFFgZ7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kkFFgZ7.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T17:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould the magic boulder be back???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T17:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to believe!
