For example, a command module with 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, two parachutes, a docking port, a solar panel, and an antenna could be \u0022grouped\u0022 as one part rather than ten individual parts in close proximity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously, if this was at all possible, the CPU (fps) savings would be pretty huge \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-16T16:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a mod that did similar, welded selected parts together.
