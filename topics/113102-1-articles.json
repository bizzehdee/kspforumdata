Probes suck at science compared to Kerbals because Kerbals can do so many science-related things probes can\u0027t. Furthermore, you have an incentive to level-up Kerbals so they become more useful to you, and you can\u0027t do that if you send probes. Plus, you get way more science returning data than transmitting it, which means if you want full value you need to bring the probe home, so you might as well send a Kerbal instead and get even more science plus experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, RT in career mode is highly frustrating and inefficient so I don\u0027t recommend it. The only attraction in normal career mode to using probes is that they\u0027re cheap so can grab a small bit of science or some contract cash if you need that to unlock a key node.

Higher-tech antennas can talk anywhere in the solar system. What then kills you is signal delay (assuming you have that turned on).

To control the ship en route, you need an antenna outside any fairing protecting the main probe, and they always burn off.

Since career mode has come along, RT has been patched up to work with it, but the basic nature of stock career mode makes it rather a bad fit for RT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT certainly adds a challenge to career mode. But that challenge only makes real sense if you impose a number of other restrictions on yourself. RT makes using probes to do real missions very expensive and time-consuming because you have to build the network first, but there is very little use for probes in stock career games; thus, you can largely ignore RT\u0027s constraints. For RT to be a meaningful obstacle to your career advancement, you must do something else that forces you to use a lot more probes. Life support, a probe-oriented tech tree, a house rule of always sending probes before sending Kerbals, that sort of thing. Otherwise, you can get through career mode without using probes at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the biggest self-imposed restriction about RT is that you have to buy into its underlying premise. That premise is that probes are stone-stupid marionettes that require somebody back at KSC constantly controlling their every action. No autonomy at all. From this comes the necessity of the uninterrupted commsat network. And from that comes signal delay (if you turn that on) at long distances, for which you also need to install kOS, which grants probes a tiny, 1960s level of autonomy. However, this is the 21st Century. We have highly autonomous vehicles on the ground, in the air, at sea, and in space.

Its primary purpose is to force you to use a big enough antenna (or set up a relay network) to be able to transmit science reports. As such, it affects both probes AND crewed ships. However, it has no signal delay, so you can always control your probes as you want to (IOW, it assumes modern, highly autonomous probes). AR also adds no parts, so you only have the 3 stock antennae. In general, the dipole will only reach low orbit from the surface, the DTS-M1 can reach about from Mun to Kerbin, and the 88-88 can cover the whole solar system (although having some relays helps).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAR has several options you can enable. One of them adds the requirement for line-of-sight links, so you have to set up RT-like commsat constellations to bounce signals around intervening planets (without this, you don\u0027t need any fancy networks). Another option prevents any probe control unless linked to the network but because there\u0027s no signal delay, this isn\u0027t as harsh as it is in RT. There\u0027s also an option that allows reducing the power required to transmit data at the cost of increasing the time needed. This helps in keeping probe size down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAR is much simpler to use because it figures out all relays by itself. You don\u0027t need to set the target of each antenna on each satellite yourself, and you don\u0027t need multiple antennae per satellite, either. When you want to transmit an experiment, AR sees if the ship\u0027s own antenna can reach Kerbin. If not, it checks all other ships in flight with antennae and tries to find a path through them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, AR is a good \u0022extra ingredient\u0022 to spice up a career game because it affects all ships transmitting science data. It does not require any major change in your customary play style to feel its effects, and it doesn\u0027t require quite as much infrastructure as RT even with the LOS option enabled. However, AR has zero impact on sandbox games, or in career games after the tech tree is unlocked, UNLESS you just want it to force communications links for probe control without bothering with signal delay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022carlorizzante\u0022 data-cite=\u0022carlorizzante\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, how do I change the label from \u0022Unanswered\u0022 to \u0022Answered!\u0022?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a sticky at the top of the forum titled exactly that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s an alternative to RT called AntennaRange, which was specifically designed for career mode.
