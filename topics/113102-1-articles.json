You should have unlocked both of those before you started getting solar panels. \n\nBuild yourself a satellite with one each of those antennae, at least 400 or so units of battery power, and enough OX-STAT panels so you can keep at least two pointed sunward (six-times symmetry on a 1.25m core should be OK for this). \n\nLaunch one, and get it to a 700 km orbit. Then test it - activate both antennae and make sure it has enough battery power to survive the transit across Kerbin\u0027s shadow, and enough solar panels to recharge.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve got your power requirements sorted, build out the rest of your network. At 700 km altitude, three satellites evenly spaced should be able to keep in touch with each other using the Communotron 16, but putting four in orbit can\u0027t hurt. For each satellite, activate its dish antenna, and set it to target the active vessel. \n\nThat\u0027s all you need for exploration all over the Kerbin system. Each moon only needs a couple of identical satellites in high orbit, with a dish permanently aimed at Kerbin and a Communotron 16 for surface comms. I usually piggyback those on to contract missions to save money.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh, and I also use the Hyperedit mod. For each satellite I\u0027m putting in orbit, I place it as accurately as possible by hand. And then I use Hyperedit to cheat them all to have the same semi-major axis (SMA). Done well, the SMA is almost the same anyway, making them match just stops them from drifting over the course of the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T12:48:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stibbons**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T13:28:03Z","Content":"What stibbons said-- you can make a network that covers near-Kerbin space just fine with nothing but Communotron 16, and OX-STAT panels are fine for powering that.

Once you get to Minmus, the boatloads of science you can collect from it will be enough to unlock pretty much all of the other antennas.\n\nFor these satellites, you only need one Comm16 per craft, which draws very little charge.

If you want to use it in career mode, look around at mod trees, some of which are intended specifically for RT and/or probes in general.\n\nBut even then, RT still isn\u0027t career-friendly because of how the whole science thing works. Probes suck at science compared to Kerbals because Kerbals can do so many science-related things probes can\u0027t. Furthermore, you have an incentive to level-up Kerbals so they become more useful to you, and you can\u0027t do that if you send probes. Plus, you get way more science returning data than transmitting it, which means if you want full value you need to bring the probe home, so you might as well send a Kerbal instead and get even more science plus experience.\n\nSo yeah, RT in career mode is highly frustrating and inefficient so I don\u0027t recommend it. The only attraction in normal career mode to using probes is that they\u0027re cheap so can grab a small bit of science or some contract cash if you need that to unlock a key node. But RT takes this away by requiring a large investment in the infrastructure to make probes work at all. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the antennas seem ok for the Kerbin system, but I\u0027m afraid they might be a bit underpowered for sending probes on farther distances.\n\nIt depends on the antenna. Higher-tech antennas can talk anywhere in the solar system. What then kills you is signal delay (assuming you have that turned on). That\u0027s a whole \u0027nother story and leads into learning to write kOS scripts to make your probes somewhat autonomous to deal with signal delay.\n\nAnd since 1.0.2, there\u0027s reentry heat, which might be tame for operations around Kerbin but which is a killer at interplanetary transfer speeds, such as when aerocapturing at Eve, Jool, or Laythe (Duna is not really a problem). To control the ship en route, you need an antenna outside any fairing protecting the main probe, and they always burn off. This severely limits your ability to aerocapture, which leads to all sorts of other problems.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would really like to know how others usually proceed in order to build their first Communication network.

Why spend the money on low-tech infrastructure that will have to be replaced anyway, especially when all you get for that time and money is just the ability to collect less science than you can with Kerbals.\n\nSo the bottom line is, don\u0027t build a \u0022first\u0022 network, build 1 permanent, state-of-the-art network, planned in advance with room to expand as you start colonizing other planets.

Since career mode has come along, RT has been patched up to work with it, but the basic nature of stock career mode makes it rather a bad fit for RT.\n\nRT certainly adds a challenge to career mode. But that challenge only makes real sense if you impose a number of other restrictions on yourself. RT makes using probes to do real missions very expensive and time-consuming because you have to build the network first, but there is very little use for probes in stock career games; thus, you can largely ignore RT\u0027s constraints. For RT to be a meaningful obstacle to your career advancement, you must do something else that forces you to use a lot more probes. Life support, a probe-oriented tech tree, a house rule of always sending probes before sending Kerbals, that sort of thing. Otherwise, you can get through career mode without using probes at all.\n\nBut the biggest self-imposed restriction about RT is that you have to buy into its underlying premise. That premise is that probes are stone-stupid marionettes that require somebody back at KSC constantly controlling their every action. No autonomy at all. From this comes the necessity of the uninterrupted commsat network. And from that comes signal delay (if you turn that on) at long distances, for which you also need to install kOS, which grants probes a tiny, 1960s level of autonomy. However, this is the 21st Century. We have highly autonomous vehicles on the ground, in the air, at sea, and in space. You can now, today, buy a fully autonomous, street-legal car to drive you home through city traffic when you\u0027re drunk (one of the greatest inventions ever, IMHO ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)). This blows the whole concept of RT out of the water. So, for RT to make sense to even have in your game, you have to imagine your game is set in the distant past, before such modern things existed, and that the Silicon Revolution never happens on Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T15:46:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For RT to be a meaningful obstacle to your career advancement, you must do something else that forces you to use a lot more probes.

You can get through career mode without using crewed pods too. What\u0027s your point?\n\nThe point you obviously missed, repeatedly throughout your reply, was that RT, because it\u0027s all about probes, it has no real impact on the game unless you rely heavily on probes. The way stock career is set up, it thoroughly marginalizes probes. Logical and efficient career progression relies almost entirely on crewed ships. So if you\u0027re already in the habit of playing that way, and keep doing that after installing RT, RT will have little if any impact. Therefore, there\u0027s little if any point in installing it---save that RAM for something more useful. RT only becomes significant in career mode if the player does something else (other mods, house rules, etc.) to force himself into a very different play style that uses a lot more probes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t need an uninterrupted network, that\u0027s what the flight computer is for - providing some degree of autonomy.\n\u003E ...False. kOS is fully programmable.\n\nThe so-called \u0022flight computer\u0022 isn\u0027t autonomy at all, it\u0027s simply an egg timer to execute something you set up previously while in direct control via the network. And that network has to be pretty much uninterrupted to set this up, having only a few small blind spots where you use the \u0022flight computer\u0022. The probe doesn\u0027t make any decision for itself so has zero autonomy.\n\nkOS does let the probe make decisions so actually provides some autonomy. However, unless things have changed recently, kOS is intentionally very retro, so imposes severe limits on file size, meaning no script can do all that much by itself and you still need a largely uninterrupted network to swap files around.\n\nBoth of these things, and of course RT itself, are totally antique in the 21st Century. The \u0022flight computer\u0022 is no more advanced than a mechanical time fuze for an artillery shell, which has been around since the late 1800s, and kOS is deliberately 1960s. That\u0027s all cool if you imagine your game set back in ancient history, or in a \u0022*Dune*-esque\u0022 world where true computers (in the modern sense) are illegal. Whatever makes you happy. But if you imagine your game set in the present or relatively near future, the whole RT thing is a complete anachronism.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *(RE: fully autonomous cars available)* Where from?\n\nGoogle. They\u0027re on the road right now. Perhaps not in mass-market availability quite yet, but definitely in the very near future. And Google isn\u0027t the only company doing this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *(RE: disagreeing that RT is an anachronism in today\u0027s world)* No, it doesn\u0027t.\n\nSuit yourself. I wasn\u0027t talking to you anyway and have no intention or desire to change how you play your own games.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can\u0027t say I agree with this.

Collect temperature/seismic/gravity data at so-and-so 3-6 locations is much more cost effective with tiny probes, as they can easily reach 10k dV and above for minimal investment.\n\nRescuing Kerbals 1 per launch isn\u0027t efficient even with probes. To rescue efficiently, build a big ship that can scoop a lot of Kerbals in 1 flight. And by then, the ship is so big that having a pod instead of probe core makes no real difference.\n\nHaving a probe to get \u0022science from space near....\u0022 is about the only cost-effective use of probes, especially if you put the probe up there to begin with on a \u0022place satellite\u0022 contract. Then you can use it repeatedly each time the \u0022science from space near...\u0022 contract pops up. But these don\u0027t pay enough to make a special mission for. As to hopping around waypoints, you get way more science if you send a Kerbal and a full suite of instruments, not just what the contract asks for. Sure, it\u0027s more expensive, but should still be within the budget. You\u0027re not doing such contracts for the money, you\u0027re doing them for the science (and crew experience). \n\n\u003E \n\u003E A network at 90 science should have the ability to reach Duna and Eve, if I remember correctly.

Science data from space around/surface of Duna/Ike/Gilly/Eve missions are frequent, lucrative, and completely repeatable by the same probes.\n\nSending 1-way probes to get science is inefficient. Unless you\u0027re willing to write off all the science the probe didn\u0027t get, you\u0027ll have to send a roundtrip Kerbal there anyway. Because the Kerbal could have gotten everything the probe did, plus all the rest, the probe is a complete waste of time and money. Instead of paying just for the Kerbal\u0027s trip, you now also pay for the redundant probe trip. Plus now have to wait however long for the next transfer window to that planet, which is inconvenient. The only time it\u0027s worth sending a 1-way science probe is if you have no intention of ever sending a Kerbal there. Like to the surface of Eve or Jool.\n\nTrue, it IS handy to have a probe with just a thermometer orbiting someplace to milk \u0022science from space near...\u0022 contracts. But OTOH, if you\u0027re actually developing other planets, you\u0027ll likely have a space station in orbit there that can do the job.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would, however, recommend that a jr. docking port (unlocked pretty early) be added to each satellite at the very least.

Now that that update has happened, and the tech tree changed, things may of course be different, but I imagine it would still work out decently enough.\n\nFor my playthrough I made extensive use of the communotron-32, the large omni antenna that RemoteTech adds. You could get it relatively early in the tech tree. My basic commsat was (IIRC) a stayputnik, six OX-STAT, one communotron 32, a RCS tank and a small monoprop engine (from a mod, but it was basically just a linear RCS port that responded to the engine throttle instead of to the RCS controls). I forget exactly what batteries I mounted, but it had enough storage to make it through the 20-minute geostationary \u0027night\u0027 with its antenna active. (Nowadays you would probably use an OKTO instead of a Stayputnik, since it has SAS and you unlock it together with the solar panels anway.)\n\nTurns out that the communotron-32 consumes very little power and has just enough range to form [a geostationary \u0022square\u0022 around Kerbin](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot39.png) with [four satellites](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/sats.png). I actually never built a LEO network at all. As the antenna is omnidirectional, you only need one single antenna per satellite to build an infinite-connection geostationary network in four launches. Takes a bit of fiddling to get them properly aligned, as there\u0027s not much leeway for drifting out of position, but it\u0027s not like dish networks don\u0027t require fiddling, either. And with two uplinks to KSC, the network can survive at least one broken link anywhere in the chain with zero negative impact... more than that if there are other vessels with omnidirectional antennas in orbit, as they will often automatically \u0022bridge\u0022 the lost connection.\n\nAfter those four, whenever I needed to link a distant location (like Minmus), I simply launched a sat (well actually a pair to cover planetary occlusion) with one communotron-32 and one dish antenna of the appropriate size into a sub-geostationary orbit somewhere. Point the dish towards Minmus, send another identical sat to Minmus, link the dishes, and base local communications off of omnidirectional antennas again. Since I can connect an infinite number of concurrent vessels in Kerbin orbit, I can just throw up another tiny dedicated sat for whatever, whenever and then forget about it ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) And if that ends up being too many at some point in the future, I will have high-end technology then to effortlessly consolidate many small sats into one.\n\nI see a lot of people struggling to build giant commsats with four to six energy-hungry dishes and the whole low-tech solarpanel-and-battery-spam shebang, just to set up basic geostationary network that still needs a dedicated LEO network to support more than a handful of concurrent craft... I like to think that my solution is a bit more elegant and a lot less hassle ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Of course, I will have to see if that still works in 1.02, since it depends on when exactly the communotron-32 unlocks, and how much less power the OX-STATs generate. But the six I mounted were more than enough in the past, and the OKTO has room for 8.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T09:02:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T09:36:09Z","Content":"My take is a little bit different.\n\nFirst I don\u0027t bother with geostationary - I find better with manned first mission because you\u0027ll get too much flexibility out of it.\n\nNext I tend to use less Comm-32, since a lot of my light-weight probes are using Comm-16 (to save solar panels) and I don\u0027t want to lose connection to them. Even in the case of Comm-32, I often make sure that I have reasonable coverage for a Comm-16-equipped-probe. So the solution I come up with is just a 4-satellite equatorial network of radius 2Mm for LKO, each having one Comm-32 for covering LKO and talking among themselves (while any probe with Comm-16 can have full coverage on LKO), and two DTS-M1, which is for active vessel at the beginning, and future coverage to Mun/Minmus/relay satellites.\n\nSecond network (actually 2 networks) would be just 2~3 satellites per Mun/Minmus at polar orbit, where it connects back to the LKO network. It\u0027s not full coverage but I don\u0027t need full Mun/Minmus coverage anyway. Plus I have one space station on each of the moon and it also gives some coverage.\n\nThen preparation of interplanetary. Kerbin side I did two things:\n\n1. I fly a cargo plane and put several rovers (without wheels, in fact) with the longest antenna you have targeting active vessel - that\u0027s going to be really handy when your interplanetary probe get out of omni range but still close to Kerbin enough and you want to do some correction burn. (I learned it in a hard way - once had to splash down an antenna plane in a certain area in the middle of the ocean to provide coverage for a probe which just get out of Kerbin SoI)\n\n2. Local relay satellite - nothing fancy here. By then you should be able to build large satellites and just spam antennas for that. For safety I\u0027m putting it on 5Mm orbit so that when Duna gets closest to Kerbin, I still get coverage with 88-88.\n\nFinally network on other planets - I can\u0027t say too much about them because my missions are still ongoing. But the basic plan is similar to how I build Kerbin system. The only exception is Jool, which I haven\u0027t started planning yet... it would be really fun for this one, I expect.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T09:41:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse**"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T11:13:19Z","Content":"Now, how do I change the label from \u0022Unanswered\u0022 to \u0022Answered!\u0022?"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T11:17:59Z","Content":"The best way to prevent people reading a post is to make it [sticky](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85063-How-to-change-Unanswered-to-Answered)"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T12:52:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E RemoteTech might be not perfectly integrated with the gameplay.

I play for the experience.\n\nThere\u0027s an alternative to RT called AntennaRange, which was specifically designed for career mode. Its primary purpose is to force you to use a big enough antenna (or set up a relay network) to be able to transmit science reports. As such, it affects both probes AND crewed ships. However, it has no signal delay, so you can always control your probes as you want to (IOW, it assumes modern, highly autonomous probes). AR also adds no parts, so you only have the 3 stock antennae. In general, the dipole will only reach low orbit from the surface, the DTS-M1 can reach about from Mun to Kerbin, and the 88-88 can cover the whole solar system (although having some relays helps).\n\nAR has several options you can enable. One of them adds the requirement for line-of-sight links, so you have to set up RT-like commsat constellations to bounce signals around intervening planets (without this, you don\u0027t need any fancy networks). Another option prevents any probe control unless linked to the network but because there\u0027s no signal delay, this isn\u0027t as harsh as it is in RT. There\u0027s also an option that allows reducing the power required to transmit data at the cost of increasing the time needed. This helps in keeping probe size down.\n\nAR is much simpler to use because it figures out all relays by itself. You don\u0027t need to set the target of each antenna on each satellite yourself, and you don\u0027t need multiple antennae per satellite, either. When you want to transmit an experiment, AR sees if the ship\u0027s own antenna can reach Kerbin. If not, it checks all other ships in flight with antennae and tries to find a path through them.\n\nIn general, AR is a good \u0022extra ingredient\u0022 to spice up a career game because it affects all ships transmitting science data. It does not require any major change in your customary play style to feel its effects, and it doesn\u0027t require quite as much infrastructure as RT even with the LOS option enabled. However, AR has zero impact on sandbox games, or in career games after the tech tree is unlocked, UNLESS you just want it to force communications links for probe control without bothering with signal delay."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:07:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now, how do I change the label from \u0022Unanswered\u0022 to \u0022Answered!\u0022?\n\nThere\u0027s a sticky at the top of the forum titled exactly that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:13:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s an alternative to RT called AntennaRange, which was specifically designed for career mode.
