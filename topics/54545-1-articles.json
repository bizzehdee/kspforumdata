It used kinda intricate staging system, three stages for descent, six stages for ascent. I saved it as subassembly so I could mount it to my lifter and send to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen loading the subassembly the staging was still there. I had to make room for it in the lifter\u0027s staging but that went all ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I lifted the lander on the lifter and docked it to my orbital station where I was constructing a new interplanetary ship. Later I docked one more part (fuel tank) to it and then separated the ship from the orbital station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of what I can say, there still were some stages at that point although parts from all the ship\u0027s components made quite a mess. I want to note that the last time I used any kind of staging on all that was on the lifter and it was only separating its own stages. I did not dare to even try to stage anything on the orbital station or the ship, instead I manually activated/deactivated anything that was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I parked near Tylo, I finally decoupled the lander from the ship. At that point I realized the game has completely screwed up its staging because everything was in one stage now. I had to spend some quite substantial time setting up the staging again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, the lander\u0027s staging had no sense when it was docked to the lifter, the orbital station, or the mothership. At that point it was just payload and served no function. What I needed was that staging initially designed in VAB to be carried through all the phases of transport till I decoupled the lander from the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to design some way of \u0022payload sealing\u0022 which would hide all staging and action groups of an individual structure, such as ship in VAB or subassembly. While sealed, this structure\u0027s parts wouldn\u0027t appear in the staging and its action groups wouldn\u0027t trigger by corresponding keypress. To activate them, you\u0027d need to right-click on the structure and select \u0022unseal payload\u0022 in the menu. Only after that, staging would appear and eventually merge with the current ship\u0027s staging and action groups would start reacting to keypresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably also help if it was possible to seal a ship in space (e.g. when a lander returns and is about to dock to mothership) so its staging and action groups don\u0027t mix up with those of whatever it is docked to. I assume one level of sealing would be sufficient, i.e. it wouldn\u0027t be possible to seal a ship which already contains a sealed part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-27T23:33:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2013 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T23:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought you were suggesting payload fairings and came here to give you that generic \u0022they don\u0027t work with the aerodynamic sustem of KSP\u0022 response. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"edwardc","CreatedById":94663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T06:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started I made myself a landing practice craft. It was a rather simple rocket but had 4 landers, 4 rovers and 4 probes radially attached all with remote guidance units. The idea was to launch once and have multiple attempts at landing without killing Kerbals. (I don;t like quicksave, feels like cheating). The staging was a nightmare. This sealing system should also lock up monopropellant usage I think. All my lander\u0027s mini tanks were empty even though the main rocket had plenty.

Docking works by merging ships but I can think of no circumstance where you would ever want the staging order of the docked subsystems to change. Each ship should have its staging sequence ring-fenced and locked together, so that you can move the entire subgroup within the staging sequence. Then when the vessels are undocked, the ships can recover their original staging sequence intact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T14:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant suggestion. I\u0027m wondering what would be the best way to implement it.

Docking ports or attach points of a sealed part would still be usable so you can attach or dock other parts to the sealed part. Therefore you can have multiple sealed parts on your ship, either docked or attached as sealed subassemblies in VAB. You can unseal them while they\u0027re part of the ship, or after you undock/decouple them from the ship\u0027s body. If you break a sealed part by using a decoupler or docking port inside it - it would just split to two separate sealed parts just like how now staging setup splits if you decouple parts from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnsealing could be accessible from any sealed part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESealing would probably make sense only for complete ships/subtrees/subassemblies in VAB and for complete ships in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T21:02:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frederf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frederf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe one problem with this is what happens to sealed items if you have a craft A\u002BB and dock it so it\u0027s A\u002BB\u002BC then undock it so it\u0027s B\u002BC.
