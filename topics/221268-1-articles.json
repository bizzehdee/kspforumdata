Its earliest mention being bacm in the 1970s, as a small, unmanned variant of the space shuttle, which was in the works at the time. After being bought by the USAF in 1973, the OFV became somewhat of a \u0022known secret\u0022. It was known by space enthusiasts, but they had no idea what it was or looked like. After 6 years in production, an unplanned Saturn IB mission took it into launch in 1978. It returned to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in 1979, making a very secretive record. Its sister, the OFV-19, was designed as a replacement for the very flawed OFV-18. After being completed in 1983, the OFV-18 was retired, as it was actually a prototype that was never designed to be used, but due to rushing of the program, and pressure by the USAF, it was pushed to become a functional orbiter. While it succeeded, it became apparent of flaws. Unbenonced to the ground control, during one of its secretive long-term flights, a payload, presumably a satellite, had collided with the solar array built into its payload. This caused the solar panel to break. While it wasnt noticed, due to the array being powerful, it became one of the most common issues with the OFV-18, as the array was built into the payload bay, and blocked some of it\u00A0 causing issues. The OFV-19 aimed to fix this by moving the equipment into the front of the nose, aswell as the solar array. This would mainly stop the payloada from hitting the solar array. After its first test flight in 1985, it proved successful, ultimately sealing the fate for the OFV-18.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png?ex=6591e428\u0026amp;is=657f6f28\u0026amp;hm=1a2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1180249308788969523/1186065050251841556/image.png?ex=6591e428\u0026amp;is=657f6f28\u0026amp;hm=1a27c6e40be37f8735105d7b881c80990b9f98a951310839e865f35523a4ec62\u0026amp;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOFV-19 in orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png?ex=65919f04\u0026amp;is=657f2a04\u0026amp;hm=6b7\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/647814097756487711/1185990811641462814/image.png?ex=65919f04\u0026amp;is=657f2a04\u0026amp;hm=6b728e4e99ac6042cc948fee04b9c909f9f0cba0ad70b20da5dbba133550e1c4\u0026amp;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOFV-18\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft files to be released soon, hopefully!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are modded, but shouldnt be a problem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unbreakify","CreatedById":220784,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-18T21:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: Fixing the OFV-19\u0027s aerodynamic issues.
