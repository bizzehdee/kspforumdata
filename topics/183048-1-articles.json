Probably far more than adequate for just about every mission I\u0027ll be using this thing on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a catch, though. (This is where you guys come in.) The parachute used by the capsule is also a decoupler. Fairly straightforward and usually a good thing, as I can clear the docking port off of the parachute well in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does not, however, allow fuel to flow through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222d1onJN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2d1onJN.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the above image shows, I can allow fuel to bypass the decoupler attaching the propulsion module to the command module, and I\u0027d been counting on the parachute doing the same. Buuuut, for whatever reason, it can\u0027t. So, I\u0027m trying to come up with a solution to bypass that decoupler\u00A0in flight after docking. I already tried using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E extensible pipes, and it... kinda summoned the Kraken.
