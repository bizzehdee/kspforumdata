It was particularly interesting to hear rumors about the railroad in the former Soviet Union, such as how they change the wheels to the other track guage at the border and how do those long-distance sleeping trains look like. I used the word \u0022rumors\u0022 since visiting the Soviet Union before 1990 was like visiting North Korea today: You could go on a pre-arranged trip to state-owned tourist sites isolated from the locals, but you couldn\u0027t even dream of independently crossing the border and doing a railfan tour of small village stations and gauge-changing facilities, so most of their discussions sounded like as if the Soviet Union was in another dimension.
