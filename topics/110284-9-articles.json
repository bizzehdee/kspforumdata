At the present time, I have not integrated the mod with CTT. But if CTT doesn\u0027t remove nodes in the stock tree, you should be ok. \n\u003E Great feedback, thank you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Consider the MC-16 communications link to be a part of the Gaslight. Yay reduced parts count! I have some other ideas in mind for next update to help keep the base\u0027s part count low as well, but still work with KIS/KAS.\n\u003E \n\u003E I think a combination of the two- lowering the EC levels on both the Outback and the Buckboard to EC amounts appropriate to the tech level, and requiring RocketParts to make the conversion, will solve the problem.\n\nThat sounds like a fantastic solution actually. Keeps it in line with the processes already being established for field changes and also helps to balance out the power issue. Great idea!\n\nOn the CTT question - no, CTT doesn\u0027t remove or change any of the stock nodes, only adds to them. Additionally, it only adds 3 nodes to the stock tree through the 90 point science level, of which I\u0027d probably only consider moving one item from Pathfinder into - the Conestoga being moved from Advanced Construction to Storage Technology on the CTT. IMHO, where these parts fall on the tree with or without the CTT is fairly good."},{"CreatedByName":"Prime flux","CreatedById":57347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:10:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...The Prime Flux Battery option is WAY overpowered...\n\nPrime Flux is always overpowered, fact of life. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nWarning: This statement may contain traces of irony\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T00:13:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prime flux**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T05:41:50Z","Content":"A couple of closeups for you.

It has a small battery built in, but for continual use, be sure to plug it into your base using its built-in KAS ports. It even serves as a short-range omnidirectional antenna- thanks for the suggestion, MeCripp, hope you like the MC-16 communications link. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like the color? Are the lights too bright? You can change them in the field through the light\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s right-click menu. \n\nThis update supports the OSE Workshop as a new template for the Ponderosa, and adds a new MaterialKits storage template as well. OSEWorkshop lets you 3D print individual parts like hammers, the Mk1 command pod, and even another Ponderosa. If you download OSE Workshop (I recommended the mod), you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to 3D print parts if you have enough MaterialKits.\n\nIn keeping with the mod\u0027s spirit of jurry-rigging what you need, you can now re-engineer the Buckboard and Outback into batteries. This is a revision to the battery template added last update. Additionally, you can now reconfigure drills to drill for different resources. You\u0027ll see this concept of jurry-rigging in other parts in the future.\n\nFinally, there are some bug fixes, infrastructure changes, and integrated standard KAS ports to help keep your base\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s part count down.\n\nNOTE: Please retire your existing TERRAIN scanners (unless you\u0027re savy enough to open your save file and replace PhotoSupplies with ResearchKits).\n\nNew Parts\n\n- Added the Gaslight Telescopic Lamppost. It comes with a 4-way KAS pipe junction.\n\nSaddle\n\n- Added a pair of integrated KAS pipes.\n\nOutback\n\n- If attached to a command pod that can hold crew, the Outback will have the ability to recharge its EVA Propellant.\n\nTemplates\n\n- Added the Blacksmith 3D Print Shop template to the Ponderosa. This will only be available if you have OSE Workshop installed (I recommend the mod).\n\n- Added a new storage template to hold MaterialKits.\n\n- Renamed PhotoSupplies to ResearchKits, and changed the icon.\n\n- Changed the icon for the Ponderosa Habitat.\n\n- The Battery template\u0027s EC levels have been nerfed; The Outback holds 154EC, while the Buckboard holds 611EC (comparable to a stack of three Z-200 batteries). Additionally, you\u0027ll need RocketParts and an Engineer to convert the Outback/Buckboard into batteries (which of course can be turned off using the Settings window). To convert the Buckboard/Outback into a battery, right-click the part to open the action menu, and press the \u0022Convert to battery\u0022 button. You can convert the Buckboard/Outback back into a storage container as well.\n\nOther\n\n- Created a wiki page describing how to add a template to the Ponderosa: [https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/Anatomy-Of-A-Template](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/Anatomy-Of-A-Template)\n\nBug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where the Buckboard would incorrectly show a ToggleAnimation button during EVA.\n\nRecommended Mods\n\nOSE Workshop: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-1-0-2-OSE-Workshop-MKS-KIS-Addon-%28v0-7-3-2015-06-01%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-1-0-2-OSE-Workshop-MKS-KIS-Addon-%28v0-7-3-2015-06-01%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Overjay","CreatedById":104131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T08:36:48Z","Content":"So just few days ago I saw OSE mod.
