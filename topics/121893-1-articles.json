Fluffed the landing of the second half, quick F9 and I realised my big mistake, was back with the first ship on decent. Worst bit is the persistent was immediately updated (I might have gone back to space centre too), so couldn\u0027t reload that to get at least the first landed ship back. Took another 10 attempts before the landing was not an explosion, but by then the second landing was easier because of the practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T17:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI already did \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663-1-0-x-Magico13-s-Modlets-%28Field-Experience-Sensible-Screenshot-etc-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDated QuickSaves forum thread (scroll down a bit, all my modlets are on that page)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/987/Dated%20QuickSaves\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDated QuickSaves KerbalStuff page (text is outdated)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDated QuickSaves does more than autosaves, it also renames your quicksaves to include information like the in-game date so you know how far back you\u0027ll go when you load it (with options for a few handfuls of other info), that way you don\u0027t lose the quicksaves as soon as you make a new one.
