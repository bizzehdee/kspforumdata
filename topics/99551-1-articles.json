RSS Stock Parts aims enable you to transition from playing stock, to full scale with a minimum amount of re-learning mechanics and installing additional mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat exactly does RSS Stock Parts change?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very simple, RSS Stock Parts simply adjusts the weights of the various engines and fuel tanks in stock KSP to fall in line with the relative Thrust to Weight and Wet to Dry mass ratios that actual real life rockets have. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really all there is to it. The only other parts that received any changes are the cargo bays, that had their weights tweaked to be more in line (though still heavier than) the new weights of the fuel tanks that they share dimensions with. Everything else stayed the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EHow exactly did I go about determining the new mass values?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started out by looking at the values of several well known and successful real life parts. The Saturn 5 F-1 and J-1 engines, the Space Shuttle SRB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and SSME\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, SpaceX\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Merlin engines, various Soyuz engines, and the Lunar Lander engines. I also looked at the Shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s external tank and the Saturn 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fuel tanks. After I had an idea of the range that the real life engines and fuel tanks fell into I went to the KSP parts and started dividing them into categories. For the engines, 1st stage lift engines like the Mainsail and KS-25x4 and so forth were matched up in TWR with engines like the F-1 and Merlin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (TWR of mid 80\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s to mid 00\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s generally) Upper stage engine like the Skipper and KR-2L were brought in line with the SSME\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and other similar engines (TWR mid 50\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s to mid 70\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s). And landing engines like the 909 and Poodle were matched with the Lunar lander engines (TWR\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s in the mid 20\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s to 30\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the fuel tanks I matched the dedicated rocket (1.25m, 2.5m, \u0026amp; 3.75m) fuel tanks up to fall in line around the Shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ET and the Saturn 5 in terms of wet to dry mass ratios, and then scaled the Mk3, Mk2, \u0026amp; Mk1 plane tanks to be slightly less efficient as they scale farther away from the rocket tanks. (Mk3 is fairly close, Mk2 with it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s lifting body starts to lose a fair bit of relative efficiency) Monoprop tanks were also brought in line, though they should in general be sightly less efficient than standard fuel tanks. Finally for the Cargo bays I simply made them weight 50% more than the same size of fuel tank to account for the mechanics of the bay mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETime for a few Example stats?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EENGINES\u003Cbr\u003EMainsail: Old Mass; 6.0  - New Mass; 1.6\u003Cbr\u003ESkipper:  Old mass; 3.0  - New Mass; 0.9\u003Cbr\u003E48-7s:    Old mass; 0.1  - New Mass; 0.08    (48-7s was very strong, so needed minimal tweaking)\u003Cbr\u003ENERVA:    Old Mass; 2.25 - New Mass; 1.75    (Best guess based off experimental NERVA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s TWR\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFUEL TANKS\u003Cbr\u003EOrange tank:             Old (Dry) Mass; 4.0  - New (Dry) Mass 1.2\u003Cbr\u003ENASA 14400 (Giant) tank: Old (Dry) Mass; 10.0 - New (Dry) Mass 2.7    (Fixed ratios being off for NASA parts)\u003Cbr\u003EMk3 Long tank:           Old (Dry) Mass; 6.0  - New (Dry) Mass 2.0\u003Cbr\u003EMk3 Long cargo bay:      Old Mass;       6.0  - New Mass       3.0    (50% heavier than long tanks due to door mechanics)\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat really is all there is to it.

With the pods as they are, it\u0027s rather high--since you have the real mass, but 39% of the surface area, that means your BC is 2.56x as high as real life. The higher the BC, the less you\u0027ll slow down high in the atmosphere, and the more you\u0027ll slow down in one big kerbal-squishing, metal-bending whump down low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the issue: when you\u0027re reentering on regular Kerbin, you\u0027re only going maybe 2-3km/sec.

Is it survivable? Sure. But it\u0027s a lot harder--both in terms of heating and Gs--than it would be with real ballistic coefficients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour other option, of course, is to multiply payload masses by 0.4 or so.
