Moreover, there is nothing special about how the rays are actually traced, and almost identical ray-tracing shaders have been used in mainstream games for a while, typically limited to screen-space effects. Screen Space Reflections (SSR) are done with a kind of ray tracing technique, where the ray is traced against the depth buffer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual bit of new hardware in RTX and upcoming RDNA 2 cards is dedicated \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBVH\u003C/a\u003E traversal hardware. This is critical if you want to be able to cast a lot of rays against level geometry. So for example, if you wanted to see a reflection of something that isn\u0027t otherwise in the shot, the ray traversal has to extend past the camera frustum, and then you have to rely on BVH to test for just likely intersections rather than trying to test ray against every single triangle in your entire scene. This is what takes ray tracing from niche use for a few FX to \u0022Holly crap, we can render the whole scene with rays.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice, however, you\u0027re limited in how many rays you can cast per frame, and that limit gets more strict as you increase the scene complexity. There is some poorly-optimized geo in Control, for example, that really tanks the frame rate in just specific shots. So while a game with simple geometry can be fully rendered in real time with ray tracing, if you grab any modern AAA game, you\u0027ll have to budget your ray casts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why most games currently use ray tracing for reflections, soft shadows, and global illumination (GI). These are areas where you can see the biggest improvements with fewest rays. It\u0027s not because the hardware is particularly good at doing these specific tasks. The graphics card doesn\u0027t care what you use a ray intersection test for. It just finds the nearest piece of geometry along the ray and gives you surface information at impact point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all of that in mind, back to the original question. Yes, you absolutely can set up a compute shader that runs ray tracing for every projectile in flight in the game and reports impacts pretty much instantly. You\u0027d probably want to set it up as part of your general rendering flow, which means you\u0027ll technically be getting results with a 1 frame delay, but the impact on performance will be absolutely negligible. But unless you have millions of projectiles in flight on every single frame, there\u0027s just no reason to do it. Performance impact of tracing projectiles is already negligible in a modern game. On average, an FPS game is going to do more ray casts to see what ground everyone\u0027s walking on to see what FX should be played. And yeah, that can also be offloaded to GPU. In fact, because of how efficient these cards are at traversing BVH, you can offload a lot of collision detection to GPU. The problem is, most games aren\u0027t CPU-bound these days. So if your CPU is already not running at 100%, why would you move work over to GPU which is usually the bottleneck?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133850\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@wumpus\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0makes a good point about multiplayer. Except it\u0027s even worse. No self-respecting FPS is going to do hit detection on the client. Anything you don\u0027t want people cheating on has to be verified by the server, and most game servers don\u0027t even have a graphics card. So anything to do with core game logic still needs to live on CPU, and outside of that, there isn\u0027t a whole lot you need to do on client side that isn\u0027t rendering, usually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more note addressing something that \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133850\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@wumpus\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said about DLSS. I would argue that while nVidia has been pushing that tech heavily, the reason they have hardware for it on RTX has way more to do with denoising than supersampling. It goes back to having limited number of rays to cast, so nearly all of ray tracing is stochastic. For example, say I want to cast a soft shadow made by large glowing sphere. A typical technique would be to cast a ray from a point on the screen you\u0027re trying to light towards the glowing sphere. If you hit the sphere, the point you\u0027re drawing is at least partially lit. Otherwise, it\u0027s at least partially shadowed. But how much shadow and how much light? Well, that depends on how many rays hit. In theory, if you could cast hundreds of rays from every point, you\u0027d have a pretty good light map. In practice, you sometimes have to live with just one ray per pixel on the screen, and you cast it towards the random spot on the glowing sphere. That makes penumbra hell\u0027a noisy. And it\u0027s the deep learning denoiser that turns this dither map into a nice soft shadow you see on the screen. And within these constraints, denoising does incredibly well. In fact, major animation studios are starting to switch to denoising for their production. Last year at Siggraph, I got to see the noisy frames from Toy Story 4 taken from the stage of pipeline right before denoiser. That looked so bad! It\u0027s like somebody intentionally put a noise filter over it, then decided it wasn\u0027t enough, and cranked up the gain.\u00A0But because denoiser has full access to the raw color, normal, and depth information, it can actually do amazing job reconstructing a softly lit scene with no discernible noise in final frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, that\u0027s the main purpose of including this piece of hardware on any ray tracing graphics card. In terms of how useful it is outside of that particular task, I don\u0027t really know. It sounds like DLSS was just an attempt to sell RTX cards in the market with so few games making use of the technology so far. Hopefully, with next gen consoles ray tracing will become common place. I don\u0027t know if it makes games look all THAT much better, but it can save us so much time, effort, and money developing games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-29T09:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat powers a Dalek?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-29T10:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223845927\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598677092\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a person A hold person C as a hostage by him as human shield at gunpoint to threaten B to drop his weapon (a classic situation of \u0027drop your weapon or I\u0027ll kill him\u0027), if B has been given clearance to kill A, disregarding what movies told us about this situation, if B shoot A\u0027s head directly that it causes an instant kill, is it possible to save C?

The vast majority of officer-involved shootings take place at a range of 8-10 feet (roughly 2.5-3 meters). At those distances, on average, 80% of the shots fired by officers miss. And that is, in the great majority, shooting as trained, at center-of-mass. This isn\u0027t because LEOs are bad shots. It\u0027s because adrenaline is a hell of a drug. So, amped up on adrenaline in a high-stress situation, taking a shot at a couple of square inches in the middle of a perp\u0027s forehead? That is definitely not Plan A.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven if you do achieve a incapacitating hit, the target may experience involuntary convulsions, which may include flexing of their trigger finger. They are also going to fall to the ground in an uncontrolled manner, in close contact with the hostage, with their finger inside of the trigger guard of their weapon.

Shot to the torso is the most reliable, as it presents the largest area with high stopping power and is the hardest to accelerate unpredictably, being tied to center of mass.
