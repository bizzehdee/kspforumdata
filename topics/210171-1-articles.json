In particular, the energy requirements (cycles of heating and cooling in the sorbent used to capture the CO2) make any system carbon-positive unless they can use purely zero-emission energy sources, which in turn reduce the availability (and drive up the cost) of those zero-emission energy sources in the market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224187991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210171\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666233414\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recall that current CO2 atmospheric extraction is chilling ambient air and drawing off the liquid components at their phase change temps.

These studies show that eCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E can promote the accumulation of soluble sugar including glucose and fructose, and the accumulation of antioxidants including ascorbic acid, total phenols, and total flavonoids, but reduce the levels of protein, nitrate, Mg, Fe, and Zn in products. In practice, it is advisable to enhance vegetable quality by (1) selecting species or cultivars that respond well to eCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E; (2) providing optimal environments together with eCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E; (3) harvesting vegetables earlier than standards set at ambient CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E; and (4) combining with moderate environmental stresses. The promotion by the increased carbon fixation and thus the precursor, dilution effect, stress induction, and limitation by transpiration or N assimilation can generally explain the shifts of vegetable quality under eCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E. However, research is still required to reveal the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms more specifically.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00924/full\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00924/full\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
