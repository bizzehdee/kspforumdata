There may be a way to divert it, but it requires launching into space a lot of complex machinery that\u0027s still fairly new and experimental. There are two options: 1) send it up in a manned ship so that there are people on site to repair anything that breaks down and/or doesn\u0027t work properly; or 2) send it all unmanned to keep the weight and mission complexity down, but risk not having anyone there to repair potential problems.

They have the advantage that we have a large stockplile of them and that they do not need to rendezvous with the object to work. They can be timed to detonate as they fly past. This saves large amounts of delta-V, which could make the difference between being able to use existing rocket designs or having to design and build entirely new launch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T15:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all in for nukes.
