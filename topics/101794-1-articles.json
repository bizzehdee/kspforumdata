Or if it belongs elsewhere, delete/move it so I\u0027m not cluttering things. Just know that I\u0027m not trying to find my problem (almost positive it\u0027s a memory error), I\u0027m just here to ask about an idea I had to fix it.\n\nAlright, now that that\u0027s all been said. For about a week now I\u0027ve been having a serious CTD problem about every 10-15 minutes. I\u0027m on a POS not all that awesome laptop. x32, 4Gb ram, 2.3GHz cpu speed. It\u0027s always ran KSP fine even with a ton of mods. But for some reason now this is happening and like I said above, I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s a memory issue. I\u0027m using ATM aggressive and on the part heavy mods I\u0027ve taken out most everything that I don\u0027t regularly use in my builds.\n\nAnyways, here\u0027s my question. In order to fix this issue I was thinking of taking all the parts I do use and putting them in a sort of custom modpack. Is this possible? For instance, could I pick and choose a few parts from the B9 pack and throw them in another folder with parts from say, BDarmory? It\u0027d consolidate my mods and hopefully I could pick out even more parts I don\u0027t use and toss them.\n\nAny help is appreciated, and again. If this belongs elsewhere or I\u0027ve not included something useful, either let me know or delete the post\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Cetera","CreatedById":109237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T17:46:58Z","Content":"I think the parts get referred to by the configs and dlls in the path that they are looking for. Maybe not all are coded that way, but I think you\u0027ll have a lot of issues moving parts to different folders.\n\nIf you need to, just delete parts out of the folders they are in. Once you have your game running the way you want, you can copy the GameData folder somewhere else as a backup, or to use as a base for a second install, or whatever. I usually make zipped copies of my GameData folder and archive them by KSP versions so I don\u0027t have to figure it all out again should I ever need to go back."}]}
