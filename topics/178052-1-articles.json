The biomes are always the same and one just move form one to another and do the same clicking. On the other hand the survey and part test contracts seem to be less popular. Interestingly they are the more sciency contracts - for the survey contract one is supposed to do science at places with special scientific interest, part tests are supposedly related to developing space technology. It seems greatly increasing the science award for these contracts, so that they become a valid way of collecting science, would address both complaints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did some tests with 10x science for surveys and 5x for part tests and it seems to work quite well. It would be even better if science multiplier also applies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-05T00:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223444909\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178052\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536039958\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182407\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheFlyingKerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, TheFlyingKerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems greatly increasing the science award for these contracts, so that they become a valid way of collecting science, would address both complaints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the science mechanic is very, well, mechanical as you say, the biggest complaint I have seen is that it is too easy to max out the tech tree without leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, increasing the contract rewards would just inflate this issue.\u00A0 Without a balancing nerf to the rest of the science collection mechanics, this would just make the game even easier.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 And nerfing the rest of the science just doesn\u0027t seem like a good idea to me.\u00A0 So while I agree that survey contracts should have more of a reward, the balancing offset to this would not improve the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for test contracts, I would think there would be a limit to how much science you should be able to get from testing a prototype part.
