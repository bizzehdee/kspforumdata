KSP is an arcadish simulator with a simplistic physics engine only capable of supporting relatively simple space craft without strutting it all over the place - but customers yearn for large, complex and sometimes absurdly powerful rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough of the physics point of view. Let\u0027s look at it from a commercial/consumer point of view - because that\u0027s what matters most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a customer, I have purchased this game, I enjoy this game - but I want to launch bigger and better rockets and payloads because I enjoy doing so. I want big, complex and intricate spacecraft with plenty of lights and moving parts, why? It\u0027s fun! But I can not enjoy the game that way because the PhysX engine is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot fit for this purpose.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of enjoying large and intricate spacecraft, I want reasonable frame rates; to help achieve higher frame rates the developers could load in the model for the payload inside the fairing gradually through the ascent or just before fairing jettison or in whatever what is deemed optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit if this game were developed by a larger software house or overseen by a large brand name publisher they would probably put a restriction on both spacecraft mass and number of parts to prevent performance and gameplay experience issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again if they had it were being developed by a larger software house they\u0027d probably look at multithreaded physics engine/GPU acceleration, or maybe clever ways to simplify the physics calculations simulated but still keep the simulated physics satisfactory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo by implementing the ideas suggested by Physcix there is a good chance of increasing performance and gameplay experience of the customer.

Ensuring object culling from the GPU is as efficient as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, Unity\u0027s physics engine is outdated while also being a heavily customized version of PhysX (part of the reason it\u0027s outdated; difficult to support). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience with the game, in order to save on computing time, a lot of the parts (rigidbodies) can start \u0027sleeping\u0027. This means that until some delta value is applied to them, no physic calculation is applied other than for the parent transform value changes (like pivot points, there is a hierarchy of objects made from the parts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis raises the question on how much KSP is really a \u0027realistic simulation\u0027 and how much is \u0027emulation\u0027. I believe, in order to optimize as much as possible, physics-wise, the latter is probably more true. In that perspective, I also believe that most of the discussions in this thread are moot. The OP\u0027s idea is definitely something that can be implemented and could be emulated correctly, just like how most of the computations are emulated now. Striving to go _100%_ realistic in KSP is asking to have a super-computer do the calculations with custom software. That\u0027s not even close to the realm of the possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, rendering wise, \u0027showing\u0027 what\u0027s inside the fairings, is _very light_. It\u0027s the physics that makes this whole engine lag beyond any recognition. As you might guess, \u0027emulating\u0027 the physics inside the fairings, with 0 rigidbodies inside, is definitely a huge-boost in performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end, my personal opinion is that I prefer a lag-free experience. KSP\u0027s emulation is darn good enough and can be tweaked but I don\u0027t expect nor believe it can ever be a simulation simply due to the engine\u0027s limitations in that particular domain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit; The poster before also tackles most of those points. \u002B1 to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T16:18:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PolishRenegade\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNewHope","CreatedById":76088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T12:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad!....

It was attached underneath it, and being pulled up by the command module, not pushing against it. The structure AROUND the lunar lander was holding the weight.

It may be an idea to have it also have built in counterweights. This would give it mass but also allow less balanced payloads to be balanced out by the fairing weight. There should be limits of coarse, but it is a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T18:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002242undead2\u0022 data-cite=\u002242undead2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut then it would have to load it once the fairings were separated, and that could take a big chunk of time, depending on the amount of parts under there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerfect solution: Load a \u0022Super duper launch camera view\u0022 so that on load, the game pauses, zooms in, and the fairings puff, open and the part floats out dramatically.
