It entered the atmosphere as a glider but when it got low enough for the engines to work (they require air as coolant), I switched them on and flew it down under power. It could land in the roughest dune fields anywhere on the planet up to about 2700m elevation, maintain about 6000m cruising altitude (reached about 15 minutes after takeoff), and could circumnavigate the planet without refueling. I was so proud of it I made equaling or bettering it the goal of the \u0022Flying Duna Challenge\u0022 linked in my sig.
