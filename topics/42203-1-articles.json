One would be textured white with the emission set to white, and the other would be same but with red. You can then put all the models in the same place (I\u0027ll make sure they fit) and swap the visiblity of the models and sprites. How does that sound?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still new to this so if anyone can think of a better way (like having more than one emissive colour, which I just thought of but I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s even possible) then let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-12T18:37:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2013 06:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
