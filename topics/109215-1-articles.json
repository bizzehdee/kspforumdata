It would be much worse control system design to have the system automatically shut itself off without user input; the controls are supposed to follow the user\u0026#39;s instructions, and in the cases you\u0026#39;re describing, the last instructions were to activate the control systems. They\u0026#39;re exactly the same as SAS in that regard.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nuclearping","CreatedById":92457,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T23:02:31Z","Content":"\nI dug a bit into this. Figured it is actually the Pitch and / or AoA which causes the problems. If you only have Pitch enabled, you can control the ship, it is a bit hard because it doesn\u0026#39;t really want to head the direction you want. But with AoA enabled it behaves really weird, as it doesn\u0026#39;t allow you to pitch your nose below or the artificial horizon or something.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI made a short video of what I mean (sorry, Kazam didn\u0026#39;t record sound and mouse):\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[video]https://youtu.be/OFQuMge129U[/video]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]After launch everything is fine as long as you are inside the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]But if you are in space and have the flight assists on, the ship starts to randomly spin and turn as soon as you disable SAS or set SAS to maneuver node for instance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Especially with Pitch and AoA enabled. But just AoA enabled will also cause the same effect.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]At one point in the video I was just holding W, but the ship bounced up and down. It did turn fine in all other directions (A, S, E, Q), but not W / S.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the biggest \u0022fool trap\u0022 here is that the settings are globally persistent across the sessions. So if you had them enabled because you were flying / testing an airplane some days ago and forget to turn them off afterwards, you are really wondering what is suddenly wrong with your KSP and you start doing weird things like deleting recently installed mods, creating new save game, etc. Until you find this thread ... :D\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T23:07:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nuclearping\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
