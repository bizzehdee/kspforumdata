Provided you know the optimal velocity (each ship has to be hit with more or less velocity depending on its design), and i know exactly what spot to aim at, every bloody ship can and will die (or at least get split in half) with a single shot unless its procedural, and well, the part count skyrockets the second i try procedural ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually have concluded that the only way to really make competitive ships is procedural style, those things (provided they are done right) are impossible to destroy without quite alot of ordinance (as you need to direct hit each module to kill it, and those modules can easily exceed your ammo capacity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and ive also stopped with my obsession regarding fighters, nolonger does every bloody AKS fighter have to go to laythe, land, and return to kerbin with 0 refueling and a full weapons load. Ive become content with ~3000 dV in LKO for fighters, at least these new ones arent 30 tons, and have some manuverability and pleasant TWR for interplanetary burns\u002Brapier rocket mode for combat maneuvers. the new HK-101 is just perfect with the exception of too much clipping making it explode when rammed or hit with any 80m/s parts. What id do for either a larger ion engine say ~10 times the mass and thrust of current one, or a smaller nuke with like half the mass/thrust and a much smaller size, especially in terms of length as the only way to make the current nuke look good is shove it inside either a mk1 LF tank, or inside a MK1-MK2 adaptor or inside some part that 100% conceals it with teh exception of the nozzle. I seem to have taken a liking to the nuclear rapier as i call it, a rapier with a nuke attached to the back and clipped in so just a small bit of the nozzle is visoible. This looks pretty (at least in my opinion), somewhat protects the nuke against weak ordinance as the rapier has a much better impact tolerance, and well, is very compact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T10:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeet the Monitor-Class Drekevak, designed to blow whatever capital ship your enemy has up, guaranteed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jCBURGU.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022jCBURGU.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T17:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alphasus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alphasus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is the first time its happened, Sharkman.

Practice and experience testing and knowing my craft\u0027s limits as well as careful planning even before the battle begins is what normally helps me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis battle was pretty much already decided before we started fighting though. Alphasus brought two smaller ships that, if they had the power of penetrating my ships, could have done damage, but they offset the balance of force between very light and quick to run out ships and heavy targets. While I brought four ships that were relatively similar armor class (84 to 117 tons), his use of two 140 ton ships meant I could focus on these bigger ones, thus making him use the lighter ships more than he\u0027d want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EMore importantly,\u003C/em\u003E the ammunition clustering of his fleet was focused on the two 140-ton ships, meaning if I took them out he\u0027d be left with only about 1/3 his total ammo, despite losing only 1/2 his ships. Sure, it might take me more shots, but in this way he\u0027d be left eventually with unarmed ships, forcing a defeat. Meanwhile I focused 4 missiles in the lightest and heaviest ship and 3 in the intermediates, for this reason: The lightest ship fires first, and if it isn\u0027t attacked it is often forced to take another attack later on in battle if the heavier ships are taken out first (I.E. my tactic against Alphasus - kill the 140 ton ships and force him to attack again with an underarmed light ship). This way the lightest ship can still have ammo left over, and since it\u0027s the lightest it\u0027s a one-shot use if it\u0027s destroyed later on, so there\u0027s no harm in making it light armor heavy weaponry. This is why your lightest ship should always be a light destroyer with many weapons and fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two intermediate ships were Kenji class, with 1 less popper (only 3) but 4 I-beams and the best D/V of the group. These ships could also take fire, but I knew they\u0027d be the ones most likely to be entering combat once or twice because heavy and light ships are targeted first. Popper ammo was an issue but being heavier I figured they\u0027d fight later in the battle line and so they wouldn\u0027t necessarily need extra ammo pools. The I-beam secondary armament meant they could also take out fighters, destroyers, and other smaller ships even after the main armament was exhausted, which I was planning to do to Alphasus once his heavy ships were killed- save Poppers and use I-beams on his lighter ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the heaviest ship was really just a 4-popper Kenji with large, lofted wing panels and no I-beams - it was designed to soak up fire and survive many hits (as it was the biggest craft many people like myself like taking those out first) and still be able to have a heavy firepower late-game. Knowing this ship would only really need to be used once, I nevertheless added 4 poppers so that in case it did have to be used again it wasn\u0027t undergunned, and range suffered but it was not a drawback as again, it was last to fire so worst case pieces get shot off of it and it increases the D/V, and it only really needs to maneuver once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, his two heavier ships were unbalancing his weapon capability, and even if he managed to score two kills with lighter ships I\u0027d have taken out his heavy ships first and he\u0027d be left without ammo facing two still-equipped Drekevaks. And that is why I win, not because my ships are better, but because the missiles are reliable and I always have a battle strategy mapped out before hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T20:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that and my missiles don\u0027t have the power to kill your ships at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T21:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alphasus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alphasus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, that and my missiles don\u0027t have the power to kill your ships at all.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/1zdra8m.gif\u0022 alt=\u00221zdra8m.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T22:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, to be fair my ships are not that much better than anyone else\u0027s (and are worse than Daemon\u0027s and Tegu\u0027s for sure).
