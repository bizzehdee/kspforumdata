There are two arrays within the module that seem like they might specify this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, is it possible to make a resource converter endothermic? That is, make it consume rather than produce heat? If so, how?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
