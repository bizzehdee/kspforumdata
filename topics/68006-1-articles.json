That simplified model works with engines where ASL Isp and vacuum Isp is relatively close together, like the typical 320-370 range for normal liquid engines. But ion engines are something else entirely, plus they consume electric power as fuel as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ion engine received the atmospheric Isp that it should have (around 10-20 at most, electric engines are utterly useless outside of a vacuum), then it would still have 2 kN of thrust. However it would also consume thousands of units of xenon per second and quite possibly tens or hundreds of thousands of Ec per second. That would mean just tapping the throttle would instantly shut down your craft completely, with no hope of ever gaining back control over it until you mercifully run out of xenon (provided you have some sort of power generation running). To avoid this kind of desaster, ion engines have the same Isp at sea level that they do in vacuum. Or in other words, they are the only engine in the game that doesn\u0027t get worse inside an atmosphere, which ironically enough is the exact opposite of how real world electric engines function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes the ion engine extremely broken for in-atmosphere use if you can somehow sidestep the issue of its abysmal thrust-weight ratio. Planes are predestined for that, because they largely ignore TWR while being predominantly atmospheric fliers. However, because of the way KSP works, there is absolutely nothing that can be done to remedy that without either changing KSP\u0027s atmospheric engine scaling model (which would change it for all engines) or returning the ion engine to more \u0022realistic\u0022 stats that are \u0022not fun to play with\u0022 in HarvesteR\u0027s opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, Near Future Propulsion (a mod based around electric engines) sidestepped the issue by hand-coding a plugin that reads out atmospheric pressure and artificially limits the thrust based on that value, effectively making its electric engines properly thrust-scaling without affecting any of the other stock or modded engines. If you have that mod installed, you can use ModuleManager (or editing the part.cfg directly) to add that functionality to the stock ion engine as well, since it comes conveniently packaged in a standard node format. Another solution could be ferram4\u0027s Kerbal Isp Difficulty Scaler plugin, which (among other things) allows you to toggle between fuel usage scaling and thrust scaling for all engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T07:47:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 07:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T07:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever had to sit through 20min of 4x physwarp transferburn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither have I and that\u0027s the problem here.
