So, as this wasn\u0027t a proper shut down I expected to have a few problems in my KSP saves.\n\nAfter having restarted the computer, I tried to launch KSP and nothing happened. Then I tried again doing a clean install and adding my previous GameData and saves folders, same result. For some crashes, I had the crash message and the crash folder appearing, without the game even showing, unfortunately those were lost when deleting my KSP\\_win folder (I\u0027ll try to get one of those again); but there was never any output\\_log.txt or player.log files created.\n\nFinally, I did a completely clean reinstall, straight out from the ksp-win-1-0-4.zip file, adding no backed up folder or file. And the same thing happened: no KSP, but this time, I had a crash folder, but still no output\\_log.txt or player.log.\n\nI looked at Windows\u0027 task manager and saw that, in the \u0022processes\u0022 tab, the KSP.exe or Launcher.exe appeared for a few seconds, and then disappeared, so the game actually somehow launches.\n\nThis kind of crash never occured to me before, on any KSP versions.\n\nKSP Win 1.0.4 32bit, .zip downloaded from the KSP website;\n\nSystem specs from dxdiag [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2d568q7zpqsmhj4/DxDiag.txt?dl=0) (some info is in French as my PC is in French);\n\nCrash folder [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pwzujobzietkztp/AAA-ugzpLBPmDKD7T3qxwHCBa?dl=0).\n\nThank you for any help, not being able to play KSP is quite frustrating. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nI will update this thread if I find any solution or if something new happens.\n\nIf you need any more info on this issue, ask and I will be happy to provide it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T00:08:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst**\n  \nSolved"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T22:58:04Z","Content":"The logs indicate that KSP was unable to start a graphics adapter, the first three lines show it tried, then crashed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Initialize engine version: 4.6.4f1 (99f88340878d)\n\u003E GfxDevice: creating device client; threaded=1\n\u003E \n\u003E Crash!!!\n\nAnd your dxdiag shows an Intel card but no driver, or if there is a driver it\u0027s not working correctly.\n\n    Display Devices---------------          Card name: Intel(R) HD Graphics Family       Manufacturer:           Chip type:            DAC type:          Device Key: Enum\\PCI\\VEN_8086\u0026DEV_0116\u0026SUBSYS_1670103C\u0026REV_09     Display Memory:    Dedicated Memory: n/a      Shared Memory: n/a       Current Mode: 1366 x 768 (32 bit) (60Hz)       Monitor Name: Moniteur Plug-and-Play g\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9n\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9rique      Monitor Model:          Monitor Id:         Native Mode:         Output Type:         Driver Name: Driver File Version:  ()     Driver Version:         DDI Version:        Driver Model: WDDM 1.1  Driver Attributes: Final Retail   Driver Date/Size: , 0 bytes        WHQL Logo\u0027d: n/a    WHQL Date Stamp: n/a  Device Identifier:           Vendor ID:           Device ID:           SubSys ID:         Revision ID:  Driver Strong Name: oem2.inf:ATI.Mfg.NTamd64.6.1:iSNBM1ML_PROXY:8.882.2.0:pci\\ven_8086\u0026dev_0116\u0026subsys_1670103c     Rank Of Driver: 00E60001        Video Accel:       Deinterlace Caps: n/a       D3D9 Overlay:             DXVA-HD:        DDraw Status: Disabled         D3D Status: Not Available         AGP Status: Not Available\n\nYou even have this in the dxdiag.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E DxDiag Previously: Crashed in Direct3D (stage 2).
