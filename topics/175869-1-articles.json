So my core question is, Is there a better way than just making guesses and playing with the maneuver node? I have no idea and just pull the node in random directions. A more procedural process? Making minor mid-course adjustments is fine, but just not full-on plane changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso something about the most efficient window AND when the planes cross or something like that.
