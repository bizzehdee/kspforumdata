I\u0027ve tried googling to no avail and it still works with other games, Fraps also picks up my voice clearly, just not KSP game audio. As far as I can tell due to having not much luck with Google this doesn\u0027t seem to be a common problem unfortunately. Any help would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T07:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I\u0027d be curious to see whether this is an issue with other Unity-based games as well... But regardless I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s a whole lot we can really do. I don\u0027t suppose you could try an alternative screen capture program, to see whether this is isolated to Fraps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
