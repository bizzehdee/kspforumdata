It doesn\u0027t show the drag if you use the f12 interface but its there allright. Even struts are adding quite alot of drag. I couldn\u0027t find the test thread but you can try it for yourself by creating a small rocket and adding a strut to the first rocket, while adding a small part that would weight the same as strut but still aerodynamically protected behind another part to the other rocket then launching them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Found the test for you here you go mate;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/370czg/psa_struts_create_insane_amounts_of_drag/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/370czg/psa_struts_create_insane_amounts_of_drag/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T20:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, parts that are marked via the part.cfg file as \u0022physicsless\u0022 have their drag added to the parent part.
