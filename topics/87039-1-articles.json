It doesn\u0027t add parts or a resource system, but a subtle, nice change. After playing for 200\u002B hours (as Steam has charted, not counting my demo time and my non-steam copies) I have gotten bored with the loading screen backgrounds. They are nice and I do appreciate the effort, but after clocking in so much time, they get boring and bland. I am asking for someone (or Squad to implement this, should they choose) to make a mod that will allow me to choose the loading screen pictures. This way, I could regularly change my loading screen images to say a blueprint for a design or whatever I so choose (and you too, for that matter). Thanks for reading this far.
