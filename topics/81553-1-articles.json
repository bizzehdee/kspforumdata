They are byproducts of a flawed aerodynamics system in KSP, in which control surfaces begin to \u0022flap\u0022 and produce thrust. The propellers weren\u0027t speeding the thing up, it was the control surfaces flapping out of control. As the craft gets faster, it\u0027s buffeted more and more by the air around it, which in turn causes faster flapping. This positive feedback loop can be terrifying, game-breaking, and \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for shamelessly promoting my videos all over the place, but here\u0027s some good things to do with infinigliders. The third Thing do Do with Infinigliders on the video... well, you thought \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E craft was doing crazy things. It\u0027s definitely worth experimenting with, as I think that you\u0027ll enjoy the results tremendously \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LeUNv4xj4s8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I enjoy your videos but they don\u0027t really belong in the \u0022Fan Works\u0022 section. There\u0027s an entire subforum dedicated to video-makers called \u0022Live from Mission Control\u0022 that would probably be a better place to put your stuff. In addition, for the sake of consistency, many YouTubers are condensing all of their videos into one thread which they update regularly; this might something to look into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice video as always Jatwaa, see you next time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
