Finally, I launch DSN B and DSN C at 120* intervals around Kerbin with the same antenna setup as DSN A but on a lander body. The way the system works (and it works quite well as the real system does) is that the TDRS network handles everything within Kerbin\u0027s SOI (including the Mun and Minmus) and then the DSN handles all interplanetary operations. If I need to boost my signal or have a \u0022backup\u0022 I may key in the TDRS satellites for my long-distance probes, but the DSN network usually has sufficient coverage except very early in the voyage to get 100% coverage.

Heck the programing in the control modules should automatically extend them to try re-establish radio contact whenever it loses it as its default functionality. Satellite dishes are a more complicated matter, but they should at least switch on and look for signals in the direction they are facing. No one designs a remote control device to just give up at the first sign of signal drop, it\u0027s just too simple and obvious (let alone expensive) an oversight to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeeding to have two devices of equal range also seems silly to me. If the transmitter is powerful enough to broadcast a signal to another planet the receiver on the other end shouldn\u0027t need an equal amount of signal gain to pick it up. If it\u0027s inside another devices broadcast radius it should receive the signal regardless of it\u0027s own range. Obviously with satellite dishes they should still need to be pointed at each other, but the range of the broadcasting dish with the control signal should be the one for which the transmission range matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first flight after installing this mod (which I love the idea behind btw) was a disaster. Here\u0027s what went down... Designed an expensive communication satellite to start building my initial network (and I try to stick as close to stock parts as possible, I have the sister mod that add the remotetech functionality to stock parts) and launch it got 2km up and lost signal... Seriously? That giant ass tracking station can\u0027t send command signals more then 2km? I\u0027ve built radios the size of peanuts that can broadcast further then that. Admittedly miniaturization technology wasn\u0027t always there but by the time we developed satellite dishes? The thing had solid boosters so when it tipped over that was that. Millions Kerbal dollar down the drain. Bad start for our space program. So the next flight we tried extending the antennas before we reached 2km height and they ripped off and down everything went... I\u0027ll take responsibility for that one. So next I designed a command rover with 3 Kerbals in it and stuck every kind of dish and aerial on it I could find, extended and activated everything. Bought out my launch ship, activated the dishes that wouldn\u0027t tear apart and pointed them at the command vehicle, pointed all the command vehicles dishes at the ship. Took off, landed in the ocean. We refuse to stick a Kerbal in one of our designs until we\u0027ve proven it can complete an equivalent mission unmanned first (e.g. probe in orbit before Kerbal, Rover on Mun before Mun walk) and I was just about convinced that with this mod that was impossible. But other people here on the forums were clearly doing it... Billions of Kerbal dollars in failed research flights later I stumbled on the fact the dipole antenna doesn\u0027t need to extend to activate and we got our first probe in space... I mean looking at it I\u0027d suspect the thing is more likely to rip off then some of the extended models but regardless what we learned is of all the omnidirectional antenna to choose from, every single ship has to have this model on it to get off the ground. Unless I\u0027m missing something obvious? Either way I couldn\u0027t handle the silliness of it so I modified every one to have a minimum range of hundred kilometers so the probes could at least break atmo and extend them, but I shouldn\u0027t have had to (also edited the weights to be more consistent with the stock parts).

When you know that you\u0027ve managed to maintain a line of communication while at the same time being able to maneuver a vessel under signal delay. It\u0027s not nearly as casual as stock KSP and a lot more dangerous; one miss step and you could send you\u0027r probe on a colision course with Duna, another miss step and you risk loosing contact with your probe forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding an emergency protocol has been suggested before, and in fact I\u0027ve experimented with adding one in a test build. But ultimately I found that it made the plugin feel too safe. I kept the \u0022willWakeInPanic\u0022 functionality, simply because it\u0027s a way of simulating higher-tier antennae. The bulky deployable antenna has this functionality, and is a lot more resistant at launch, mainly to make it an ideal choice for communication during atmospheric flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bremech","CreatedById":58844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T00:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CAPFlyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CAPFlyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyway, I was just giving you a suggestion and how I do my launches.

I\u0027ll look into handling the computation in the same way I currently handle the computation that calculates the shortest signal path.

It has both a ModuleRemoteTechSPU, a ModuleRTAnimatedAntenna (controlling the omni) and a ModuleRTModalAntenna (controlling the dish).
