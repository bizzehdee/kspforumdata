I decided to get off for little walk with both of them. After leaving the seat I noticed I could not move either one of them. No controls work. I have tried restarting game and I have also rebooted my PC after this problem started. Other kerbals can be controlled in EVA just fine. Rover has been there for long time and I decided to drive it again and they have been attached to chairs for long time (I think before 0.24 came at least.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInformation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion: Version 0.24.2 (Steam version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use 32 bit version\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods or plugin installed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8.1 64 bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i5-3230M @ 2,60 Hz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 Gt of RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENvidia Geforce GT 635M (with 2 GB)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are pics of situation: NOTE: One of the kerbals did not move even when he is outside rover, I moved rover before trying to EVA with another one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vZk74xF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vZk74xF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4AkEqhm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224AkEqhm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can download my savefile (ZIP folder, please unzip before using): (It has quite lot of stuff, Kerbals in question on the bottom of list (Edlo and Midlo IIRC).
