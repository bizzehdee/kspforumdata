If they try to walk around on a flying ship they just fall over like someone hit them with a stun gun. It\u0027d be nice if they were pressed up against a flat object with g force in the green zone that they\u0027d be able to walk on it. Then you could do things like spinning platforms to create artificial gravity or have a continuous thrust at one g to do the same. Also a part of that would be more tools for calculating trajectories assuming continuous acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ittiz","CreatedById":78645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T03:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one else cares about this?
