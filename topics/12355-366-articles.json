Once it was corrected Mech Jeb was able to place two into orbit, one after the other, no problem.\u003Cp\u003ENow, I also decided to see if I could place my new Zero-G Shuttle/Tug into space again. Did it once, by the skin of my teeth, with Mech Jeb, and wanted to see if I could do it again.

Failed. Tried. Failed. Most of the failures were engineering and design issues and I finally got one out of the atmosphere....but Mech Jeb not only continued to try to gravity turn but pointed at the planet. So I figured, okay, my design is the problem..let me look it over, add some more SAS, some duct tape, so on. Make it stable, give Mech Jeb more torque and so on.
