Repulsor lights were an easy fix. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the dust colours, basically, the biome dust colours are really bold, while the camera colours are very subtle. For example: 0.75,0.75,0.75,1 is three quarters of the way to full white. The output from the camera has far lower values, so when the two are averaged, the biome colour is quite dominant.

How can we get camera output less subtle? Unless I can make the camera usable on its own, then we\u0027re always going to have snowy particles, or default colored particles, in those improperly flagged areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been struggling for quite some time trying to figure out why the camera particles are so subtle that I can\u0027t even see anything when they\u0027re running alone, but the biome colors are super strong when used alone. They used to be moderately subtle before we introduced the camera, but now if I use them together I see very little effect from the camera because the errant flagged areas of the planet still display the wrong particle colors. The whole purpose of a camera was so that we could eliminate those issues. For that, we need a camera that isn\u0027t so subtle that the biome colors overpower it at every turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: okay, I was able to eliminate the subtlety by eliminating the division process of the colors on the camera, however I found that the camera only gave me a grey color. my theory right now is that is is being affected by the ambient light (I\u0027m testing at night due to the repulsor lights) and spitting out the grey because it\u0027s only getting a dark grey color in the first place. In the end, we\u0027re pretty much stuck. If we can\u0027t sample the terrain color without the ambient light affecting the output, then I\u0027m unsure how to make this really work properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Nope, I tested it just now during the daylight and I must conclude that the camera is not working properly at all. Using only the camera to grab the color information, other than the alpha value which I\u0027m pulling from the biome defines, all I get is a light grey. It seems that the camera will no longer output anything else.

Something for you to look at when you get a chance though is the interaction between the water and the repulsor fields. As it turns out, the frictionless behavior of the repulsor doesn\u0027t work when over water. You actually slow down quite quickly, and you get splash effects when your ride height is below 50 or so (didn\u0027t actually look at it, might be more like 35).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just going to ask how I could adjust the light origin to not be at the collision point, but if you\u0027re working on it then I\u0027ll leave that alone. I still intend to do some more fiddling with the dust which I\u0027ll merge in when you\u0027ve committed your light changes.

There are two modes that the dust colors can take. First mode, and this was the mode I built in to the DustFX class before merging with KF, is that the location of the vessel is taken and compared with the biome map. When the biome is identified it then compares the biome name with a set of predefined colors for the body and biome that the craft currently resides in, and then outputs the dust with that predefined color. The actual color of the biome on the biome map is not used if the predefined color is set properly, otherwise you\u0027d get some really whacky colors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second mode is using a camera. In the original camera mode a 6x6 resolution image is taken every few frames, culled to show water and local scenery only. The colors are then indexed and added to each other and divided by the total number of colors present. This gives us an average of the colors present on the camera. We then create a new color based on that information and pass that to the dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two different ways of handling this data now that it\u0027s been passed to the DustFX class. The first one is that the camera color (a subtle representation of those colors) is added to the biome definition-based color for the current biome and then divided by 2 to get an average between the two, and then passed to the dust. The second option is to simply pass the camera colors directly to the dust, however I still set the alpha transparency to the current biome defined alpha channel. This is the mode I\u0027m fiddling with right now actually, so the exact behavior is not yet set in stone... err... binary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T15:13:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, that\u0027s interesting.

I\u0027d like to fiddle over the next afternoon (by the way, what time zone do you reside in?) and see what else I can come up with to fine tune things, but if your latest commit was featured in that video, then as far as wheels are concerned it looks great. my tests have been solely on the repulsors because of the greater distance between them and the ground where the dust is being spawned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do wonder if some of the directional stuff you did with the repulsors could be applied to the wheel dust so that we don\u0027t get as much of the dust particles intersecting with the physical models of the wheels/craft, but I don\u0027t want to touch any of that now just in case I break it again. I think for 2.0 of KF I\u0027d definitely like to put more control into the configs to specify what happens when that specific wheel calls for a dust plume. For instance, I want parts like the screw-drive to occasionally throw up a CollisionFX-style spark out (complete with light and sound) as it travels over the terrain, as well as emitting dust plumes not only backward but also outward in a direction that would be consistent with its current rotation. So, in the future I expect to be swapping out the boolean \u0022isRepulsor\u0022 for an enumerated list of possible part-types that will have modifiers based on that type. I also enver did really get a good hold on how I might add more watery looking particles when hovering over water, which would also be needed for when propelling through water with the screw-drive. I \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E hate the stock effect for water impacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think we\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the splashes of color thing... I love color, but there\u0027s just one problem with that: matching. The reason we stick to greys, blacks, and whites is because they can fit together rather nicely. When you introduce color you exponentially increase the complexity of making something look \u0022right\u0022 in the context it is in. That\u0027s why i\u0027ve been bugging a number of plugin authors that have implemented a form of color-switching to their parts to expand it into a revival of KerbPaint. KerbPaint works for some still, but for others it really has problems. it\u0027s mostly due to the restrictions the recent versions of KSP (0.90 and onwards) put on certain shader-based effects such as glowy-outlines requiring AA to be active, which kills my machine. Glowy-outlines never killed it, but AA does so I\u0027m stuck without my glowy-outlines. The modding community here really needs a new spin on KerbPaint to be developed, and I ain\u0027t the one skilled enough for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T18:22:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T18:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I often forget to turn the music off when I video capture.
