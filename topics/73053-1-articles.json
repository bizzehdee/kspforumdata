Doing it this way, I can usually get the periapsis well above ground level before it\u0027s time to kill the thrust and cruise to apoapsis, leaving me a circularisation burn of just a few seconds. I do this with both spaceplanes and vertical-lift rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If I\u0027m doing a steeper ascent, I use the reduction of the climb rate to zero as a cue to when to switch from jets to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* During reentry, I try to hold my drop rate stable until 20,000m, then zero it out and hold altitude until I\u0027ve slowed enough to drop further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* During landing, vertical velocity matters a lot more to me than horizontal velocity. I can set down just fine at 200m/s or more, but it only takes a few m/s of excessive vertical velocity to seriously scuff the paint on your aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of these things you can approximate by watching the altitude meter and the prograde marker on the navball, but I find it a lot easier to do it by numbers. Particularly in the hypersonic range, a very small navball deviation can mean a large change from level flight. Doing it by monitoring the pace of change on the altitude readout leads you astray when lag slows down the in-game time rate, which happens quite a lot with my dodgy old laptop, particularly when flying fast and low over water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] Currently provided by Mechjeb, which did all my flight data before this mod; add vertical velocity and I could ditch the Mechjeb readouts altogether, saving a nice amount of screen clutter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T15:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Wanderfound:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those purposes, I use Kerbal Flight Indicators (also by DaMichel). It shows forward and prograde markers relative to a virtual horizon with much finer detail than the navball. The stock vertical velocity indicator is usually enough for landing planes and level flight even though it\u0027s not on a linear scale.
