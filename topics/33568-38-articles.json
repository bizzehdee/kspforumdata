The beep sound you heard was because you\u0027re missing those parameters when the Celestial Body Catalog opens and tries to find them but can\u0027t. When you start this release of KSP TOT, you can load the bodies.ini file I\u0027ve included in the ZIP. Also, the data in the bodies.ini file is stored with each Mission Architect MAT file, so you might need to start a new MAT file until I get an \u0022MAT upgrade\u0022 feature into v1.1.8.

Altitude is a foreign language to us. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s not something I often think in, but KSP defies a few real conventions for the sake of gameplay. If you want, I can add periapsis/apoapsis altitude to the tooltip, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
