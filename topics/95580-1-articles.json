Meaning if you get it into low kerbin orbit first, the lv-1 might just be able to get into mun/minmus orbit, but maybe not even that. Not like there is anything to do then anyway as its just a probe core, a reaction wheel, a battery and some solar panels. So lets add a mystery goo unit for science. Mass for the satellite core goes up to 230kg without engines/fuel tanks. Sticking to the 1 oscar tank, the LV-1 no gives 593 delta-v and the 48-7s 582 delta-v. Not enough to even get to the Mun for a fly-by. But interesting to note that delta-v difference at this point is negligible, with a whopping 11 more dleta-v for the small lv-1 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step, add 1 oscar tank to the setups. the bare satellite with 2 tanks and a LV1 engine now gets 1841 delta-v versus 1628 for the 48-s. You can land it on the mun/minmus, maybe even get it back to crash on kerbin but again no science or anything. For the goo setup the lv-1 gives 1036 delta-v and the 48-7s 1040, making the 48-7s the more efficient choice. Not that it can do much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso lets try with 3 tanks. Lv-1 gets 2285 delta-V versus 2111 on the 48-7s. Again adding a goo gives the lv-1 1384 delta-v to play with and the 48-7s 1414.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elastly lets compare the 2 engines with a round-8 tank instead. The LV-1 gets 1707 delta-v and the 48-7s 1486 on the bare probe. With the mystery goo added this goes to 936 for the LV-1 and 934 on the 48-7s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econsidering these numbers, is there *any* use for the lv-1 engine other then shooting a small probe core on a one-way trip to the mun or minmus? as soon as you add anything other then mass-less modules the 48-7s engine gives more delta-v. or is it pointless without a boost to ISP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T01:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s just say that the LV-1 needs to re-balanced...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe make the LV-1 have a bigger nozzle and give it a higher Isp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smartech","CreatedById":125691,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T02:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recommend reading those wonderful charts optimal engine choice for desired TWR and d\u003Cem\u003Eelta-v\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/iNqmQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

On very small/light probes, it does outperform the 48-7S. For instance, if you made a probe for contracts without goo/science jr, it would be mostly massless parts (ox-stats, comm16s, thermometers, Z-100s, etc), an OCTO or HECS (100kg), and fuel tank and engine. If you put one or two round8s on, the ant will give you more delta-v due to it\u0027s lower mass (or upwards of four oscars).

While I haven\u0027t landed on Eve yet, the math screams \u0022USE AEROSPIKES\u0022 for lower stages. Even on upper stages there is something like a 00.8% advantage over LV-909 *in the soup* and *using a command chair* (and orange tank). When I go to Eve, I\u0027ll bring aerospikes and LV-909 (of course, by then one of these could get buffed/nerfed). [note: according to kerbal engineer you shouldn\u0027t use the poodle on Eve. Use 4 LV-909s instead].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit: EVEN MORE WRONG! This is only true for verticle staging. As far as I can figure out, the rocket equation only considers the mass(empty) of the entire asparagus stage (i.e. no payload), so the fact that 48-7s wins without payload means it should be used for all lower stages as well. You aren\u0027t going to ascend Eve without asparagus staging, are you?]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the LV-1 could really use an ISP buff, most of the cult of the 48-7s is assuming that the mass empty part of the rocket equation will be similar on other craft as it is to the last probe stage. [EDIT: Nope. The 48-7s really is that good (although you probably want to have docking ports or other tech before switching to mass 48-7s use, it still doesn\u0027t like payloads).
