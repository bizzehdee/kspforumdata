Flight Recording. Record the flight with KSP itself without any other screen recorder, to watch it later! Okay, that\u0027s the first part, now for the second: I really get miffed when I watch KSP videos online *Cough* Scott Manley *Cough* and I right click in the window trying to rotate the view... So from here I make an expansion for the first part : When KSP saves the flight, it saves it not in a regular .MOV or .AVI or .MP4 but in a special format, to be later opened and watched in KSP itself that reanimates every single moment of the flight, letting the viewer to freely change the view, alter the warp speed, open the map at his own will , and without giving him any control on the rocket/spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you didn\u0027t understand any part of the idea, and/or found anything wrong I would like to read a reply \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E :D \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T18:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how many times this has been suggested over the past year in one form or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I am all in favor of this since I too have suggested this several months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
