Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could as well redirect the tachion beam to the warp core using a nanoflux radiation so jerody la forge can see the radyon emissions with his visor... technobabble to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T06:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look into the 1st newton law it says: If body rest motionless or if it moves constant speed there is no force applied.\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A8Second newtons law says that if you aply force body will accelerate constantly.
