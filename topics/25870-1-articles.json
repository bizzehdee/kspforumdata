Actually it\u0027s not really a question. I\u0027m just \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elooking for someone to confirm if I\u0027m using the right approach when designing my spacevessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always start al my designs by defining a mission or goal. For example: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch from Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fly to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Deliver payload to Mun surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Return to Kerbal orbit and await new payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasicly I need to design 3 craft to complete this mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the lifter (Kerbin to orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the transporter (Kerbin-Mun-Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the payload (which is a simple lander in this case)(Mun orbit to Mun surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now it\u0027s all about the delta v when designing the spacecraft, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lifter needs 4500dv; I assume thats right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transporter needs 2140dv. (860 to reach the Mun \u002B 210 to establish orbit. and then I double this to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emake the return trip but I don\u0027t know if this is correct.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The payload needs 640dv to land on the Mun. (one way trip)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that to build the lifter with the neccesary dv, I first need the weight of the transporter and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe payload. So I start building backwards. Payload first, then Transporter and finally the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the Kerbal engineer redux mod show me the dv when building. But that\u0027s not going too well. It\u0027s showing me the dv of the transporter without its payload. So thats\u0027 nowhere near correct. Is there a mod where you can enter payload weight and then recalculate?

I can\u0027t remember the exact numbers off the top of my head, but I think it takes about 3000-3200 m/s delta-v to get your initial apoapsis up to about 70km (assuming a good ascent profile). A lot of that initial delta-v takes place in the atmosphere, so I design my initial stages to deliver a little bit less than 3000 m/s of atmospheric delta-v. The circularization stage takes another 1200-1400 m/s delta-v, but that\u0027s all at vacuum, so it\u0027s easier to calculate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few sat-map probes that work out almost perfectly for calculating this. The first stage is just enough to get up to 75km, the second stage is just enough to circularize, the 3rd stage is just enough to get to Duna, or Eve, and the all the fine tuning after that is done with an ion engine. I\u0027ll try to launch one of those later today and see just how much delta-v is needed for each part of the ascent. I assume there is an easy way to calculate this based on atmospheric density, ISP, and TWR, but it seems just as easy to monitor how much delta-v is expended at each step.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T16:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steamypete\u0022 data-cite=\u0022steamypete\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETransporter needs 2140dv.
