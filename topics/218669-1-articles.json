take the heat with them, and so you replace it with a cold particle, it needs to be heated back up. so lost particles represent a huge\u00A0 energy loss and are an efficiency hurdle to fusion power generation. the loss rates will get ever smaller, but i very much doubt they will hit zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhot particles are harder to contain than cold ones, since they have enough energy where they can zip right on through containment if the conditions are just right. so take an extremely robust containment system spun off from fusion tech, run it with a colder plasma, and you could get the loss rates way down. but not zero so you are going to have to deal with a lost particle every now and again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

feed in only one direction. when one looks at the complexity of regular old rocket plumbing, then realize you have to accomplish the same feat entirely with magnetic fields, one realizes the magnitude
