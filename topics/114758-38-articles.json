I had three goals in mind:\n\n- Create a gameplay incentive to build on a planetary surface, as opposed to KPBS modules having identical functionality in space.\n- Give airlocks a practical gameplay purpose.\n- Keep supply management simple.\n\nThe recent release of MKS-Lite provided some inspiration. MKS-Lite introduced \u0027Dirt\u0027, a resource abundant on all planets and required to operate the \u0027Agricultural Module\u0027, restricting its use to planetary surfaces. I decided to replicate this arrangement for KPBS, but without the additional complexity of MKS-Lite (I prefer the simplicity of \u0027dirt \u002B mulch -\u003E supplies\u0027, without involving fertilizer/organics). Airlocks are used to collect dirt (but only with an engineer on-board), based on the idea that an airlock is necessary to facilitate the frequent excursions \u0026 hauling of materials necessary to gather soil for plant cultivation.\n\nI\u0027m quite happy with the result, so I thought I\u0027d post it here for others who might be interested.\n\nThis patch adds the functionality described above for the KPBS greenhouse and airlocks:\n\n    @PART[KKAOSS_Greenhouse_g]:Final{\t@RESOURCE[Fertilizer]\t{\t\t@name = Dirt\t\t@amount = 0\t\t@maxAmount = 500\t}\t@RESOURCE[Mulch]\t{\t\t@maxAmount = 500\t}\t@RESOURCE[Supplies]\t{\t\t@amount = 500\t\t@maxAmount = 500\t}\t@MODULE[PlanetaryGreenhouse] //supplies output 0.000225 = 4.5 Kerbals\t{\t\t@INPUT_RESOURCE:HAS[#ResourceName[Fertilizer]]\t\t{\t\t\t@ResourceName = Dirt\t\t\t@Ratio = 0.01\t\t}\t\t@INPUT_RESOURCE:HAS[#ResourceName[Mulch]]\t\t{\t\t\t@Ratio = 0.0001 //2 Kerbals\t\t}\t\t@INPUT_RESOURCE:HAS[#ResourceName[ElectricCharge]]\t\t{\t\t\t@Ratio = 6\t\t}\t}}@PART[KKAOSS*airlock*]:Final{\t@description = Airlocks are essential for tasks requiring frequent excursions.

The Dirt option (or something similar) would allow players to continue using the parts in space, but ensure that surface usage has a clear advantage. I actually kind of like the idea of using KPBS parts as hab modules on an interplanetary ship, which are then landed and reconfigured into a planetary base upon arrival. If you decide to condone use of the parts in space, I would love to have a CLS-passable version of the Bi-Cupler (it would obviously need to be much thicker to plausibly accommodate crew movement through it).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You could simply let greenhouses extract Fertilizer from the ground, or something.

I seem to recall debates over simply using \u0027ore\u0027 for a similar purpose.\n\nMining Fertilizer from the ground would still require adding resource definitions to make Fertilizer present on planetary surfaces. Also, the concept of harvesting Fertilizer from planetary surfaces may be confusing or immersion-breaking for some players. Frankly, I\u0027m not a fan of Fertilizer in the first place - it doesn\u0027t really add meaningful/interesting gameplay, it just requires the player to do extra math to calculate the optimal ratio of supplies/fertilizer/greenhouses. Moreover, mulch (Kerbal poop) and fertilizer seem conceptually redundant.\n\nUsing Ore would avoid the need for new resource definitions, but - again - may be confusing or immersion-breaking. Also, it forces the player to bring a mining drill to cultivate plants, which is a bit odd.\n\nI like Dirt because it\u0027s intuitive and allows for a harvesting method separate from drills (e.g., airlocks in my patch above).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hint: screw-up is in Connected living space module implementation in the config for the parts. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIndeed, looks like there\u0027s a missing {.

This is one of these mods I think is a \u0022must\u0022 in the game. The only thing I miss is the possibility to have a workshop module to create parts needed for the base survival. I mean, when I arrived EVE and mount the base, I opened all my solar panels to charge batteries and all of them were immediately destroyed by wind forces. So the base stayed with no energy production and three frightened kerbals. Then I tryed to add compatibility with \u0022OSE Workshop\u0022 mod and it worked fine, but I think a big Workshop module to create big things would be great! \n\nThe compatibility was as simple as add a cfg file to the Config folder with the definitions (for the science part).\n\n@PART[KKAOSS\\_Science\\_g]:FOR[Workshop]:NEEDS[Workshop]:HAS[!MODULE[OseModuleWorkshop]]\n\n....\n\nIf you need more information pm me. \n\nRegards.\n\nOSE Workshop: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-0-90-OSE-Workshop-KAS-KIS-Addon](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-0-90-OSE-Workshop-KAS-KIS-Addon)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T08:30:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi!\n\u003E I want to thank you.
