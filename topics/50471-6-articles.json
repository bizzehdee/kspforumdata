Nothing to do with this mod. I was building a realistically 0.65 rescaled Saturn V on stock KSP scale and i encountered this problem. Rocket total mass was about 1200-1400t and launchclamps could just not hold on to it on loading the launchpad. They will collapse, the rocket would fall and break itself. I had to turn on \u0022unbreakable joints\u0022 from the cheaty debug menu (\u0022ALT\u002BF12\u0022) everytime, to prevent this. And even just to keep the rocket from dancing the lambada, I had to design special reaction wheels built into the rocket itself that had 1000 torque, and it will still wobble, but at least it will somewhat point up during first stage ascent. Second stage on is rock solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem i have with this mod which is bugging me now is the way objects on the ground behave when focusing back to them.

Noticed already 5 times that a rocket on the launchpad, when reverting back to launch after an unsuccessful one, it will reload several metres from the launchpad. Effect seem to be time-related.
