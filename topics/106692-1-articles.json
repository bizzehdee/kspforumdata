Here\u0027s what I think can be done to make it better.\n\n1. Resource overlay: persistent settings (per planet, per resource). If I set up a cutoff and pattern, It means that I would like to see this resource map for this planet exactly like that, without tuning it every time. I\u0027d like it to be saved.\n\n2. Narrow band scanner\u0027s GUI: autoupdate. It doesn\u0027t need to be drawn on every OnUpdate or something like that. 1FPS for the map would do just well. Clicking refresh-refresh-refresh-refresh isn\u0027t fun.\n\n2.1. Ability to save the resource map with coordinates, say, in Science Archive, under separate tab, \u0022Exploration\u0022 or something like that.\n\n2.2. Synergy with the contract system: ability to generate an empty/generic mission for the saved region. 0 science, 0 rep, 0 funds, but what\u0027s important, a nav point on the surface for me to easily find the spot I liked and land there.\n\n2.3. Maybe new part to make photos of said spot and save them - how cool would that be! Target the navpoint, click \u0022take photo\u0022 and if the site is visible, render high-detail terrain image as seen from the current position.\\* Maybe a part which would make an elevation/inclination map for said spot. All linked together and saved under the same folder inside Science Archives: \u0022Site Duna-XYZ-789\u0022.\n\nSee the workflow? Make a scan, save location, create a mission, take photos from different angles and radar scan from orbit, then send small rover to find/confirm exact hotspot and closest flat terrain, then send a refinery. What do you think?\n\n\\*Bonus points to developers if it would also allow to take photos of satellites, ground bases and celestial objects in the same manner."}]}
