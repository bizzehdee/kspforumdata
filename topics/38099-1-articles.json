CubeSat is a standard, and parts are readily available. There\u0027s a company out there that actually makes CubeSat thrusters, in a variety of types (electric and monopropellant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno if 3_bit is talking about launching a 1U directly into a lunar transfer orbit, but the problem I examined was getting a 3U from LEO to lunar orbit on its own, unassisted by other vehicles. Time-consuming (CubeSat-scale electric thrusters produce thrust on the order of mN), but doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ballpark price tag I came up with for such a mission was about $150-$200K, and that was with significant margin to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T15:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Epic DaVinci\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Epic DaVinci\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReally? that little? i take it your talking about using a pre-built launch vehicle and cubesat design so development costs are not factored in?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s estimated hardware costs.

I crunched the numbers on this when I was examining it, and to reach orbit around the Moon from LEO takes about 4 km/s, which equates to anywhere between 2-2.5 kg of fuel for an electric thruster (and a whole lot more for a monopropellant engine). That leaves you with about 1.5 kg for structural elements, comms equipment, the engine itself, and mission payload. The vast majority of that will be taken up by structural components and the engine, so you\u0027re left with maybe a few hundred grams for mission payload and comms gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cypher_00","CreatedById":61486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T18:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe love the 7 million stretch goal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E$7,000,000:Ten CubeSats with networking capability placed into optimal orbits by CAT engine, establishing the first interplanetary internet and paving the way for total solar system domination.
