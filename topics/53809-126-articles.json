The only problem I have had with the beta ATM was a load freeze whenever ATM went to cache the coolrockets directory \u0022cryo-2m\u0022. It may be a coolrockets issue, but it is one that seems to occur in its interactions with ATM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote: for anyone who cares, none of the coolrockets config entries referenced the #2 cryo or ice directories as far as I could see so I deleted them and the issue went away and ATM seems to cache the other two directories just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
