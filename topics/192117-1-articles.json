If you could share this picture with us, it might make it easier to identify the mod(s) in question. A picture speaks a thousand words, as the saying goes. There would be plenty of help if you were interested in making a mod for these parts, check out the Add-on Development subforum for more information!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-09T19:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTantares has some bubble-shaped pods.
