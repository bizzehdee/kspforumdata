I usually fix this with struts, but those makes the parts count skyrocket, and isn\u0027t always efficient enough, which leads to a huge workload for the pc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I suggest is this: Certain parts should fuse during construction, if they are put together the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if two fuel tanks are stacked on top of each other (not if the fuel tanks are attached to the sides, that should be an unstable build), they could fuse together into a single hexgrid, which would make standard rockets much more robust. If it is also made so that engines are fused with fuel tanks and stack separators, multistaged rockets would be much more stable (right now they are wobbly as all hell, and building them can make your rockets break very fast, unless you use struts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly parts that are the same diameter should be able to fuse to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harguinxx","CreatedById":76917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T12:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmmm you give me an idea... what about a part called soldering ring, if you attached it between two parts they become rigid until enough force is applied, then they simply break, without wobbling...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso guessing why these is not the vanilla way to break things, I mean, I don\u0027t see real spacecrafts wobbling with no sense, or NASA filling things of struts trying to avoid this effect...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewobbling mechanics in KSP have just no sense...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-03T12:06:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2013 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Harguinxx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T13:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECombining parts for optimisation purposes is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat not to suggest list\u003C/a\u003E.
