It\u0027s a spotlight, pointed downwards so that you can see their thrust when you\u0027re close to the ground. What Kaeyr96 appears to be looking for is a point light source that will light up the ground and the craft at the same time. To do this, you change the light.type = LightType.Spot; to light.type = LightType.Point;. You could also offset the t.transform.position so that the light comes from the bright centre of the flame rather than inside of the engine bell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very weird to see a massive flame coming out of the back of your rocket, but have that side of the rocket be in complete darkness.
