I think he wants some sort of particle effects that are also a light source.\n\nI don\u0027t know, it sounds like you\u0027d have to modify Emissives or create a \u0027lightbulb\u0027 node to the engine model. Both are huge amounts of work."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:07:43Z","Content":"The engines already give off more light or flame in space then they do in real life."},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:30:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Both are huge amounts of work.\n\nDo you have any factual basis for this?\n\n[Here\u0027s the code to do it](https://github.com/pizzaoverhead/RcsSounds/blob/master/RcsSounds/RcsSounds/RcsSounds.cs#L190-210), as used in [RCS Sounds](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52896) to add light effects to RCS thrusters.\n\nEngines already have a single light source. It\u0027s a spotlight, pointed downwards so that you can see their thrust when you\u0027re close to the ground. What Kaeyr96 appears to be looking for is a point light source that will light up the ground and the craft at the same time. To do this, you change the light.type = LightType.Spot; to light.type = LightType.Point;. You could also offset the t.transform.position so that the light comes from the bright centre of the flame rather than inside of the engine bell.\n\nIt\u0027s very weird to see a massive flame coming out of the back of your rocket, but have that side of the rocket be in complete darkness. This would be a nice plugin to have, and an easy first mod for someone to make.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T15:50:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:24:08Z","Content":"Sounds like a neat idea, I would also be interested in seeing a mod made for this."},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:40:56Z","Content":"Tajampi has taken up the challenge and made the mod: [Engine Lighting](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109845-142-engine-lighting-151-little-config-update-13-october/).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-31T20:46:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2018 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead**\n  \nUpdated link for 2018."}]}
