Ive got the SSME from the shuttle engines pack and that is way under powered for my shuttle. Im going to be sending up nuclear transfer stages with this vehicle and out of the nearly one hundred engines i have I found that the 68c suits me the best. Large power, no tank butt and relatively light compared to others of the same performance. However.. i got half a mind to rip the engines out of the CSS now and see if there more powerful then the shuttle pack\u0027s. Thanks again Yanfret. \n\nIts interesting for me because the reason i like your parts pack the most isnt exactly for the crafts you build. There great, but I personally just love seeing what i can do with the amount of diversity you offer here. And its something i hope more modders do in the future instead of adhering to \u0022stock alike\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T19:50:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Well","CreatedById":145290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T20:08:39Z","Content":"My first lunar mission, beautiful !
