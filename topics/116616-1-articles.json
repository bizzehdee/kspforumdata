Didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feel like waiting for a proper window. Sent them on the scenic route past Eve. The wasted Dv was supposed to be made up by a fancy aero capture, except I set the entry too high and had to use a lot of fuel to set down safely in the lowlands. Sent a rescue mission that landed 8km away from the first. Opened the service bay and deployed the solar panels to recharge. Switched ships and used the last of the fuel to hop to the rescue ship. Now the problem is when I started walking the crew to the rescue ship I noticed solar panels all over the ground. They were fine before I switched ships. Must have happened when physics were applied during switching. So how do I fix them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure Kerbals can fix solar panels.
