Didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feel like waiting for a proper window. Sent them on the scenic route past Eve. The wasted Dv was supposed to be made up by a fancy aero capture, except I set the entry too high and had to use a lot of fuel to set down safely in the lowlands. Sent a rescue mission that landed 8km away from the first. Opened the service bay and deployed the solar panels to recharge. Switched ships and used the last of the fuel to hop to the rescue ship. Now the problem is when I started walking the crew to the rescue ship I noticed solar panels all over the ground. They were fine before I switched ships. Must have happened when physics were applied during switching. So how do I fix them?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:13:39Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure Kerbals can fix solar panels. If they can, the kerbal would need to be an engineer of a sufficient level.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf you really want them fixed...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Quicksave your game, then go in the quicksave file. There, you will find your craft somewhere down. fine the corresponding solar panel in the craft and there should be a line that is something like \u0022stateString =\u0022 or something like that. In that case, after the equal sign, there should be \u0022BROKEN\u0022, just change it for \u0022EXTENDED\u0022 , return in the game and quickload, the solar panels should be fine then."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:28:39Z","Content":"Thanks.

[/alanis]\n\nIn atmospheres, solar panels have been nerfed anyways - they generate considerably less power than in a vacuum. I tend to use RTGs or fuel cells if I can get away with it, or have to run a rover or somesuch. Otherwise you need way more OX-STATS than is practical to do anything."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T20:44:47Z","Content":"Service Bays are problematic. Typically, you only want to use the center of those and not attach anything outside that\u0027s next to them, even if attached to a part on top or below the service bay.
