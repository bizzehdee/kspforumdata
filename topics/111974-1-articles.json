So im curious can i do better? Any suggestions if you have built a plane that can go faster than this and still be stable? \n\nRequirements;\n\n1.Plane should be able to reach a certain altitude and keep that altitude within 2k margin without speed loss.\n\n2.Plane shouldn\u0027t overheat enough to destroy parts while going max speed at the optimal altitude.\n\n3.Plane should have enough fuel to do a Kerbin circumnavigation.\n\n4.Plane should be able to reach the desired altitude and speed under its own power. So no rocket boosters or vertical takeoffs.\n\nHoping to improve my design with your suggestions. Ty in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:57:26Z","Content":"Well, I would imagine 1500-1550 is pretty much the most reasonable sustainable max speed range one can expect in atmospheric flight - and that only at the very high altitudes. I\u0027ve build small RAPIER test jests that go 1600\u002B in a slightly lower environment, but they eventually melt. Turbos, of course, are worse. I\u0027ve gotten one to around 1500 before, slightly sub 20k, but it doesn\u0027t last long at that speed at that altitude (again, heat).\n\nMost of my tests were very small and light probes stripped down to minimal fuel for absurd TWR. After some testing, I found that making the plane larger (adding more engines) would increase theoretical top speed - but it would just incinerate the plane even sooner. Precoolers everywhere helps - but it doesn\u0027t stop the eventual overheat. \n\nFor maneuverability, I\u0027ve found that basic elevons used as elevators, tail fins, and canards are enough to handle super high speed flight.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T18:13:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 06:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prepper-Jack**\n  \nTypo"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:21:35Z","Content":"Whiplash and RAPIER will never exceed sustained level speeds of 1.8 and 2 km/s respectively.

I was just asking if someone has a better design without exploits like the cargo bay exploit. I know using that exploit you can even reach 2000m/s. Well hopefully someone will come along and share his design."}]}
