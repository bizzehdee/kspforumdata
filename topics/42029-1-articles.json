If you orbit counter clock wise and your escape vector lines up with the prograde vetor of Tylo your alltitude above Jool will be relatively high compared to Tylo at the point of escape . At the same time your velocity will be higher aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is to point the escape vector like 45-90 degrees away from the prograde vector of Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T15:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAccording to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E optimal for Tylo to Bop is 249m/s, Tylo to Pol is 261m/s.
