It happens on every occasion, as soon as I start KSP up. The launcher seems to have the same problem. It makes ksp unplayable because I can\u0027t really fly anything when every click I do on the screen makes the game get \u0027stuck up\u0027 for a split-second. I really would like to know if there is a fix or imcompability issues that happened with 1.0, because in 0.90 I ran the game at 30fps and now it is also at 30fps, but with this game-breaking phenomenon that gets the game to hang up foor an isntant. Also when I Tab-out I can\u0027t get the game to show up again, even thought it is on my taskbar. Double-clicking KSP on task manager has no effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy games is fully stock, out of the Installer. I don\u0027t know if installing it makes it do this, but it might be important. The game does not crash at any point, it just hangs up until I force-shutdown the game. I never heard of anyone having this problem either, so I\u0027m at a loss for what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6gig RAM (I know ksp can\u0027t use more than 2.5gb or so)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD Series Radeon HD 7670M\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessor : Intel\u00AE Core i3-3120M CPU @ 2.50GHz, 2500 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4lZOkLwPTe7WHBhbVRWZmlGcEk/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoutput_log:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T19:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaplingPick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESolved!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, okay, the log says you are running KSP from the desktop, unfortunately this is known to be bad as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Execution_Prevention\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDEP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E can prevent KSP from working correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe copy on the desktop will now be flagged as potentially malicious, so moving it elsewhere won\u0027t help, the OS will still treat the files as a risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get around this, copy the whole folder to a new place that isn\u0027t protected by DEP, we recommend C:\\Games as you make this file yourself and Windows has no control over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe copy should work, once you\u0027re sure it\u0027s fine you can delete the copy on the desktop, and make a shortcut to the \u0022new\u0022 KSp.exe, the shortcut can be on the desktop and will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the problem persists let us know \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try that, will let you know if problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T15:26:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaplingPick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUPDATE:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopying over KSP to C:/Games didn\u0027t work.
