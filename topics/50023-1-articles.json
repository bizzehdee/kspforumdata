But determining how much of the deviation should be introduced at the start is the whole science. Because you need it to end with circular orbit without escaping (that happens when the deviation is too small) or crashing back to the surface (that happens when the deviation is too large).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity turn can be used for landing, too.

Gravity turn is way to conserve fuel. People usually don\u0027t care much about fuel when leaving low gravity bodies because their TWR and fuel reserves are high enough. Maybe on Tylo it may play some role. Otherwise what\u0027s in KSP usually called \u0022gravity turn\u0022 is just very rough approximation of one which is used just to avoid atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimum launch trajectory is not horizontal. Not even close. If you launch horizontally, you crash into terrain way before you get enough speed to overcome gravity.
