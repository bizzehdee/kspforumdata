I took it into orbit around the Mun and brought it safely back to earth. I figured I was now ready to actually land on the Mun so I made a couple minor alterations to the rocket (basically added landing struts and an RCS). However, this new rocket swerved out of control on launch. I verified that all the new parts were symmetrical and to make a long story short I basically tried removing each new part one by one to see which was causing the stability problems. But even after removing all the new parts (so that it was exactly the same as the rocket that successfully made it to the Mun) it was still swerving out of control. I reloaded the original (good) rocket and again had successful launches every time. As a test, I removed a single part and then reattached it exactly as before and the rocket started swerving out of control again. So the exact same rocket which was working beautifully 1 minute earlier, suddenly stops working if I simply remove and reapply a part. From what I can tell, nothing has changed with the staging or symmetry. I\\\u0027m kind of lost right now. Has anyone else experienced this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guard13007","CreatedById":30274,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T05:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had strange things happen like this too, nothing nearly as severe, but for example, my Battlehog (plane design based on A-10) used to launch perfectly and suddenly sticks to the pad, and used to fly really well, but suddenly has a few random issues for no apparent reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpha game is in alpha, what can I say?
