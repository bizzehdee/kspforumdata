Nothing much to see, it\u0027s not a viable propulsion system due to the low thrust and extreme power consumption - if I want a practical VTOL I\u0027d go for [heavy lift choppers](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118652-The-Mosquito-of-Doom-Multi-Mission-Synchropter-My-first-rotary-wing-aircraft-in-KSP-1-0-1-02) or tilt rotor craft which are easy to make with Infernal Robotics. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVJ8pScGdjk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
