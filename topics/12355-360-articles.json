BDArmory provides me with a 500km load distance and it works great. So good I nearly hit myself for not having tried it awhile ago. And to make it even better MechJeb WILL split into two entities and control each craft individually. The only hurtle now it seems is the MechJeb LandingGuidance doesn\u0027t seem to want to reverse the trajectory to boost back to the KSC. Ive already done it manually. Works just like it should. The problem here is having to switch back to a craft that\u0027s a 100km downrange. It will explode. Or try too. So I need to set the first stage booster to auto land then switch back to the second stage ( which is what I really need to put the payload where I want it ) while there still close together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd its strange somehow I can switch to and from craft within the atmosphere.

You want the direction of approach to be somewhat aligned with the orbital direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Docking Autopilot the \u0022trick\u0022 is to set the ship you are docking *to* to KILL ROT in SASS. That makes MechJeb attempt to keep the craft from turning in any direction. If you set both to TGT\u002B and try to use DAP, both ships will try to chase each other\u0027s targeting corrections and they\u0027ll both be wobbling all around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a highly maneuverable docking craft, DAP is now good enough that it can usually figure out how to fly around another craft to a port on the far side or otherwise not in line of sight or directly aimed at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the default safe and starting distances are causing trouble, use the overrides. I generally use 5 for safe and 10 for starting. Starting the docking from too close can cause DAP to try to fly past the port. Back up a ways then try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T11:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy prefered lazy / relaxed mode SmartASS assisted manual docking: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet target (larger) vessel to ORB, \u002B or -NML so that any orbit induced rotation will be on the docking axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitch to docking vessel and get close, possibly using \u002BTGT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZero relative velocity using TGT \u002B/-RVEL and main engine, trim with RCS foward/back translation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget destination docking port and set TGT -PAR, use RCS translation to get into alignment.

I was hoping to come back to KSP after about a year off, and find that Mechjeb was workin great!. Sadly after reading a few pages it seems not to be so. So I love KSp..spent about a few hundred hours in it, but nerver made it to the far planets because .sadly i suck at docking. I can land, orbit, even launch small stations, landed a plane on minmus.. Had Tons of fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E So as i start to play again..cause there is really nothin like KSP for me,If anyone out there cares, is there a good docking Mod. really..sigh.
