If you hit Alt\u002BL does the staging light switch between green and purple?

If no to all those, you have simply lost control of your probe ship, probably due to lack of electric power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf yes to those, ie you still have power, you have either a problem with your controls or a game or windows bug. Check your keyboard as well as any joysticks or controllers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf no to the first question, ie if the pitch, roll, and yaw indicators are all centred, does your rocket have multiple engines, does it use fuel lines, or is it asymmetric? If yes, you probably have an unbalanced thrust or weight that\u0027s throwing it off course. If no, you may have a \u0022phantom force\u0022 in your craft. This is usually caused by parts clipping into each other. Try and redesign your ship to minimise clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
