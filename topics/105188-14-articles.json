Sadly soon after during bleeding off speed for re-entry, the heat shield ejected for an unknown reason. As Flight Commander, Val made and executive decision and ejected from the capsule to attempt orbit with her E.V.A pack. She ran out of fuel before completing orbit and fell into the atmosphere at 4000\u002B m/s. Her death was not in vain as she saved Bill and Bob from a fiery demise.\n\nWell, that was a wall of text lol.

Thanks, Squad for another excellent update!\n\nI\u0027m pluggin\u0027 and chuggin\u0027 through the tree and the building upgrades. I find the cost/reward balance to be just right. Not too easy, not too grindy. Good job on the transition from the early to mid-game. The expanded tech tree soaks up the science, and the building upgrades seem reasonably priced.\n\nThe new heat and aerodynamics add new challenges which are fun and challenging to work through. I\u0027ve had to revert more than a few times getting my launch profiles nailed down. Lesson learned: get out of atmo before obtaining orbital velocity. The previous \u0022horizon at 50k\u0022 ascent has exploded more stuff for me than anything else. Getting stuff back intact from Mun and Minmus is a bit trickier as well. ~34k periapsis seems to be the sweet spot for lowering the apoapsis without vaporization.\n\nThere are a lot of rescue missions, which I like. Perhaps too many though. I\u0027d suggest upping the tourism % and lowering the rescue % on contracts.\n\nI\u0027ve unlocked planes, but haven\u0027t messed with them yet. That will be tomorrow\u0027s focus.\n\nKudos on striking the balance between fun and challenging in the early game. I\u0027m looking forward to getting the tech for interplanetary missions unlocked and seeing how the mid to late game transition works out. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alizerin","CreatedById":126590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:03:19Z","Content":"I\u0027m in love with everything about the update, but man - I cannot seem to go to space today.
