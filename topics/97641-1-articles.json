When moving at \u0026gt;100m/s (even perfectly horizontally, or approaching the ground very gently), it is impossible to land, at least on the grassy area around the KSC. This turns many possible landings into crash landings if the runway is missed, even for resilient craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hills and mountains behind the runway, and most areas of Kerbin, do not appear to have this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft begins to \u0022land\u0022, falling through the ground:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8E3oq5M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228E3oq5M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft passes through ground before exploding:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZKdFRye.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZKdFRye.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-25T00:40:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2015 12:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheLastMonkeylander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T11:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your Terrain Detail set to?
