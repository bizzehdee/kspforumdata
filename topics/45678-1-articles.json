(YAY) Anyway, I have been messing around with the Kethane mod and I have been able to get 2 probes into orbit around earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 1 on the Mun, And also sent a ship to drill and retrieve it but crashed upon taking off of the Mun. But I\u0027m having extreme trouble figuring out how to drill and reuse the kethane, And how to mine it from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost Below either some ideas or advice on kethane mining, OR post pictures of your crafts/mission screenshots of what you used to complete your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso post some craft files if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to help people that are wanting to kethane mine.

This way, in the case of the Mun, you wouldn\u0027t have to haul the stuff back to Kerbin all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your refinery, you\u0027ll want to make sure your converter has direct access to a fuel/oxidizer tank, as Kethane, Xenon, and Monoprop can go anywhere but LF/Ox must have a proper connection, be it by placing the converter on a stack with a fuel tank, or by running lines. This way, you guarantee your fuel conversion will work; I am not sure how the converter treats docking ports on stations with fuel tanks elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T03:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of engineering, the easiest would be a fuel station in kerbal orbit, a station in Minmas orbit, a lander to harvest on minmas, and an orbital freighter ferrying between the two. Minmas has such a low escape velocity it is really easy to get kethane into orbit. Once in orbit it is really simple to use nuclear engines as a fuel efficient way to get to and from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OgreMagi","CreatedById":103767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T11:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went with the miner/processor/refueler MPR, as one unit and a fuel tug ( large fuel pod with LVN atomic rocket) to move the pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe MPR is a lander with 4 kethan pods 4 fuel pods a single processor and the usual assortment of pods, I used a 4 LVN skyhook rocket system and added 5 Large solar panels and a couple large batteries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI land and full up the MPR make a full load of fuel and max my kethan, launch to orbit and wait on the fuel tugs, fill them processing the remaining kethane to fill my tanks so I can land again then send the pods back to kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun works out the best all in all, Minus is a low energy return but it take a lot of delta v to get there, while the mun is higher gravity it think it is a better trade off as it is closer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eworking on a similar system for eve, duna and plane to take it all to jool\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
