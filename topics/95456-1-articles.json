The only clouds on laythe are thin, icy cirrus clouds. There is almost a constant breeze, that shapes dunes on the sandy islands. There are lots of geysers, sheet ice, and laythequakes on Laythe. Geysers dot the landscape, occasionally releasing steam that quickly condenses into water, and runs offshore into the salty ocean. Large sheets of slushy ice glide by in the oceans, and build up at the shores. They mostly come from the poles, where ice is abundant. Laythequakes are common, happening at least once every day (on Earth). You can hear the soft rumble, and see the dunes slowly flatten. More rarely, about twice a year (on Earth) a stronger quake occurs, and the geysers go crazy, exploding all at once, throwing sand and steam high up into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI picture Eve\u0027s atmosphere to be visibly thick, thick enough to obscure the surface, but there are rare breaks in the clouds that reveal the surface.

The gravity is so low that each step is basically a short spaceflight, and since there\u0027s no atmosphere, there no feeling of resistance to help dispel the illusion that if you just jumped real hard you\u0027d fly off into space. So I think it\u0027s sort of an agoraphobic\u0027s worst nightmare, especially when out on the ice lakes with kilometers of flat, featureless chemical solid around. Total silence too, of course, since you\u0027re in near-total vacuum, but after reading the description the seismic sensor gave me, I always imagine that if you\u0027re standing still on one of the lakes you can feel constant, distant vibrations underneath your feet as really deep portions of the chemical stew cracks and heaves under its own pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the real \u0027land\u0027, I think that there\u0027s a bit of an icy glaze over everything, like on a cold morning where your front yard is covered in a layer of frost. It\u0027s greenish, of course, but so thin that you can still detect the base color of rocks, etc. Any misstep and little rocks are sent flying and flying before the minimal gravity brings them back to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Minman night, I feel like there\u0027s just enough reflected light from Kerbin to make things slightly visible as that glaze shimmers and the lakes turn more \u0027blue\u0027. Except on the side facing away from the planet, where I think the term \u0027dark\u0027 is redefined. In the day, I think the place literally sparkles, as the sun ever so slightly melts some of the frost and maybe the very, very top layer of the lakes. Things get slippery them, and while there\u0027s no real \u0027fog\u0027 in my imagining, landers and bases are gradually covered with a fine coat of Minmus-ice that gives the Kerbonauts fits climbing up ladders and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T11:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToxic rain on Eve forming puddles in the ground, heat distorting the shape of the landscape, ocean currents that glow in the dark, thick fog periodically reducing solar panel efficiency and limiting visual range.
