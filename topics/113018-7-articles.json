The mod has been updated to be compatible with KSP v1.2.2 with this latest release of Solaris Hypernautics v0.5.4!!!\n\nAlright, that\u0027s enough grandstanding. Onto what got changed around for this update beyond actually working in the latest version of KSP. Existing parts have all been moved to their corresponding categories that were introduced in KSP v1.2, so Electrical, Thermal, etc. Similarly the added comms functions, like hibernation and Kerbnet, have been added to all the corresponding parts. The Nuclear Fuel Pod and the Dust Refinery have both had one attachment point ever so slightly moved for better alignment and connectivity.\n\nA very big thank you to user [**Putnam**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125984-putnam/ \u0022Go to Putnam\u0027s profile\u0022) for providing the coding required for CTT integration, or Community Tech Tree. With this file, the mod is fully compatible with the two largest tech tree mods, the other being ETT or Engineering Tech Tree. Thanks again [**\u003Cu\u003EPutnam\u003C/u\u003E**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125984-putnam/ \u0022Go to Putnam\u0027s profile\u0022) for your big contribution!\n\nOne final major fix in this update was the Specialist Bonus that was causing major issues with a resource conversion efficiencies. It has now been remedied so all parts will return to their previous efficiencies but have a minor bonus when the craft is crewed with an engineer. This extra bonus is small, but it can still help when trying to maximize the efficiency of ship-wide systems.\n\nWell there you have it, the wait is over.

Well to address the concerns, the nuclear jet and scramjet were originally meant to have dual fuel modes, but I later dropped the idea. The descriptions are left overs from back then. To be fair though, since you brought it up I may just reintroduce that feature in again. Thanks!\n\nNow the other matter involving the catalyst engines and their dust modes producing no thrust. That is actually how they\u0027re meant to work, drawing in atmosphere to filter out the dust and store it. Its meant as an easy and quick way to collect large amounts of dust for processing without collecting it from the solar wind. And as a result of the drawing in, the thrust will show as a negative.\n\nThanks again for the second looks!\n\nPS, I\u0027m fiddling with a couple last features before updating the mod, to everyone."},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T23:39:35Z","Content":"Solaris Hypernautics is back!
