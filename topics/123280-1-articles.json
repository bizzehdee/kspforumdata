But I just kinda feel the need to say it because of how deep I used to be into this game. After about 820~ hours of KSP since May 2014, I am officially retiring from Kerbal Space Program. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E I\u0027m finished with the game and I am hanging up the pilot wings for good!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not dying, I\u0027m not quitting video games. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENothing\u003C/span\u003E is wrong with KSP, the game is fine, the 1.0 update was great. It feels weird. But... I feel like I\u0027ve accomplished everything I wanted to accomplish in this game. I\u0027ve been to every planet and every moon countless times, including most of the outer planet mods. Taking off, building new rockets, landing on planets, trying challenges, new mods, I\u0027ve done it ALL. And I just don\u0027t feel the same fire or enthusiasm to play this game anymore. I took a good long break for a while and came back but I still don\u0027t feel much of a spark. And finally I came to the conclusion that I am finished with KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think my whole life of 25 years on this planet have I ever felt like I was totally finished with something! But KSP, that\u0027s it! It\u0027s funny, but I feel satisfied with my time on KSP and it feels like it\u0027s time to move onto new things, both on and off the computer. It\u0027s weird because it almost feels like closing a chapter in my life with the amount of time I played this game. So yea, this is it. But thank you SQUAD, for making this wonderful and educational game on spaceflight. We need more kids enthusiastic about the exploration of space. I thoroughly enjoyed this indie game and put more time into it than the AAA, big-budget titles out there. And I will always recommend it to others that haven\u0027t tried it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it wasn\u0027t time consuming and I had the motivation to do it, I was thinking of having a send-off, fly all my ships into Kerbol like the series finale of Battlestar Galactica. But let\u0027s say I did it in spirit! I will probably drop by the forums from time to time and continue watching Scott Manley videos here and there. But, I feel like I\u0027ve had my dose of KSP, and now it\u0027s time to retire. Good luck to you all! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T09:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI bet you will be back for 1.0.5 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T10:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImagination exhaustion.

I completed going to all moons and planets yesterday with my marathon of probes. And now I\u0027m empty. After finishing exploring everything I expected to get a note \u0022you\u0027ve done it all\u0022 or a contract to explore something special, but nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got over 1000 hours in game. I built bases, stations, SSTO space planes, pushed asteroids, pulled asteroids, threw things back at Kerbin, made cars, trucks, a quadroengine thing with kOS which stays up just by controlling the engines and much more. I have the feeling that there is not much to explore left. And exploration takes time, too much for me right now. (Have a look \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=2249127\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2249127\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027ve written about it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes me wanna stop playing also the little things. The lack of polishing, an empty Kerbin, the stuttering when flying my 100 parts rocket up through the atmosphere and seeing the heat effects kick in. I have to rely on MechJeb for all bigger projects, because otherwise its uncontrollable. Kerbin lacks roads, bridges, settlements, quarries. SpaceStations and Bases lack a reason for existance, even though this shall change, I still can deny the contracts and do it without. A game has to be rewarding. First time making an orbit all alone, this is rewarding. First time docking in space without Navyfishs docking alignment mod: It is rewarding! But after that it becomes annoying. I remember my first landing on the moon. That was a really good feeling! But since then it\u0027s all been the same. I always wanted to make a craft that can get back from Eve to orbit. But it\u0027s just too hard for me and I lost interest, all the testing, all the failures and then the bad performance, it took the fun out of it. And I don\u0027t get what ion engines are for now. It takes much too long for a dV change with them, not fun for me. The Nerfs aren\u0027t as good either. Ever did a 5 minutes burn? Boring, very.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not about KSP or Squad at all. I still love this game. It taught me so much about space, space exploration and travel I would have never learnt this on my own. I love showing it to other people, showing them how a rocket works and watching them making their first orbit and to see them having the same rewarding feeling afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now I\u0027ll let it rest. I will test the new parts. I really love building planes. And now that I\u0027ve got my own point of interest (a landed asteroid) on Kerbin I will fly over and \u0022analyse\u0022 it with a rover. But I think I\u0027ll let it sit until 1.1. I love planes, but I also love cars and cars will be better in 1.1, not in 1.0.5. And maybe a good multiplayer will get me back. I love the idea of playing with others and learning from them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robcro","CreatedById":152494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T10:50:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould you still be quitting if each time you started career there was a new solar system generated by a seed which was not laid out straight away in the map screen meaning you had to explore it with telescopes and probes?\u003Cp\u003EWell good luck to you in whatever you move on to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats an amazing idea.

I have no life, and thus, 2000 hours of KSP under my belt. I haven\u0027t played seriously in a few months, but as soon as we have the Unity 5 update, I\u0027m diving back in, with all the mods I\u0027ve ever dreamed of, and no more OpenGL, which sometimes drags my framerate into the teens, with two 780s in SLI!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a break, then come out of retirement, Sedativechunk! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T17:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP burnout ... happens to everyone I think.

While I agree that Squad\u0027s parts all seem part of the \u0027set\u0027 these days, I don\u0027t think this argument holds water in the face of the diversity of awesome mods, which were after all part of Squad\u0027s vision for their end product, and which broaden the scope of KSP tremendously. I\u0027m part purist - I love stock KSP - but on the occasions when I think it gains something from a mod that\u0027s not present (I deliberately avoid the word \u0027lacking\u0027) in stock, I would much rather use the mod than see Squad do their \u0027official\u0027 version of someone else\u0027s idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game has enough issues for Squad\u0027s devs to be working on without reworking mod concepts into stock parts. As ever, imagination is the key - I don\u0027t see any part as a shortcut, I see them all as opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Hot tip - I recently noticed that the newer landing gears can have parts attached to the wheel trucks, which stay in place when the gear is retracted)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
