If you install FAR (Ferram Aerospace Research) mod, then apart from all the other stuff it does, it also eases the control surfaces. But, because I get many complications with FAR, I rather play without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is there any way to reduce that sensitivity like FAR does, but without actually fully installing the FAR mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T11:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo u know your keyboard has a capslock?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei heard that helps in case you didnt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T12:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lammatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lammatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edo u know your keyboard has a capslock?\u003Cp\u003Ei heard that helps in case you didnt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know they already mentioned it?

For those without joysticks, holding alt will enable you to set trim. I find this useful for fine maneuvering as well as it is somewhat smoother than caps. Just remember to press alt-x after you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
