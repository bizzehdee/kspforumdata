Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build an underwater base near KSP, and staff it with at least 13 Kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFurther, you must build a launch pad at this base, and successfully launch a rocket from it, into a stable orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could also, for extra fame and glory, build a transport truck with wheels or tracks to travel between KSP and the underwater base.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor extra points... you must recreate this base on another world with water... \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFurther..... totally extra points, up to 1 million, will be awarded for the best base name.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs always, Mister Phelps, if you or any of your team are compromised, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of you.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPhotos please..... or it never happened. :) (video would also be acceptable)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nedit: Mission Impossible TV series (1960\u0026#39;s vintage) references because for some.... this will be an impossibly easy mission... but we shall see. :)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T05:19:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 05:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kiwi1960\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cikho","CreatedById":128274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T10:19:39Z","Content":"\ni don\u0026#39;t think you can anchor things to the sea bottom due to buoyancy.. and clamps not working..\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fluburtur","CreatedById":152556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T10:41:55Z","Content":"\nYou greatly underestimate the power of....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=1]\u003Cbr\u003E\ndramatic effect\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=3]\u003Cbr\u003E\nORE TANKS![/SIZE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/SIZE]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T06:48:55Z","Content":"\nExactly...

THE SUBMERSABUS for getting back and forth and/or examining Kerbin\u0026#39;s inner core, but I think if I do this challenge, I\u0026#39;m gonna make something with a more substantial payload bay.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022silver\u0022][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut yeah. Flubby is right. Full Ore tanks (especially radial ones), some jet engines, RTGs, possibly small monoprop tanks, the small retractable landing gears, and maybe some other stuff can be used as ballast. It may also be possible to clip lots of things inside a payload bay to the same end.\n"}]}
