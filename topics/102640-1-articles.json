So I had to move Unity. I deinstalled and reinstalled the program (latest versions both)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a much larger drive. The last part I made (a bullet shaped tank) ran hideously slow in KSP. I found a directory with a tremendous number of temporary files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed the 20 part tools and load the 23 tools on top of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blender files are no longer recognized by Unity, not old files that previously worked that it recognized, and now not fairly simple files,. I\u0027m thinking I have to completely scrub Unity from my system, there is some file cached some place that is creating a conflict, but where and how do I fix it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did manage to load 1 part, but the part had no texture and when it showed up in KSP is was invisible (it was based on the same blend file previously used). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that nothing worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone had a similar problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPdate: I removed blender and Unity with about 16GB of space on my SDD. (I found a bunch on Unity files on my Public user directory which I had to manually remove freeing up 4GB of disk space in and above what I previously reported). As soon as I installed Unity on another disk, 4 to 5 GB immediately disappearred. I previously have completely removed anything having to do with Unity from the system, and the unity files are not in the Public User directory, so . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResolved (I hope): Both are reinstalled, I managed to make a test fuel tank amazingly in KSP a pentagon shaped tank can do a SSTO, no accounting for aero, lol. Whatever Unity has added to the C drive, I cannot find, it has not grown from its original state. I suspect what happened in the first place is that Unity overwhelmed the SSD and started glitching out, it probably place a few poison-pill files around that kept it from running properly. By removing everything and changing completely the installation directory, it couldn\u0027t find the pills or I removed them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T04:13:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T04:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you installed Unity 5, it\u0027s probably the realtime GI cache that ate up the storage space. by default it can eat up to 10 gigs.
