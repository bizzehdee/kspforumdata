So I had to move Unity. I deinstalled and reinstalled the program (latest versions both)\n\nIn a much larger drive. The last part I made (a bullet shaped tank) ran hideously slow in KSP. I found a directory with a tremendous number of temporary files.\n\nI installed the 20 part tools and load the 23 tools on top of them. \n\nThe blender files are no longer recognized by Unity, not old files that previously worked that it recognized, and now not fairly simple files,. I\u0027m thinking I have to completely scrub Unity from my system, there is some file cached some place that is creating a conflict, but where and how do I fix it? \n\nIt did manage to load 1 part, but the part had no texture and when it showed up in KSP is was invisible (it was based on the same blend file previously used). \n\nAfter that nothing worked. \n\nHas anyone had a similar problem?\n\nUPdate: I removed blender and Unity with about 16GB of space on my SDD. (I found a bunch on Unity files on my Public user directory which I had to manually remove freeing up 4GB of disk space in and above what I previously reported). As soon as I installed Unity on another disk, 4 to 5 GB immediately disappearred. I previously have completely removed anything having to do with Unity from the system, and the unity files are not in the Public User directory, so . . . . . .\n\nResolved (I hope): Both are reinstalled, I managed to make a test fuel tank amazingly in KSP a pentagon shaped tank can do a SSTO, no accounting for aero, lol. Whatever Unity has added to the C drive, I cannot find, it has not grown from its original state. I suspect what happened in the first place is that Unity overwhelmed the SSD and started glitching out, it probably place a few poison-pill files around that kept it from running properly. By removing everything and changing completely the installation directory, it couldn\u0027t find the pills or I removed them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T04:13:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T04:42:02Z","Content":"if you installed Unity 5, it\u0027s probably the realtime GI cache that ate up the storage space. by default it can eat up to 10 gigs. Use Unity 4.2.2 for better compatibility with KSP, and not have to worry about running out of disk space because of GI precalculations.\n\nUnity requires FBX plugin for Blender in order to import \\*.blend files. removing/reinstalling blender probably resolved that issue."}]}
