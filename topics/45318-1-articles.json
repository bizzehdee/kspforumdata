The Guppy Mk 1 has a single LV-909 engine boasting about 1900 dV, making Mun flybys a fun and easy trip, especially since all Guppies make orbit with the upper stage center stack at least half full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll Guppies share the same solar arrays and a Z-4k battery to ensure that even on long Munar nights, power is still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img30/7906/b2f3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b2f3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuppy Mk 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img208/1276/j4g1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022j4g1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Guppy has landing legs!

This rocket does not use asparagus. That was on purpose and I made that clear in the OP. The rocket uses onion and pancake staging to be friendly and easily troubleshootable by new players. Experienced players can take the Mk 5 to Duna and back and probably still have the dV to go to Minmus and back. These are simple, elegant craft built to be noob friendly as well as useful in the hands of a pro. Lots of people can do what you did. Look at my ribbons. I can do some pretty impressive stuff. I am familiar with, do use, and can orbit 120\u002B tons with asparagus but asparagus staging is complicated to understand just by looking at the staging and is often difficult for newer players to use. Also, I consider it a challenge to make a highly effective rocket without using asparagus. It is a fun and refreshing exercise. I am building a station on my livestream in a million mile high orbit without using asparagus. It is very nice to know that you can do good things with minimalistic asparagus designs. What can you do without asparagus? I can build a station. What can a new player do with asparagus? A lot, including crash and burn many times as well as excellent feats like yours. THe idea was to make it simple to noobs. Most people here apreciate the efforts others go through to make stuff simpler for newer players.

RIght now, it lifts the Guppy Mk 5 at 22.2 tons to LKO with just barely over half the core of the upper stage full. It uses an LV-T45 so that is enough to kick start the transfer burn or even set up a Mun encounter. It could probably orbit 25\u002B tons, but I was more concerned with orbiting the 22.2 necessary to orbit any of the guppies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDev note: Modifications are coming along and I may have a new release by the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T17:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome thread-making skills ^^ liked the idea of Guppy though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T18:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting close to Guppies ver. 1.1.
