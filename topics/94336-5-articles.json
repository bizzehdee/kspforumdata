Basically right now the only good way to do it is with MM configs. If you look in the \u0022SupportedMods\u0022 folder under CCC, you\u0027ll see what I have in there so far. Each of those little code blocks for MM are what is needed for each part. It\u0027s even more complicated when the part doesn\u0027t already use the \u0022MODEL {}\u0022 syntax, because then you have to add that for the actual object\u0027s model in addition to the dome (the MRS configs are a good example of this). So I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to universally add them without a serious plugin, and that probably also excludes an easy file where you can just add parts by ID. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nifty little trick I did, is that for the blue domes on the SpaceY engines, it\u0027s using the SpaceY fuel tank\u0027s texture rather than providing a new one with CCC, so no space is wasted if you\u0027re using CCC without SpaceY.
