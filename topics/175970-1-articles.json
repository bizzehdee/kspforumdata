So, I \u0027d like to request a new contract type to be made to promote this kind of craft. I know that the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102771-14x-impact-impact-science-and-contracts-v163/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EImpact!\u003C/a\u003E mod adds a similar type of contract, but it requires a separate craft to record the impact, but I find that to be a bit tedious, not to mention unrealistic. What I\u0027m looking for can be described/designed as a contract that requires you to either crash a space probe directly into a celestial object, or do some science while on a collision course with a celestial object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
