I\u0027ll land a landing pad (big square of panels with the cylinder structural pieces underneath) with a small probe/parachutes/engine coupled on top. After landing, the probe/parachute/engines module takes off and explodes somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed that after landing, the craft is listed as \u0022Splashed Down\u0022 in the tracking station and everything is fine. But once I decouple the probe on top, it\u0027s now listed as \u0022Landed\u0022 in the tracking station. If I try to load it up, it\u0027ll look good for half a second, then it\u0027ll drop to the bottom of the water. Seems like a fix to make sure your bases don\u0027t fall or get stuck underground when they change topography.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know how to prevent it from becoming \u0022landed\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T03:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try building in a probe core and some RTGs into the base platform.
