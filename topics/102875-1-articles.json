I have a large rocket (3370t, 473 parts) that keeps having structural linkage failures during my launch ascent. It happens at the same point every time I launch: shortly after all 8 of the big boosters have all been separated (at about 32-40km altitude). The reason why this boggles me is it happens more than 10-15 seconds into that stage and there is no wobble - I have added about 40-50 extra struts and a bunch of girders all over the place and my center stack still fails at this point in the launch. The top-most Kerbodyne S3-14400 fuel tank fails first followed by both of the Mk3 adapters above it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from my first image I should have more than enough struts to hold it together. In the second image, all of the girders and struts have broken off and those 3 sections of the center stack are now all debris while the lower portion of the rocket is still intact with engines running at full power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me figure out why this always has structural failure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/txUWq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Top of the rocket is simply too heavy, and is putting too much stress on the weak middle part (hundreds of struts aren\u0027t going to do you much good if the part below them snaps and disconnects them). I\u0027m also not suggesting to make it a pancake lifter, I\u0027m suggesting removing the structural integrity weakness that is the middle part. If you need the extra fuel it holds, you can just add some half tanks on top of the boosters - that won\u0027t make the rocket fatter, its going to make it look and behave more sane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T00:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn all honesty, out of the pictures alone I can\u0027t understand what is happening.
