Explodifying it on the runway and in mid-air, if I actually am able to lift off.\n\nFor the sake of this thread I am using an early tier science/exploration craft for low speed and low altitude.\n\nSome Pictures:\n\n![Schermopname%2039_zps3b5syu0f.png](http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t375/TimVroomans/Schermopname%2039_zps3b5syu0f.png)\n\nLoading Up, notice there is no kerbal in the bottom right\n\n![Schermopname%2040_zpsqelfm7lq.png](http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t375/TimVroomans/Schermopname%2040_zpsqelfm7lq.png)\n\nREJECTION\n\n![Schermopname%2042_zpsav0fyo78.png](http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t375/TimVroomans/Schermopname%2042_zpsav0fyo78.png)\n\nFinal Result\n\nWhen it doesn\u0027t manage to explode, it makes a weird bounce upon hitting the runway and about thirty seconds after taking off:\n\n![Schermopname%2045_zpsodunynyx.png](http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t375/TimVroomans/Schermopname%2045_zpsodunynyx.png)\n\n![Schermopname%2046_zpsjpuynmik.png](http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t375/TimVroomans/Schermopname%2046_zpsjpuynmik.png)\n\nI explodify in mid-air\n\nI hope someone has a fix for this bug, because it is bugging me for some time now (pun intended).\n\nLooking forward to your responses,\n\nTim\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T11:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TimVroomans**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:17:13Z","Content":"Hi TimVroomans, please see the support stickies, we\u0027ll need your logs for this one, as it seems to only be happening to you."},{"CreatedByName":"TimVroomans","CreatedById":123068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:06:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m sorry...\n\nSupport Stickies?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:11:43Z","Content":"Go back to the Support page and look at the top few threads, the ones you need are marked **[Official]** ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis issue you have is not happening to anyone else, so we need your KSP.log, output\\_log, settings.cfg and dxdiag to even begin figuring this out."},{"CreatedByName":"TimVroomans","CreatedById":123068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:39:07Z","Content":"Done that, here are the:\n\n- .craft file of the dragon plane\n\n- the persistent.sfs file\n\n- the output\\_log.txt file\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cwxhf8osal7igh3/AACAWKK-BCRyqLcHiX8-ok31a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cwxhf8osal7igh3/AACAWKK-BCRyqLcHiX8-ok31a?dl=0)\n\ncheers,\n\nTim"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:57:08Z","Content":"I\u0027m not having any trouble with your plane, I managed to get to the island with it, the log shows it colliding with the rest of the plane but not why.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [00:00:14]: Liftoff!!\n\u003E (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)\n\u003E \n\u003E Mark1Cockpit collided into tank\\_002 - relative velocity: 171.5737 - no impact momentum (no RB)\n\u003E \n\u003E (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)\n\u003E \n\u003E Mark1Cockpit Exploded!! - blast awesomeness: 0.5\n\nThe missing Kerbal is strange though and suggests a corrupted save or part file.\n\nI\u0027d try making a new save, also deleting the mk1 cockpit, look for \u0022Kerbal Space Program Steam/GameData/Squad/Parts/Command/mk1Cockpit\u0022 and doing a game cache verification in Steam, you can do that by right clicking KSP, selecting Properties, then Local Files, then Verify cache."},{"CreatedByName":"TimVroomans","CreatedById":123068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T00:19:03Z","Content":"The cache validation returned that four files were not validated and that steam will reinstall said files.
