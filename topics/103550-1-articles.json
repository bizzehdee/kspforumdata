If your pitchover is too aggressive, you\u0027ll never escape the atmosphere; if it\u0027s too vertical, you\u0027ll incur potentially-huge gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, if I understand correctly the trajectory is in large part determined by the thrust curve of the launcher, which obviously involves a number of variables. A pitchover maneuver for one launcher is not likely to work for another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons, it\u0027s been my experience that FAR launches involve either a lot of trial and error for each new launch platform, or throwing a lot of extra delta-v at the problem at taking a conservatively high trajectory. Okay, maybe that\u0027s the Kerbal Way; but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see too modding-type challenges here; I don\u0027t know if either of them has been addressed. One is to reliably execute a pre-programmed pitchover maneuver, which doesn\u0027t seem that difficult. (It\u0027s not incredibly hard to do manually, but there\u0027s a big payoff for precision.) The second, which I\u0027m more interested in at the moment, is to compute the correct pitchover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that this should be a solved problem in the actual aerospace industry; I haven\u0027t yet done enough research to see. It\u0027d also be nice to calculate a good value for \u0022how much delta-V do I need to get into X orbit\u0022 rather than the existing rules of thumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anybody working in this area? If so, I\u0027d like to help (within my relatively limited means).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"conklech","CreatedById":140565,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that 1.0 has hit, a gravity turn calculator would be particularly relevant.

A gravity turn is not the most efficient ascent. All it is is minimal steering loses and at high enough speeds, minimal AOA. Only through exceptional design attention are the zero steering loss ascent and the minimum fuel ascent equal. Imagine two rockets of different CG-CT displacements but otherwise identical engines, fuels, weights, etc. The solution for a gravity turn on each would be different but their optimum \u0022fuel to orbit\u0022 profiles would be the same. This should show that gravity turn and fuel to orbit optimizations are not the same question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost associated with a non-gravity turn in fuel are rather small, a percent perhaps. This is perhaps enough to buy a new car on a real launch but few KSP players are optimizing to that degree. A huge real life motivation is the strength of the rocket structure which does not cope well with aerodynamic side loading. KSP\u0027s rockets are infinitely more robust than their real counterparts and routinely take AOA of 10-30-90 degrees in stride where more than 2-3 would collapse a real article.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like a nit picky distinction but these nits are the size of buffalo at this specificity. It would be embarrassing to receive exactly what you asked for only to realize you asked for not quite the right thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best you\u0027ll get out of Squad is some kind of \u0022sandbox\u0022 wind tunnel simulator whazzit that you can use to try various procedures yourself and maybe find a better way. It\u0027s firmly against the design philosophy of KSP to output \u0022answer\u0022 optimizations on behalf of the player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe usual answer to an \u0022efficient\u0022 route to orbit is usually by chucking a crapton of attempts until you get a route that works on the majority of craft. So in the pre-1.0 days it was ascend vertically to 10-14km, pitch directly to 45 degrees until whatever, and then directly to 90 degrees and start circularize burns. It wasn\u0027t the absolute tightest efficiency, but it was optimized for nearly all rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still possible to use the same route and even with the same rockets, I took a rocket Scott Manley used in his \u0022Landing on Minmus\u0022 video from December 2012. I also took it on a 0.25-0.90 ascent pattern, not only did it still work... I made it to Minmus as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly it was not enough to actually land, but I did manage a very low \u0026lt;5km flyby and then got stuck on a very eccentric Kerbin orbit for the next 6 months until I could loft a properly built \u0022rescue\u0022 shuttle. But it still worked getting out of the atmosphere, and no real changes were needed, and that was on a pre-0.25 version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR the older ways and rockets still work if you\u0027re careful. It just lost a touch of efficiency, not enough to bother most people, just the folks who shave the margins close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just reliase you probably didn\u0027t know about the older routes players used, but yeah. The optimized thing, is just keep trying different variations on routes. If you blowup or fail during launch, restart and try it again a few times, try different things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T05:48:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Somtaaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frederf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frederf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost associated with a non-gravity turn in fuel are rather small, a percent perhaps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.0 least d-v to orbit is in the range of 2800m/s, vs some 3800m/s for a \u0027classic\u0027 stock ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
