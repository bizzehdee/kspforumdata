In test flights, it was capable of taking off, climbing to a cruise altitude of 25,000 meters, (82,000 feet MSL) circumnavigating the globe and landing back on the KSC runway, using less than half of its fuel capacity. Test flights brought it to altitudes in excess of 30,000 meters, and surface speeds in excess of 1300 meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1MZVUhZ.png\u0022 alt=\u00221MZVUhZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStats are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoaded Weight: 15.1 Tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum Tested Altitude: 32,000 Meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommended Cruise Altitude: 25,000 Meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruise Speed: 1,200 Meters per Second (surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to Cruise Alt: Approx. 8 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERange: Global\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff Speed (Loaded): 20 Meters per Second\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStall Speed (Loaded): 10 Meters per Second\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR: 1.52\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Needed: Procedural Wings, Mechjeb, B9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u99KIWo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u99KIWo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the high lift of its wing, the K-2D requires very little power during takeoff and no power at all on final approach. Takeoff is level, with the aircraft lifting off of the runway at 20m/s. Low power is recommended during takeoff, as high power settings can cause a severe nose-up tendency unless corrected with trim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA long, slow and shallow final approach is recommended when landing. Due to the high lift of the wing, the plane tends to \u0022bounce\u0022 following a steep approach. It also has a tendency to float down the runway, though its low landing speed means that once on the ground, the brakes will quickly bring it to a stop. Speed going into the flare should be about 13 m/s. Level the plane off and hold the wheels just a few inches above the pavement. The plane will eventually settle as the speed bleeds off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the wide wingspan, the wings should be kept as level as possible on final to prevent a wing strike. Any corrections should be made with the rudder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt high altitudes, trim or Mechjeb Spaceplane Guidance should be used to keep the plane under control. At low altitudes however, the aircraft is responsive and nimble, whilst remaining stable and easy to fly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: This plane can experience prolonged shock heating under certain conditions: particularly during descent from cruise altitude and during high speed cruise in the 18-20KM range. Users of mods that simulate re-entry heat may need to take this into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cT1fycl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cT1fycl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircraft has not been tested with FAR.
