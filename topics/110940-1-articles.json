Your version should end up a bit different from mine, depending on the parts you have available as well as any other characteristics you\u0027d like to build into your version. The key characteristics of this lander are as follows:\n\n1.) the crew module holds one passenger, a scientist. Engineers are basically useless for this work, and we avoid the need for a pilot by using a probe core instead.\n\n2.) the command module is centered and low to the ground\n\n3.) the fuel tanks, engines, and landing legs are splayed outwards for a low profile and wide base\n\n4.) the fuel tanks are centered on the center of mass, so it doesn\u0027t shift much as fuel is drained; the RCS thruster blocks are centered on the median center of mass as well\n\n5.) ship has docking port, probe core, batteries, RCS storage (optional), RCS thrusters, reaction wheel, antenna, photovoltaic panels, and all of your available non-atmospheric science modules\n\n6.) total fuel mass is a bit more than half of the mass of the ship\n\nYou don\u0027t need the 2.5m service bay or the docking port sr., those I just selected because they work nicely and look cool. I like how the service bay consolidates all of my science gear for me. The large docking port makes docking slightly easier but really is unnecessary. I used the RC-001S 1.25m probe core, but the first option in the tech tree for this lander is the OKTO which has SAS capability but does not have other navigation tactics. I put the probe core on the bottom and the docking port on the top for easy docking to orbital stations, but you could swap the two to make it easier to dock with a ground fueling station by way of landing atop the fueling station. Landing on top of a fueling station is a rather difficult maneuver, however.\n\nLet me know what you think of my lander!"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T02:12:59Z","Content":"I think you could mount the engines on the inner set of fuel tanks and make the outer tanks \u002B landing legs detachable via radial decoupler without increasing the tech requirements at all, thereby increasing your takeoff efficiency \u0026 improving your margins for kerbin return.\n\nOther than that its a fantastic approach to solving the biggest problem newer players have with landing."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T03:24:43Z","Content":"That\u0027s not a bad idea but I was using the design as a fully reusable lander. I collect the data and put it all in the crew cabin, and then leave it on the orbital station later. When enough science reports have collected up, I send a small disposable shuttle to take them down to Kerbin. That way you can take it down to visit a biome or two, back up to refuel, and back down to visit more biomes."},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T03:58:06Z","Content":"I really like how you use cargo bays ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T08:44:42Z","Content":"Thanks! =]\n\nI like shoving the materials bay inside in the center, then kind of arranging everything else small enough to fit around the materials bay. I also installed lights on the top so it\u0027s easier to see in there."}]}
