An efficient small Mk 2 design can orbit a Kerbal for under $125. This price drops under $50 if you use large Mk 3 designs.\n\n A design that orbits a huge number of Kerbals (even if it\u0027s highly oversized and inefficient) can still rack up insane points so long as it\u0027s easily flyable. You could even afford a huge R\u0026D budget and not worry about it.\n\n I don\u0027t know what you\u0027d do to fix that. \n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T03:38:09Z","Content":"![PBthreeO_zpsz0cydn08.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/PBthreeO_zpsz0cydn08.jpg)\n\nThe Probuilder 3.0 is an example of what I mean. It\u0027s about the smallest thing I\u0027d care to make with Mk 3 parts and I took some extra flights to tweak it out. $6,836 on R\u0026D, but because it carries 20 kerbals, it can get over 30 points. This one has a lot more orbital DV than is necessary to do the job and I\u0027ve run 2 full missions to make sure it\u0027s got no kinks.\n\n Flies pretty much like the 2.0. A little shallower on the initial climb and a little cleaner on reentry (include s-turns in the descent profile). The wings have a lower heat tolerance, so take care. Let them cool before doing the reentry and don\u0027t push it.\n\n I don\u0027t normally do large- scale passenger transports because I never have a need to move large numbers of kerbals at once, but this is about the smallest thing I can do at this scale. Increasing from here will only make the scoring sillier.\n\nDownload link\n\n[http://wikisend.com/download/493856/PB30.craft](http://wikisend.com/download/493856/PB30.craft)\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:06:24Z","Content":"I 100% agree. I hate changing the rules but I think we need to give payload more of an incentive because it costs more kredits to deliver some loads then points you get. Would 3 points per ton throw it off? Maybe 2.5? Also I was hoping someone wouldn\u0027t do it but I had a feeling it was about to happen. I was just about to implement a 6 kerbal limit but since you already made 20 kerbal craft and it makes sense (1 command pod and 1 passenger cabin) I think a 20 kerbal limit is fine. I am thinking 6 kerbal EVA limit from 6-20 you are required to have a docking port or sr docking port for tourist transfer. (can you transfer tourist?)\n\nCongrats on developing that craft for only 6,836 although you took quite a bit of risk as you could have had -200 points for dead kerbals. I think that does kind of balance it out and you still need someone to successfully fly it. I have not had a lot of success with those wings as I cant figure out the entry profile and they tend to get explody on me.\n\nAs for PB2.0 since it is a top score craft I am going to be a stickler about the rules and yes you would have to add my costs. I have been lenient with lower score craft as I know how hard it can be. You only lost .075 points for the missing solar panel so I would just wait for someone else to beat my score with it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T15:06:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nich**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T15:20:55Z","Content":"Updated the Multicord to point to the original post (finally figured out how to do that) I plan on doing this for the rest of the craft when I have more time.\n\nI also checked the Neagle MK3 while it was better it still needed a minimum of 1500 LF in the front tank to maintain stability.

I\u0027d rather have that than a big transport arms race.\n\n If we\u0027re getting 2 points per kerbal, then 4 points per tonne of cargo makes sense since a 4 kerbal pod weighs 2 tonnes. The penalty for costs really needs to rise dramatically though or you still have a race to huge spaceplanes. The penalty for orbiting a kerbal should be about equal to the reward for orbiting a kerbal. That way there\u0027s no incentive to build bigger and bigger ships, but rather more efficient and cost-effective ones.]\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T17:14:14Z","Content":"Larger planes are harder to design and pilot in my opinion.
