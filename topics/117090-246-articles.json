Noticed that 1.3 has been officially released.\n\nWill be spending a bit of time today updating the existing dev branch for 1.3, and hopefully will be publishing a public 1.3-pre-release, mostly depending on if ModuleManager is available yet. Initially there will be no localization support, and probably won\u0027t be any for quite awhile (will need some minor back-end code changes, but the biggest bit missing/needed would be the actual localization files that I\u0027m unable to create myself).\n\nSo there may be a 1.3 version available a bit later this afternoon, if all goes well.  Will update a bit later today with more info / links to releases as they become available.\n\n**WARNING** -- These upcoming releases will **not** be fully compatible with craft/vessels/save-games from previous versions.  Depending on the craft configuration it may or may not load at all, and even when they do load it will certainly be missing textureset and coloring data.  If you are trying to bring over your 1.2.2 save, the only safe way to do it would be to remove any existing craft using SSTU parts, update, and then re-create your craft with the new updated parts and hyper-edit them back to where they need to be."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T14:59:24Z","Content":"\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E is updated:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-130-module-manager-280-may-26th-2017-better-late-than-never/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T16:49:27Z","Content":"Initial 1.3 testing release is available:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.6.36.135](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.6.36.135)\n\nThis should be treated as a pre-release / testing version / alpha.
