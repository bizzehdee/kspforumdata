You build a lot of aircraft, do you just delete the inlets that lack AJE support or do you make your own personal cfgs for these?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh crap just ignore what I wrote. I just looked at your inlet cfgs in RftS and I see you have actually made new parts from existing models, not just rescales. I guess it\u0027s just to add support for AJE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna do that this week, I can post a cfg here if you like?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit2:\u003C/strong\u003E As you might have seen in the AJE thread I made cfgs for those intakes who lacked AJE support, let me know if you want them btw.

They\u0027re also not super heavy. The Vulcan is basically a developed J58 optimized for near-hypersonic speed rather than the Mach 3 range. Instead of a regular turbojet with bleed air, where even at max bleed it still has a decent compressor pressure ratio, a true turboramjet will entirely bypass the compressor at high mach. A turboramjet is, basically, everything from a turbojet that uses a ramjet combustor rather than a traditional afterburner (the Miles M.52 engine) through the J58 (a turbojet with bleed-air bypass such that at high mach intake air is routed around the compressor) to what the VULCAN is: essentially a non-afterburning turbojet *inside* a ramjet. Another way of conceptualizing the VULCAN is as a J58 where the ratio of bled air to compressed air approaches 100% at high mach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, in fact, an engine broadly achievable with 1960s technology; the problem is basically to ensure that the aircraft (and the ramjet insides and the diverter placed in front of the compressor intake) will survive the heat at that temperature. One need not worry about the delicate fan blades at that temperature because the air is fully diverted away from the compressor at high mach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that since only the nozzle is graphically modeled, the engine itself (which probably ought to be a good 2m in diameter) is not.
