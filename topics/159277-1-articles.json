But the HG-5\u0027s themselves are too small to resolve a good signal from each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the direct case, each antenna has two functions: first, to send a signal from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to remotely control your satellites, and second, to send science data from your craft back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. The HG-5 antennas will only send a very low power stream of data back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the massive antennas in your tracking station are huge buckets that can pick up extremely faint signals. Inversely, the tracking station antennas send out a broad high power signal that even the tiny dishes on your satellites can resolve easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, when one HG-5 tries to relay signals to another HG-5 you end up with small dishes trying to resolve weak signals. This is why you have a good connection to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E but poor connections between your satellites. If you just wanted to control those satellites then using the larger RA-2 relay antenna (or preferably the largest relay) as your third comm-net satellite around Kerbin should solve this problem because the bigger dish will be sensitive enough to collect the weak signals from either of your HG-5\u0027s when they aren\u0027t in direct connection with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E tracking station and pass them on. However, you will have a problem if you want to use the HG-5 antennas to pass on signals from other craft further out, because they are best suited for relaying signals from a craft in a low orbit (or one on the surface) back to the large stations on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-16T17:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2017 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-16T18:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI For the formulas to calculate range and signal strength look at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice that a link of any strength provide full control for unmanned vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"digger1213","CreatedById":176898,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T01:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answers.
