Hopefully Planetary Resources and other companies with similar goals will have begun mining NEO\u0027s! There will be several large permanently manned space stations (operated by different governments and private companies) orbiting Earth at different altitudes and the cost of visiting one for several months as a tourist will, at most, equal the cost of a suborbital Virgin Galactic ticket today (~1/100th of what it currently costs to visit the ISS as a tourist). There may be at least one large space based solar power station collecting huge amounts of solar energy and beaming it to a receiver on the ground, powering an entire city, 24 hours a day, all year round. There will be remote controlled robotic satellites that can repair and move other satellites in orbit, greatly reducing the need to build and launch replacement satellites. There will probably be small cheap craft whose job it is to de-orbit hazardous space junk (sorry, no need for anime characters to do it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).

They may have unmanned spacecraft covertly shooting down each others satellites from time to time.

NASA\u0027s Orion/SLS will cost $1billion/year for one launch, and there is no budget planned for mission modules (landers or exploration modules), so there will be no Moon landings before 2025-2030 at least. The chances for Orion/SLS of being cancelled by then are actually rather high because of the high cost/per flight, the low launch rate, and the lack of budget for actually doing anything once the infrastructure is in place. There is simply no budget for a lander or a Lagrange space station and there is no real justification for the public to send humans into space when robots can do most of the work. If we\u0027re lucky, we might have a couple of Orion asteroid missions, and maybe a small space station at Earth-Moon-L1. That\u0027s probably as far as we can get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, moving out to 2060, either we have given up on manned spaceflight altogether, or there might be some huge event that will change public opinion: maybe a new cold war, the discovery of life on Mars or Europa, or a giant asteroid. Those are pretty much the only things that will motivate the public opinion enough to put space exploration in the spotlight once again. If this happens, then yes, we might finally get our Moon base and maybe a Mars landing, but I really wouldn\u0027t count on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t forget that space is a hostile environment and it\u0027s hard to get to, and it always will be. The laws of physics are not going to change and it will always take a huge amount of energy and technology to put a human into orbit. Whatever technological breakthroughs come around in the future, there is no such thing as free energy, and you will always need to accelerate stuff to 28000km/h to get into LEO. Even if we do crack nuclear fusion power, it will still take 20 to 30 years to design and build power plants and for the technology to go mainstream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople (especially Americans, because of their history) often compare Space to the colonizing the Western Frontier. This is a flawed comparison for many reasons. First, in space, there is nowhere to go. You need technology to survive and nobody is going to voluntarily emigrate to Mars or the Moon and spend the rest of their life living in a sealed hab module with recycled air and water. Colonies started with people willing to live off the land and trade with the old continent. In space, there is no land to live off of and nothing to trade. It will always be cheaper, safer, and easier to colonize the ocean beds or Antarctica than to colonize the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-15T15:40:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2012 03:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T15:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, yes, you can\u0027t live off the land in orbit, but there are some things you can get in space that you can\u0027t on Earth.

The Falcon Heavy could launch as early as next year, and it will be able to carry 12~ tonnes to GTO, more than enough to get a Dragon to Mars.
