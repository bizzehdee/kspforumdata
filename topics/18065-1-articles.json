Which part of your rocket will do the Munar transfer burn? Your lander won\u0027t have enough delta-V to do everything. It also looks too tall and the fins are useless. You want your lander to be light and low and wide. There\u0027s nothing more frustrating than making a perfect landing... just to see your rocket tumble over because you were on a slight slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can combine some of the stages described above. You seem to have combined the ascent and descent stages in your design. I usually find it more efficient to combine the Munar transfer stage with the descent role, and drop it just before the final descent, like 200m above the ground. Again, you want your ascent stage to be as light as possible because you certainly don\u0027t want to be carrying empty tanks back home with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-28T23:41:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2012 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T05:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBigger, faster, stronger. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in all seriousness though, I would suggest that you make the base wider, that should increase stability while in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
