But none is as unique as the ROUND-8 fuel tank. This challenge is given to raise awareness of this awesome little part and give us what may be... \\*SNIFF\\* ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) one last chance to build stock ships with it.\n\n**FUN FACTS ABOUT THE ROUND-8:** (all stolen from the wiki, or just made up)\n\n- *It is the only toroidal fuel tank currently available!*\n- *The ROUND-8 is one of the few parts in Kerbal Space Program that is covered in multi-layer insulation!*\n- *Though it\u0027s called the ROUND-8, it has six segments!*\n- *It\u0027s less orange than the Rockomax-64 fuel tank, and also somewhat smaller!*\n- *It carries 174.368% of the fuel capacity of the Oscar-B Fuel Tank, despite having a smaller apparent size!*\n- *Despite the above, there are some who believe it to be redundant with the Oscar-B! Can you believe it?*\n\n***And now, the CHALLENGE!***\n\nIt\u0027s quite simple: Build the most awesome mission you can think of using only ROUND-8 tanks to carry liquid fuel and oxidant. Please avoid using solid fuel motors except for stage separation, and don\u0027t abuse monopropellant. Mods are OK, however any entry that carries xenon fuel (booooo!!) for any reason will be *disqualified with extreme prejudice!* Hyperedit to get your ship to the interesting part of the mission is OK, but think how much more awesome your mission will be if you lift that 200 ton monster off Kerbin using nothing but ROUND-8 boosters. No other cheats (glitch abuse, infinite fuel, etc, etc) please.\n\nI know what some some of you are thinking: \u0022But Kuzzter, this challenge is pointless! The ROUND-8 is so awesome that I have *literally never used any other liquid fuel tank, ever!*\u0022 But some others might be thinking \u0022ROUND-8? I never figured out how to use the ROUND-6!\u0022 So here are some ideas:\n\n- SSTO with ROUND-8! (you can drain the oxidant)\n- Eve Ascent with ROUND8! (What\u0027s the only thing more awesome than a pancake? A pancake MADE OF DONUTS!)\n- Huge Ships!\n- Fast Ships!\n- Jool Ships!\n- Blue Ships!\n\n**Scoring!**\n\nWhat, scoring? You\u0027re actually serious about this? OK, OK, let me think of something... right, here we go. As entries appear I will make categories. I will put your entries into these categories arbitrarily and I will rank them arbitrarily on the leaderboard. Peer feedback on the thread will be taken into account. You will not get bent out of shape about any of this. Please? The whole point is to shower love upon the Great ROUND-8 and show all of Kerbin the versatility of this Great Little Tank.\n\n**LEADERBOARD:**\n\n#1 in Tearjerker Category: *Kerdinand, ROUND-8 Memorial Gravestone* \n\n#1 in Single Stage To(roidal) Orbit Category: *Kuzzter, ROUND-SSTO*\n\n#1 in Room with a View Category*: n.b.z., ROUND8Trip \\*\\**\n\n#1 in I Broke the Universe Category: *UpsilonAerospace*\n\n#1 in Not Single Stage To(roidal) Orbit Category: *Argon*\n\n#1 in To Mun and Back in a Donut Category: *Yukon0009, Apollo-Style*\n\n#1 in LFO Capsule Painting Category*: Mad Rocket Scientist, Minmus mission\\*\\**\n\n#1 in Beachballs on Eve Category: *Badsector, Eve 10k Lifter*\n\n#1 in Single Stage To(roidal) Laythe and Back Category: *Juzeris, Donutzer*\n\n#1 in Swarming Satellites Category*, Mallock*\n\n#1 in Kerbal Coast Guard Category, *BoobyTrapGaming, Save Jeb From Drowning!*\n\n**HONORED GATECRASHERS:**\n\n#1 in Compact Satellite Deployment, *GoSlash27, Satellite Launch Bus \\*\\**\n\n#1 in Toroidal Landing Shock Absorbers, *UpslionAerospace, Porthole Springy Lander \\*\\**\n\n#1 in Nested Tanks For A Very Cute Skycrane, *Octa, Duna mini probe lander \\*\\**\n\n\\*\\*awarded Knight of the Order of the Golden Toroid for demonstrating A Job No Other Tank Can do\n\n![GsA0F4K.png](http://i.imgur.com/GsA0F4K.png)\n\nThe motto of the Order comes from the Wiki text that this is an \u0022undoubtedly handy\u0022 tank.
