But as you said, stuff is still rezzing inside the launch platform (the ones of this pack and the hooligan ones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it appears that the system uses a mixture of the root position of the control unit (pod or probe) and/or the clamps. I had two items rezzing okay, using like 6 struts and a clamp to make sure the clamp does not collide into the launcher (and it took me some time to figure out how many struts and offset i need so it does not collide) the last one, i could do what i wanted, the thing always got rezzed INSIDE the launcher with its root position beeing EXACTLY at the root position of the launcher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after some thinking (me beeing a 3d modeller by trade) i remembered a similar issue on another game, in which the programmer worked around that by calculating the geometrical box of the spawner against the geometrical box of the item to get spawned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way in the API of KSP that lets you know the colission box (the widest in any direction - that is pretty foolproof) of the station/base and the item that is to be spawned? If yes. then you just need to make some math to create a dynamic spawn point with some headroom that makes 100% sure that nothing can intersect, and collide once physics kick in. (they may collide afterwards, and there the user just needs to make sure that the item can withstand this impact (in the case of a base for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that gives you an idea for the work around \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T16:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t remember the exact value (somewhere between 0.25 and 0.75), but the Hooligan Labs pad is actually why I created SpawnHeightOffset in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t figured out bbox calculation yet (but it is indeed there).

Point is, i do mid to high poly these days on very thight schedules, so some low polystuff with some nice AO baked textures should be a cakewalk. not sure how unity handles animations, but there is youtube and eh. can\u0027t be too different i guess. Most stuff doesn\u0027t even need animations. The tanks for example. And i got a couple nice ideas on how to bring that stuff into a spaceworthy formfactor. The launchpad of hooligan for example is awesome. it just got one problem: the bbox does not change evenly when animating. thus it tends to let the build sway (not so good). So they are nice but can be done better. I also got an idea for a foldable runway that follows more what the military would use for improvised runways. Also Thyssen Krupp made mobile smelters.
