There are, of course, some exceptions when participating in challenges and competition where you compare performance, but you get the idea. However, I play KSP partly because I feel it gives me new insights into the difficulties of space flight and engineering in general.

Up until now I have spent most of my time developing throttle capabilities - I had some fun creating mathmatical models that are intended to be as universal and vehicle non-specific as possible. With the advent of direct control I can finally turn my attention to control logic.

The reason NASA can succeed at putting a probe in orbit around Mars is because NASA already knows what BODY(\u0022Mars\u0022):Mass and BODY(\u0022Mars\u0022):Radius are. It seems silly to have to re-measure it every time once it\u0027s been calculated by scientists back home. Either it\u0027s calculated already before even the first probe is sent, or if it does require a probe it\u0027s only unknown once, the first time, then after that they\u0027d add it as a constant to look up in all future software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, it\u0027s an utter pain to show off your software to other people if you have to put \u0022spoiler alert\u0022 and mask off parts of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why the only sort of keeping data out of the BODY structure that I\u0027d accept as being okay is if it *IS* there in the structure, but masked off until your career mode campaign has measured it (as described in the post I made earlier). (And in the case of sandbox mode it\u0027s not masked off). That way I can still say \u0022here\u0027s the code\u0022 without it containing spoilers because all people will see is a call to BODY():something and they won\u0027t know the actual number unless they\u0027re playing sandbox or have gotten that far in their career mode game. It allows me to show 100% of my code rather than only 99% of it and having to hide the private database of stuff I learned in my career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lenar","CreatedById":104620,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T22:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid another test while outside atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Elock steering to retrograde.\u003Cbr\u003Ewait 1.\u003Cbr\u003Etoggle ag10.\u003Cbr\u003Ewait 10.\u003Cbr\u003Etoggle ag10.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship starts to spin towards retrograde, but when the antennas deactivate, it just spins past retrograde.

I think it\u0027s not, since you don\u0027t simply change the rotation in one step by telling the underlying engine to do so, but instead you use a multiude of commands on a higher level to achieve this rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this cheating in a \u0022roleplaying\u0022 PoV ? Probably yes, unless you have a module on board, that adds a certain mass to your vessel, to account for the additional \u0022hardware\u0022 your vessel requires to be able to achieve it. This basically comes down to balancing the tradeoffs one has to consider, when designing a vessel. Let\u0027s say you have a small probe, that just barely scratches the 1t mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want the comfort of \u0022automated steering\u0022, you have to add a module that masses 0.3t(arbitrary number) to it, which could make the vessel desing unfeasible.

From an information theory point of view, both a Euler rotation and a Vector contain the same *amount* of information. The tradeoff is that Vectors have length information but lack roll information, while Euler rotations have roll information but lack length information. So when you \u0027lock steering\u0027 to a vector, you can\u0027t control which way the ship is rolled. This is usually okay for rockets which have axial symmetry so you don\u0027t care which way it\u0027s rolled, but its a big problem for airplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use a Rotation for the steering that is the result of adding your vector to a rotation that only has a roll component (similar to the \u0022up \u002B R(0,0,180)\u0022 that is in most scripts). If you don\u0027t know the roll before hand you will be able to get it from ship:facing:roll (this feature is in my fork of kOS but it will be merged soon).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
