I didn\u0027t test every part, but it seems to be reproducible with every vessel (tested MKI, MKIII and the small probe core, forgot his name).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reproduce, just launch a vessel in low Kerbin orbit, and spin the vessel when you see the light reflection on the ocean. I suspect this bug to be present in other locations too (Eve? Laythe?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely not game breaking, I only noticed it because I was spinning my vessel like crazy, not exactly a normal gameplay session.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing interesting in the logs, but I can provide some if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETested on 1.0 vanilla with DX9, and 0.90 with a ton of mods with OpenGL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs are: i5 4570K (3.4GHz), 8GB RAM, and a GTX770 2GB with drivers up to date (350.12), but I doubt it\u0027ll be relevant. All graphic settings are set to max (\u0022Fallback shaders\u0022 is unchecked, I don\u0027t even know what it is. I suppose this are shaders used when the hardware is not compatible, maybe?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this issue has already been addressed, a mod can close this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T23:47:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lilleman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
