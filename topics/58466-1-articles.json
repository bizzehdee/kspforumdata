Played by thousands of people worldwide every day (including, reportedly, engineers at Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Lab) the game is the closest an Earthbound enthusiast can get to building his or her own space program. With seven planets governed by Newtonian orbital mechanics, navigating the Kerbal solar system is no easy task. The game offers a rare insight into the complex problems that face real rocket scientists. Want to reach the solar system\u0027s distant fringes? You might have to slingshot around the Moon, a manoeuvre known as a \u0022gravity-assist\u0022, to conserve fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The brainchild of Brazilian games developer Felipe Falanghe, KSP was released by Squad in 2011 after an intense seven months during which a new, fully playable version was updated every three weeks. The speed of development was driven by uncertainty. \u0022We didn\u0027t know how far we could go before someone pulled the plug,\u0022 says Falanghe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The game is still in early-access alpha and updates in 2014 will build out missions and goals to give the game greater structure and make it more accessible to a wider audience. It will also introduce dynamically generated contracts, with players being hired for specific space missions, rather like Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX. But not quite as expensive. \u003Cstrong\u003EKadhim Shubber\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003Ekerbalspaceprogram.com\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnd Article\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of this article and KSP\u0027s ever-growing fame?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
