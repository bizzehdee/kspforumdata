We agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE CHALLENGE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild and deploy an orbital weapon system consisting of missiles and a manned core. The system should be designed to be reloadable in orbit. Such functionality should be demonstrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE RULES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - This is a design challenge. Anything goes except breaking the laws of physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The weapon platform must be manned. Any reloading probes should be unmanned. Missiles can ONLY be fired from mounts attached to the platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
