At least the M700 does, but i guess you could leave the hex spinning scanner there to pinpoint some good ore landing site so the relay dishes are an excellent idea. There are some interesting ways to send a M700 to another planet and reach a polar orbit without using many orange tanks worth of fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-14T11:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have enough (or plan on being able to get enough) fuel to get to another CB with the same scanner, then yes, the scanner becomes basically useless. Usually, I put the scanner on a decoupler on an interstage fairing, with a klaw under it. Once I\u0027ve scanned, I decouple the worthless scanner, and the klaw comes to life. At that point, the former scanner sat becomes a klaw-equipped spacetug instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-14T15:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTook me a while to realize CB = Celestial Body = Moon/Planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking of mounting it in the Service module of my spaceship instead of on a separate satellite, but wondering if that was smart or not.
