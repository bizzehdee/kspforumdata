Suspected mods: KJR and (possibly) SpaceY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteps to reproduce:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFind something big to put into Minmus orbit. Preferably weighing 200 kilotons or more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd large-diameter SpaceY parts and other things\u00A0until it can get to Minmus orbit, in the same manner as you would build a regular craft. It should weigh somewhere around 1 megaton or more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd the big SpaceY launch clamps. (And probably the stock ones too, for good measure.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet up the staging such that the first stage activates enough engines to go up, and the second stage disengages the launch clamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt either main engines start or launch clamp release, the launchpad should spontaneously combust without injury to the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis happens fairly dependably with anything bigger than 1 megaton that use launch clamps. Unfortunately, I have been unable to determine whether this is ALL launch clamps or just the big SpaceY ones, as it does not happen under a certain craft weight (or maybe thrust) and the stock launch clamps look woefully inadequate for anything of this size. I should probably test this again with a LOT of stock launch clamps instead of 4-12 big ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I know that I\u0027m on an unsupported version, I am looking for tips on how to narrow this down to a more specific set of actions. In addition, I have no idea whether this issue persists in the latest version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-29T01:53:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2016 01:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DaMachinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI cans spell so gud!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
