I know you had no interest in the thought I had at the time (2 completely different sets of parts for different uses), but would it be possible to use the mesh switch to control how a part is oriented for mounting (normal versus reverse mounting)? I\u0027m looking at some parts and comparing normal and reverse mount versions. They look essentially identical save for the lights used to tell us the type of mounting. I don\u0027t know how the plug-in works, so I have no clue if this would be even possible. I just know several big mods using FSMeshSwitch to cut down on part count via tweakables.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand of FSMeshSwitch, it just switches the mesh of a part. For it to be usable to remove the variants it would need to be able to switch multiple meshes at the same time (not sure if it can) and more importantly change the position of attachment nodes and where surface attachment applies from. The former would probably be easy for FS to implement, but I have no idea about the latter, especially if the part is already surface attached (where do you reposition it to?). Its certainly a nice idea, and maybe one day it can be done but for now variants is the best way to handle this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pellinor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pellinor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis sounds like a workaround to something that we haven\u0027t even tried to fix in the first place. So if you have a part that would need an unreasonable mass to allow good connections I\u0027ll find some time to look at how these connections can be tweaked.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been going on the info sirkut gave me a while ago which was that there\u0027s hardly any options to tweak the strength of the joint between the IR parts. Even if that could be improved it may actually be the joints between adjacent parts that are the cause of excessive wobble (the ones KSP creates) and they may not be fixable without KJR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T00:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe part descriptions for the structural pieces seem light with clear functional descriptions.
