First time to Orbit on your new career save feels awesome. First time you pull off a two-ship docking, you have to wipe the sweat off of your forehead.

Part of it is that it\u0027s like virtual LEGO bricks, putting together your space shuttle, or your Apollo mission, or just seeing if you can make this plane into a single-stage-to-orbit crew transfer shuttle. Then you get to fly your creations. You can put rovers on other worlds, other moons. You can send Kerbals onto these planets, set up colonies, collect science, and return the data to unlock new parts (in Science/Career mode.
