High wing gives dihedral effect, a positive stability force. So when an aircraft with high wings is disturbed in roll, the wing inside of the turn \u0022sees\u0022 more airflow than the wing outside of the turn. This generates more lift and causes the low wing to want to raise back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA highly roll stable craft would right itself and be done. A marginally roll stable aircraft may right itself, but oscillate as it finds neutral. An unstable craft just keeps rolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of a low wing craft, the CoL slips up and under, to the other side of the CoM and contributes to the roll. Hence, unstable. So I suppose it isn\u0027t really that the CoM is \u0022hanging,\u0022 but rather where the CoL is. Maybe it just depends on your point of view?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, there are a lot of interacting forces at play. So there are lots of variations on this, but that is the basics of dihedral.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T05:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn a tangent, how does this work for aircraft when the same idea doesn\u0027t work for rockets: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy\u003C/a\u003E .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the fact that the orientation of thrust is different in the two situations. In the plane, the direction of thrust is perpendicular to the direction of the upward force counteracting gravity. In the rocket, the direction of thrust is parallel to the force acting against gravity (its the same vector). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes the pendulum rocket, it\u0027s my understand that the rocket invariably picks up some yaw/pitch oscilations. These oscillations \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E cause the direction of thrust to change, which amplifies the oscillations, and you get a positive feedback system that becomes unstable. The high wing in these aircraft really counteracts roll, which occurs on an axis parallel to the thrust, not perpendicular like pitch/yaw. Therefore, the correction for the roll little to no effect on the direction of thrust, and oscillations are dampened, instead of amplified. If the wing led to pitch or yaw oscillations, something similar could happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, IIRC, the \u0022pendulum rocket\u0022 is only a problem when thrusting \u003Cem\u003Eagainst\u003C/em\u003E gravity, e.g. getting into orbit. Once you\u0027re in orbit and you\u0027re no longer thrusting against gravity, it\u0027s not unstable to have your CoT in front of your CoM.
