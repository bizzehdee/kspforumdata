The size of these markers should scale with the size of the craft or part cause tbh they seem too big sometimes even when working with big rockets (IMO). If people don\u0027t like that maybe make the scaling of these markers a bar in the settings window?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041565925607997502/1148479161174863923/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
