So I thought I\u0027d show the little solution I have put in place if others want to apply something similar in their games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are probably mods that do this, but I prefeered to find a stock solution \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Kerbin is on a 6 hour rotation, we\u0027re in the fortunate situation that every hour Kerbin will rotate 60 degrees. So if I want to land at KSC and I\u0027m precisely 2 hours away from touching down, then I should try to make my touch-down point 120 degrees East of KSC. In that period of time, Kerbin will rotate so that KSC will be directly at the landing point when the space-craft gets there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use a mod that tells you the coordinates of a landing site, then you can simply calculate the difference of the coordinates, and ensure that you are that many minutes worth of degrees away from landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you can put in place a set of beacons, to aid you in eyeballing it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577869921313211482/7A6D1B294B558128DF73B5BF015ACBDC6E45BA5C/\u0022 alt=\u00227A6D1B294B558128DF73B5BF015ACBDC6E45BA5C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I have put in place 6 beacons at the equator around Kerbin, with 60 degrees between them. One of them is located right at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the distance between one beacon to the next represents one hours worth of rotation, I can use that to aid me in eyeballing where to come down for landing to be as close as possible to KSC. An example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577869921313220075/D0D105A7112920F69C1E631EA711526FB98E0E4D/\u0022 alt=\u0022D0D105A7112920F69C1E631EA711526FB98E0E4D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is Merrie Kerman, comming back from a trip to the Mun. As he has heard that the canteen is serving his favorite dish today, he really wants to go directly home and not having to wait for the recovery ship to pick him up half-way around the World.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end the manuver node making the transfeer from Mun orbit is tweaked slightly, so that he will make a touchdown close to Beacon West 120, meaning the beacon 240 degrees (4 hours) away from KSC. That path will take him 3 hours and 53 minutes, checked by placing a manuver node on the estimated trajectory and seeing at what time it touches ground. This means Merrie will land close to KSCs canteen, and his spaceplane can glide the rest of the way to the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I find that I\u0027m slightly off, then the trajectory can be adjusted halfway though. Its also much easier to fine-tune by eye the off-set needed for (for instance) 15 or 30 minutes worth of rotation when I have these navigational aids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, here is a shot at one of the beacons, they could be anything really, essentially just a piece of debris will do, I just thought I\u0027d make something resembling a beacon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577869921313225312/FB22FD68D64A77128394FA9965AA59C51B8727EF/\u0022 alt=\u0022FB22FD68D64A77128394FA9965AA59C51B8727EF\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, if you want to put a series of beacons up like this, or calculate it directly, then your beacons will need to be at the following longitude coordinates (as measured by Kerbal Engineer):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon 0 (KSC) : -74.575\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon East 60 : -14.575\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon East 120 : 45.425\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon 180 : 105.425\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon West 120 : 165.425\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon West 60 : -134.575\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr these if you\u0027re using the coordinates as pr the tracking station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon 0 (KSC) : 74.57 W\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon East 60 : 14.57 W\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon East 120 : 45.42 E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon 180 : 105.42 E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon West 120 : 194.35 W\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacon West 60 : 134.57 W\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that it looks like the zero-point for the tracking station coordinates are off, as no longitude coordinate should be above 180.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe principle can be used for all the other planets as well, such as a base on Duna, just look up the rotational period and put down beacons accordingly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T09:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good strategy.
