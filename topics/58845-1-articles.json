Once you are done, and only left with software you will actually use, go to the Startup button in CCleaner, and see what is listed. Look at anything \u0022enabled\u0022, and decide if each one is something you only use occasionanally, or you need it running all the time...Disable those you dont want running all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen go back and take a look at how many processes you have running from all users...A typical \u0022clean\u0022 install of Win7 should be no more than 80 or 90 total for all users...Not sure about Win8...I have my Win7 down to 64-69 processes at idle, and only about 25% RAM usage (about 1.25GB)....I havent played with my Win8.1 install much, but I did get it down to 75 processes at one point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if that screenshot you took of Task Manager was WITHOUT KSP running, then your system is already using almost 3GBs of RAM, leaving AT MOST, just under 3GBs for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike you, I have a 1yr old i5 2450M, 6GB RAM, Intel HD 3000/NVIDIA 630M video, Win 7 Home Premium....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have NEVER seen my computer make full use of its RAM using the Task Manager window...KSP is the only program I use that comes close to maxing out my RAM usage. The most I have EVER seen being used, win7 and KSP TOTAL RAM, is about 4.3GB....So if your comp is acting similar to mine, if you are already using 3GBs of total RAM at idle, that leaves maybe 1.5GB left for KSP...Which is pushing even a vanilla KSP install...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, like others have mentioned, the Intel HD is NOT for a game like KSP...I know I have to go into my NVIDIA control panel app, and tell the computer which video GPU to use on a program by program basis. The default is to use the Intel HD....SO you may have to manually change the setting for KSP to use your ATI GPU...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHEN, make sure you adjust, (most likely) turn down most of your grahics settings in KSP itself....I have to turn mine down almost to a bare minimum to get a nice frame rate, with MANY mods installed. Also, dont run KSP full screen...Try running it windowed, one or two settings below your max res.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatKerbal","CreatedById":98809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T18:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the replies!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out i can run at bare minimum medium settings so it looks a little good.
