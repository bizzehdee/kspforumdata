What would happen to one of those low-thrust high mass spacecraft that has to \u0022spiral\u0022 its way out of a planets gravity well, if the navball wasn\u0027t always perfectly accurate? You\u0027d never be able to plot an accurate interplanetary course, or accurately adjust said course, that\u0027s what would happen. Nobody wants \u0022artificial difficulty\u0022 in the game, and that\u0027s exactly what this sounds like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s certainly not like real life. IRL, your instruments are based on something called an Inertial Navigation System, and while yes older ones were based on actual gyroscopes and therefore could drift over time, craft that used them would be able to calibrate the INS in-flight by using instruments to sight several stars and knowing the time of day to a high degree of accuracy, and doing a lot of complicated math.\u003Cbr\u003E\nModern INS are based on Ring Laser Gyroscopes, which are so good that you might as well say they don\u0027t drift at all, and you can almost instantly get a position fix by using the GPS receiver that you almost certainly have onboard for other purposes (as a matter of fact, these days INS is usually a back-up to GPS, only used when you can\u0027t get a good GPS signal). And yes, GPS can be used in space, the equations change and you have to account for the doppler shift of the radio signals due to the high speed that orbital flight entails, but it\u0027s perfectly doable and in fact I think SpaceX\u0027s Starlink satellites actually use GPS to coordinate their locations in their satellite constellation (I could be wrong, but why not use what\u0027s already there?). With over 300 satellites launched to date, it\u0027s the simplest way to avoid satellite collisions in that constellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: As to how the nav-ball itself will work with axial tilt, I think you will be able to have it switch between several modes (both automatically and at-will, similar to how the KSP 1 altimeter works, but with some automation).\u003Cbr\u003E\nModes I just thought up include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAligned with local equator\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAligned with the ecliptic plane of bodies orbiting a planet (useful for transferring between a planet and it\u0027s moons)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAligned with stellar ecliptic plane (useful for interplanetary travel)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAligned with galactic ecliptic plane (useful for interstellar travel)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerhaps \u0022aligned to custom beacons\u0022 as well, that way it would allow you to set up your own local coordinate system for something like setting up a colony.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat last one is iffy, and I\u0027m not even sure how it would work that makes it different from one of the other modes in a meaningful way unless you\u0027re somewhere like near the poles of a planet or moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-22T16:50:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2021 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T08:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would prefer each \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E to have its own coordinate system and the attitude indicator to just change with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E change just like the altitude indicator does now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T13:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 data-ratio=\u002242.25\u0022 height=\u0022505\u0022 style=\u0022width:400px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022AeTLhdD.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AeTLhdD.jpg\u0022\u003EKSP1\u0027s navball changes quite dramatically upon a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew players \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/187731-orbital-physics-broken-or-only-bad/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eoccasionally get confused\u003C/a\u003E, but seem to figure it out quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrincipia allows different planets to have rotation axes in different directions, and \u003Cem\u003Eallows\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0different \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts#navball\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enavball frames of reference\u003C/a\u003E, but one does not force the other.\u00A0 You can always choose to use the navball aligned to the body in whose \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E you currently are, as in stock KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-28T15:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah nothing I said prevents you from setting the navball to \u0022stay aligned with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the planet you\u0027re in\u0022.

In this mode, you\u0027d get navball markers for prograde, retrograde, etc. that consider both your path around Kerbin AND what effect that has on your path around the sun, and the velocity indicator would indicate your velocity in Kerbol orbit (taking into account the influence of your velocity around Kerbin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame idea applies on the Mun or Minmus for instance, you\u0027d be \u003Cem\u003Eable\u003C/em\u003E to set the navball to indicate what your orbit around whichever of those moons you\u0027re orbiting means for your orbit around Kerbin, and additionally you\u0027d be able to even set your navball to indicate your trajectory around the sun (while orbiting the Mun or Minmus).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is done to make it easier to do interplanetary trajectories from ANY body to ANY body in the entire game, including directly from a moon of a planet in one solar system to a moon of a planet in another solar system (tho to be fair unless we can get these interstellar ships to burn at like 5g then the burns for that would likely continue across a few \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E borders, so that might complicate things on the \u0022thrust while on rails\u0022 side of things, but that\u0027s not for this topic).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially, it makes it so you can tell the game to do the math to figure out your true solar orbit velocity vector no matter where you are, which is critically important for calculating interplanetary trajectories.
