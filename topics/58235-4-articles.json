I\u0027ve got methane going into RF-enabled tanks fine, but I\u0027m wondering where resource unit size is defined, as opposed to density? Because the KSP Interstellar Rockomax 64 holds more way methane (plus LoX) units than the stock Rockomax, 7538 units versus 6400 units - I suppose because it has its own capacity definition - and that\u0027s bugging me. Can I alter Methane\u0027s unit size downwards, like Xenon, without affecting its unit value? To the ends of matching the performance of the KSPI methane tanks without having to manually define methane capacity for every other tank in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this is unclear, why and how Xenon has its own unit size is a little unclear to me in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T08:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Estock resources define only name, mass density (t/u), color, tweakable, flow and transfer I think the parameter you want to tweak is utilization in the tank definition.

So I used this site \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-to-weight\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E to get the weights for most of the fuels from KSPI. I think I have converted them properly into the cfg file that I have jotted down and wanted to know if this would work theoretically. I am going to try it here in a second, but I am sure it will need more tweaking in terms of units, but I attempted to calculate the weight by unit I think. So were water equals 1000g per liter, it works out to .01 on the mass line. I am not sure if this is correct, but from what I can see of the weights of the other fuels that have a mass augmentation to be in the ballpark. I know that real fuels deals with some of these resources, however, I am not trying to change what fuel is being burned by motors, just trying to change the fuels the tanks can hold. So I hope that its ok to have this conversation here, instead of there, if not I will delete and re-post as I don\u0027t want to take this to the wrong forum.

I this mistake is probably due to my not paying attention to the wording on the documentation. I think I only need to add to weight if the tank needs a refrigeration unit or shielding or whatever, so that would only be for the fuels that require a little something extra, it seems the liter units are pretty much the same across the board for all the liquids so, I think I will finish this cfg file. I would still like input, however, on any balancing issues that may arise from this. My main hope is to ditch some of the spare tanks that I wont need thus lowering my memory usage until we get a 64bit windows version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-29T03:42:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2014 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrWizerd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETested\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T09:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think something like that should be a KSPI supplied Module Manager patch.

I have just been met with some minor hostilities when I have made inquiries in other threads before this regarding other such things. I did get it working, however, the only thing I could not do is add active refrigeration to tanks, but this is to be expected. I was thinking of attempting to create an active refrigeration tank, that had its own type. However, it kind of defeats the purpose of reducing texture files. Then again, one tank that replaces 2 is still better off... Anyhow, I will take the file over to KSPI and see what they have to say. Just to cover due diligence Taniwha, there is not currently a way to add energy drain to a tank is there? Like for a specific fuel type, I know that it supports boil off which works for these the cryotanks fuels for the purpose of balance, which I have set, but need to test. But I did not see in the tutorial of options a way to add energy drain to the tank. You don\u0027t need to add it or anything, I am just making sure that there isn\u0027t a hidden option \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biotronic","CreatedById":72381,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T18:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrying to make a plugin work with Modular Fuel Tanks (Goodspeed\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72567-0-23-5-Goodspeed-Aerospace-Parts-TweakScale-plugin-v2014-4-1B/page8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETweakScale plugin\u003C/a\u003E to be specific), I encountered problems when updating to the version in Git - the namespaces are different.
