I\u0027d love to see it moved to the same tier as the Skipper and Poodle. The Skipper kinda fits the purpose of the J-2 Engine and the Poodle (Which I call Rockomax Service Engine because I\u0027m using Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp which should become stock anyway) fits the purpose of a Service Module Engine, so getting a 3 man pod for this diameter kinda makes sense. At least, it makes more sense than getting it \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the Hitchhiker Storage Container.
