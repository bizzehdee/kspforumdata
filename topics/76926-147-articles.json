It matters on both the maneuverability of the craft as well as the settings. No matter how you set it it can\u0027t make a brick dodge a sidewinder. I\u0027ve done tests with my super-maneuverable fighter and it can effectively fight as well as evade all but the closest of missile fire. It took a lot of tweaking (6-8 flights) to find settings so that the AI could maneuver, but wouldn\u0027t end up over-correcting itself into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The selected weapons actually depend on the Weapons Manager Guard, which picks weapons based on distance, and effective range (for guns, it chooses the gun with the most turning range). It won\u0027t really use the guns until close range, but will likely choose close range missiles over a static vulcan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

I do believe it is influenced by Steer Limiter, but I\u0027m not entirely sure how. My leading theory is that it influences maneuvers somehow. However once again my understanding of this one is vague.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Steer Limiter: How much it will steer based on percentage. Only really necessary to lower it from 1 if the craft in question is nigh impossible to control without fine control on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Steer Damping: Determines when the AI will ease up on controls for maneuvers. Necessary to keep it from over-correcting into the dirt. However if its too high the AI won\u0027t use the craft to its full ability. Generally best to put this at 5 for early tests with super-maneuverables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Max Speed: Max speed the AI will go at, if it exceeds this speed it cuts throttle. Keep 15-30m/s lower than the speed that either the wings tear off when steering, or when the craft loses significant steering ability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jackalan23","CreatedById":122466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T11:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s my computer then thx for your help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supergamervictor","CreatedById":23473,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T16:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a new question : Why are the AI guards not firing the guns?
