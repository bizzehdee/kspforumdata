I would say try to use as little throttle as possible, slow yourself down early so you don\\\u0027t have to do a full-throttle burn to slow yourself down closer to the Mun. I usually burn down to 200-300 m/s when I get captured by the Mun, then go to about 100k and then go for a slow burn to get down to 50 m/s or so by the time I\\\u0027m at 10k. Then I keep the throttle very low to keep my speed down around 20-50 m/s until I\\\u0027m about 1k up, then I reduce to about 10-20 until I see my shadow. I guess the main point is that smaller burns consume less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m sure someone else will be able to give you a much better detailed walkthrough on this though.
