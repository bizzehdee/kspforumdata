I found this back in .12 (the first KSP version I used) and it\u0027s still there in .90. I tested this example craft in .25 and .90 last night to make sure the bug shows in both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should not matter what order the couplers and engines are placed on the adapter or what order the stages are arranged. As long as the correct icons for the engines and decouplers are together in the stages, the activation should always work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplicating debugging this is that Sepratrons are not affected. I tried swapping on small I-beams with a pair of Sepratrons in place of the liquid fuel engines, tanks and probe cores. The Sepratrons light every time, in all possible arrangements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve experienced other oddities when using this adapter in rockets, which can be worked around by altering the order in which parts are attached and/or staging order while achieving the same final construction. If the bug is fixed, there would be no need to do such fiddling because there wouldn\u0027t be the possibility of stumbling upon a configuration that does not work \u003Cem\u003Ebut should\u003C/em\u003E with this adapter in the build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tri and Bi couplers should also be examined to see if they have the same or similar issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
