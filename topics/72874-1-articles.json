Either directly with an imaginary tether or each suit would have a battery that you return like a science experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T17:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh. Interesting... Though it does have sort of a KAS-ish vibe to it, what with the ability to put on extra solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most cases, though, the vessels that run out of power are probes. Manned vessels don\u0027t drain electricity unless you are applying SAS force, while probes are a constant drain. If you realize you are going to have dead batteries beforehand, you can usually salvage a manned ship, but with probes... you\u0027re sunk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T17:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell a few times ive lost solar panels while landing or on rovers and then run out of power. Its not a common issue i realize but a neat little something that might give life to a lost mission otherwise. Also if you follow up on an un-powered probe with a mission or rover you can get it working again. Plus sometimes you run out of power before you remember to deploy your solar panels. it happens often enough to me lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
