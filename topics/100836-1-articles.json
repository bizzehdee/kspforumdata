Really you\u0027d need to go about it one of at least two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Empirical Method: Build a table of information by repeatedly launching a test rocket until you can build a table based on dV at some relatively constant takeoff TWR. Like LethalDose said, 1.5-1.7 TWR at launch is about right for most stock craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Theoretical Method: Build an iterative computer program or spreadsheet that can solve all the equations for you. You \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be able to build and solve a system of equations by hand, but it would get rather messy with all the calculus.

Rather than solving a set of equations, I went through process #1 above with a few assumptions to make testing easier. Then I built a chart that shows me how much dV I need to reach a certain altitude. Now when I get those \u0022test part X at altitude Y and speed Z,\u0022 I know how much dV I need without having to over engineer everything.

I might have been misleading with my question. I mean to say what is the end goal of calculating the numbers? Are you trying to optimize staging? Optimize payload fraction? Obtain a specific altitude/velocity for part testing? Get to orbit? That sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally people who ask questions similar to yours like to avoid over engineering (I am one of those people). But there is a huge array of things to help avoid over engineering. The tool to use depends a bit on what you are trying to accomplish. Someone built charts which show the \u0022best\u0022 engine for given a TWR and craft mass, for example. Or dV burn numbers for an optimum ascent (so you can plan stage requirements).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just want to figure out if your rocket will make it to orbit, then your most basic bet is to determine how much dV your rocket has (either by hand or with a plugin such as Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb). ~4,500 is required to get to orbit. When I use SRBs, I generally bump up the requirement some because they often lose more dV to drag than a dV equivalent liquid fueled engine (since you can\u0027t control the throttle mid flight). This might be where your question is coming in, as to how much dV is lost due to drag. That\u0027s a bit tough to tell in stock KSP right now because the drag model is dependent on ship mass. So real world drag equations don\u0027t strictly apply, since currently Cd of the rocket is not based on it\u0027s shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m starting to wander a bit, but hopefully I\u0027m narrowing down in on what your question is primarily aimed at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHost56","CreatedById":138750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T21:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems I have been fairly misleading as well.

Estimate 4,500m/s Delta-V required to reach orbit (75km x 75km). We know from Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation that Dv = Isp*9.8*Ln(M0/M1). M0 = full mass, M1 = empty mass. For the Isp, you can estimate the average if it changes. This is true for any single stage. You can add stages together for the total mission (say you have asparagus staging, or something) by calculating this for each stage, and adding the total together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Dv = Dv1 \u002B Dv2 \u002B ... \u002B DvN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you can then work that backwards to solve for the Full / Empty masses required for each stage.
