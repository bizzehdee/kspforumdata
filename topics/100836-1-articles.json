The TWR at launch for the vessel you\u0027ve provided would be 315/(9.82 \\* 15.1) = 2.12\n\nFor stock aero (I play with FAR), the consensus seems to be you should aim for a TWR of ~ 1.5-1.7 at liftoff, but don\u0027t take that as gospel, at least from me.\n\nFor what you\u0027re asking, Th3F3ar is correct: Getting those estimates is something of a fool\u0027s errand IMO. The end state of the flight is determined not only the starting TWR, mass, etc, but also the flight path. In general, I think stock aero takes about 4.5 km/s of dV to get into LKO with a reasonable TWR. That\u0027s a better target for vessel design than what it appears you\u0027re trying to do."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:01:08Z","Content":"The type of information you are asking for is a bit difficult to calculate by hand. Really you\u0027d need to go about it one of at least two ways:\n\n1) Empirical Method: Build a table of information by repeatedly launching a test rocket until you can build a table based on dV at some relatively constant takeoff TWR. Like LethalDose said, 1.5-1.7 TWR at launch is about right for most stock craft.\n\n2) Theoretical Method: Build an iterative computer program or spreadsheet that can solve all the equations for you. You *might* be able to build and solve a system of equations by hand, but it would get rather messy with all the calculus. But you can build an set of equations and have the computer do some iterative calculations for you. I think someone might have even done something like this and posted a few charts around here.\n\nWhat\u0027s maybe more important for us to know, is why you are trying to figure out how high and how far your rocket is going to be? Rather than us trying to help you recreate a complex set of equations, there might be a simpler method to find the real information you are after.\n\nFor example, I wanted to know \u0022how much rocket\u0022 I needed for part testing. Rather than solving a set of equations, I went through process #1 above with a few assumptions to make testing easier. Then I built a chart that shows me how much dV I need to reach a certain altitude. Now when I get those \u0022test part X at altitude Y and speed Z,\u0022 I know how much dV I need without having to over engineer everything. Some people don\u0027t find that fun and it\u0027s easier to just put the pieces together and go. So it all depends on what you want.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:06:49Z","Content":"You may get a look to the Ascent Komputron: very useful for that kind of stuff!"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHost56","CreatedById":138750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T17:18:18Z","Content":"In response to your question on why I want to calculate it, it\u0027s because I\u0027m playing career mode and don\u0027t want to waste money on a failed flight that could have been avoided.\n\nThank you for your help though."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T19:26:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In response to your question on why I want to calculate it, it\u0027s because I\u0027m playing career mode and don\u0027t want to waste money on a failed flight that could have been avoided.\n\u003E Thank you for your help though.\n\nThen unless you\u0027re going to orbit (~4,500m/s dV), leave altitude-dependent missions until you have wings and do them with a plane that can fly at any altitude, control its speed better and use very-efficient jet engines.\n\nTHE problem, as the others have said, is that there are so many unknown variables affecting your flight, especially those dictated by your ascent path.\n\nIf you\u0027re actually doing the \u0027achieve an altitude of nnnn\u0027 contracts then ... overbuild.

I might have been misleading with my question. I mean to say what is the end goal of calculating the numbers? Are you trying to optimize staging? Optimize payload fraction? Obtain a specific altitude/velocity for part testing? Get to orbit? That sort of thing.\n\nGenerally people who ask questions similar to yours like to avoid over engineering (I am one of those people). But there is a huge array of things to help avoid over engineering. The tool to use depends a bit on what you are trying to accomplish. Someone built charts which show the \u0022best\u0022 engine for given a TWR and craft mass, for example. Or dV burn numbers for an optimum ascent (so you can plan stage requirements).\n\nIf you just want to figure out if your rocket will make it to orbit, then your most basic bet is to determine how much dV your rocket has (either by hand or with a plugin such as Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb). ~4,500 is required to get to orbit. When I use SRBs, I generally bump up the requirement some because they often lose more dV to drag than a dV equivalent liquid fueled engine (since you can\u0027t control the throttle mid flight). This might be where your question is coming in, as to how much dV is lost due to drag. That\u0027s a bit tough to tell in stock KSP right now because the drag model is dependent on ship mass. So real world drag equations don\u0027t strictly apply, since currently Cd of the rocket is not based on it\u0027s shape.\n\nI think I\u0027m starting to wander a bit, but hopefully I\u0027m narrowing down in on what your question is primarily aimed at?\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHost56","CreatedById":138750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T21:14:57Z","Content":"It seems I have been fairly misleading as well. Specifically, yes, I want to send something into orbit, and I\u0027m on a budget. All I need to know is how high each stage is going to go, given thrust, mass, burn time, etc. That way, if I can predict the outcome to some sort of degree, I can figure out a rocket that will work the first time around instead of wasting money on rockets that don\u0027t make it. Not so much the stages that are used to establish orbit, just the ones that get me up out of the atmosphere.\n\nThank you for other explanations as well."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T23:23:41Z","Content":"MrHost,\n\nThe info you are looking for can be determined from working backwards with the Delta-V provided by the other users. Estimate 4,500m/s Delta-V required to reach orbit (75km x 75km). We know from Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation that Dv = Isp\\*9.8\\*Ln(M0/M1). M0 = full mass, M1 = empty mass. For the Isp, you can estimate the average if it changes. This is true for any single stage. You can add stages together for the total mission (say you have asparagus staging, or something) by calculating this for each stage, and adding the total together:\n\nTotal Dv = Dv1 \u002B Dv2 \u002B ... \u002B DvN\n\nThen, you can then work that backwards to solve for the Full / Empty masses required for each stage. For instance, if you know that you need 4,500 Delta-V from a single-stage, and that stage needs to deliver 2,000kg into orbit:\n\n4,500 = 350\\*9.8\\*Ln(M0/2000kg) - solve for M0:\n\n1.312 = Ln(M0/2000kg)\n\nI cheat and use a table I already have and find that the mass ratio is between 3.5:1 and 4:1, so I use the average of 3.75 (ln(3.74 = ~1.322)) - which means that I need 7500kg of fuel at 350 newton seconds (Isp) to get that payload into orbit in a single stage.\n\nOr I could use the identity of e to get the actual result:\n\ne^1.312 = M0/2000kg\n\n3.714 = M0/2000kg\n\n7427 = M0\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T23:27:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHost56","CreatedById":138750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:59:42Z","Content":"Thank you so much!"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T00:40:44Z","Content":"Quick \u0027n\u0027 dirty rule of thumb for stock:\n\n You will spend the first 1,500 m/sec in **vertical boost**.
