It does two things. Autothrottles to keep you 50 seconds from AP, and steers pitch to match a simple equation: tan(altitude/18000)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried 10000 instead of 18000 but that leads to heating effects during launch and I like to avoid that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, my idea today was, a MOD that would put a target on the navball that showed that pitch during ascent. The player would then try to keep that marker in the middle, rather than my script which steers for you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing fancy in the way of optimized trajectory for a specific craft, just a hard coded \u0022reverse ballistic trajectory\u0022 upward to 80km.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
