I just placed an upside down decoupler on the topmost floating node so I could decouple, then turn around and dock and extract the lander (much like Apollo\u0027s TD\u0026amp;E maneuver.) I did this because I didn\u0027t want fairings to eject. I did run into a problem however, where initially the decoupler didn\u0027t actually disengage.
