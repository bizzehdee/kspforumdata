Below is my best thus far \u0022the great tripod.\u0022 It was launched mainly in one go, then received some extra fuel and engines in orbit before heading to the mun. My goal was to land it right next to the armstrong memorial, but targeting of the landing zone proved very difficult due to the large mass and low thrust. Ended up landing about 30km away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/4204/tri1u.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tri1u.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img22/9813/tri3v.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tri3v.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img594/5357/tri2y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tri2y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the buran cams aren\u0027t stock but all the actual engine/fuel/phsyics stuff was.
