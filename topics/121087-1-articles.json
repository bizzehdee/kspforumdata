Purpose being, the shuttle barely touches space, then glides back down to the runway to land and be re-used, while the main stage continues on to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/e1JQO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to the design is that it maintains symmetry in all three modes: Lifter, shuttle, and mainstage. Each mode has at least two-way symmetry. Changing the loadout on the mainstage can easily be compensated for by adjusting the thrust limiter on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch, the thrust limits are heavily skewed. As the shuttle loses mass, the thrust of the mainstage is adjusted to compensate. Engine cutoff occurs just before the shuttle tanks are emptied, leaving a little in reserve in case a push is needed to complete a large cross-range glide back to the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding involves two steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
