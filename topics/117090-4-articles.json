So for example one could create a standard part with rigidbody/colliders (i.e. habitation module\u0027) that have i.e. 2 \u0027holes\u0027 for physicless docking ports that you can attach in editor. Then when launched those 3 parts would count as 1 part with 2 docking ports (performancewise). That could be partial solution to the performance problem. It would come with some ceveats though (player would not be able to click on docking port parts - no collider, so generally no option to undock a part?, probably those parts wouldn\u0027t work well with KIS system etc). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis however could be solved by hybrid system, so one part is normal and has integrated docking module (i.e. habitation module with one side docking port) and other side you would just pluck physicless docking port.

Very interesting findings. Especially the fact that the shielded docking ports have less of a performance impact (when working properly) compared to a normal docking port.

So they physics-less docking ports are a complete no-go because of stock code (and there is no clean way to override that section of code to fix it through custom plugin; and the docking port code explicitly references ModuleDockingNode by class/type so you cannot create a non-derivitive clean implementation and still maintain compatibility with stock docking ports; they would not know to look for your non-derived class and would never connect).

Compared to the current balance, the new numbers should increase weight substantially (~35%), but also increase the dV budget for a design by %20. Tankage mass fraction has stayed consistent (and is inline with stock values), but the tanks now hold more fuel. The new fuel/volume/mass numbers are based off of an idealized fuel-tank for each size (rather than the previous balance pass that was based on the actual volume of the individual tanks in any particular part). This brings the fuel tanks to be more in line (volume wise) with the cargo parts (and allows me to add a resource-switch to the cargo parts to allow them to carry fuel as well, without being overly OP compared to the other fuel tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also aimed for single-stage capable landers for -most- situations. I\u0027ve found it is barely (if any) more efficient to build a 2-stage Mun lander than a single stage (using stock parts at least); so I\u0027ve saved the multi-stage setups for planets/moons that really need them -- Duna, Laythe, Tylo, Kerbin. Most other moons and planets have low enough gravity /dV requirements that a single stage lander is small and light enough that designing a two-stage lander for the purpose really only increases part count and cost (you -might- save a slight bit of mass on the two-stage design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on this information? Does it seem like these parts would be overpowered, underpowered, or just about right? I have tried to maintain stock balance values for tank dry mass ratios, and am staying within the volume constraints of each part (e.g. it does not magically contain more fuel than it could by exterior volume). There is still a bit of wiggle room in the numbers though, so please let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T17:02:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T17:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust out of curiosity, will they have IVA\u0027s upon release?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T17:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust out of curiosity, will they have IVA\u0027s upon release?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinished IVAs - no.

About the best I can do is the view-switching. Or I guess I could move the kerbal seats -way- upwards. The overall geometry though is flawed in regards to Kerbals; It works/would work for humans IRL, as we can move our head around to look out the window, and move it back to look at instruments if needed; not so easy to do with a Kerbal in-game. IIRC, that was how the Apollo crew flew the LEM - standing up with their noses pressed into the window, moving back and looking around at instruments as needed (or relying on the co-pilot to relay vital information).

I was waiting to finalize the masses on the pods before working over the engine thrust and mass values. 40 or so will probably be about right for the single engine; It just needs to be powerful enough to be used as an ascent engine for the LC2-POD\u002Bascent tank (updated full/wet mass value of 2.82; 40 thrust would give a vacuum TWR of ~1.41). Might even bring it down a bit further; the single engine is at most intended for low-gravity worlds, so it likely doesn\u0027t even need a 1:1 TWR on kerbin.

Yes, it is one of the highest ISP RP1/LOX engines available; why would you use anything but the most efficient engine available for a real lander design? However, the ISP might come down slightly (350?), as I believe the performance #s of the parts with their new fuel/mass values might be a tiny bit -too- good. Might make this during a second balance pass; will probably keep the ISP as-is for now, and look into adjusting in the future if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines will start to be available about 1/3 the way through the tech-tree (45 or 90 science nodes); one or two nodes deeper in than the most similar stock counterpart, but still early enough to make the landers useful in a (still developing) career game.
