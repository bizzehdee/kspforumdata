It is composed primarily of water ice surrounding a small core of unknown extremely dense matter. When Minmus was young, and its crust was still in a liquid state and before it lost its thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, a species of microorganism thrived in its oceans. This microorganism secreted copious quantities of lipids, hexahydrothymol, chlorophyll, and resins which remain in the crust of Minmus today.\n\nThis theory explains why Minmus can exist as close as it does to Kerbol: As the ice of Minmus\u0027s crust sublimes in the vacuum of space, the resin is left behind and forms a barrier to further sublimation. This theory would also explain why the crust of Minmus tastes like mint ice cream, and why it is such a popular destination for spacefaring kerbals who are running low on snacks."},{"CreatedByName":"MGCJerry","CreatedById":95202,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:03:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E HAH!

These microorganisms, when die also become food for the others so they multiply. Suddenly there was a huge solar flare that pushed Minmus further out of its orbit, which stripped its atmosphere killed the microorganisms causing them to die, and burn into some weird green material. This caused Kerbin to pickup and alter Minmus\u0027s orbit to become its own moon.\n\nI just made that up so its going to have a lot of holes."},{"CreatedByName":"Sovnheim","CreatedById":104593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:52:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s mint chocolate chip ice cream!\n\nAn after eight. \n\nA big, delicious, orbiting after eight."}]}
