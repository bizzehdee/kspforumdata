It is powered by 2 CR-7 RAPIER engines with optional closed cycle mode for \u0022edge of space\u0022 operations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original aircraft\u0027s streamlined profile is replaced by a beefy high capacity \u0022space tuna\u0022 fuselage, providing vastly increased capacity for internal fuel and optional oxidizer for sub-orbital missions. The Mk1 cockpit is also retrofitted with a heat-pipe cooling solution, ejecting waste heat outboard of the primary air intakes. A modest array of structural parts around the intakes and engines, plus an added ventral stabilizer provide some measure of area ruling, decreasing transonic drag and improving high Mach stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ynFdSgM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ynFdSgM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T04:53:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 04:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheLeganderyHero","CreatedById":105554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T04:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat craft, like the way you used the radiator panels and the MK2 parts, though the cut off between the engine bay and the fuselage is a bit sharp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T04:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the precoolers and the Mk2 hull don\u0027t go well together, especially in the middle where the reversed structural intakes serve to cover up the hole.
