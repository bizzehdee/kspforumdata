Not if you see it as the abstraction - that it is - for a veteran pilot\u0027s skill in keeping his spacecraft under perfect control, which increases the mission\u0027s fuel efficiency. A USS Enterprise with Scotty in engineering is going to run smoother than one with a generic chief engineer.

It is not an abstraction for anything. If you take a spacecraft of a given mass, with a given engine, and perform a burn of a given duration in a given point in its orbit, you can only have ONE resulting orbit. You can\u0027t argue with that: it is a fact. Any game mechanic that breaks this fact is also breaking physics: period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t justify it in any reasonable way. I\u0027ve seen an argument tossed in this thread a lot of time, \u0022an experienced pilot knows better where the safety limit of the engine is\u0022. No: an experienced pilot will just do what mission control (i.e, the player) is telling him to: if mission control orders a rookie to overthrottle, he will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will repeat it because to me it is the most important thing about this discussion: this game mechanic is not an abstraction for anything that can be done in real life, and it opens up holes in the physics simulation where the trajectory of the vehicle is not purely dictated by the physics of its component.

It is not an abstraction for anything. If you take a spacecraft of a given mass, with a given engine, and perform a burn of a given duration in a given point in its orbit, you can only have ONE resulting orbit. You can\u0027t argue with that: it is a fact. Any game mechanic that breaks this fact is also breaking physics: period.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T15:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless you don;t control it.
