The Germans start by bombing civilians in the UK\u2014not necessarily intentionally, it was impossible to bomb targets in any city at that time without hitting civilians, a \u0022precision\u0022 mission would maybe land 80% of the bombs within 2 \u003Cstrong\u003Emiles\u003C/strong\u003E of the aim point, but I recall reading about bomber \u003Cem\u003Ejettisoning\u003C/em\u003E bombs and heading home, which hit a neighborhood. RAF responded by attacking Germans in kind, then Coventry happened, and Bomber Command developed the art/science of starting firestorms with night time area bombing. The USAAF stuck to \u0022precision\u0022 daylight attacks, but many bombs obviously hit well outside targeted factories, etc. LeMay moves to the PTO, and the jet stream, distance, etc make \u0022strategic\u0022 bombing virtually impossible over Japan (not to mention distributed industry/\u0022piece work\u0022). He elects to switch to the RAF Bomber Command model, and burns whole cities to the ground. BDA was done in \u0022square miles destroyed.\u0022 They also mined the Inland Sea, and the USN submarine service did what the U-boats never came close to doing, they completely destroyed the Japanese Merchant Marine. The island nation of Japan, that required outside inputs from over the water was starving, and cities were burning as fast as they got on the target list. Civilian bombing deaths in total are estimated at ~675k for Japan\u2014and technically that is overstated as by Imperial Edict in March \u002745, every male from 15-60, and every female from 17 to 40 was conscripted for the final battle (invasion), making all those people \u003Cem\u003Etechnically\u003C/em\u003E combatants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, nukes did not kill millions, and arguably their existence prevented a conventional WW3. In the counterfactual with no nukes, the US still defeats Japan while losing substantially more American lives\u2014and \u003Cem\u003Evastly\u003C/em\u003E more Japanese lives than were killed by the bombs\u2014using Okinawa as a model, the Japanese lost ~10X the US losses. 250k US soldiers dead? 2.5M Japanese. 500k? 5M. That\u0027s just on the Home Islands and still a nightmare for both sides. The CCCP then invades the Japanese holdings on the mainland... hard to even imagine the toll there. And there was a standing order for all POWs held by the Japanese everywhere in the Empire to be eliminated upon invasion of Japan\u2014most were civilians from the countries the Japanese took at the start of the war\u2014several hundred thousand people. Anyway, the war ends, and minus nukes there is still a Cold War (though it\u0027s hard to imagine people somehow not figuring out \u0022physics\u0022 and building bombs anyway\u2014they are possible, so their construction was certain, IMHO). That Cold War minus nukes would be far, far more likely to turn hot. Why not? So more deaths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs awful as the bombs were, they were just a more efficient way to kill people, the attitude that made killing huge numbers normal was already there because of the war (at the most charitable, or just in human nature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-25T20:29:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2023 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 25\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-26T02:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nagain human behavior is the biggest great filter. inherited from the transition from apehood to humanhood. no mater what notions of civilization you claim to hold, it is so easy to fall back on old patterns, patterns which are very destructive at scale. and with post industrial weapons of war, those behaviors had us killing eachother in droves. sometimes it takes an existential threat to make people think about what they are doing. things like nuclear weapons and climate change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlets say we all agree to give up nuclear weapons, we start having them dismantled and their cores burned in nuclear power plants. it only takes the last world leader to go: \u0022haha we got nukes and you dont, surrender or die!\u0022 of course they wouldn\u0027t be the only one to pull that stunt and they would be lobbing nukes at each other in short order. old patterns are always there. its better to just let the nukes rust in their silos and carry out our stupid little proxy wars as the world leaders beat on their chests like gorillas. on the other side the good thing about primitive instincts is that survival is one of them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-26T04:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith or without WWII, a primitive nuclear device would appear and be tested within a decade from the fission discovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWWII just made this a little faster due to the motivation, but WWII absence would make it easier due to economy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, once you have started uranium enrichment for the reactor, you automatically get fissiles for much simpler military needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-26T04:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224305945\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218603\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690344694\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith or without WWII, a primitive nuclear device would appear and be tested within a decade from the fission discovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWWII just made this a little faster due to the motivation, but WWII absence would make it easier due to economy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, once you have started uranium enrichment for the reactor, you automatically get fissiles for much simpler military needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, there\u0027s no alternate history where nukes are not built within a short time period of when they were.

The US famously worked to get designs that were \u0022good enough\u0022 for the task at hand, then went into truly mass production. The US also concentrated on the supply chain (as one does when one is used to selling stuff). Logistics wins wars. A few hundred vastly superior aircraft than can only manage to get a few 10s in the air per day loses to 2000 less capable aircraft in the air. Or large numbers of meh tanks that are easy to fix (driven by guys who own and fix their own cars/tractors at home) beat incredibly good tanks that are finicky, driven by people who take public transit at home, and need specialized mechanics to fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe counterfactual of a later start date for the war is interesting, but made more complicated by Japan. Japan started a war that their own IGHQ thought had a 90% chance of failure resulting in (their own words), \u0022national death.\u0022 (from a post war interview mentioned in\u003Cem\u003E Combined Fleet Decoded\u003C/em\u003E). They started anyway since they had left the Washington Naval Treaty earlier, and the US responded by securing the money to increase the fleet. The US data was all public\u2014Congress passed a budget, and the plan for what ships would be built, when was in all the papers. The Essex Class CVs that were commissioning in 1943 were paid for before the war ever started. So I think Japan has to start their war around when they did regardless. Does Germany join in solidarity? Another bizarre counterfactual is that many forget that Germany was in cahoots with the CCCP. Maybe they actually team up in some counterfactual (as they did vs Poland (something many also tend to forget/ignore)? This latter is an interesting one since the US government was absolutely riddled with Soviet agents\u2014up to the the assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State. So the German-Soviet team would have a lot of intelligence that the Germans lacked. Course Stalin sharing intel with even an ally seems... unlikely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, I recommend reading up on the end-game of WW2 in books written after the mid 1990s. There was a brief period after 1991 when some old Soviet era documents became available (there\u0027s good Yale University Press series with a lot of this), then in 1996 much of the US codebreaking was finally declassified. During the war years (and before), the US was reading even the comms of our allies, or of neutral countries. Importantly, the Soviets diplomatic cipher was a one time pad, but because of the war, they reused pads... which meant we read those as well. This played into some post war drama in the US, since the authorities could not tell how they knew what they knew about various spies. Tough to make a legal case when you know someone is a spy because managed to link a code name with them, and you read the report because the code was broken\u2014but you don\u0027t want the other guys to halt their current efforts, since as long as they keep on keeping on, you have a handle on some of their

Einstein came to the US soon after Hitler took power. The Germans discovered fission at the very end of 1938. They started a small project to work the issue in April of 1939. In August 1939, Einstein wrote his letter to FDR. The US spent a small effort from that point forward (maybe a couple million $ over a few years), but did not work in earnest until the Manhattan District (Project) started in 1942. The US then spent ~$2B dollars from 1942 to completion in 1945, employing hundreds of thousands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermany spent ~$2M in USD for their entire effort. In order to imagine a Germany first counterfactual, they would somehow need to be interested far, far earlier than they were. Einstein is writing his letter regardless. The US, even just doing minimal effort work after that letter to see what was possible spent as much in 3 years as Germany spent for the whole effort over 6 years, the we finished by spending 1000X more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy 1944 (Normandy), Germany would have needed a US scaled effort (where are they getting the fissile material, BTW?) in 1941 at the latest\u2014is that even plausible given the relative size of population/economies/etc? Also, bombing Normandy literally assumes the war started as it did\u2014in which case Germany has no path to securing the materials needed, much less making a bomb. Remember that the US pushed really hard as a race to beat Germany (loads of smart people there with the skills), Germany would have had to think of it as not \u0022a super weapon,\u0022 but, \u0022we need to beat a combination of the US/UK to get the super weapon.\u0022 So they would have had to estimate what the US could afford in terms of money and manpower\u2014and dedicate MORE manpower/$. Incredibly unlikely (and very likely not even possible). Then if the US learns of such a program, we just spend yet more. We had more of everything, in that sort of arms race, the smaller country/economy loses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-26T20:05:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2023 08:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 26\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-26T21:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224305839\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218603\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690312351\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/25/2023 at 9:12 PM, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe US assessment of Japan as a secondary threat was there from the start of the war.
