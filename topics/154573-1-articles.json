All of my rockets, no matter big or small always pitch downwards. I tried flying with and without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E but neither seem to make a difference. I tried rotating my rocket 180 degrees so it starts off facing the other way but every time shortly after launch, it pitches down. I bought the game recently while the game was in\u00A01.2.2. As of writing this the game is still 1.2.2 and I have not installed any mods from the time that this problem started to occur. The only mods i have installed are B9, Airplane Plus, and OPT space plane parts. Below are links to\u00A0screenshots of a test Rocket to demonstrate my issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/VoaO1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/VoaO1\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T10:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at the pitch indicator on the first screenshot.

Alt\u002BX has no affect except to reset to pitch down. I must Alt\u002BUpArrow and hold to neutral before each takeoff and ignore all previous orbiting or landed flights, for they will tumble. I\u0027m running 1.2.2.1622 and didn\u0027t have this problem before v1.2.2.x. Was there some change to the control settings that I missed or is this a major bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
