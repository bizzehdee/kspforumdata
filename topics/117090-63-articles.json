I don;t see the techtree as a time-line, rather as a career progression (getting more science as you go from Mun to Minmus, by that time you will have 3/4 of the tree cleared if you gather all the science. I basically clear most of the tech I need by doing two runs to the Mun and two to minmus, progressing the rocket I use each time. First one is a godawful KSP contraption, the second already starts to use some other mod parts, third is a full fledged SSTU with nukes/NFprop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T19:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCTT adds some additional nodes beyond Very Heavy Rocketry: Experimental, Gigantic, and Colossal Rocketry (I think Experimental Rocketry used to be a stock node). \u00A0You\u0027re still somewhat limited to the stock \u0022bigger = more advanced\u0022 paradigm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T20:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222374494\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453490919\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119688\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blowfish\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, blowfish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCTT adds some additional nodes beyond Very Heavy Rocketry: Experimental, Gigantic, and Colossal Rocketry (I think Experimental Rocketry used to be a stock node). \u00A0You\u0027re still somewhat limited to the stock \u0022bigger = more advanced\u0022 paradigm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that is probably a large part of the problem; the stock tech tree is indeed balanced towards bigger=better; which is patently not the case.\u00A0 Not to mention the whole \u0027starting manned\u0027 problem (really, the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the tech-tree should be building up to figuring out -how- to get kerbals safely into space and back down).\u00A0 Trying to view it as a timeline is probably also part of my problem.... its all backwards/mixed up, and stops in the late 60\u0027s....\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngines -- seem to be the most difficult parts to balance, due to the stock setup, with perhaps tanks or pods/service modules coming in as a close second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example from the GitHub conversation, the Merlin-1D is superior to the F1 in nearly every stat that matters (ISP, TWR), but is most definitely a smaller engine, and should be placed later in the tech tree due to the... well, technology needed to create it.\u00A0 The problem there is that stock would place the F1 at the end of the tech tree (being the biggest engine, and the tanks for it not being unlocked until then), leaving no room for advancement/upgrading to the Merlin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven using CTT and its extra \u0027more advanced\u0027 nodes wouldn\u0027t really solve the problem (and would probably just make it worse), as the player would still need to do most of Mun/Minmus (and unlock 3/4 of the tree) before they could unlock the tech that is -supposed- to take them there in the first place (e.g. Apollo-era stuff, specifically the tanks/engines).\u00A0 Nor would placing the Merlin into \u0027Gigantic Rocketry\u0027 make much sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose I need to decide if I\u0027m going to go for \u0027timeline\u0027 type progression, or stock \u0027bigger=better\u0027 type progression.\u00A0 A timeline-type progression would place stuff like the F1 squarely in the lower-half of the tech-tree, somewhere close to stock 2.5m unlocks (along with RL10, J-2, H-1...), with the RS-25 somewhere near the 1/2 to 2/3 mark, and the RS-68, F1B, and merlins at the end of the tree.\u00A0 Stock progression would see nearly the opposite positioning for most of the engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think it would be cool to have some \u0027upgraded\u0027 parts near the end of the tree, such as the Merlin engines and J-2X, so that your space program can become more-efficient as time goes on (rather than just using larger rockets); where these would be positioned in a node that the player has to work on a bit to unlock (1000\u002B science nodes).\u00A0 So they already have stuff that \u0027works\u0027, but can optionally work towards tangibly \u0027better\u0027 stuff if they want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I suppose another part of the problem that I\u0027m facing is my....assumption?... need?... want?... for players to have access to realistic-progression-technology for their operations; e.g. Apollo-era gear for exploring the Mun.\u00A0 I\u0027m just not sure how to reconcile that versus the stock tech-tree setup while maintaining compatibility with other mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoL...

You really don\u0027t need to rush this, because it is a big step towards a release. The thing with CTT and having your own mod is that you can choose where ever you want to put your parts at to be unlocked. It makes sense to think about your engines and think of the technology timeline to base it off of. There are other technology nodes to unlock that may be used, creatively, to unlock more parts/sizes. Even looking down the road towards interstellar space travel, you\u0027ll have to broaden your scope on what kind of technology you\u0027d want to work on to make this happen. Even having to consider logistics is a nightmare.
