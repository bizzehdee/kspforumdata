I\\\u0027m busy doing other things so i just hit the ASAS, max the throttle, and set it off. Maybe i push something else or click something else, i\\\u0027m honestly not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways stage one is burnt out and heading sideways, so i assume it\\\u0027s just a stability issue, jettison, and activate stage 2. I have pushed nothing but the spacebar at this point. I come back when stage 2 has burnt out a few minutes later and realize that the rocket has autopiloted itself into kerbian orbit.

I\\\u0027m positive that the ASAS is having the rocket lineup on orbit simply because i\\\u0027ve had retro fuel left and it\\\u0027s centered itself on 290. Does anyone know how the ASAS works and what it uses to determine the correct flightpath? Or is it just that the rocket is unstable enough that it gets horizontal momentum along that axis?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypocee","CreatedById":8609,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-02T14:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ASAS locks in a vector in privileged inertial gamespace and attempts to keep your nose on it.
