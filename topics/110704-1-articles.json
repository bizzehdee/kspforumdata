The Mk3 parts currently have questionably high drag. This can be circumvented with the use of Stock Bugfix Modules (the thread is stickied down in add-on releases).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext question. Which mods do you have or are willing to use?

I might use a few, but I play on a laptop that is prone to overheating. The components are simple. Mobile science lab (with accessories[solar panels, legs etc.]) the orange fuel tank, a hitchhiker can with drill and large storage tank. nothing will be too large. Sorry I don\u0027t have pictures, I haven\u0027t built any of the components. I\u0027ve only made an attempt at building the carryall. I used a mk. 2(the sleek 2 seater) cockpit for my design. wish I had screenshots for you guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
