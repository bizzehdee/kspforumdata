Taking most of the science out of contracts is a step in the right direction, but it\u0027s not enough by itself.

In sandbox it\u0027s far too easy to build a giant mega-launcher that can go anywhere, whereas with career you have a greater element of realism.\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve never bothered with is any of the strategies. Early in the career, you don\u0027t have enough of either science, funds or reputation to trade one off against another. Later, you have plenty to go around and none of them are really worth bothering with.

Yet still, I made it a habit to start every new version in career mode, just to see what it\u0027s like. This one seems a lot more balanced, IMO. I didn\u0027t analyse too deeply, but they seem to have cranked up the funds so that you don\u0027t have to grind as much for the building upgrades. Tier2 just happened -- by the time I needed the building upgrades, I could afford them.\n\nAs to hollow contracts: everything I don\u0027t have a mind doing is a chore, it\u0027s as simple as that. But it\u0027s truly surprising how much tourism adds to career... I\u0027m not sure, it may be just because it\u0027s another high-paying contract at a stage where previously you had no choice but launching one satellite after the other. This gives you at least some variety where previously there was none at all.\n\nOverall, I still think that career mode is mostly suitable as a prolonged tutorial. Which ain\u0027t bad: it provides the right kinds of challenge in the right order.\n\nI think career could gain a lot if you were not only provided with tasks you can take or not, but could somehow affect what kind of contracts you are given.
