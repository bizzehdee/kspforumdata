Holds 2 crew now and has an external camera view that makes targeting with the gun somewhat nicer due to having a good viewing angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Incendiary bomb fires on the terrain now cause heat... which will make any nearby vessels/parts catch fire and burn/explode... Very cool yet the game seems to have an issue with burning and exploding kerbals so I\u0027ll likely make kerbals flame resistant for now as it crashes the game if a kerbal dies of over-heating for some reason. The heat buildup is influenced by the range from the fire of course. Right now all fires produce the same heat, though I could change this later to be more dynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) all HE bomb explosions now have better explosion collateral damage, not only is there force effects but parts of vessels can be hit by the explosion debris as well, which can cause damage to nearby vessels even if not directly hit by the HE bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther issues squashed were related to the damage system saving code... it\u0027s been a thorn in my side for a while. This is the only part of Skillful that you will need to be conscious of, all vessels in the scene need to have IFF tags or it risk is vessels won\u0027t save their damage states.

ANNND, cut him some slack, he\u0027s working so hard on any of his free time. He has other things, not just day in, day out making the mod. And if you looked at his previous post he said he was just testing for any bugs and writing a user manul. You try making a mod, it\u0027s pretty hard.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T02:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep off-topic banter out of other threads.
