Yes, I know to use \u0022[\u0022 to switch to the stranded Kerbal; I had other issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The first was *seeing* the stranded Kerbal. I put on his helmet light, but even when he was 300m away, I couldn\u0027t see him from the ship. People say to get the claw, but I couldn\u0027t see the Kerbal to claw him!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. More importantly, the stranded Kerbal had trouble seeing the ship! I had festooned the ship with copies of both the lamps available to me, but I still couldn\u0027t spot it, even 300m away. I did finally see it once, and I chased after it ineffectively. Should I wait to do these missions until I get red/green lights? Or until I get that claw thing, I suppose?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Most importantly, my empty capsule magically filled with Jeb when I reloaded! I designed a ship with a probe and an empty capsule, and I flew it empty (no crew) into orbit. I got to within 400m of my stranded Kerbil, switched to him...and floundered while trying to rendez-vous with my ship. I\u0027m not adept with the EVA controls, it\u0027s safe to say. After a long period of floundering, the ship pulled away, and, being low on fuel, I (cough) reloaded a quick save with Alt-F9. But when I reloaded, shazam, Jeb is now sitting in my cockpit! Groan! Even if I rescue the stranded Kerbel, someone\u0027s gonna have to get out and float. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug? Is there a way to design the rescue ship so that reloading won\u0027t repopulate it with Jeb? I haven\u0027t reported it as a bug officially yet, because I\u0027m unable to reproduce it in the VAB/launchpad now. I build a ship with empty capsule and probe; put on launch pad; quicksave; reload; and the capsule is still empty.

Here\u0027s some tips that I use that may help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Navball is your friend here, be sure you have your Kerbal targeted so he\u0027ll show up on the Navball as a target to steer towards (pro grade or retrograde). Once you\u0027re close, keep your speed slow just as you would a docking maneuver. Now you just need a point of reference to help align your view to your target. I like to use the sun because it\u0027s so easy to find. What I do is point the nose of my ship directly towards my target (the floating Kerbal) and rotate the navball to a level/horizontal plane so I can easily tell North \u0026amp; South and take my relationship of where my nose is pointing and where I am in relationship to the sun. If the sun is behind me and the angle is up and left, when I switch to the Kerbal using the \u0022[\u0022 key I know I should be looking towards the sun down and right (the opposite direction). The ship should be easier to see than the Kerbal, and simply use your RCS pack to fly the Kerbal to the ship. You may have to bounce back and forth a few times until you\u0027re close enough but this method worked for me without fail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T06:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the further replies! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@xcorp: I tried targeting the ship when I \u0022assumed command\u0022 of the Kerbil, but the Kerbil has no navball.

This is done by having the Navball in Target Mode and finding the retrograde marker. You might also want to limit your thrust (Depending on which engine you have) to a very low value so that you don\u0027t go shooting past your target. (Generally speaking if I need to make small corrections I turn the trust all the way down to it\u0027s lowest setting) By lowering your thrust you lower your TWR, which means you have finer control over how fast your velocity is changing. Once you have zero\u0027d your relative velocity point target prograde (The pink meatball) and make a small burn in that direction to bring you closer to your target. If the prograde marker is not aligned with the meatball you can burn off center to pull the prograde marker (this will increase your speed) or flip around and burn off center to push the retrograde marker onto the target retrograde indicator (the other pink thing, this will also slow you down) Once you are within about 50m (This is a very long distance, get closer if you are less experienced with RCS maneuvering without a Navball) you can take control of the Kerbal and finish off the rescue from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T16:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are struggling to see things at 300m, have you got your markers turned off.

The more in-line (direction, speed, inclination) you are the better you will be at getting your relative speed to zero. I honestly wouldn\u0027t worry about being at zero, you\u0027re never really going to be \u0022perfectly\u0022 matched until you\u0027re physically docked to something. As long as your relative speed is .3 or less there\u0027s plenty enough time to maneuver around before the distance becomes too great to interact. In space, close is a pretty garsh darn big area in comparison to what we think close is for ourselves. Basically the higher your relative speed the smaller your window of opportunity will be for an encounter and a higher risk for physical damage if contact is made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
