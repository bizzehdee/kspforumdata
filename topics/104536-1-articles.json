Up to this point all my creations have been of my own design, but for the most part I do like them to appear as if they could have existed in real life. Indeed some have ended up bearing a passing resemblance to actual craft, though generally this has been as a happy coincidence.\n\nFor this craft, I actually set out with the intention of making a proper replica, and then discovered that it\u0027s a lot more difficult than you think, so all Kudos to you guys that have built some amazing replicas that have appeared in the Exchange thread. \n\nThe craft here is my attempt at recreating the Me 163 Komet, or as close as my limited abilities will allow me to get. I am not entirely happy with the area around the cockpit, but can\u0027t think how I can improve it. The purists will also say that the tail end is not tapered enough, and of course the original didn\u0027t use retracting undercarriage. I did try using a drop away dolly, but it wasn\u0027t very elegant, and the skid on the bottom of the craft isn\u0027t very durable, which meant that all landings ended with a big explosion.\n\nIn the interests of giving the pilots a fighting chance of completing each flight in one piece, this craft features normal landing gear. To be fair, I did try to make it look like a dolly on the ground, and you can\u0027t see it in flight when retracted, so I am happy with this particular compromise.\n\nAs far as flying the 163 goes, it\u0027s pretty docile. Take off speed is around 100 m/s, flight duration is limited, as per the original. Keep the wings level when landing due to the narrow undercarriage, and be careful with use of the brakes on the ground to avoid nosing over.\n\nHope you enjoy it.\n\n![Me16301.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/Me16301.jpg)\n\n![Me16302.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/Me16302.jpg)\n\n![Me16303.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/Me16303.jpg)\n\n[Download craft file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/px64t39xb35su3f/ME%20163.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Bugs","CreatedById":123899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T22:03:39Z","Content":"Could use a little bit more wing area near the engine, but other than that, it looks really nice."},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T22:57:42Z","Content":"It\u0027s a really good looking replica, BTW welcome in the world of replicas!"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T00:46:38Z","Content":"Can\u0027t say I\u0027ve seen too many Komet replicas hereabouts.

Its not perfect, but considering that we still dont (and prolly never will as devs are against it) have procedural wings, not a bad replica.\n\nIve actually tried creating replicas way back, but all of them ended up excessively complicated, or just refused to fly. I tend to build for efficiency (part count is my major limitation), so my replicas are either limited to very simplistic, or just useless outside of taking screenies.\n\nNow most of my designs that are even influenced by movies/real life/games/whatnot, are just that, influenced, and i tend to take too many shortcuts to cut down part numbers."},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T20:59:16Z","Content":"I can emphasise with that. A few versions ago, I built a Harrier jump jet. Given the limitation of the parts we had then, as well as not having the translation and rotation tools that we have now, I thought it was half decent and actually flew quite well. Unfortunately when they introduced the new wing parts and control surfaces in .90, it was no longer compatible. I recently built another Harrier using .90 parts, but it was done without referencing any photos or drawings, so is more a representation of what I remember a Harrier looks like rather than a proper replica. The important thing with that particular craft is that it conveys the feeling of a Harrier and flies well, so I\u0027m happy with that."},{"CreatedByName":"Nik_601","CreatedById":104747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:27:38Z","Content":"Nicely done!![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) You reminded me of my old Komet replica..\n\n\u003E ![CgHEx55.png](http://i.imgur.com/CgHEx55.png)\n\u003E ![dVNaiwh.png](http://i.imgur.com/dVNaiwh.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![86yXMH8.png](http://i.imgur.com/86yXMH8.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T22:09:24Z","Content":"Lol, love that.
