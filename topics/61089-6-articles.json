It is the SAS that tries to balance the ship, TCA only actuates its commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) We\u0027re currently working on the next release which is a complete rewrite and will address these problems. The first beta release is published above so you can compare, but the development moves on and current dev-TCA already uses a very different engine-controller mechanism than even 1.5.0-beta.0. So the advice, unfortunately, is to wait for the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T09:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso I need.. what, bigger reaction wheels?
