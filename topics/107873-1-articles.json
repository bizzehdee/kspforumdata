Oxygen in the suits should be finite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxygen in capsules and cockpits not necessarily should be finite, but on the other hand, we have a resource system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do not use it to produce oxygen for green men?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not like sending a manned mission to the Duna using just a small capsule. It should be a punishment for having Kerbal staying a few months in a capsule with only 1 crew spot. The most sensible solution, ie one that does not kill Kerbal, would be such as to lose the experience he gained as well as lose/lower ability to gain experience and thus the amount of science points to be gained from a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mechanism should also work in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
