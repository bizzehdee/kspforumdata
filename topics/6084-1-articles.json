The big test. Well, at least the first one. I\\\u0027m likely going to take it again in May.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy PSAT last year was a 181, this year a 195, and my latest practice test was an estimated 1920. They did not give me the 1600 scale score. My weakest part is apparently math... I think I get a bit OCD over my answers and then end up checking and re-checking too much. I didn\\\u0027t finish the math on the Practice test nor the PSAT. Reading I did very well though, over 700 estimated, and the essay was pretty average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m hoping for above 2000. Preferably in the 2100\\\u0027s or even 2200\\\u0027s. On the 1600 scale, 1500 and above or bust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else taking them tomorrow (If you\\\u0027re not in the U.S., you do not have them at all)?

They have a program for it. Anyway, it was quite the tree destroyer, there were more pages than the TAKS test I had taken the previous year, and it is still bigger than the STAAR (the new test of Texas). You however, seem to have quite the SAT experience and I applaud your efforts. Good luck\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrobug","CreatedById":1542,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-28T04:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck to you sir!
