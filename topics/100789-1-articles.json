Somehow the CM used the Landers fuel ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Not sure what I did wrong there?\n\nDocking ports will, by default, pass fuel and other resources automatically (only while docked, obviously). Your lander\u0027s tanks were the farthest from your ship\u0027s engines, so the lander fuel got burned off first. Some methods for fixing this:\n\n1. If you fabricate your ship and lander in one piece and launch them together, you can turn off fuel consumption for particular tanks in the VAB, by right-clicking on the tank and then using the \u0022play/stop\u0022 buttons next to the fuel and oxidizer meters. You can also do this exactly the same way while in game when you want to re-enable fuel consumption on the lander after you undock.\n\n2. When your ship/lander are docked, you can right-click on one of the docking port halves where there will be an option to disable crossflow in either direction. If you don\u0027t see this, click on the other half of the dock- the game is inconsistent about which is the \u0022correct\u0022 half. Also, this setting probably won\u0027t be saved after you switch away from the ship- you\u0027ll need to manually re-disable crossflow whenever you switch back to the ship.\n\n3. Make a habit of checking your lander\u0027s consumables before undocking it, and filling up anything that may have emptied. I remember once having an empty RCS tank on a probe and realizing this two seconds after undocking it. It took me half an hour to use an EVA kerbal out to push it back to re-dock- then it hit me I could have just used RCS on the mother ship to catch the probe. Yeah that was pretty stupid.
