I wanted to see if anyone else was experiencing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy spaceplane is using medium landing gear that is clipped into the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything works just fine as long as you overlook the known issues with landing gear not wanting to go straight down the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can make orbit and dock to my station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I save and then reload, or do anything else that makes the craft re-load, it will freak out and different parts will move out of alignment. It doesn\u0027t explode or disassemble itself, but some parts move apart from each other and out of alignment.\u00A0They mostly move back if you start timewarp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried many things to find what was causing the problem. It looked to me like there was a clipped part that was getting angry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure enough, if you remove the landing gear and launch the craft (hack gravity), all of the issues go away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far it seems to be more reproducible in space than on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also seems to\u00A0not happen\u00A0if the landing gear is left extended and never retracted. This makes me wonder if it\u0027s the tires. I know in previous versions of KSP, the tires would collide when you retracted them if they were clipped into something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help me test this and nail down what is going on. There may be more issues with landing gear than just the steering and handling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T03:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually sounds\u00A0like a part clipping issue.

You can clip the gear deep into the craft or just leave it on the outside and it will still cause the effect when the craft reloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took out all of my mods to double check.
