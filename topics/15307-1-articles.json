Would appreciate help with this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I\\\u0027m fairly decent at designing and piloting my ships and have gotten to the point where I\\\u0027m fairly efficient at everything I do from a piloting standpoint, but I am still unsure as to which is the best way to descend from orbit to planets in regards to fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it better to do a slow, controlled descent from a higher altitude and not do a heavy burn until you\\\u0027re close to surface, or is it better to wait until you\\\u0027re closer to the surface and traveling at a higher rate, then do a shorter, harder burn and disregard the controlled descent from higher up? Some mix of the two? I\\\u0027m trying to put together some lander vehicles with decent amounts of fuel in reserve so I can do a bit of exploring on a scale larger than feasible with EVA (besides, still playing on .15.2 a bit until more of my mods are updated to fit right since there\\\u0027s not a -whole- lot to do with EVAs atm).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my second question, I first include a picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cFy8d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cFy8d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, there\\\u0027s really three parts at work here. The radial fuel tanks and their mounts are from the Kosmos pack. The mount is called the \u0027Powerpack\u0027 or something, and it is fuel crossfeed capable. The body is the TKS lander body also from the Kosmos pack and it is also capable of fuel feeding. Below those are the Thor landing tank and engine from the Novapunch pack; I like to do a mishmash with parts and see what I can come up with. Shuriken originally looked more like the object its named after, but I had to remove some fuel tanks so it would fit inside the fairing, but I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I was doing a bit of Munar north pole exploring and touched down nicely, having yet to dip into the radially attached tanks. I decided to relaunch and head towards this suspicious crater, when I suddenly ran out of fuel and came crashing to the Munar surface. I was not happy. Staging is correct, and all of the parts involved are supposed to be fuel crossfeed ready. Is there something I\\\u0027m missing with the setup here? I could easily rectify this with fuel lines, but I want to keep the landing craft as light as possible regardless of how insignificant fuel lines are. This is supposed to work with the parts involved. Is there something about the Thor main fuel tank I\\\u0027m missing? The one in question is for the ascent engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this design and want to make it work without adding fuel lines, as both the ship and lander are fuel efficient and the lander is quite agile. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T17:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel efficient descent would be starting with a very low periapsis and doing your landing burn before periapsis so that, as you come to a slow velocity, you should be no more than 1000m above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your second question, I think fuel lines are the only way to do it.

I guess there\\\u0027s a part of me that feels odd about coming to a halt from a single km up, it just feels wrong and that I should be a bit higher. I\\\u0027ll probably still do it from like 4k or so to give myself some time to adjust my landing site, but that makes sense and will still save me a ton more fuel since I used to descend from about 20k.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T23:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel-efficient way is one big burn.
