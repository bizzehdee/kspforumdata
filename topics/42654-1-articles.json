Mirrors aren\u0027t perfect, so if you hit one with enough energy it\u0027ll melt and start to absorb more of the laser. It gets worse, mirrors don\u0027t reflect all frequencies evenly, a silver-coated mirror is brilliant for most of the visual spectrum but just below that it drops to about 50% reflectivity. Metals which aren\u0027t as bad at low frequencies don\u0027t have as good performance overall. Throw in dirt and damage to the mirrors, which will happen in any operational environment, and mirrors can only make it slightly harder for a laser to destroy a ship.
