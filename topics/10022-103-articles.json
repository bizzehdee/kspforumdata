Though, you did mention a diversion? It isn\u0027t uncommon that people outside know that the Iron Wall cannot be fooled. Those missiles will destroy anyone within 1.5 gridmarks if the command is given. Can you give a bit more explanation?\n\n(A mass of land war-vehicles and soldiers approached the boundaries of the Iron Wall. Their defenses were insufficient to withstand a volley of our autonomous missiles, but somehow they made it to within 1.22 gridmarks before termination)\n\nCould they be getting smarter? Learning our defenses? If less than a day was needed to figure out how to elude the missiles, they could know a way past it completely by tomorrow... Then the barrier...\n\n(The barrier is impenetrable. All matter is decompiled into its\u0027 basic atomic structure, upon which those that can be used to fuel our energy supply are routed to the regulator. Those of which can not be used are rejected)\n\nWhat if an object didn\u0027t have mass? Like... negative matter? (It would be impossible to compile enough together in order to pass through) What about Project N? It was an area of research we had long ago. We were learning ways to manipulate space in order to capture negative matter. If someone picked up on that research, what would it do?\n\n(...The result would be the output of negative energy into our systems, causing it to meet with positive energy, and cancelling it out. Our shield would be brought down, and the Iron Wall would be all we have left)\n\nWe need to take steps to make sure that doesn\u0027t happen. Scan the surrounding region, 10 kilometers, for signs of negative matter. Report any signals of excessive amounts to me when I return.\n\nLet\u0027s just hope that they never figure it out..."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T10:49:21Z","Content":"I nuke everything with Tsar Bombas.
