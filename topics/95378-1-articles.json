You launch your model rocket, recover it, and use the science you get to unlock the \u0022start\u0022 node.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T16:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 04:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hobbes Novakoff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T15:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that the capabilities of the buildings in 0.90 have been tweaked to compensate for the absence of the \u0022barn\u0022 tier buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
