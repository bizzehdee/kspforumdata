The contract part for fly by should be fullfilled when entering Muns SOI. During testing, I\u0027ve changed two things when the contract was completed:\n\nWarping through SOI change with max 4xwarp\n\nThe craft was seperated into two crafts, one for flyby and one for orbit. I\u0027ve changed the root part of the craft to the command module of the tourists stage. Before, it was the command pod of the orbiting stage.\n\nSo one of these changes has been the cause for correct completion."},{"CreatedByName":"Lambuck","CreatedById":142514,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:36:21Z","Content":"To get the flyby enter the SOI but do not enter orbit.

As I recall, KSP only checks the flyby condition when you cross that boundary; if you switch away from the vessel for the crossing, then it never does the check and you never complete the contract.  Yes, this means you can orbit a body without first doing a flyby--at least, as far as KSP is concerned.  I do not believe it counts to put yourself in orbit, burn to escape, and get flyby credit that way; if you\u0027re already in the SOI and leaving, that should count as \u0027escaping\u0027, which is different from a flyby."}]}
