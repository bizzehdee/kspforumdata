Uses Airplane Plus parts, kerbal foundry and whiplash engines. Oh, and procedural wings.\n\nCan fly for ~4500 km at a cruising altitude of ~16km and 777 m/s. Carries  3 crew, 3\\*16 = 96 passengers. Built for Kerbinside Remastered long-distance passenger flights.  Take-off speed is ~85 m/s with a very heavy rotation to almost 30 degrees - absolutely needs leading edge flaps/droops to be at all be fliable near takeoff/landing. Must hold in place and spool up engines to 110 kN before disengaging brakes. Almost its entire trailing edge is elevons with 1 small flap to still provide some help. I tried more flap area but turned out I lacked pitch authority like that. Like, I gotta set them to delfection 1 to be able to control under 220 m/s  \n\nSpoiler\n\n![lfg9U5T.png](https://i.imgur.com/lfg9U5T.png)\n\n![THqLtnC.png](https://i.imgur.com/THqLtnC.png)![nC0pSRv.png](https://i.imgur.com/nC0pSRv.png)\n\n![vsRjAQO.png](https://i.imgur.com/vsRjAQO.png)\n\n![aTM3mj9.png](https://i.imgur.com/aTM3mj9.png)\n\nNeeds power almost until touchdown, she\u0027s a horrible glider under 200 m/s. Thankfully, touchdown speed is just under 100 m/s. Could probably go for higher if you optimized glide slope but under 110 m/s, control authority is too low for me to feel comfortable and given spool up time, you can\u0027t even abort at that speed.  Fortunately, she stops pretty fast once engines are cutoff and airbrakes are deployed.\n\nWing strength is 0.5. Uses 2 rudders like the real deal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-02T14:24:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2024 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 2\u0022\u003EJune 2\u003C/time\u003E by RunaDacino**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jebs Piloting Skills","CreatedById":231279,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-03T02:21:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/14/2015 at 7:39 AM, FourGreenFields said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Am I right to assume that \u0022mindblowing resolution screenshots\u0022 may kill my several years old laptop?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E While doing the screenshot for the BV 144 I had about 6 fps iIrc...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, old screenshot key was F12 (default), new one is numpad 5.
