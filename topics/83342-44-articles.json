I think it would be neat to be able to split up your VAB/SPH build queues. For example, you could have a separate queue for manned missions and one for your probes. That way you can prioritize missions without interference from the other queues. The upgrade points would work no different.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the plugin works currently, that might actually be detrimental to the player. They\u0027d spend extra points on rates that might not get used as frequently, in which case they could just buy more rates and fiddle with the ordering of their builds a bit more. The current method ensures that every rate can be used, and that the fastest rates are always used first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, where that could work well is if you can purchase additional \u003Cem\u003Ebuildings\u003C/em\u003E (which I plan on doing with LaunchPads at some point). So imagine you can buy a second VAB with funds\u002Bscience that you can allocate your upgrade points to \u003Cem\u003Ein parallel\u003C/em\u003E with the main VAB. So if you\u0027ve got 10 upgrade points in your main VAB, you could put 10 into your secondary VAB (or maybe some reduced number depending on balance). So a similar idea, but it won\u0027t hurt the player as much as splitting up upgrades more than you already can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, RSS already has a similar feature as each KSC operates independently, meaning you can have one entirely devoted to building manned rockets, one for mass producing probes, and another for only building planes. I need to convert that code over to the new KSCSwitcher that Regex has made, so when RSS for 1.0 comes out KCT won\u0027t work with it right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stevehead","CreatedById":137745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs the plugin works currently, that might actually be detrimental to the player.

(This post contains no bug reports or feature requests; you can skip the rest of this post if rave reviews bore you!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I just had my first manned Mun landing -- in the second year of my space program. I\u0027m making myself play with no reverts, since KCT\u0027s ingenious \u0022simulation\u0022 function lets me test-drive every rocket and plane I make, for a cost. KCT\u0027s time delay, coupled with a \u0022lite\u0022 life-support mod (Rover\u0027s USI life support), induced me to build a rescue vehicle and a refueler before building the Munar lander. I was (gasp) planning ahead, kinda like one might do in an actual space program, since if something went wrong, I wanted to have rescue vehicles ready to go. After the refueler was launched, I rehearsed every critical aspect of the Munar landing: liftoff, staging, Munar landing, Munar liftoff, re-entry, parachutes. When the actual event came, I was actually a bit nervous, as I\u0027ve resolved not to revert, but things went off without a hitch -- immensely satisfying! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also enjoy the trickle-science aspect of this mod. I hadn\u0027t really digested this aspect of KCT when I started playing, but the option to earn science by building rockets and aircraft really appeals to me. This might reflect the technological and engineering advances that occur when smart people design and build complicated things. As a gameplay matter, it means I can focus more on big missions, less on grinding out tiny bits of science, even on \u0022moderate\u0022 or \u0022hard\u0022 difficulty levels. Even if a big rocket fails -- and several have failed -- I still get something out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther users have stressed the immersive feel of the mod, and I can only echo that. I\u0027m using Final Frontier, and it shows 6 decorated Kerbals, but they\u0027ve gained those medals slowly, over time, not all in the space of a week or so.
