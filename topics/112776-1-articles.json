So when returning from a high aopsis (mun, minmas or any other planet) as soon as you get into Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence fast forward to the nearest multiple of 6 hours before your projected landing time (6, 12, 18, 24 etc). Check out where you will be landing on kerbin at that time (ie let\u0027s say 30 hours before you actually get to Kerbin). \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EYour landing point shown will be your actual landing point geographically as Kerbin will exactly rotate 5 times before you land (6x5 = 30).

This will then show which part of the planet you will be arriving at, not allowing for atmospheric drag. Usually you need to aim a bit to the east of your intended landing spot to allow for drag slowing you down, but the exact amount will depend to an extent on your speed on arrival, and the angle that you come in through the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA : Ninja\u0027d\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OldLost","CreatedById":143451,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought maybe he was talking about warping as well, but then his later statement doesn\u0027t make any sense, in that if you warp until you\u0027re close then you\u0027re no longer \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eso far away dv costs are minimal\u0022.
