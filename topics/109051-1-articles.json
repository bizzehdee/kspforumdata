I am also a writer, I\u0027ve written two books in my native language which are awaiting grammar checks. Translated to English their titles would be: \u0027About the people of Et-Estir\u0027 and \u0027War on the horizon.\u0027 They belong in the history-fantasy genre (not Game of Thrones clones, mind you) and talk about the beginning of civilization, the bronze and iron age coupled with some magic here and there. I\u0027m currently in the process of writing a book in English called \u0027Just another love story\u0027 which tells my life story more or less. I\u0027m also super interested in physics and chemistry and am planning to become a physicist or chemist.
