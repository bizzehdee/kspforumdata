The limiter for most of the intakes is the machCurve in ModuleResourceIntake. Jet engines themselves are density and speed limited, to avoid the older problem of \u0027intake spam.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that isn\u0027t working, try ModuleResourceHarvester in atmospheric mode instead, which seems to work at higher altitudes and the lowest densities. You\u0027d need to make a resource definition though, as I don\u0027t believe you can make \u0027intake air\u0027 as a resource when it already exists as a special case for oxygen worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at the harvester examples in Explodium Breathing Engines for inspiration. Haven\u0027t tried hacking a resource definition at Kerbin in a while, but I cheated a craft to Eve and found the harvesters working on the very edge of Eve\u0027s atmosphere. The amounts were microscopic, but if this is for modelling that ion engine the ESA was proposing, microscopic amounts would be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-27T21:31:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2018 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Fecyk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espeed limited, not altitude limited.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
