Use 32bit. Are you using KSP Windows x64? If so, expect problems. KSP Windows x64 is a work in progress that has been shown to be unstable for the majority of modded installs and crashes easily. This is not due to problems in the mods themselves but in the Unity player and KSP assemblies. In particular, if you have a large number of plugins or parts (i.e. high memory usage for textures and on the stack) KSP Win x64 is incredibly unstable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile i hadn\u0027t read that, i haven\u0027t had any major issues, (although admittedly i haven\u0027t tested it much) it just seems a tad confusing to me that support is very limited.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T18:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock career itself doesn\u0027t work in KSP Windows x64.

NathanKell here and a lot of others seem to have a hard-to-quantify phobia of KSP Win64. I\u0027ve troubleshooted enough mod related crashes to know when a mod is interacting with the stock game, when a mod is interacting with another mod, and when the stock game is just saying \u0022too much!\u0022, as have a lot of people here. I have yet to troubleshoot a crash that I could in fact trace purely to KSP Win64, therefore I personally believe the phobia of it so many people have is wholly unjustified. A lot of the people in the support forum need to accept the reality that a crash or other issue on Win64 can in fact not be caused by an instability in the 64 bit game client and thus is very possible to troubleshoot and rectify.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/rant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Simon, I run 64 bit with 5.5GB of mods on the install without issue, and that was with 0.25.

Except it turned out to be an unstable mess, and then users decided that the reason for the unstable mess was mods, rather than the game itself. This, of course, meant that issues we could actually fix were buried underneath crash reports and complaints about win64 being busted completely, that somehow modders were supposed to fix. Maybe they thought we could inject code into the engine below what even Squad changes. I dunno. But in any case, it made providing support for everyone more difficult, especially users who didn\u0027t use win64, since their issues simply got buried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, we don\u0027t have it out for 64-bit KSP.
