The only two ways its doom becomes more definitive at this stage is if Private Division Shuts down, or if they announce explicitly and in no uncertain terms that \u0022Kerbal Space Program 2 is cancelled\u0022. The next step back from that line is \u0022Entire team is gone nobody says anything\u0022, which is where we are, but it offers the slim chance that there is an unspoken transition plan, that they don\u0027t want to speak about for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally consider that unspoken part the damning part at this point, as the most common reason a company wouldn\u0027t say more is that they don\u0027t want to commit to a promise they may not want to keep.
