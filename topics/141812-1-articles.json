It thinks I am still in the sky. The recovery button won\u0027t appear and when I try to leave for the space center I get a message saying can\u0027t leave while craft is over kerbin and it relods me to my last save. It seems to be locked in flying mode. Anyone seen this before or know what causes this? I can reload but I land and it does the same thing again. It worked 30 min ago to recover but that was over land and this is in water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-14T22:50:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2016 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by superkurbol2014\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
