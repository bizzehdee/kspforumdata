Is this detlaV require to circularize after capture? \n\nFor example:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/V4FHldK.png](http://i.imgur.com/V4FHldK.png)\n\nThere is a node labelled \u0022Kerbin Escape/Capture\u0022 which I would assume is the point where you leave Kerbin SOI, and therefore would then be in an orbit around the sun(Kerbol). There is also a node labelled Kerbin-Kerbol Transfer.
