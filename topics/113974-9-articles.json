Then she slowly tilted it back the other. One eye... bulge was raised, the corner of her lip just below it matched. Somewhere, distantly, some part of her mind told her she should probably be offended, but... it was all just too \u003Cem\u003Eweird\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0It was so absurd that surely it must be satirizing \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Ething, but she wasn\u0027t getting the joke. She tried switching the raised part of her face. Nope, still didn\u0027t make sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery room here in the Kerbonaut center had its own entertainment box. Bit of a wordy name for it, that. They had them back in the Union too, of course, but not nearly in such numbers! Quite literally \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0room in the building had one. And so many channels! Why, there must be a dozen of them, maybe a dozen and a half! Some things weren\u0027t all that different, but others were extremely, well, \u003Cem\u003Eforeign\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe news programs were straightforward enough, if unusually frank. Although the weatherkerb who stood there so happily describing the incessant heat and humidity in the forecast was certainly in need of a sound beating. The \u0022game-shows\u0022 were endlessly entertaining, apparently they would just \u003Cem\u003Egive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you all sorts of very nice things if you were willing to embarrass yourself on a national broadcast. Valentina still didn\u0027t quite grasp this concept of this \u0022vacation\u0022 they mentioned so much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that had been a long block of very strange, very serious people saying very serious things. Something about an hourglass and a hospital. Which was good, she supposed, as there seemed to be a lot of brain tumors involved as well. It was all quite confusing and just a bit melodramatic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then she had found the Gytepi channel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was some sort of satellite feed, apparently. She knew the Union had launched a number of communications satellites for the Gytepis, but... they certainly had some truly bizarre taste in programming. Their \u0022game-shows\u0022 went far beyond the Foreigners\u0027, Valentina hadn\u0027t come close to discerning was was \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0going on or even what the point was, but had laughed herself silly all the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now, this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tilted her head again. She really \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be offended, she thought, even appalled, but... it was just so \u003Cem\u003Estrange\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0This was either the work of a truly depraved mind or social commentary so brilliant it was far beyond her understanding. So she just shrugged, kept watching, and popped another morsel into her mouth with the funny little sticks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral Chang\u0027s chicken. \u0022Gytepi day\u0022 in the cafeteria downstairs, someone had said. The food was delicious, even if the presentation was quite odd. It was served in little white containers with cute metal handles, and had to be eaten somewhere \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than the cafeteria, so she had brought it back here to her room. There were half a dozen empty containers scattered about her small table. The attendant had given her a strange look when she had bought them, perhaps she had taken too few? There were many different dishes prepared, was it courtesy to sample them all? What she had finished was amazingly good, but this one was by far her favorite, such a delightful mix of sweet and sour and crunchy and firm. Not really what she would have expected a general to eat, though, and the bits had a tendency to cling on to the side of the container.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe little wooden sticks circled the inside of the container a few times, and Valentina looked down and frowned. Empty. Just one of those skinny red peppers left. She knew better than to touch those, the Gytepis probably used them as rocket fuel. She sighed, set the container down, then burst out laughing. Her hand slapped to her mouth, eyes wide and searching.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was nothing funny. What was on the entertainment box \u003Cem\u003Ecertainly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was not funny and what was in the take out box, or rather the lack thereof, was just plain sad. That bizarre sensation again, like she was feeling someone\u003Cem\u003E else\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0emotions. Valentina sighed again, and rubbed her face. It \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be the strange drink at the bar. She should go ask about it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore her, on the entertainment box, the... program was ending with a jarringly upbeat pop song. It was immediately followed by an advert for this \u0022Wutani Kokuni\u0022 corporation. The spokes...thing was an anthropomorphic kitten. Valentina couldn\u0027t understand a single word, of course, but it was such a strange mascot for a large electronics firm. Deciding that was enough weirdness for one day, she reached over and clicked off the box... and paused. The emblem on the unit was the same as the one in the advert. Frowning, she wondered how many other electronic gizmos around here featured that same emblem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sighed and pushed the thought away, turning to the window. The sun was just dipping below the horizon in a flourish of orange and red. Day became night very quickly here, but the sunsets were always magnificent, the sun seemed to sink right into the ocean driving a thousand brilliant hues as it went. It was a pleasant end to a, well, rather unremarkable day. Valentina had spent most of the morning giving interviews to the incredible variety of news agencies in the area, and met the mayor of Kerbin City to the south, who of course had invited her to come for an official visit, meet more official people, \u003Cem\u003Eet cetera, et cetera\u003C/em\u003E. Then came a very stuffy lunch with the KSA Board of Directors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPfft.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first she\u0027d thought it was the KSA\u0027s own little Imperium, minus the pointy beards. Instead, they would have fit right in with the typical ineffectual mid-level apparatchiks back home. Gene had done an impressive job trying to keep conversation flowing, but Valentina suspected he was the only other one in the room who had the slightest idea which end of a rocket was supposed to point towards space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, well, nothing. She had been on her own the entire afternoon, and spent it watching the confounding pictures on the entertainment box. Which wasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E, of course, but... somehow she had suspected more... structure to an official visit. She had the growing feeling this trip was every bit as improvised as it felt, and that led to the even more unnerving feeling that someone had arranged it get rid of her. Valentina shuddered, and recoiled from the thought. Too many implications down that road. Best to avoid it, and deal with what she could see. Everyone back home would be all right... right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain she pulled away from the thought. Her task here was to gather information about a new KSA spacecraft. That was seeming an odd thing too, they certainly didn\u0027t appear very secretive around here. She looked out the window toward the launchpad, where Burdous\u0027s rocket stood bathed in floodlights in the waning twilight, and shrouded in scaffolding. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0certainly couldn\u0027t lift a ship of any size to orbit, and this \u0022Rockomax\u0022 seemed unable to deliver a replacement. But surely development of the ship its self was proceeding... might it be as simple as just, well, \u003Cem\u003Easking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0someone? Wouldn\u0027t Imperium intelligence--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain Valentina burst out laughing for no sensible reason. Someone, somewhere was having a grand old time, which irritated her to no end, being in on neither the punchline nor the joke. She stood up with a grunt, enough of this nonsense! She was going to march right down to that strange bar and find out what they put in her drink!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe place was considerably more... muted, this evening. Valentina stared, slack-jawed, around the room. Not a single glass looked out of place. Tables, chairs, all of it... looked perfectly normal. There were perhaps twenty people scattered widely about the main floor, a Kerbal on the stage was butchering a vaguely familiar song, but no one was bothering to throw anything at him. Then she spotted a lone figure seated at the bar, and thoughts of drink additives quickly evaporated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mister Edmund?\u0022 She said curiously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, wasn\u0027t expecting to see you back here so soon,\u0022 he replied with a smile that looked a bit forced.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You... are all alone, tonight,\u0022 not a question.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, yes... when I drink alone I prefer to be by myself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh! Apologies, please. I will not disturb you further.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund laughed bitterly, and gestured to the barstool with the drink in his hand, not quite looking her way, \u0022relax, it\u0027s just a song. Get your tush in the seat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina managed to do so without embarrassing herself too much, stupid tall barstools.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Your rattail,\u0022 she pointed, \u0022is not lit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh? Oh,\u0022 Edmund looked at the whitish stick in his fingers, then bit the end off, \u0022 it\u0027s candy. Can\u0027t smoke in here, either. How\u0027s that for a bar? Can\u0027t drink, can\u0027t smoke, but scheduled gratuitous violence is encouraged.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis brow pinched, while he continued to stare at the wall of bottles, \u0022they call cigarettes \u0027rattails\u0027 in Ussari?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, are actual rat tails,\u0022 she smiled innocuously, \u0022is thriving cottage industry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund opened his mouth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund closed his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shrugged, \u0022ok... not the strangest thing I\u0027ve heard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOl\u0027 Sam meandered by about this time, \u0022and what\u0027ll it be for ye, mum?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was that line from the entertainment box again? \u0022Um... I have what he having.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yar, comin\u0027 roit up.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short glass, a single bottle flipped in the air, then \u003Cem\u003Eplink, plink.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And leave the bottle,\u0022 Edmund said.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOl\u0027 Sam frowned, \u0022suit yerself, but that\u0027s no way to be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina was still staring at her drink. She reached into the glass and plucked a rock out, studied it for a moment, then dropped it back in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside her, Edmund chuckled, \u0022don\u0027t ask.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had turned a bit and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh!\u0022 Valentina cried, \u0022your chin!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s nothing,\u0022 Edmund tried to cover the little bits of paper closing the skin, \u0022he got one good one in and--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am so sorry!\u0022 She pleaded, \u0022I did not mean to cause problem, I--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now don\u0027t you even start with that!\u0022 Snapped Edmund, \u0022Dean had it coming. For once he actually reaped as he sowed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina blinked at the odd phase, then turned to her drink, and grimaced at the deep, smoky taste of the dark liquid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is as they say,\u0022 she sighed, \u0022he is big shower head.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shower head?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think she means d-\u003Cem\u003Eouch, me shin!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Another rock plopped into Valentina\u0027s glass as Ol\u0027 Sam dropped to a knee, \u0022blimey, that smarts! Best go get a bandaid meself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, like that,\u0022 Edmund said, topping off his drink from the bottle. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two sat in silence for a time, taking turns staring at their own drinks, or at the rows of multicolored bottles on the wall behind the bar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length, Valentina spoke, \u0022drinking alone in empty bar, and so early, in my country, this is thing of mourning. Is not so, here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mourning,\u0022 Edmund grunted, \u0022s\u0027pose that\u0027s one way to put it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe frowned, \u0022has someone died?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, my career.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How... do you mean?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got the mission assignment today,\u0022\u00A0he said wistfully,\u00A0\u0022Command Pilot for DUOS 1,\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... do not understand. This is not thing for celebration?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund turned a bit, and waved the arm in its sling at her, \u0022that shows you how confident they are it\u0027ll ever fly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is this DUOS 1?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A spacecraft without a booster.

Was \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the new spacecraft the Kommissar had mentioned? Edmund hadn\u0027t hesitated to mention it, there didn\u0027t seem to be any real secrecy about it at all. It felt more like... shame. But... the Imperium had ways of finding things out, surely more reliable than sending a nosy Kerbonaut. What were they playing at? Unless--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund simply began speaking, staring into his glass as if seeking insight there, \u0022it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0my fault, after all. I felt it when the solids let go, knew something was wrong even before the chamber pressure on number two dropped out. Half the board lit up red. But I hesitated. I knew that stack better than any bird I\u0027ve ever flown, I \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it couldn\u0027t tolerate an engine out. I saw the needle moving off the vector, heard mission control screaming in my ear. But I hesitated. I kept thinking, maybe it\u0027ll straighten out, maybe it\u0027s not over.

Torque came on so strong it slammed my arm into the couch rest. Snapped the bones like toothpicks, did something to my shoulder I can\u0027t even pronounce. When I came to, I was on the deck of an Ussari trawler, getting mouth-to-mouth from some burly bearded fisherkerb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared up at the wall again, or rather, somewhere far beyond it, \u0022I should have stayed on that damn boat.

Oh, never call him that, he \u003Cem\u003Ehates\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that,\u0022 Edmund said, \u0022we get along well enough, but it\u0027s... complicated.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis eyes rose to the picture case above the bar, \u0022it was supposed to be me, y\u0027know. Way back when, when Kleptogart and Omork first starting discussing a joint space program, after J--\u0022 he winced hard and lowered his face, waving vaguely at the photographs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just... after. I was number one on the flight roster, then the Gednalnans started making a stink. Didn\u0027t want our rockets landing their heads. Airheads today, warheads tomorrow, that\u0027s what they said. Everyone knew it was malarkey, but the politicians did what they do. And Chadvey was the keystone. Close enough to their king to have his ear, far enough to be expendable.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund topped off his drink again, \u0022so that was the arrangement. Gednalna would allow overflights, build a tracking radar on Zaroeka... and Chadvey Kerman becomes the first Kerbal in space...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...officially,\u0022 he sighed deeply.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And he\u0027s coming back tomorrow. Always has been a bit of a flake, but he\u0027d never miss a comrade\u0027s launch,\u0022 he downed the rest of his drink, then sat idly stirring the rocks with a finger, \u0022I just wish... things could have been different. That I could have been... remembered.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund pursed his lips, and stared down into the worn, scarred wood of the bar, \u0022but if wishes were RatSquirrelFishes then beggars would gag. My old grandpabbie said that. Still doesn\u0027t make sense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, and in case no one\u0027s told you, never sleep by the lake,\u0022 he waved in her direction, then went back to studying the bar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilence stretched on again, thick and pleading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina did not look at him, just kept staring down into her own drink, \u0022staging was nominal, at first. Then I saw needle move off vector, for second time. Radio, is just static, gee force, too much. I know, is wrong. I know, is much past flight rules. But...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe glanced his way for an instant, \u0022I hesitate. I think, maybe will smooth out. I think, maybe, I still can have honor like Sergei, maybe, I be more than shamed peasant girl. When I reach for knob, is too late. Gee force, is too much. I nearly break arm. I wake at bottom of ocean, and I think, now I shall be like Edmund Kerman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned to him fully now, \u0022then I think, yes, I \u003Cem\u003Eshall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be like Edmund Kerman, who was not broken by sea or sky, who rose from water to-- how you say?-- get horse on back,\u0022 then taking another sip of her drink, added, \u0022but is no burly fisherkerb for me, only stern look from great sea-beast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Would have preferred burly fisherkerb,\u0022 she shrugged, drawing a hint of a chuckle from Edmund.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But... now I have met Edmund Kerman,\u0022 she took a sip, and looked up at the photographs, \u0022Edmund Kerman, who raced alone into hurricane because he would not risk own crew, and returned with shipwrecked sailors. Edmund Kerman, who flew time after time to burning drilling rig to rescue stranded workers, until aircraft run out of fuel and crash, but they all safe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina set her glass down, and deliberately pushed it aside, \u0022Edmund Kerman, who stand up to little shower head in bar and get punched in chin, for Kerbelle he hardly know, because he is Kerb of honor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think,\u0022 she looked at him again, \u0022is good to be like Edmund Kerman. Edmund Kerman \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is hero. Edmund Kerman... will not be forgotten.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, well,\u0022 Edmund said, flushing a bit as he still stared into his glass, \u0022wouldn\u0027t do to have \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0beat him to a little green pulp. International incident, and all...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wise friend once said to me, \u0027do not loose heart,\u0022 Valentina smiled broadly at him, \u0022is only beginning.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund finally looked at her, and smiled back. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, a muted buzzing filled the air. Edmund scowled, and dug around in his pocket, finally producing a small black shape. He looked at it, silenced the buzzing, and frowned again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gene\u0027s paging me,\u0022 he said, sighing as he rose, \u0022sounds important, I\u0027d better go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe clapped Valentina hard on the back as he passed, the hint of a smirk on his face, \u0022and call me Ed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe watched him disappear up into the light, then turned back to her half finished drink. Wouldn\u0027t do to waste it, after all. Still didn\u0027t understand the rocks, either. Perhaps--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You,\u0022 said a trembling voice beside her. She turned, and looked into the face of a madman. One of his eyes was purple, nearly swollen shut, a missing tooth peeked out from his sneer, and there were two little round burn marks in the center of his forehead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS\u003C/em\u003E, even like \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0he was still gorgeous!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I spent an entire night in jail, because of \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 D.N. croaked, advancing, \u0022I\u0027ve been suspended from flight status for a \u003Cem\u003Eweek\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0because of \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina carefully slipped off her barstool. D.N. spoke in a thin, wavering voice, his eyes wide and bloodshot, pupils dilated. Valentina knew a face like that. There was no reasoning here, no talking her way out. Only force. She set her stance and tensed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD.N.\u0027s face began to tremor, he raised his hands as he stepped toward her, \u0022I\u0027m going to k--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA telephone receiver appeared in front of his face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Phone call fer ye, Dean,\u0022 Ol\u0027 Sam said, looking very confused, \u0022some feller calls himself, uh, Igor?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s jaw dropped like it was full of rocks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD.N. blinked, shrugged, then put the receiver to his ear.

A rare westerly breeze was blowing down from the distant mountains, and a sleek training jet was slowly taxiing to the eastern end of the runway for take off. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone shouted, \u0022there he is!\u0022 and for a moment the mass of people threatened to crush Valentina right into the rail. She pushed back, made some judicious use of her elbows and the convenient height of her feet, then looked and saw a dust cloud to the north beyond the runway fence. It meandered back and forth down the old, sand-washed road that followed along the edge of the beach dunes, its source remaining hidden behind the towering hills of sand. As it drew nearer and nearer, the sound of screaming turbines began to fill the air over the babbling of the crowd. Suddenly it burst forth from behind the last dune, tearing along the north access road to the Center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ERED\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was the reddest \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Ered \u003C/span\u003EValentina had ever seen!

She had no idea what any of that meant. The eye-watering vision screeched to a halt around the corner onto the frontage road beyond the fence, paralleling the runway, pulling even with the jet as it turned onto the center line. For a moment all was calm, then that calm was shattered by a discordant symphony of spooling turbines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tail of fire burst from the aircraft and the kar\u0027s rear wheels disappeared in a roiling cloud of grey smoke. It was noise and smoke and fire to rival a rocket launch, and then the two vehicles took off like rockets, tearing down their respective strips of concrete with incredible force. They jockeyed for position, first one gaining ground, then the other, neither able to gain an advantage as they roared along the pavement. The rail in shook, the building shook, the \u003Cem\u003Eair\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0shook! Finally the jet rotated, its wheels leaving the ground a moment later, pulling past and then away.

On the concrete apron, the crowd spread out some, depositing her there rather roughly as they pointed and gaped at the incoming banshee. Valentina fought back to her feet, once more deploying her elbows, which also happened to be at a convenient height now, and made her way to the front of the press, but could only peek past a pair of onlookers. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shimmering \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Ered \u003C/span\u003Eand chrome vision charged toward the crowd, then at the last possible second, fishtailed into a sweeping sideways drift, spinning through 270 degrees just in front of the gathered Kerbals, the rear-hinged door swinging open and the driver simply stepping out as the vehicle continued its pirouette, stopping at the exact moment he leaned casually against the hood.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, the crowd stared in stunned silence, as the breeze tousled his bushy red hair.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hullo, lads!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022CHADVEY!\u0022 the throng called out in unison.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What was it this time, Chadvey?

She stood for a time like this, shook herself, sighed. She picked up the \u0022CAUTION: WET FLOOR\u0022 sign, set it in the middle of the hallway, and trotted off in the other direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pause to glance at the simple map, then turned down a different corridor. It \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like a maze down here, and nearly deserted, too. Creepy. A primitive part of her mind kept expecting to find an eldritch abomination or some other nightmare down every crossing hall, the uneasiness driving her rapidly onward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWait, why am I anxious in the first place?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she thought, \u003Cem\u003EI have no reason to--\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOOF!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blow nearly knocked her off her feet, the curse out before she knew it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417, \u0414\u042F\u042D \u0423\u0424\u0426 \u042ALI\u0419D?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I\u0027m not blind and my mother is a very fine lady, thank you very much!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina blinked, \u0022oh!

Anyways, it\u0027s down this hall, then left-right-left, then your third left. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re a bit too late though, the room was already overflowing last I saw.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer face fell, \u0022why is such important place buried in ground anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn cue, the hallway shuddered and a gentle cascade of dust descended from the ceiling tiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous looked up at them, \u0022that\u0027s the main reason. Anything this close to Fermi Kerman\u0027s lab needs to be well shielded... or just underground. Nothing spoils a good lecture quicker than transsonic shrapnel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He just... blow things up all day?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027d be surprised how much you can learn by blowing things up all day. As long as someone\u0027s still around to write it down. That\u0027s the difference between science and just mucking about, writing it down. Besides, he\u0027s on the verge of a real breakthrough, and--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hall rumbled especially loudly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, poor choice of words...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina put a hand to her face, \u0022you people are so strange.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s quite the adjustment, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, is feeling like, how you say? Like fourth wheel. Like not expected.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous let out a long breath, leaned back against the wall, and shoved his hands in his pockets, \u0022well, to tell you the truth, you weren\u0027t. The Board only gave Gene a couple of days notice, and with an important launch coming up, too. He really had to scramble to put anything together.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 she said flatly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s just the way things have been around here,\u0022 he said, studying the floor, \u0022you\u0027ve probably seen it too. One day the Ussaris are our friends, the next they\u0027re our bitter rivals, the day after that they\u0027re our friends again. It\u0027s all politics. I don\u0027t care much for politics, do you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I \u003Cem\u003Ehate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0politics!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe nodded, \u0022well, this place runs on it. Representatives from three different nations, four, now that Nefcarkaland had signed on, each trying to steer the Board their way. Competing contractors and subcontractors, a dozen major universities who all want \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0payload shoehorned into the next mission, a few dozen minor ones just clamoring for attention. It\u0027s a mess. Gene\u0027s doing his best but it\u0027s a bit like herding cats.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is... very strange way to run space program. You wander, like vagabond, no course. Very excited, but... no one seems...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To notice? Or care?\u0022 Jerdous raised an eyebrow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina shrugged, \u0022in my country, we do not ask question, but still leaders always have answer...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous opened his mouth as their eyes met, then paused. He stepped forward, looking intently at her. Then closer still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 She blinked. His eyes... it looked like there were little--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Specks,\u0022 he said, \u0022those little iridescent specs in the whites of your eyes...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stepped back, \u0022yes, I know of this, have always had. Doctor said is harmless, just superficial abnormality.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Scleric flourochromia. Quite rare, don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever actually seen it before. And yes, mostly harmless, now a days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What you mean?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn odd little grin crossed his face, \u0022well for example, if the the ancient Vulgar tribe had seen that in your eyes, they would have put a silver crown on your head, a golden scepter in your right hand, and named you \u003Cem\u003Eten\u0027bish\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s lips moved silently for a moment, \u0022...driver of shade?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sounds a lot like Ussari, doesn\u0027t it?\u0022 Now Jerdous grinned broadly, \u0022the Vulgars were early contemporaries of the \u016As\u0027, their language is the most direct ancestor of modern Ussari. Although the usual translation for the word is \u0027Shadowscourge.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah yes, you are this... anthropologist,\u0022 she smirked back at him, \u0022and these Vulgars, they would have made me queen for this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of a sort. You would have been showered with all the riches and furs of the tribe and granted the favors of only the \u003Cem\u003Estrongest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0warriors...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina grinned broadly herself, and blushed just a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...and then on the third full M\u00FCn they would have sacrificed you to the dark god \u003Cem\u003EBa\u0027alzacropth\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0by pulling your spleen out through your throat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grin disappeared, and her jaw fell open.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous smirked again, \u0022that\u0027s the main reason their language is still around, but they\u0027re not. According to an ancient scroll, they gave this treatment to the daughter of a powerful \u016As\u0027 chieftain, and as you can imagine he wasn\u0027t terribly happy about it. Supposedly the only survivors of the ensuing battle were marched to the banks of the Never River and had their--\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand clamped across his mouth, \u0022is... Quite enough. Indeed, you do study dead people.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I find the dead so much more agreeable than the living,\u0022 he replied, carefully removing her hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina snickered a bit at this, \u0022but... how you end up being space-kerb, mister anthropologist?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Politics, remember? My brother\u0027s doing, mostly. He may have the personality of sandpaper, but he\u0027s really, truly a genius. The Royal Astronomical Society recruited him when he was still \u003Cem\u003Eofficially\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in secondary school, just after receiving his first doctorate. I think he dragged me along more out of spite than anything else, but he \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0open doors. He got me a research fellowship with a very well respected Gednalnan professor-- no, not \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one-- and my time in the Gerin desert, it was...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA shadow seemed to flicker across is face, perhaps from the lights above, \u0022...it was truly changing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe odd uneasiness had crept back between Valentina\u0027s shoulders at some point. It was becoming \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0annoying. Jerdous was a bit odd himself, but...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You and your brother... it seems, is much there to tell,\u0022 she\u0027d already missed the lecture, why not? \u0022But, what was in desert?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I had an epiphany, of sorts,\u0022 Jerdous nearly squealed with glee, \u0022it\u0027s been the cornerstone of all my work ever since. Well, except for all this space stuff, but even some of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina raised an eye... bulge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It led me to this theory, my own little theory of everything, that all the cultures that have ever existed on the planet are all connected, that there\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Ereason\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for it, maybe even an explanation behind our weird local cosmology.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Weird local cosmology?\u0022 Valentina said slowly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re a Kerbonaut, you\u0027re certainly aware that Kerbin and everything else in our solar system is far \u003Cem\u003Edenser\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than it should be, none of it should work, and now that we\u0027re getting accurate measurements of the mass of stars beyond our own that \u003Cem\u003Earen\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0so dense, it--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slow, rhythmic buzzing emanated from somewhere. Jerdous uttered a curse and began fishing around in his pocket, coming up with another of the tiny black boxes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ugh, that\u0027s Gene. Looks like another fire to put out,\u0022 he glanced at Valentina, \u0022figuratively speaking, of course. Well, probably.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027re a tough one. You can handle some obnoxious foreign politics for the good of all Kerbalkind, right?\u0022 Jerdous smiled, and clapped her on the shoulder. He said something else, too, but she didn\u0027t hear a word of it. Dibella\u0027s M\u00FCnstone had frozen its self to her skin like steel in darkest winter. By the time her senses returned, he had trotted off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stood for a few moments, simply breathing, pawing at her chest. Something was... was... was what? She shook her head, trying to clear the fog that had suddenly taken it. Somewhere, she had to \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0somewhere. She spun around, sure she would see... the hall was empty. A light in the distance flickered. One step back, then another. No... No, something is... something is...!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer feet burst into motion of their own mind, and in an instant, she was running, \u003Cem\u003Efleeing\u003C/em\u003E, the knot between her shoulders now abject terror. Doors, closed doors, flew past on either side. She tried to look back but saw only shadows and flickers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERun!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer conscious mind devolved, nothing but base instinct remained as she flew around a corner and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBLAM!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow, Ed, you went \u003Cem\u003EBLAM!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina found herself on the floor, head spinning, eyes struggling to focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry!

Eventually, they focused on a hand held out in front of her face. They followed the attached arm, and looked up into the most earnest face she had ever seen. It was smiling broadly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi, I\u0027m Billy-Bobrim, Billy-Bobrim Kerman, that\u0027s me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother Kerbal was still busily \u0022sorry\u0022-ing on the floor and trying, with only moderate success, to gather the papers that were now scattered across it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill feeling dazed, Valentina took the hand, \u0022yes, hello, excuse--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt pulled her easily and smartly to her feet, pulling a yelp free as it did, \u0022I know you, you\u0027re Val-en-tin-a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E-man-o-va, famous Kerbonaut.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe floor Kerbal\u0027s head shot up so quickly that his neck crackled like dry wood. His face disappeared behind wide, staring eyes. A long, inhaled gasp rasped in his throat. The earnest-faced one\u0027s eyes jumped back and forth between the other two Kerbals for a moment, the he gave the one on the floor a light kick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Eeeeed, inner-duce yourself!\u0022 He said from the side of his mouth, gesturing with his eyes, \u0022where are your manners?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... I....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina held out a tentative hand, tried to put on a polite smile. The floor Kerbal awkwardly un-floored himself and took her hand with his own trembling, extremely clammy one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I-I-I-I-I-I\u0027m...

Somehow, his eyes grew wider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edgas here is your really biggest fan, Mizz \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E-man-o-va,\u0022 the earnest-faced one then spread his hands wide, \u0022he\u0027s got this biiiiiig poster of you on the ceiling of our room!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other one squeaked deep in his throat, and incredibly the hand clamped down even harder. Valentina thought she saw a tooth crack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, he reached over with his other hand and peeled the first one off of hers, speaking in a lilting, creaky tone, moving only his lips, \u0022weeeeeeeee MUstbeGOingNOW.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe earnest one blinked at him, \u0022but Ed, you said if you actually ever met her you were gonna mrrrf grrf prrf-?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand had been clapped over his mouth, and this \u0022Gas-man\u0022 was now half-leading, half-dragging the other one away down the hall, despite muffled protests. The two disappeared down another corridor for a moment, then the earnest-faced one reappeared, hand still over his mouth, just long enough to wave \u0022mrrrf grrrrf!\u0022 before vanishing again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina could only blink, and stare. Or stare, and blink. And wait for feeling to return to her hand. It was tingling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length, she recovered, a bit unsure of what exactly had just happened. Such strange people here. They both wore cadet\u0027s jumpsuits, but... perhaps the young fellow was simple? Yes! Yes, that was it! The young Kerb was simple, and the earnest-faced one was his keeper, that \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be it. Perhaps this really wasn\u0027t such a bad place, then, they gave poor Yuri a job, after all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s foot nudged something on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked down at the scattered papers, and picked up a heavy book. It took her a moment to translate the long words in the title.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAdvanced Orbital Mechanics and n-Body Physics\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, odd reading for a simpleton. Might he then be one of those, what was the word? Savants? Well, far be it from her to deprive a savant of his reading material, so Valentina dutifully gathered up all the papers and folders and set off after him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, after much searching, she found the hallway to the auditorium. She stood to the side, out of the path of the throng of people walking out, scanning faces for the strange young Kerbal. Occasionally someone\u0027s eyes would meet hers. There would be recognition, a smile, perhaps a nod, but her presence seemed to be becoming less and less remarkable here. That was fortunate, at least for the moment. At length the crowd passed, but without the face she was looking for.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe glanced around the corner toward the auditorium, and saw him. Talking to Sir Kerman, of all people! Chadvey. Such an odd name. Anyway, what did the young fellow say his name was again? Gas-man? She looked at the binder in her hands. Ah yes, Edgas. She frowned. So many odd names here. But where was his keeper? With a shrug, she approached the two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excellent question, lad, Ah only wish you\u0027d\u0027ve asked it during the panel,\u0022 he was saying to the younger Kerbal as Valentina neared, \u0022the thing about n-body physics is that-- well hullo, Major! We\u0027ve just wrapped up here, Ahm afraid, if you\u0027ve come for the lecture.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mister Chadvey, is pleasure to see you again, I am sorry to have missed it,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just Chadvey, please,\u0022 he grinned broadly, \u0022but indeed, Ah was just saying to young Edgas here-- ach, where are m\u0027 manners?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned to the other Kerbal, whose face seemed to have mostly disappeared again behind two massive, bulging, white eyeballs, \u0022Edgas, thus is the famous Major Valentina Kermanova of the Ussari Space Agency. Major, thus is Edgas Kerman--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, we\u0027ve met...\u0022 she said flatly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022--soon to be a risin\u0027 star in the Kerbal Space Administration Kerbonaut Corps.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s eye... bulge pinched, \u0022you are... Kerbonaut?\u0022 She said to Edgas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgainst all probability, this Edgas\u0027s eyeballs grew wider, his speck-like pupils darting back and forth like a cornered animal, \u0022huh? What? Who? Me? Go into space? Um, no... I...I...I...I...I\u0027m just a cadet here at the Research Center, I-I-I-I-I could never do that!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, nonsense, lad, the Corps needs sharp, young minds like yours. It won\u0027t be all daring test pilots much longer. We\u0027ll need someone in the other two seats doin\u0027 the real science.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, \u003Cem\u003Ethree\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seats? Not two? Was \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0finally the new KSA spacecraft? She\u0027s need to talk to Chadvey more about it. Now, how to get rid of the odd one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, Edgas, was it?\u0022 She held the book and folder up to him, \u0022you drop this back in hall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one called Edgas reached out tremblingly to take the items, and his stubby fingers brushed hers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hurk,\u0022 said Edgas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina Kermanova had spent countless hours training to handle unpleasant situations. In the dark, upside down, under water, and through thick gloves, she could locate all the switches and levers of her craft by memory. She could withstand 18 gees in the centrifuge without blacking out. Surviving in the harsh Kerberian taiga with nothing but lip balm and a plastic coat hanger was second nature. She had even been to space now, and more than once.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut nothing, nothing could have prepared her for the torrent that suddenly erupted from Edgas\u0027s mouth. It spewed forth with all the fumes and rage of a rocket engine plume, deflected off the book, sprayed splattered and filled the hallway with billowing, foamy clouds like a rocket \u003Cem\u003Elaunch\u003C/em\u003E. Conscious thought had run, screaming, for the nearest bunker, and for all her training, she could do nothing but hold fast against the onslaught.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the flow ebbed, slowed, and then ceased, leaving the hall quiet. The three Kerbals just stared, wide eyed, at nothing. For some time the pungent silence was broken only by the soft \u003Cem\u003Eplip... plip... plip...\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of liquid on linoleum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh dear,\u0022 Chadvey finally said, his shaggy, red hair matted into a dark mass against his neck, \u0022oh dear, dear, dear, dear, dear...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one called Edgas\u0027s face was a frozen rictus of horror, that Valentina was sure mirrored her own. His pupils had disappeared to singularities. The book and folder slowly slipped from her still-outstretched hand and made a horrid thick splashing noise as they hit the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse us, please, Major,\u0022 Chadvey said softly, gently gripping Edgas\u0027s shoulders with a squish, \u0022come lad, let\u0027s get you to the infirmary.\u0022 He guided the younger Kerbal away, slowly, hand still outstretched.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stood there for a long time, unblinking, gaping, her own hand dripping before her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u00A0She swore aloud. She looked around and took stock. Incredibly, the book seemed to have shielded her from most of the noxious assault.
