The Oscar-B is 45.03% Fuel / 54.97% Oxidizer, and the Round-8 is 45.05%/54.95%, so they\u0027re still comparable if you\u0027re talking about just a single tank; its when you start stacking them up that a problem arises. The rest of them are 45%/55% on the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s of more use is the full mass of fuel tanks versus their dry mass - again, except for the Oscar-B and Round-8, the full-to-dry ratio for fuel tanks in KSP is 9:1 (for the Oscar-B it\u0027s 5.245:1; for the Round-8 it\u0027s 5.44:1). Since it\u0027s only the mass of the fuel you\u0027re carrying that changes when you\u0027re burning a rocket, that 9:1 ratio gives you a handy substitution you can put into the rocket equation - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-V = ln(M/Mo)*Isp*Go = ln(9Mo\u002BX/Mo\u002BX)*Isp*Go, where X is the mass of everything in your rocket that isn\u0027t a gas tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, that works only if you leave out Round-8s and Oscar-Bs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is that useful? Well, if you\u0027ve got a target delta-V in mind and you know the Isp of the engine you\u0027re going to use (say 800 for a nuke in space), you can solve that equation for Mo, multiply the result by 9 to get the full mass (i.e. the amount of gas you\u0027re going to need for the amount of delta-V you want), and then divide that by 0.5625 (the full mass of an FL-T100 tank) to figure out what configuration of tanks you\u0027re going to want (an FL-T200 is the same as 2 FL-T100s, an FL-T400 is the same as 4 FL-T100s, an FL-T800/X200-8 is the same as 8 FL-T100s, an X200-16 is the same as 16 FL-T100s, an X200-32 is the same as 32 FL-T100s, and a Jumbo-64 (the big orange tank) is the same as 64 FL-T100s - a bit of a pattern there).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-14T21:53:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2014 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T22:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answer not sure how you got the 9x=11000\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T23:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECaptain Sierra was answering the example question in your original post directly - You have 1000 units of Liquid Fuel and wanted to know how much Oxidizer you wanted.
