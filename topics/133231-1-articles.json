Every play session at some point I mis-click and wreck my crafts. Having to undo the mistake with ctrl-z is fine with small part counts, but once crafts start getting more complex this is asking for a crash to desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple \u0022lock/unlock\u0022 option in the right click menu to disable a part from being picked up. And somewhere down in the toolbar maybe\u00A0a lock/unlock all. Imagine being able to lock all parts and then just enable the decouplers or isolate any part group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T01:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick-thru ...

I still experience it with a mod (Holodeck. I should probably report that...) but not on the stock menus. It could also be that it\u0027s been fixed in 1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough there are more ways to accidentally click the wrong part than clickthrough. I don\u0027t recall them saying you\u0027d be able to lock parts.
