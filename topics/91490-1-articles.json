But then again there is many, many posts here, some buried for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn about the Suggestion. I was just thinking the other day (yeah it happens) and came up with the Idea that you only really need 3 parts for fuel tanks. I\u0027ll step you through what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you want a Huge Xenon tank to fit your Grand Tour Mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou click on the \u0022Fuel Tanks\u0022 tab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You get 3 choices: a Sphere, a Cylinder, and a Square. So you pick the shape, say the sphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Then you pick a preset of sizes (to keep it simple, either 0.625, 1.25, 2, 3 or 5 meters) So we pick 5 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Then you pick the texture (completely optional step, but you could have 2-3 textures)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Then the Color (without having a RGB indicator like lights, you could have the basic KSP colors for tanks, \u002B green), so we pick green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Then you have a maximum fuel indicator (again keeping it simple, not including density) and you pick what the tank holds (in here we said Xenon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have your 5 meter green sphere, containing god knows how much Xenon (sorry, no maths). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do the same for every shape that you want, for any resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022tweakable\u0022 option means you only need the largest part that is re-scaled (larger texture tends to shrink well, where a small texture will look bad if enlarged) to meet your size requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously it would require serious work on the editor to feature this (I think), but everyone could have tanks the size/color/utility that they need, whithout every player suggesting on the forums that they need more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP is still 32 bits for the foreseeable future, this also has the added benefit of less memory usage (I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think about it ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dreamixpl","CreatedById":32905,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomeone was a lot faster than You, he even put that suggestion into his own modyfication\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I was suggesting for stock game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing against the modding community, but I always think long term with stock in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure HarvesteR is against procedural parts in the stock game, they take away from the lego like quality of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T19:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMyself I am against procedural parts, I wouldn\u0027t mind the complexity, but I like the \u0022lego\u0022 feeling as well as how easy it make to identify design in screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, If we start having more and more fuel tank I\u0027m hoping the new GIZMO tools will be able to cope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit :\u003C/strong\u003E A scoundrel also \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/blogs/15379\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuggested this\u003C/a\u003E.
