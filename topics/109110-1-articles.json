Mods can be loads of fun just be careful how much you install, the more you have the slower the game is (Most likely) and prone to crash. Can\u0027t wait to see your spacecrafts in the spacecraft exchange. \n\nHappy Flying."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:09:56Z","Content":"Hello iDisOrder, and welcome to the forums! There are many, many great mods out there. I\u0027ve only tried a few myself.\n\nThere are many silly questions asked on the forums. Most of them, as well as most of the serious ones, have been answered it the [Gameplay Questions and Tutorials](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials) section of the forums where you\u0027ll find an enormous wealth of valuable information. Also, be sure to check out [the Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page), if you haven\u0027t already. Some of the info may still be slightly out-of-date, but it will be updated as quickly as the volunteers can manage and it is an essential resource for important reference information.\n\nHappy landings!"}]}
