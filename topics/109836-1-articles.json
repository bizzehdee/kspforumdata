After a quick read of the wiki, I\u0027ve found out that with it\u0027s gravity and atmosphere, Eve seem to be hardest to escape than Kerbal....not good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m coming here for advice to plan a mission and to Eve and back since most Eve guide doesn\u0027t take into account the latest changes (1.0.2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my skill tree :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w76/Eloking/2015-05-18_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-05-18_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that tech tree and your probable game skill/experience level, I wouldn\u0027t bother trying to bring anyone back from the surface of Eve just yet. You probably don\u0027t NEED to drop anyone off there anyway, unless you accepted EVA report/Sample/plant flag/crew report missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you did not accept missions that require a Kerbal to go down to the surface of Eve, you\u0027re probably better off launching a large \u0022mother ship\u0022 with a bunch of cheap, detachable probes. Put your mothership into a polar orbit, and then launch a probe down when you line up with a temperature/pressure/seismic reading/whatever node. I\u0027ve done this before, it works pretty well, and it is cost effective- you only need a small amount of fuel on each probe, and some simple instruments. It can be sometimes be difficult hitting the targets though from orbit though, you\u0027ll need to save and try again until you get it. Alternatively, you might be able to create a probe with WINGS and thus have it fly/glide to its measuring target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you absolutely have to land Kerbals on the surface, simply leave them down there until you acquire the tech and know-how to bring them back up. I\u0027m assuming you haven\u0027t unlocked the aerospike engine yet; if you have, there might be hope. However, they nerfed the crap out of engines with 1.0.0, and it might be incredibly hard now to to bring Kerbals up from sea level (it used to be reasonably doable). You\u0027ll probably need to give your Kerbals a rover and drive them up to a high altitude launch site where you\u0027ll have an ascent vehicle waiting for them. Remember, you wouldn\u0027t even need to send the rover now, send them a rover when you send them the ascent vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and if you only have like one contract that requires you to send actual Kerbals down, you can cancel it... cancelling a contract isn\u0027t that bad, usually at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T19:59:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, don\u0027t plan on an Eve return unless you want your whole game to become all about that single thing.

It\u0027s a simple burn from Kerbin, given that it\u0027s SoI is so big, and you can aerobrake on arrival to save fuel for your return. The burn to depart Eve is significantly more expensive than the burn to leave Kerbin, so plan accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t even consider sending Kerbals to the surface. Even with the new aero, successful ascent is still very hard, at any tech level. But you could send down a probe, assuming you have the tech, to transmit data back. Don\u0027t forget a heat shield. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still the chance for a flag-planting ceremony though. Landing on Gilly is very simple, it has so little gravity that you can do it with RCS. Getting to Gilly from Eve orbit isn\u0027t straightforward, as it is on quite an inclined and eccentric orbit, but you\u0027ll manage it with a little thought. A good option is using a small ship to go to Gilly and land, rather than taking your whole interplanetary ship from Eve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission, without a Kerbal landing on Eve, will still yield a ton of science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T21:33:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Oafman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
