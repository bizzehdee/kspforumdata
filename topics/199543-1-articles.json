Do \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E activate chutes, as they would deploy too early and then get destroied\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the atmosphere will be enough to slow you to less than 200 m/s. when your speed starts to stabilize, only then get rid of the upper heat shields and deploy the chutes (i moved those commands in the same stage)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- set the parabrakes to deploy at 5000 m of altitude, to have plenty of time to slow. actually i set 4 of them to deploy at 5000 and the rest to deploy in sequence a bit later, to make deceleration less brutal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- set the main parachutes to deploy at 3000 m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- after speed stabilizes to around 20 m/s, only then can i get rid of the lower thermal shields. and dropping them from this high means they disperse far from the landing site. But that\u0027s not required (see later)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- at this point, i\u0027m falling at 20 m/s. when I am close to the ground (less than 100 meters), i activate the engines to slow down to a safe landing. this only takes a tiny bit of deltaV. the vehicle reaches orbit with over 500 m/s left, there\u0027s plenty spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhowever, i later found out i did not need to actually drop the lower heat shields. Instead, falling at 20 m/s, I could simply let myself fall, the shields would hit first and explode, but they would slow me down and protect the rest of the ship. and the mammoths have excellent impact resistance anyway. So, the last 20 m/s i actually lithobrake, and it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a couple mistakes in that lander, though. First, i attached the chutes to the main body; i should have put them on a separate staging with the shields, so i could jettison them before reentry too. Second, my last stage, the one actually reaching orbit, is overengineered. that\u0027s because i use it to land on laythe too, but it would have been better to make another ship entirely; as it is, it is too draggy and too heavy. i could get away with a smaller rocket if i had used a smaller thing with a terrier engine. So, I have stability issues going up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost important, though, I made a classic model with lateral boosters, and that turned out to be a problem; upon first stage separation, the wind pushed at least one of the boosters against the main body, destroying the ship. If I had to make it again, i would have a first stage detach entirely from the bottom, to avoid the problem. as it was, i learned to shut down the first stage engine, decelerate to 100 m/s, and only then detach the boosters. and wait until they separate and go their own way before turning on the engine again. this, of course, is inefficient, but luckily i packed extra deltaV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe first stage goes up straight, at a speed of 250 m/s (above that, it\u0027s flipping time and horrible death). the second stage accelerates to 7-800 m/s (it could go faster, but drag heating would then destroy the last stage. I really hate eve) and to 50-60 km of altitude. It also starts turning after crossing 15 km altitude. the last stage is now in a barely suborbital trajectory, but it has 3500 m/s of vacuum deltaV, enough to circularize with some spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it was a grueling ordeal, and i exploded dozens of times before finding the correct sequence of actions to avoid all the horrible deaths. so, don\u0027t worry if it happens to you too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-15T00:09:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2021 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TanDeeJay","CreatedById":188578,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-16T06:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223909085\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199543\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610669174\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/15/2021 at 10:06 AM, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it was a grueling ordeal, and i exploded dozens of times before finding the correct sequence of actions to avoid all the horrible deaths. so, don\u0027t worry if it happens to you too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah! already had lots of explody test failures \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0 My ship that invites kraken to a kerbin launch has some special order of action required for entry...\u00A0 \u00A0As it was the landing component of an eve mission I was testing, I was starting by setting orbit to 110k Eve orbit... (getting to eve would have been the next level of designing after proving I could take off...)\u00A0 so once in orbit, I would first decouple from the \u0027return to kerbin\u0027 stage, use a small amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to move the \u0027return to kerbin\u0027 stage out from amongst all the struts, girders and heat shields, then rotate the lander to retrograde, and fire the poodle to lower the PE to 72500m.\u00A0 this would burn a bit over half the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E in the deorbit stage.\u00A0 then decouple the poodle stage, and activate the parachute stage.\u00A0 next, deploy the heat shields with action group 1.\u00A0 \u00A0then wait....\u00A0 (safe to warp until altitude is 95k, then you have enough time for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to re-orient to retrograde), then wait... everything starts to heat up....\u00A0 altitude will continue to drop as the heatshields get hotter... around 35k,\u00A0 one of the mamoths starts to display a heat bar, but that only displays for a few seconds, as by this time, speed is starting to drop significantly, continue to wait until the drogue chutes deploy.\u00A0 at this point activate action group2 to decouple the top heat shields.\u00A0 (Do not wait until horizontal movement has been eliminated, as the heatshields will come crashing back through the ship with destructive force when the chutes open and slow the ship right down... discovered this one the hard way... for some reason, after decoupling the upper heat shields when horizontal velocity is eliminated, the heat shields continue to fall in a very stable formation, so that when the main ship slows right down, they return with avengeance...)\u00A0 Now it is just a waiting game... the main chutes will deploy at about 5000m.\u00A0 Continue to wait... the drogue chutes will then fully deploy at 2500m, and then the main chutes at 1000m at which time speed will drop to around 6.5m/s now it is safe to activate action group 3 which will decouple the lower heatshields, and the structural members holding them in place, and they will fall straight down.\u00A0 you can watch them fall and they should all explode to non-existance when they hit the ground... if they don\u0027t they might get in the way of landing... but so far in all my tests, they have been successfully destroyed.\u00A0 then don\u0027t forget to activate the landing gear, and the landing lights if you are landing on the dark side of Eve.\u00A0 Rotate the ship so that the north/south axis on the navball is horizontal so that when you take off, you only need to worry about 1 axis...\u00A0 as long as the ground isn\u0027t too steep, you should be good...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have yet to achieve a successful take off test from eve with this ship, however with all the excellent advice received in
