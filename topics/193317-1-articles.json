I\u0027ll encounter jool and then adjust my manouver until I encounter one of the moons. The problem is my speed is like 5000ms and I end up having to use about 3000 delta V to slow down and orbit. How can i encounter another planet or moon without coming in so quickly? I feel like i\u0027m doing something wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-22T15:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204167-cameron-brown/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204167\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204167-cameron-brown/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cameron Brown\u003C/a\u003E and welcome to the KSP Forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince this is a question about how to play the game, your thread has been moved to the Gameplay Questions section of the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially, what you want to do is use a \u0027gravity assist\u0027 from one of Jool\u0027s heavier moon\u0027s (usually Tylo) which changes the direction of your motion in Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 If done properly a craft can enter Jool orbit without any braking burn at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to have you aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-22T16:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also adjust your path to go by Laythe or towards Jool itself, and aerobrake in the upper atmosphere if your craft can handle it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-22T16:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you\u0027re meeting the moon head on or at an angle.

You will need to shed all that speed in the form of aerobraking or an engine burn. A gravity assist with Jool\u0027s moons is easier but more difficult to plan, with several moon orbits being made before you get close to Jool. I have never really tried gravity assists with Jool\u0027s moons but they are probably super useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you would probably need to aim for a gravity assist, with a trajectory that can be corrected with a burn to then go to Jool\u0027s atmosphere and aerobrake until your trajectory isn\u0027t a straight line but curves around like a proper orbit, or aerobrake until you have a capture entirely. And then finally prograde at apoapsis to take your perapsis out of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-29T23:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key is getting your orbit to match as closely as possible to your target before your encounter. If you\u0027re coming in directly from a Jool escape trajectory, then naturally your orbit won\u0027t look anything like your target\u0027s. Instead, try to use gravity assists to capture into a Jool orbit, and then use more assists to adjust your orbit so that it closely matches the moon you want to get to\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, it\u0027s OK if your AP or PE is some ways\u00A0off, but you want the other side to be just barely touching your target\u0027s orbit and have the encounter happen there (so it looks like a Hohmann transfer). Having a big inclination difference is also bad. Finally, get your encounter as close to your target as possible, which will also cut down on the delta-V you need to capture (maximizing Oberth effect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that it IS possible to efficiently capture directly into a moon\u0027s orbit, but you\u0027ll need to follow the advice above (no inclination difference, having the orbit around Jool just\u00A0touching your target\u0027s, and getting the encounter there).
