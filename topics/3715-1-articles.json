In my research into one of my other passions (battleships and battleship gunnery), I\\\u0027ve seen the official US Navy range tables for the main guns of the Iowa-class battleships, and at their maximum range of roughly 40,000 yards range, Coriolis effect can alter the range by up to 162 yards (depending on target bearing and latitude), and see lateral deflection of up to 227 yards. Range alteration is maximized by low latitude and a target close to due east/west in bearing; deflection is maximized by high latitude and north/south bearing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuzzle velocity on them was 2700 feet per second (823 m/s), so you can see that there would be significant effects on your flight, even with Kerbin\\\u0027s slower linear speed of rotation at the surface.
