The new crew management system changed the format for saving crews (to something much better), and the new format isn\u0027t compatible with the old version. Instead of risking breaking things even more by writing some sort of upgrade logic, we decided it was better to just break compatiblity and start fresh.\u003Cp\u003EThis also gives us a nice opportunity to do other tweaks that we can\u0027t usually do, exactly because they tend to break saves. Because we\u0027re going to break it anyway, we can push in a lot of other little tweaks that wouldn\u0027t have gone in otherwise, so hopefully they will make it worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always manually edit your save so it matches the new format, but that can cause other issues, so we really don\u0027t recommend it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned for a dev blog soon about new things that we got to add because we decided to break compatiblity. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E We can be sure, now.

I don\u0027t know whether or not to work, or just stop playing KSP until the new version is out. I do believe that the devs should know, as the new version is in its quality assurance phase, and the testers probably would find out and tell the devs if they didn\u0027t already know. If you are a dev, and you are reading this, please tell me. Will the new version break saves, or will we be able to continue our previously created saves?
