If I were making an aircraft for a human I\u0027d probably not end up designing the KF-Spike 5 the way I did. Tetryds managed to set his aircraft up for B\u0026Z\u0027ing tactics which was cool. I decided to exploit the v8 BDAI\u0027s tendency to be terrible at going defensive by simply giving the Spike a bunch of instantaneous rate. With a dash of \u003E1TWR when slow and decent low speed maneuverability to make up for the fact that I basically intend for the AI to bleed all its energy on purpose to get good rate and small radius.\n\nI\u0027m still speculating on what sort of design will do best with the new AI.

Planes evade, but blindly and with no concern for the energy they\u0027re losing or where the opponent they\u0027re evading is going. I\u0027ve seen planes with much more energy extending away from a slower plane suddenly go insane and bleed off all their speed because that slower plane got a single shot off and triggered evasion... and then the was-slower-but-not-anymore plane caught up and destroyed the target plane. I\u0027ve seen other planes panic themselves into the ground after a near head-on at low altitude, and I\u0027ve seen planes that should have simply continued the turn in the direction they were going \u0022evade\u0022 back into their pursuers guns.\n\nWhoever gets guns near enough to fire first nearly automatically wins the engagement, because the other one will be too busy panicking rather than actually trying to delay dying, let alone attempting to gain a reversal. The only time this doesn\u0027t happen is when the chasing fighter bleeds off so much energy that it falls below the minimum altitude set in the AI and it stops pressing the attack to climb out of that and the reprieve lets the other fighter switch things up.\n\nOlder BD AI with current better-than-real-life prop engines seems like it could be tweaked to do BnZ, but current AI with real-life prop engines are stuck turnfighting, lawnmowering and making things easier for their opponent.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-16T03:15:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2015 03:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4**\n  \nwhoops, more clarity"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T21:59:13Z","Content":"I have just released the weapons pack that will be used on the next version of this challenge!\n\nHave fun playing with it, the points system to determine the amount of each weapon you can use is still to be set.\n\nI heavily recommend testing each weapon to see which one fits your aircraft design style the best.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134745](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134745)"},{"CreatedByName":"Littlerift","CreatedById":144390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T23:44:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have just released the weapons pack that will be used on the next version of this challenge!\n\u003E Have fun playing with it, the points system to determine the amount of each weapon you can use is still to be set.\n\u003E \n\u003E I heavily recommend testing each weapon to see which one fits your aircraft design style the best.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134745](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134745)\n\nThis is awesome - I need to lock myself away for a little bit and test. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:34:11Z","Content":"Great weapons pack.

At the moment the challenge heavily favours aircraft that are built to turn fast and have the minimum altitude set to 150, because if you have a fighter that is designed to BnZ or fight at higher altitudes then you can be sure that your plane will be shot down while climbing by any well designed competitor following the former design philosophy. It would also mean that things like climb rate actually matter, whereas at the moment you can get away with things like high wing-loading because the trade-off of wing area for weight means you\u0027re penalised in an instant-action, ultra low altitude dogfight. It would also help the turboprop a little bit, as while my current design uses a turboprop some testing has shown that switching out for the radial engine, which is lighter, has faster acceleration and is more powerful, almost ensures a victory in under a minute against the standard model. Hell, my radial engine variant can engage and win against 3 of the turboprop variants simultaneously, simply due to the fact that it will be in the air and turned around before the other planes have even built up any speed or altitude.\n\nOn another note, however, I\u0027ve loving the weapons pack - the models are fantastic: stock-alike but still with a very specific character and very high quality, and they mostly seem balanced against one another (although the cannons could perhaps use a weigh increase: one cannon weighs less than two mgs and ensures a much faster kill)."},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T04:10:45Z","Content":"While I agree that 600m min should be the limit low, an aircraft built to get to 150m faster will also reach 600m faster, even more if the other airplane does not accelerate as much while climbing.\n\nWhat I am thinking about doing is spawning both very far away from each other, but I am still thinking of how would I do that.\n\nBy the way, the next semifinal match was just ran!\n\nBut first I need to see with erasmusguy if he would be fine with it being made public, it was not one of the most fun matches, you know.\n\n**But there we have our finalists!**\n\n**Maelstorm vs KF-Spike 5**\n\nBoth airplanes were designed to be light and powerful, with 20mm cannons and a lot of turn rate.\n\nThe battle will happen soon.\n\nWho are you betting on?\n\nRemembering that the winner\u0027s craft will be made public after the final.\n\nAbout the losers branch, I am thinking about quick best of three 1x1 battles, no upload, just to show who wins."},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T10:44:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m 95% certain the VZ-38 will take the losers bracket pretty easily, it\u0027s a really good plane and I\u0027m sad it got knocked down in the first round.\n\nAnd whoo, finals, I hope my little plane will manage.
