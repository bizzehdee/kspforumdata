Planes evade, but blindly and with no concern for the energy they\u0027re losing or where the opponent they\u0027re evading is going. I\u0027ve seen planes with much more energy extending away from a slower plane suddenly go insane and bleed off all their speed because that slower plane got a single shot off and triggered evasion... and then the was-slower-but-not-anymore plane caught up and destroyed the target plane. I\u0027ve seen other planes panic themselves into the ground after a near head-on at low altitude, and I\u0027ve seen planes that should have simply continued the turn in the direction they were going \u0022evade\u0022 back into their pursuers guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhoever gets guns near enough to fire first nearly automatically wins the engagement, because the other one will be too busy panicking rather than actually trying to delay dying, let alone attempting to gain a reversal.

At the moment the challenge heavily favours aircraft that are built to turn fast and have the minimum altitude set to 150, because if you have a fighter that is designed to BnZ or fight at higher altitudes then you can be sure that your plane will be shot down while climbing by any well designed competitor following the former design philosophy. It would also mean that things like climb rate actually matter, whereas at the moment you can get away with things like high wing-loading because the trade-off of wing area for weight means you\u0027re penalised in an instant-action, ultra low altitude dogfight. It would also help the turboprop a little bit, as while my current design uses a turboprop some testing has shown that switching out for the radial engine, which is lighter, has faster acceleration and is more powerful, almost ensures a victory in under a minute against the standard model. Hell, my radial engine variant can engage and win against 3 of the turboprop variants simultaneously, simply due to the fact that it will be in the air and turned around before the other planes have even built up any speed or altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, however, I\u0027ve loving the weapons pack - the models are fantastic: stock-alike but still with a very specific character and very high quality, and they mostly seem balanced against one another (although the cannons could perhaps use a weigh increase: one cannon weighs less than two mgs and ensures a much faster kill).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T04:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree that 600m min should be the limit low, an aircraft built to get to 150m faster will also reach 600m faster, even more if the other airplane does not accelerate as much while climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am thinking about doing is spawning both very far away from each other, but I am still thinking of how would I do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, the next semifinal match was just ran!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first I need to see with erasmusguy if he would be fine with it being made public, it was not one of the most fun matches, you know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBut there we have our finalists!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaelstorm vs KF-Spike 5\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth airplanes were designed to be light and powerful, with 20mm cannons and a lot of turn rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe battle will happen soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho are you betting on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemembering that the winner\u0027s craft will be made public after the final.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the losers branch, I am thinking about quick best of three 1x1 battles, no upload, just to show who wins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T10:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 95% certain the VZ-38 will take the losers bracket pretty easily, it\u0027s a really good plane and I\u0027m sad it got knocked down in the first round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd whoo, finals, I hope my little plane will manage.
