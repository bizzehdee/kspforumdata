So, here\u0027s a long answer.\n\u003E \n\u003E In the many hours of research I\u0027ve done on this lil project I\u0027ve come up with a gazillion ideas. Since there\u0027s only two of us actually working on ship mods, the field is wide open so there\u0027s gobs of parts that could be created. And yes, all of the things you have mentioned have been investigated and considered. However, I know first hand that InfiniteDice isn\u0027t creating any new parts. His RL obligations are making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain his own mod (Boat Parts). So that means, at the moment, I\u0027m the only person actively working on anything maritime for KSP. I can sum it up this way...\n\u003E \n\u003E Soooo many parts... Soooo little time.\n\u003E \n\u003E So, here\u0027s how I prioritize what I\u0027m doing next:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. I have fun. If I cease to have fun, you cease to get parts. If you cease to get parts, you cease to have fun.\n\u003E \n\u003E Dice told me that one of the issues he had with Boat Parts was that he ceased to have fun because he was spending more time filling requests rather than bringing to life what was in his head. I took that advice seriously. So, I\u0027m trying to balance what I want vs. what everyone else wants. \n\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t get me wrong. I LOVE suggestions and hope they keep coming. But, that being said, the core of Maritime is complete and the Clipper is just that. And already, with the paddlewheelers (something I wanted \u002B a very early request to transport lots of Kerbals) the core pack is over 40 parts. So, I have to consider fun factor vs increasing the pack size as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E Next, I have to consider function vs need. Yes, I\u0027d love to add in some more superstructure parts and that\u0027s in the idea book. But right now, the boats work without them. Adding in superstructure parts or stealth hulls would only be eye candy. While I like cool looking ships, I\u0027m trying to focus on functional first. So, to answer in turn:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. V shaped hulls - Using stock physics, it\u0027s not gonna happen. Flotation works on the amount of surface area contacting and below the surface. V hulls end up akin to balancing a pencil on it\u0027s tip. But a fix is being worked on.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Superstructure, specifically military - I love blowing people and things up. Just not in KSP. I know others do. I spoke to the guys who are creating the new guns based on the Maritime Pack hull size and offered them the opportunity to have one of my models to base their designs on. I suggested that they focus on military while I focus on civilian maritime pursuits. They have not gotten back to me. I know they were considering working on boat hulls. I wish them luck in that little endeavor.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Stealth - While a lot of the new boat designs out there look really cool, like stealth, for the moment, it would just be an eye candy part since there\u0027s no radar to avoid. Sorry, not real high on my priority list.\n\u003E \n\u003E So, now that I\u0027ve basically tossed all of your suggestions into the proverbial garbage, let me hopefully cause you to raise an eyebrow with what has become my latest inspiration for the Maritime Pack.\n\nAh, ok. I understand what you\u0027re saying, I\u0027d rather you have fun and further develop the mod than have to incorporate every single idea that I have. I didn\u0027t intend my ideas to be a necessity for the mod, I\u0027m just the kind of person who likes to get ideas out there. Believe me, I would love to make these things myself, while I\u0027m not bad with the coding but terrible with large 3D models (and I also have plans to make weapons for BDArmory). But, with hints that there might be military hull in the future, I\u0027m happy with that and I\u0027m quite interested in what you have to bring next. cheers.\n\nP.S.

I ended up getting overwhelmed, but I retained a lot of the lessons I learned along the way. With community resources, and now vanilla Ore, the land is fertile, and two things in this thread got me thinking. That sail boat prototype and the airship boat delivery system. I\u0027m thinking Guns Of Icarus style steampunk airships.\n\nI\u0027m feeling an itch to get back into working on that mod. I originally had visions of throttle being tied to boiler flame, with the heat of the boiler dictating steam flow and therefor thrust, meaning that your speed response would be on a delay and running the boilers too hot would make them explode. After some thought I\u0027ve decided this is needlessly complex.\n\nYour approach, however, looks interesting.\n\nI was thinking if Infinite is too busy, I could step in and help a bit. I\u0027m not making promises, it\u0027s been two years since I even touched the code of this game, and I remember having a lot of difficulty in getting the Squad code to inject properly into the parts, but if I could come up with some functional hardware, it needs branding, and I was thinking having it be a parts pack for your mod would be a good way to do it.\n\nWith your permission, I\u0027d like to get to work on making some steampunk hardware.\n\nRelated note, I don\u0027t know what the fix for V hulls is you were mentioning, but a quick and dirty fix I can think of, which is what I had in mind for mine and how I stabilize my taller ships; keels. Just make a mesh variant of the compressed water holder that\u0027s flat and semi-cylindrical and with a far higher crash tolerance.\n\nSo yeah, I think I\u0027m gonna go reinstall blender and poke around my old folders to see if I can find my old data.\n\nEDIT: Damn. I knew I lost some data, I just didn\u0027t know the project files were among it. All of my work on the old steampunk mod was lost, I\u0027ll be starting completely from scratch.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u0027ve never been happier to have a poor organizational system. I found a few files I\u0027d moved to a different folder to work on. I was able to recover the mesh and textures for the MkI boiler and the mesh for the flux turbine. everything else is still gone, but at least I have something to start on.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\na month and a half of work.\n\n![SrILfNY.png](http://i.imgur.com/SrILfNY.png)\n\nand that\u0027s all that remains of it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T15:50:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tanya Sapien**"},{"CreatedByName":"WolfAngriff","CreatedById":150522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T17:21:09Z","Content":"Hi, thanx for the answer, that\u0027s what i was thinking about.

Dice told me it took him a month to figure out the best way to build his carrier so that it didn\u0027t fall apart. While my catamarans will take some re-thinking in the design stages (you\u0027ll need to build it deck first), they won\u0027t be that difficult. The one you see in that pic has just 2 struts across the bow sections, and I easily hit 100m/s \u002B with it, did some hard turns and it stayed together.\n\nAs far as coding for struts to be automatically added in...\n\nSquad could easily make multiple nodes connect. But they choose not to. One of the things that keeps people coming back to this game is the fact they try to overcome failures in design While this means some designs will inherently fail, once you get it right, it\u0027s pretty solid. Catamarans will fall into that category. At present, I have no plans to code in any automatic strutting. There are welding mods and enhanced struts and mods that improve connection nodes already. To me, those steals half the fun of the game of figuring out how to make it work within the confines of the game rules. I classify them in the same category as MechJeb, they have all the fun.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi Fengist! Here\u0027s my 2 Minute Mod video about your mod.

First, I have complaints that my textures suck and people want BIGGER stuff. So, I up the resolutions, redo old textures, learn about converting to dds to save load times, make an effort to improve the new parts textures and plan for even more memory gobbling meshes and textures and bumpmaps on even larger ships.... and then... the opposite complaint. Now my textures are too large and eating too much memory. Forgive me if I sound brusk, but I\u0027ve been expecting this but not with nearly this much lack of tact. Yes, there is definitely room for improvement and eventually I will get around to it but this has me realizing that when I do there will probably be a complaint about that. I hope when I do get that complaint that the individual who does so chooses their words a little more carefully than you.\n\nHere\u0027s something to keep in mind. The date on this thread is June 10th. That means, prior to June 1st I had created exactly one part as a result of a tutorial I read. You sir, are comparing the results my 3 months of part time modding experience with nothing more than a basic tutorial on Wings 3D and Google for an education to someone who creates mods professionally, has hours to spend on it every day and is paid well for the effort.\n\nFor those of you who follow this thread and have now had to see my venomous side, I apologize for this abrupt rant and I apologize for being overly defensive (sensitive) of what I\u0027ve created. I considered multiple times not even responding, but the wording of this post, comparing me to PorkJet, just felt like a slap in the face.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, rudders mounted directly behind the engines...

I had a suspicion you had the rudder behind the engine. It\u0027s the same with stock aircraft engines. If you mount engines behind one another or you try to mount them in a series, the ones in front get blocked. My solution, and yes, I discovered this by doing exactly what you did and scratching my head, is to mount a rudder in the middle. If I feel the need for more than one rudder, those you can mount in series but I usually just mount them close together near the center of the hull. You might even try mounting one on the bow.

I had a suspicion you had the rudder behind the engine. It\u0027s the same with stock aircraft engines. If you mount engines behind one another or you try to mount them in a series, the ones in front get blocked. My solution, and yes, I discovered this by doing exactly what you did and scratching my head, is to mount a rudder in the middle.

Just had the ship in the water, jettisoned the transport, and was in the trimming stage when Steam crashed! I know for a fact it was a Steam crash because as soon as I was thrown out of KSP I did receive the message that Steam had to restart because of a new update. It has a way of choosing the worst time to update. Now I have to launch the vessel all over again ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I made the mistake of having them toggle with the brakes (the method I use to get ships to the water) on a rover, and as soon as the first attempt made it to the end of the KSC runway and began the downward slope, I hit the brakes at the time it was leveling out - and blew out everything under the bow of the ship. \\*sigh\\* Another lesson learned... ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nI placed mine under the bow and staggered in a pattern of two rows, the first row only has two air brakes, the second row has three but the center one is offset to the rear of the two in the second row. Once the ship has slowed to 70m/s, it is reasonably safe to deploy all of them at once... and there\u0027s sufficient enough drag created that you can rapidly see the speed drop - and if you reverse your engines while you do it, you may not be able to stop on a dime, but you can slow it a lot quicker."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T10:38:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I tried that out a few times.
