Since I\u0027m also a 3D Modeler and Animator, I decided I just had to make some new assets for the hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I\u0027ve run into a snag. I work primarily with LightWave 9.6 and 10.0, with Blender 2.5 being used to generate my UV islands. Having read the wiki, I\u0027ve created my objects as folows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Generated base part mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Generated collision object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Named part \u0027collider_node\u0027 in LightWave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Assigned new surfaces to both the base mesh, and the collider node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Set collider node surface (aka \u0027material\u0027) to 50% transparancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Ensure both meshes exist in the same layer in LightWave modeler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Export the object either as an .obj or as a .dae file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Created new folder for the new object, with \u0027mesh\u0027 and \u0027textures\u0027 sub-directories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Placed the .dar or .obj file into the folder (not in the \u0027mesh\u0027 sub-directory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Modified an existing part.cfg file, ensuring to update all appropriate information, and pointing to the new .obj or .dae file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Moved the file into \u0027Parts\u0027 subdirectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. Started KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and that\u0027s where I get stuck at the \u0027Loading...\u0027 screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy research indicates that usually means there is no material associated with the object. I\u0027ve ensure that there is by loading the objects in Blender 2.5x. They import just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve attempted to use the \u0027PartLab\u0027 found in the KSP_SDK_v01, but I have yet to see any of my meshes load up there properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, folks, I\u0027m stumped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m attaching a quick SRB I knocked together in a couple of minutes in both .obj and .dae format. Maybe somebody with more experience with both Unity and KSP will have more luck finding the step I\u0027m missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esd","CreatedById":705,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-24T18:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELightwave may suffer the same flaws as Cinema4D does - duff export for OBJ and DAE.

As well it looks like the collision mesh got merged with your \u0027normal\u0027 mesh.

I\u0027ve seen been following this process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Model object in LW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Model collision object in LW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Export Model as .OBJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Export collision as .OBJ and different name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Import OBJ into Blender 2.5x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Press \u0027n\u0027 and rename item as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Import .OBJ collision object file into Blender 2.5x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.

With object still selected, rename object \u0027node_collider\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.Change surface material on node_collider to .5 Alpha under transparency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.

In fact, since LightWave works with real-world units, modeling to scale is a simple matter.
