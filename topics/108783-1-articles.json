For instance I have a command pod that has a decoupler on the bottom node and also has included. Hitting the \u0027stage\u0027 action for that part will activate the decoupler -AND- the parachutes; which is often not what the user would want (e.g. you want to decouple prior to re-entry, and activate parachutes quite a bit later after most of re-entry is complete). Is there any stock method to split the staging actions of a single part? Is it possible to accomplish this through a custom plugin-module code (e.g. if I wrote a custom decoupler and/or parachute module); is it at all possible to have a single part with multiple staging icons/actions?\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to specify certain modules to -not- activate through staging? For example, is there a stock method to disable the staging action from the decoupler or parachutes? Having just a single action trigger through staging could be an acceptable work-around."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:44:36Z","Content":"Unfortunately not. The staging is per part, not per module."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:16:14Z","Content":"Okay, thanks for the response; Perhaps I will have to rethink my parts/layout a bit. Was trying to cut down on the excess part count on finished vessels by including always-needed functionality into the parts that always needed them, but apparently KSP is not designed to properly handle these / is setup specifically to encourage part spam. \n\n Not the first time I have encountered difficulties while trying to use multiple unrelated modules on a single part; it appears that the KSP devs did not intend to ever combine functionality of many of these modules... which is unfortunate. Just trying to combine an emissive animation with a parachute module on a command module has caused no end of headaches (drag cube issues...).\n\nThanks again for the response; apparently I have some redesigning to do in order to conform to the KSP way of things."}]}
