For surface to surface operations with standard engines, 15,000 feet is its standard operating ceiling. With the toridal \u0022airspike\u0022 engines, the operation ceiling is roughly 41,000 feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture upgrades for the Starwing include payload launching system and fuel drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Many rather spectacular crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**Seriously, this thing flies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
