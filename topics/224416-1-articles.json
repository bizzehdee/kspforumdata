I figured I would post this here as the topic of a dedicated Interstellar spacecraft has been one of much discussion for some time now and I wanted some feedback on a personal mission design of mine, specifically how realistic it is. This is based heavily on the \u0022Interstellar Probe\u0022 concept proposed to NASA a couple years back.

Launch vehicles are limited due to the sheer amount of power needed to make this flight practical, SLS block 2 or SpaceX Starship are viable options, both must carry an additional Centaur upper stage and Star 48 Booster or similar system. Using this method Odyssey will be able to reach Jupiter in around 7 months for an additional gravity. The crafts final speed will be around 95 kilometers per second or 6-7 AU a year. With a speed Odyssey will be able to reach Interstellar space in 16 years (Voyager 1 arrived after 35 years).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EIn addition to this Odyssey will be able to flyby a single major KBO and possibly more if a suitable target is found. Currently the prime target for a flyby is the possible Dwarf Planet \u0022Quaoar\u0022 and it\u0027s only known moon \u0022Weywot\u0022. This has been chosen due to it\u0027s position along the trajectory of the probe along with the objects unusual nature. Quaoar has a slightly elongated shape and two sets of rings that lie outside the Roche limit where such things are expected. A flyby of the Pluto/Charon system is also possible though a flyby of another object will allow for comparative science between the two objects.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOdyssey 2:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EOdyssey 2 will launch around 2033 and travel in the opposite direction to it\u0027s sister probe, it will fly through the tail of the heliosphere. The launch profile is identical to Odyssey with a Super Heavy-lift Launcher and a Jupiter Gravity assist propelling the craft to just under 100 Kilometers a second. Unlike the first probe Odyssey 2 is unexpected to enter Interstellar space for quite some time as it has more distance to cover.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EOdyssey 2 has a very special target in mind for it\u0027s minor planet flyby; the Likely Dwarf Planet Sedna. Sedna is an extremely distant object with an extremely eccentric orbit that takes over 11,500 years to complete. Due to the nature of it\u0027s orbit Sedna spends the majority of it\u0027s life in Interstellar Space and far beyond the reach of any modern spacecraft. It\u0027s also likely to be the first observed object of the hypothesized \u0027Oort Cloud\u0027. All of this makes Sedna an incredibly appealing target for study and the perfect fit for the mission as it lies in the path of Odyssey 2. With it\u0027s speed Odyssey will be able to reach Sedna in as little as 12 years and provide much needed data on the nature of Interstellar Objects and the Oort Cloud.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOdyssey 3:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EOdyssey 3 would launch around the same time as Odyssey 2 and would travel to the \u0022side\u0022 of the heliosphere.
