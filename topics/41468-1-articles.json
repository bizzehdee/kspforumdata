Achieving that gives you the know-how tools to really open up your world. (Without using maneuver nodes, one simply waits until Mun-rise in Kerbin orbit, then accelerate in the direction of your motion. Follow the progress on the map until you reach Munar orbit. It should be possible to achieve a FRT without corrections, but don\u0027t let that stop you from making changes as you go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bradburym13","CreatedById":77633,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T10:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplanning my next mission now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe the mun\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
