If you want an intermediate step, go for Ike - it\u0027s pretty much like landing on Mun, except you have to go interplanetary to get there. Give your craft enough delta-V and you can hit both in one setting. If you\u0027re going for science, I\u0027d suggest a single lander with a lab-equipped mothership (for experiment storage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is easier to reach than Duna. Landing there\u0027s easy too. Getting back up is, since it was created it back in 0.17, still probably the game\u0027s ultimate challenge. Gilly\u0027s a tough nut to intercept; think of it as Minmus on crack. It\u0027s SOI is ridiculously small and its inclination is killer. If you can get there, though, it\u0027s one of the easiest landings in the game - you don\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Eland \u003C/em\u003Eon it as much as you \u003Cem\u003Edock \u003C/em\u003Ewith it.
