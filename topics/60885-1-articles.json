Everyone is memorizing the delta-v to get from Kerbin-to-Mun, the phase angles to transfer from Kerbin to Duna, LKO starts at 70km, etc which is all a bunch of useless information in the real world. That\u0027s one of the things I liked when I played Orbiter, I ended up memorizing the height/velocity of the ISS and real facts about the real space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
