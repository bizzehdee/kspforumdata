Mechanical parts and/or robotics are something that crop up fairly often in this forum, so unless you have specific ideas on the implementation of them, just rest assured that the devs are very much aware that there is a demand for mechanical parts of some kind. However, as this is one of the items on the What Not to Suggest List, I\u0027m going to have to close this one for now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the interim, you may want to have a look around for the Damned Robotics mod (check the Add-On Releases forum), which as far as I know has a great many types of moving structures available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
