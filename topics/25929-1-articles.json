I\u0027m trying some more advanced stuff now, and just recently have been doing the Mun orbit scenario. I was able to successfully undock the lander, power up the engine and land on the Mun - then regain orbit and try an approach for docking, however I can\u0027t seem to switch back to the command module. No matter what I try. The key map says that [ and ] should switch between ships, but it doesn\u0027t work for me. What am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T21:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to be pretty close before the bracket keys work, usually within a kilometer or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blackstar","CreatedById":61238,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T21:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, make sure your command module either has a command pod with a Kerbal in it, or a probe core with power.
