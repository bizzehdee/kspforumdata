We assembled the radio gear from off the shelf hardware. The overall system involves significant amounts of custom hardware and software but the radio gear itself is off the shelf and it works over the range I mentioned above. Indeed the same radio system has been used in an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.canuck-boffin.net/sonde/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eearlier project by my friend\u003C/a\u003E who I worked with, to transmit sensor telemetry over even greater distances (over 100 km). The telemetry allowed us to accurately point the high gain yagi antenna and maintain an RF link over those distances.\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I am beginning to sound like a broken record, my point from yesterday still stands: There are people on this forum who have the talent to make an idea like this actually come together. But the goals have to be realistic and significant logistical problems would have to be worked out before any of them would be willing to invest thousands of their dollars and thousands of hours of their free time in making it happen. Nothing is going to happen if we aim too high or have unrealistic ideas about the kinds of resources that we could draw on. But I don\u0027t doubt that a group of us could make this happen if we got organized. Sadly though, I believe that the non technical problems of financing, marketing, project management, etc are what would kill an endeavor such as this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need to get this more formal and organized, but thay will take a bit of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T16:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aethon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aethon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll say again.

It did cost quite a bit and was otherwise one of the most sophisticated ones but it\u0027s possible.

So by possible I mean possible in general for a real research team, not for us though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all I\u0027d say this thread is very educational for all who want to face real engineering challenges. We\u0027ve gone from an \u0022easy Phobos landing\u0022 to a \u0022floating bucket in LEO that could maybe carry a camera or something.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally it doesn\u0027t matter what the satellite does as long as it does something funky or something useful. One problem is that we don\u0027t have any tech to demonstrate. If someone here has special skills to build something they think could be useful in future cubesat missions, speak up now. Otherwise we have nothing on that front so either find something easy to measure or test that hasn\u0027t been measured or tested before or think of something cool. In case 1 we might hitch a free ride due to scientifical utility, in case 2 we might raise enough money to pay for a launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that aside the real and massive and biggest challenge here is doing it as an internet community with people all over the world. And just saying we\u0027ll assemble in in K^2\u0027s garage isn\u0027t the answer here. Anyone who\u0027s willing to relocate to where ever he lives, speak up now. Realize that this isn\u0027t a model airplane and you don\u0027t just put it together over a weekend. You really do have to move physically to the assembly location and it does take more than one person to do it in any reasonable time. I don\u0027t know what K^2\u0027s real skills are but I\u0027m assuming he or she is a physicist or something of that sort so if he\u0027s really good and motivated he could maybe assemble it all by himself given enough time. But I wouldn\u0027t build a community project based on one person doing all the work while the rest of us shout instructions over the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the more administrative people at SQUAD are already looking at this thread with a finger on the trigger to stop the whole process. It\u0027s one thing to do something small as a fan work but if this project is trying to be serious, we\u0027re talking about raising possibly a hundred thousand dollars or even more by using their IP as a promoting tool. They might want to say something about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t mean to be negative here but I am assuming that people who say they\u0027re serious about this really are serious about this and even some sort of answers to these things should be first on the list. Once you have the team together you can think about what sort of skillset they have and what they could realistically accomplish. You can\u0027t build the mission if you don\u0027t have the engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
