My friend and I were messing around on KSP, first I told him about the DEMV Mk II Rover and he took it for a spin and saw how fast it was. Then he had an epiphany, \u0022What if we strapped some wings and rockets on the side of this thing?\u0022. I said go for it, and we started the construction/design phase. It was a very poor design, but it was just for kicks. We used the rover\u0027s engine for lift and then upon commencing the rocket ignition the rockets tore all but the inner wings off with three control surfaces and two wing parts remaining. My friend and I wanted to see this through to it\u0027s grave, alerting him to pull up right before we fell of the end of the runway. To our astonishment, the craft maintained controlled flight for roughly fifteen seconds and then fell into the sea. We then decided to pursue a design where it would sustain further flight length, which it did but after an additional 30 seconds of flight, it followed its predecessor. Then after tinkering with the design, we developed a magical piece of engineering, the Stubby Mk II. When we initiated take off, all went well. But then to our bewilderment, it not only sustained flight but maintained/increased in velocity without any propulsion mechanisms. After traveling over the mountains west of KSC, we checked to see if this anomalous thrust was coming from the cruise control of the DEMV, so I turned it off and it marched on forward. We managed to get all the way from KSC to the western coast near the strait. This design hasn\u0027t any thrust capabilities off the ground, and amazed us so profoundly that we flew for a complete hour in real time. Here are some pics for your amusement, and I will post a video within a week or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/W5zan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/W5zan\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MassiveEffectz","CreatedById":8742,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T15:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations.

Quite a lot more than their own weight. This is in order to turn spacecraft and planes which weigh a lot. The reason it is modeled this way is there\u0027s no true lift/drag stuff implemented yet in KSP. So, if you strap enough canards/control surfaces you can make a plane fly. Try putting a single fuel tank with 24 advanced canards around it, launch it with a small rocket up, say, 500m, then hit q or e to spin it. You can go 1500 m/s or so with no fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardian19","CreatedById":34864,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T20:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely checking that out!!!
