Breaking physics just to make things \u0022harder\u0022 is not something I consider appropriate. Returns from Kerbin SoI are generally easy, yes, and I imagine returns from Duna and Eve are too, but I have found that returning from a sun dive (and by extension from past experience at a time I wasn\u0027t using DRE, Jool) can be quite challenging. Hitting Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at around 3km/s seems to be \u003Cem\u003Egenerally\u003C/em\u003E safe with appropriate shielding (I\u0027ve gotten plenty of bangs coming back from Mun), but 4\u002Bkm/s can become quite a challenge, and 10km/s... not going to happen (Kerbin is too small). And sub-orbital flights can be quite hair-raising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, upping the difficulty for reentry would make space planes on stock-sized Kerbin much more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... I agree that putting in an option (per-save is probably best) for \u0022hard mode\u0022 is best, but the default should definitely stick with realistic heating. Remember: that was the whole point of DRE 2: realistic heating while making the player think about heat (DRE 1 was pretty much \u0022forget entering the atmosphere\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think the problem is not so much the heating factor, but rather the crazy heat tolerances of the parts (even after DRE halves them (last I checked)). An Mk1 lander can should not be able to survive 1100\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C (Mun FRO, 30km periapsis), or at least the kerbal inside should not.
