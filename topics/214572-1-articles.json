It would recreate a Kerbalized version of a lot of knowned exoplanet (such as HD 189733B, J1407B, or Gliese 436B) and their stars, and maybe even a blackhole or a pulsar (probably not). So of course I went to Goo- I asked ChatGPT. From what I found on Google and what Lil AI said, it\u0027s pretty hard, I would need to learn C#, install and learn basics of Unity Engine, and make my mod, right ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now I have some questions !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any good tutorials of how I can make this ? If not, any good way to learn ?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EShould I make it for KSP 1 or 2 ?\u003C/s\u003E Answered. I\u0027ll make it on KSP 1 for now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdeas of which simple planets I could start with ?

The whole modding ecosystem is way more mature and stable and there are tons more resources about it. KSP 2 modding just started over a week ago and things change almost every day, new tools get made, processes change, and there\u0027s a lot we still don\u0027t know how to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, chances are, if you managed to make a planet pack for KSP 2 which nobody has gotten even close to at this point, it\u0027s very likely it would break very soon with game updates, while KSP 1 is basically finished and only has small bugfix updates, if any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-06T19:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2023 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by munix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GlaceAuPlutonium","CreatedById":223416,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T21:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk thanks !
